B00260HH3K|3.0|I don't see what everybody is so upset about. Yeah, the movie is corny at times, unrealistic, and sometimes over acted, but so was the cartoon. They did change the story and gave it the movie treatment. Just think about it if they made the live action movie exactly like the cartoon it would have been extreemly cheesy. But i do feel overall there was the same spirit of the original, it had the same mix of goofball,action,and drama. Of course it could have been better and a little more true to the show (the biggest example being where in the heck is Krillian' thats hard to forgive).But still i liked it and i am a huge fan and i've seen every episode of all three of the cartoon series. So if i can  get over it with no problem then i don't see what the cry fest is about.
B002APNQF4|5.0|What a fantastic album. A beautiful package,  superb bonus tracks and a gorgeous DVD. A great job done on the remix! An absolute \\"must have\\" for every Whitesnake fan!!
0374530718|2.0|\\"Sophie's World\\" is, as the author states, a novel that presents \\"a wide bird's-eye view of the history of philosophy.\\" Its fantasy plot takes us into a \\"reality\\" (which turns out to be an illusion), where \\"all that we see or seem, is but a dream within a dream\\" (Edgar Allan Poe) and \\"We are such stuff as dreams are made on, and our little life, is rounded with a sleep\\" (William Shakespeare). Indeed, according to the Big Bang Theory, we are all star dust. \\"Sophie's World\\" is a journey, so to speak, \\"down the rabbit hole\\" into an Alice-in-Wonderland, Through-the-Looking-Glass existence, in which fictional characters assume the appearance of \\"reality.\\" The novel is simply an excuse for the author to present a summary of the history of philosophical ideas. At the risk of sounding like a parrot and saying, \\"Me, too!\\" I agree with the reviewer (see \\"A Doughnut!\\", January 13, 1999) who says, \\"The author is not expected to deal with every philosopher. However, to omit Schopenhauer altogether and reduce the great Nietzsche to one sentence tears the heart out of the book.\\" Although their philosophies are quite different, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche are my two favorite philosophers, and making such a short shrift of them is disappointing. The writer of \\"A Doughnut!\\", however, is incorrect at one point: the author gives Nietzsche more than one sentence; he gives Nietzsche a whole paragraph. The danger of this book is that beginning philosophy students, although they may receive some profit from reading \\"Sophie's World\\", will assume that they now know everything about the subject and pursue it no further. If Mr. Gaarder's novel encourages readers to investigate philosophy more seriously, he will have made a positive contribution; if, however, readers are turned off by reading this work, the effect would be deplorable. \\"Sophie's World\\" would serve as a passable companion to a course in Philosophy 101, but would be of less help in Philosophy 102, 103, and beyond. If you must readit, bear in mind that there are better treatments of philosophy and philosophers \\"out there\\" (in what we assume, correctly or incorrectly) to be the actual world.
B002APNQEU|5.0|Just like the Slide it in Deluxe Edition, this is really a treat for all the fans!! It's an unbelievable big difference between this remix and the original album from 1989. It's like you hear the album for the very first time but you know the songs.... It's simply great!

0618918248|1.0|Dawkins reveals himself to be an angry man with an axe to grind, and adds nothing new to the debate between science and faith.  He admits that science does not have the facts to prove how life originated on this earth (although he says he fully expects they will soon be discovered) but then goes on to claim that parents who believe in religion without any facts should have their children taken away from them.  I had hoped for a better defense of the scientific world view, but instead Dawkins further convinces me that his views are as much based on faith and personal bias as those he demeans.  I read the whole book eagerly looking for some scientific basis for his arguments rather than just personal bitterness, but came away very disappointed.
B000WGWQG8|1.0|Just got the box in the mail the other day.  Besides being incredibly hard to get out of the plastic with out breaking the discs, put the disc in the drive and player says - \\"no disc\\".  I bought the kind for US and Canada Region 1.  Is it a bad disc?.  I got it to work later on the computer and on another DVD player.  I would give the movie a better rating but, they need to smarter at presentation.  This begins with making disc holders that won't break the movie and readable by any DVD player common in the market.   If their goal wasn't so MONEY orientated, maybe they could get better ratings.  I've been buying less and less movies because most are just regenerations of old themes, however this one is worth revisiting. The other reason beng the lack of consumer needs, all the money has been invested in high tech images and little to no thought in packaging and presentation. I don't have time to watch the whole thing at once and really hate watching over and over again the begining credits that you can not fast forward through. They lack the insight into time that is valuable to a consumer. Skip the overdrawN intro's and comercials, I paid money to see a movie NOT ADS!
B0000DJE9R|1.0|The CD arrived timely and in seemingly great condition. The last track on the CD, the live version of \\"Ben\\", skips crackles and pops horribly. It was cheaper to buy a replacement at WalMart than to send the defective one back. Makes one wonder if this might have been a pirated CD. My wife and I were very disappointed.
B001EO2UKO|5.0|There are no immediate standout pop tunes like \\"White Flag\\" or \\"Here With Me\\". - no anthemic choruses. Instead the verses are strong and are punctuated by the chorus. The CD chugs along and weaves its spell using more traditional instruments such as bass, guitars, strings and brass. Less synth driven beats - subtle light percussion moves the music forward. The tempo stays mellow throughout. I really enjoy this CD and listen to it regularly. The single \\"Don't Believe in Love\\" is good...I like when she sings \\"says leave right now or quicker\\"...she's restrained yet so intense. All the songs are good. The loss of her father runs throughout the CD... \\"Grafton Street\\", \\"The Day Before the Day.\\", \\"Let's Do the Things We Normally Do.\\" \\"Quiet Times\\" and \\"Look No Further\\" are sweet songs about those everyday routine things that people share in their relationships that make them so special. All of her CDs sound personal and melancholy. Safe Trip Home's quiet sadness is what makes it so poignant. The melodies are strong...they get in your head and stay there...but you have to listen to it a few times to catch on to its subtleties. It's not commercial. it's a mature piece.  The CD ends on a downer with with the excellent trip-hop sounding \\"Northern Skies\\"...\\"I have returned to sombre greys\\"...she's never been very far from them.
B001V7YWTQ|5.0|Clapton and Winwood are still providing great music after all these years. This CD has not left my player in over two weeks. Clapton is still God when it comes to guitar playing.  Winwood's voice is as good and strong as ever. I loved this CD so much I had to buy the DVD. The DVD is outstanding too. The concert is incredible and the interviews with the artists are very insightful. The music of my generation never gets old! Like wine, it improves with age!
B001PPF126|5.0|This is really a scoop re-release of Radiohead's classic \\"The Bends\\". Besides the classic album, with great songs as \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\", \\"High and Dry\\", \\"Nice Dream\\", \\"Black Star\\" . . (  in fact you could name them all ) , you get another CD with most tracks actually equally strong.<br /><br />The second CD contains the single-tracks that came with the singles \\"My Iron Lung\\", \\"High and Dry\\", \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\" and \\"Street Spirit\\" as well as four songs from a BBC radio session.<br /><br />There are several pearls among these single-tracks. The melodic \\"How Can You Be Sure\\" always was one of my favourites, and songs like \\"Banana Co.\\", \\"Bishop's Robes\\" and \\"Lewis\\" are as good as most of the actual album-tracks.<br /><br />Great acoustic versions of \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\", \\"Street Spirit\\" and \\"Bullet Proof\\", too. I can't help regretting that the band chose that radical musical change after \\"OK Computer\\".
0307588335|1.0|A silly book written by someone with a \\"colossal ego\\".     It's telling the author dedicates more pages to his former web-company that he co-founded than he devotes to the Federal Reserve or the Treasury. There is one reference to the PDCF -- the liquidity facility created after Bear Stearns' collapse. But no discussion of why (or how) Lehman didn't access it.     It's amusing to think his life's ambition was to work at Lehman Brothers -- as if it were some elite club. He (or his ghost writer) use such purple prose you almost laugh out loud -- describing for instance how Tom Humphreys passed around some \\"rich, vintage, port\\" after a dinner meeting. Or how Dick Fuld's office was filled with antiques -- like \\"Sotheby's\\". Or how every day he walks by the former offices at 745 7th Avenue and looks up to the 31st floor and wonders.     Much of the first 100 pages or so of the book read like he has a chip on his shoulder -- against the type of students and schools that Lehman traditionally recruited from. And he constantly reminds us that 'his resume would stack up against any of the other traders' on the desk. Unsurprisingly, he insists on telling us how much money he made for the firm and he revels in the reflected glory of his boss, Larry McCarthy, who clearly was the brains behind that desk's profits.     While railing against the hubris of Dick Fuld and the Lehman executive committee, he is too blind to reflect on his own arrogance. Here's a 40-something VP, hired outside of the regular recruiting channels, who asks his boss when he will get to meet Dick Fuld himself -- shortly after being hired. As it has been stated elsewhere, Lehman had literally hundreds of VPs in Fixed Income. It's like a Senator's aide asking when  he'll meet the President. His bio on the dust jacket of the book states that he was \\"vice president of distressed debt\\" at Lehman -- but neglects to mention how many other vps worked at the firm, or frankly on that same desk.    The author is completely unsympathetic -- even when he is called to the 24th floor in March 2008 in a round of layoffs. As much as I tried to feel sorry for him, he ruins the feeling by asserting that he wasn't surprised to be laid off -- after all he was part of the old guard at the firm warning senior management about the imminent disaster waiting in the wings from deals like Archstone and CMBs. Funny, I don't recall hearing him on CNBC or frankly hearing about him at all before this book came out.    The author goes through the same tired olds saws: that Lehman was done in by a cabal of hedge funds, that there was bad blood between Paulson and Fuld, etc. However, he uncovers no new evidence on this -- just the same unconfirmed anecdotes in the popular press.    Frankly, I'm hoping the books due out later this fall have more fact than a collection of second and third hand anecdotes. And perhaps a bit more modesty on the part of the author.
B0013N3DSE|1.0|After receiving the disc I was very disappointed that this print looks exactly like the DVD/VHS versions.  I really enjoy this story and have for many years.  But BD expanded capabilities should have been used.  Even though, as expected, the movie is 4:3 it doesn't appear that any effort was made to find the best print.  This WHOLE thing, even extras, is just a copy from DVD/VHS versions.  Some of the extras have no tie overall and in fact a few are just simply filler.  The History of Robin Hood files is filmed 4:3 format in 1998.  Clearly any film prior to 1953 should only be purchased on normal DVD.  Between 1959 and 1960 one will have to see how it was shot, print used or extra content before purchasing a BD version.  There's even a web page that won't open on BD live!<br /><br />I will continue to enjoy this film especially now I finally own it.  But I will be very very skeptical in the future buying an old favorite on BD disc.<br /><br />[...]

B00008EYA5|4.0|The Bottom Line:    S.W.A.T. doesn't aim very high but it avoids many of the cliches of the genre while providing some fun scenes (e.g. a plane landing on a bridge) and enough character depth to make the actors more than just cardboard cutouts; if you're looking for some action you could do far worse.    3/4

0312383436|3.0|It's interesting to me how an author can stereotype. The born-again Christians in this book are portrayed as rigid, holier-than-thou, and judgemental. Not to mention being fearful of gay people, which is just ridiculous. Christians, as far as I know, are not afraid of gay people. The Christians I know are loving, accepting human beings who honestly believe Jesus died to save them just like everyone else. They know they shouldn't point fingers because no one in this world is perfect, including them. It's portrayals like this that create anti-Christian attitudes in those who don't know any better and that's truly a shame.    Otherwise I enjoyed the story and the two unexpected twists. I would have given this story a higher rating had it not been for the one-dimensional portrayal of Christians.
B000002KDG|5.0|Rust Never Sleeps being Young's 14th studio and 1979 release starts out with a bang with the amazing track \\"My My, Hey Hey\\" which contains the classic line \\"It's better to burn out than it is to fade away\\". Other great tracks are Powderfinger and the second rendition of \\"My My, Hey Hey\\". The reviews where all very positive and Allmusic, Robert Christgau and Rolling Stones all gave the album 5 or very positive reviews and I concur with them. The booklet contains all the lyrics and we also get well written liner notes. 5/5.

B0000AI44P|4.0|Greendale being Young's 2003 release and is a concept album that can be comapared with The Wall by Pink Floyd and Autobahn by Kraftwerk and tells the story of a family in a fictitious town in California called Greendale. The album met good reviews and Allmusic gave it 3.5 stars and Rolling Stones gave it 4 so I also give 4 since a strong 3 feels a bit cheap. No lyrics are included but we get well-written liner notes for each track and some interesting sketches of the family. 4/5.
0312370849|3.0|My friend, an avid reader and in several book clubs, said that this was her all-time favorite book and I would love it.  All-time favorite????  Huh?  It was mediocre.  Not bad, but not great either.      Two things I got from this book.  One, my \\"friend\\" is simple.  And two, Amazon recommended buying Those Who Saved Us with Sarah's Key... now this was a good suggestion.
0452289963|5.0|Tolle's book offers insights and guidance. We use it as a base for our meditative times. It is extremely helpful in identifying and offering ways to dispose of old emotional baggage.
0385341008|4.0|Before reading this book, I was skeptical and hesitant.  It sat in my stack for months before finally getting to it.  I think the title had something to do with this.  That and the fact that letters written back and forth usually don't do it for me.  However, this book is sweet.  Immediately I was drawn to the characters and story.  It was an easy, light read that was charming and different.
0061854549|5.0|This is an absolutely fantastic read.  I always approach a book written by a college professor with a bit of concern.  So often I find the author must feel a need to write for their peers and not for the general public.  This is a wonderful exception.  This book is well written in easy to understand language.<br /><br />But if it were just well written, it would not be much of a story. Dan Ariely tells us that we are not only irrational but that our irrationality is totally predictable.  Then he goes on to show by example after example the truth of that statement.<br /><br />There are some wonderful marketing lessons in this book.  Any one involved in marketing needs to read this book.  So much of what Dan has discovered is counterintuitive.<br /><br />The first lesson is that price is relative.  He gives the example about a bread maker priced at $200 that was not selling. When a new more expensive model was introduced at twice the price, the original model started flying off the shelf.  The $200 model, relative to the $400 model was a real bargain.  And that is how our mind works.  We do not evaluate things in a vacuum.  We compare them to some other known item.<br /><br />Another lesson he talks about is the cost of free.  He shows example after example of people who make bad choices based on something free.<br /><br />An extremely interesting but totally irrational concept is the value we attribute to something after we own it.  We overvalue things we own.  By a wide margin.  Again, Dan gives lots of research to back up his theory.<br /><br />There are countless other examples of irrational behavior that we engage in each and every day.  It is truly alarming the amount of dishonesty that goes on.  It is also unbelievable how people justify their dishonesty.<br /><br />If you are at all interested in why people do what they do, I highly recommend this book.  It is a fantastic read, full of interesting stories and clever experiments.  You will shake your head in disbelief but you know it is true.<br /><br />You will get a much better understand of yourself and others.  It will help you in dealing with others and if you take the messages to heart, you will understand yourself better.<br /><br />Highly recommended.much better understand of yourself and others.

1563894696|4.0|I don't have an expert opinion, but I think if you're just getting into graphic novels (particularly Batman), and liked Christopher Nolan's movie, The Dark Knight, you owe it to yourself to get this and The Killing Joke to find out where the great sanity vs. insanity, crime vs. heroism, Harvey Dent vs. Harvey Dent storylines came from. It's a murder mystery that you want to read again as soon as you finish reading it the first time.

B002A9OJ0Q|5.0|Laid hands on the album 2 days ago.Have been listening repeatedly since then. This album opens up with a powerful rich song\\"Bandstand\\" and carries you forward smoothly till you reach the title song which has the same opening lines of \\"Longest Night\\" sung by Magne Furuholmen in his solo album \\" A Dot of Black in the Blue of your Bliss\\". The songs are complimented by rich synth.that made A-ha famous more than 2 decades back.However, it is my personal opinion that Morten Harket's voice is more suited to ballads that are more serious and melancholic in nature.His lower keys and upper octave is extremely clear which is very rare and that too in a typical pop music arena.A-ha's focus should be more on creating songs that are clear and high on vocals with rich supporting music.The album under discussion is very rich in music, on a very positive note, lyrics by Pal Waaktaar are thought provoking and Morten as expected is at his usual best.It is a MUST buy if you are a die hard A-ha fan like me.If you would be hearing A-ha for first time, I suggest you try out with Letters from Egypt, Wild Seed by Morten Harket, Lifelines,Minor Earth/Major Sky,Analogue by A-ha and then graduate to this album.The true worth can be appreciated only then.Till then HAPPY LISTENING FOLKS.<br />Onkar Chattoraj,<br />Mumbai,India.
0151013047|2.0|Mohsin Hamid's The Reluctant Fundamentalist is a story within a story. One is the clever telling of the other.    At a café in Pakistan, a Pakistani man tells his story to an American man. The men are strangers. We learn about the Pakistani man through his narrative. The American remains a mystery man throughout. In paragraphs between parts of the Pakistani man's story are hints about the American man, the purpose of his encounter with the Pakistani man, and perhaps even the Pakistani man's purpose in telling his story.    In this short novel, the Pakistani man tells of coming to America to attend Princeton and then work for high wages at a New York company. He falls in love with an American who's in love with a dead person. But she's rich and gets him into all the right places. He's on his way to living the high life.    Then, surprise, he decides on 9/11 that he's disillusioned with America. And he decides that America is that big, bad, obnoxiously rich and power-hungry nation that waves its flag as if it can't get over itself and is stuck in some black-and-white movie. He smiles at the sight of the destruction of the Twin Towers.    I wouldn't have bothered reading more. But I had read so many reviews of The Reluctant Fundamentalist that were favorable and praised its suspense. I figured something must be about to happen that would justify all this, and it was such a short book I stuck with it.    The Pakistani man continues to describe his disillusionment with America and his doomed love affair. He goes on to explain why he is back in Pakistan and what he is doing there.     Where was the suspense? The mystery American?    The Pakistani man speaks of the necessity of knowing history but obviously knows little history himself. He complains more than once about the awful Americans invading Afghanistan for no reason and of Pakistan helping America but the Americans refusing to take their side when they go to war with India.     He, of course, doesn't mention the Taliban in Afghanistan and their promise of another 9/11. He also forgets (I don't know how since he lived there) that Pakistan and India have been going at it with each other for years and that this war with India was a frequent occurrence.    So the Pakistani man's story is told, and then comes the ambiguous end. My guess is one of two possibilities.    I can't recommend this book.
0143034901|5.0|The Shadow of the wind is a superb novel. Once you started it, you cannot put it down. It has all the right ingredients to make it suspenseful and at the same time charming.The description of the child's first love, for instance, is touching (for anyone who has been in love as a child, and if you have not, you are under-privileged). It is also very well written and translated, with many witty remarks. I want to read more novels by Zafon.
032147404X|3.0|I purchased all three volumes of this book and all three contain useful information.  My complaint is about the presentation.  Maybe I am old-fashioned but I buy books because I want factual information, or honest opinions, and because I expect that I will refer to this written material in the future.  The author of these books presents his photographic tips as if \\"you and I were out shooting\\" but his writing style is so irritating that I would never go out shooting with him.  He seems to think of himself as much a comedian as a photographer, the type that would play practical jokes on his amateur shooting companion, falling to the ground convulsed with laughter.  Some books contain passages that deserve to be highlighted for future quick reference.  These books contain passages that deserve to be blacked out to avoid reading them a second time.
0385495323|3.0|This book was a little bit disappointing. Simon Singh is usually more exciting, but in this book he is a little bit too UK-centered. For instance, he gives an extensive description and history of the decoding of the German ENIGMA code by the British, but only a few words on the American decoding of the Japanese Purple code. As a general introduction to coding and decoding, it could have been shorter, as a detailed introduction, then it should have covered more areas.

B00009ZYBY|5.0|I was completely satisfied with this transaction.  I guess the only thing I would like to have known is the condition of the disk.  When the seller said it was in 'good' condition it was because of the case and not the DVD itself.  This was a relief because I was under the impression it would be the actual disk.  Either way it shipped faster than expected, I received it earlier and the transaction was as smooth as the come.  I thank the seller for the excellent service and wish other sellers would emulate these good traits.  No complaints here, extraordinary service.

B002BVYBBK|4.0|The movie itself was good, better than the two sequels in my opinion. But the real reason I bought the film was because it was on blu ray, and it did not dissapoint. The cars looked amazing, as did the special effects. The special features were ok but nothing really great, the \\"mash up\\" feature was kind of neat to play with. For those who don't know mash up is mixing clips and sound from the movie in a order you like. You are basically making your own commercial. All in all this was a good buy, I just ordered Fast and Furious, hopefully it's just as good.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|\\"From the Earth to the Moon\\" is a wonderful mini-series chronicling mankind's greatest achievement: putting men on the moon and bringing them safely home. If you've never thought about how truly amazing this feat was, you will after watching this. It not only makes heroes out of the courageous astronauts who put their lives at risk with every mission, but also the scientists and engineers who developed the technology to accomplish this unprecedented journey.     Below are my brief reviews of each episode (plus grades)    PART 1: CAN WE DO THIS? - In 1961, President Kennedy set the goal of putting a man on the moon before the end of the decade. It becomes NASA's job to figure out how to do it (and beat the Russians). The first episode introduces many of the characters, both scientists and pilots, who will fulfill this mission. It also effectively portrays the magnitude of the task. Grade: A    PART 2: APOLLO ONE - A tragic accident during a training exercise claims the life of three astronauts on the eve of the first Apollo flight. Congress now questions whether the hazards and expense are justified. The dramatic hearings where NASA officials had to convince the government that the space program was worth the risk make for a riveting episode. Grade: A-    PART 3: WE HAVE CLEARED THE TOWER - Seen primarily through the eyes of a documentary film crew, this segment shows the tense build up to Apollo 7, the first manned mission after the tragedy of Apollo 1. Though it effectively shows the concerns of those involved, the episode drags a bit getting to the big launch. Grade: B    PART 4: 1968 - A turbulent year marked by war, assassinations and riots, 1968 also saw Apollo's first successful orbiting of the moon. One of the less engaging episodes because too much time is spent brooding over the year's terrible events and not enough time is spent in space. Grade: B-    PART 5: SPIDER - One of my favorite episodes of the series, \\"Spider\\" outlines the evolution of the lunar lander, the crucial piece of the puzzle needed to get astronauts to the moon's surface. A fascinating and fitting tribute to the great minds that worked on the project. Grade: A    PART 6: MARE TRANQUILITATIS - It all led to this: Apollo 11 - July 20, 1969. The first landing on the moon is as thrilling and stirring as you would expect. We did it, and we did it before the deadline! When Buzz Aldrin takes communion to commemorate the event, I was moved to tears. Grade: A    PART 7: THAT'S ALL THERE IS - Believe it or not, there were other missions to the moon after Apollo 11. Although public interest had waned, the flights continued. The personalities of the men of Apollo 12 are the highlight of this fun episode. Grade: A-    PART 8: WE INTERRUPT THIS PROGRAM - A malfunction during the flight of Apollo 13 nearly led to tragedy. The episode takes the unique approach of viewing these events from the perspective of news people and technicians on the ground, but this story is told better in the film \\"Apollo 13.\\" Grade: B    PART 9: FOR MILES AND MILES - Alan Shepard was the first American in space, but an inner ear condition then grounded him for years. Through his fight to regain flight status and get to the moon, I was rooting for him all the way.  Grade: A    PART 10: GALILEO WAS RIGHT - The later Apollo missions required men who were scientists as much as pilots. Though the episode is heavy on geology lessons, I found the astronauts' specialized training strangely captivating. Grade: A-    PART 11: THE ORIGINAL WIVES CLUB - This episode focuses on the astronauts' wives and the toll the space program took on their lives and marriages. There is little action in space, but the human dynamics are poignant. Grade: B    PART 12: LE VOYAGE DANS LA LUNE - The final Apollo voyage is interspersed with a recreation of George Melies' 1902 classic film. It's a fitting conclusion to the story of man's remarkable quest to visit the moon. After 35 years, why haven't we been back there? Grade: A    Before you view this series, let me suggest that you watch the excellent film \\"The Right Stuff\\" first. It lays out the events of our first ventures into space and introduces the original Mercury astronauts, several of whom appear in FTETTM. A good follow-up to the mini-series is the documentary \\"For All Mankind,\\" which features reflections from the astronauts and footage from the actual missions.     I have to say, after seeing the monumental efforts, both intellectual and physical, that it took to reach the moon, I felt proud to be not just an American, but proud to be a human.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I saw Food, Inc. several days ago and many of the images still haunt me.  The essence of this movie is how food production in America has gone from being locally produced to being controlled by multi-national corporations.  The upside of this is that food is cheaper and more plentiful.  This movie examines the downside, which is horrifying.    All livestock (including fish) are now fed some sort of corn meal, regardless of whether this is what the would eat under ordinary circumstances.  For example, cows eat grass.  If they eat something else, it causes extra bacteria, including e-coli to grow in its stomach.  To treat this they are given antibiotics.  Milking cows are fed hormones to speed up milk production.  Chickens are fed so much corn to fat them up many cannot walk and they break their legs trying.  Or the legs get infected and they are given antibiotics.  One chicken farmer showed a \\"typical\\" day in the coop where she would go in and scoop up a dozen dead birds and through them on a gargabe heap. Lest it sound one sided, the large corporations were invited to participate in the movie and declined.    While parts of this movie are difficult to watch, ultimately it ends on a high note that we, as the consumer, have the power to change food production processes.  As one farmer pointed out, you wouldn't buy the cheapest car or the cheapest clothes, so why apply the same philosophy to the purchase and consumption of food.    Simply put, this movie will change your life.

0007105045|4.0|J. R. R. Tolkien's \\"Tree and Leaf\\" originally included two items - one an extended essay, \\"On Fairy Tales,\\" the other an intriguing short story, \\"Leaf by Niggle.\\"  The essay yields insight into Tolkien's theory of the \\"subcreation\\" which underlies the fictional world of fantasy (both his and that of others), and has a good bit of Christian theology incorporated into it as well.  The short story tells of an artist who wants most of all to be left alone in his creating, and a neighbor whose need impinges upon the artist's time, energy, and, ultimately, art itself.  Poignant, telling and essential for understanding Tolkien's experience of art-making and life.      Unique to the HarperCollins (British) \\"Tree by Leaf\\" edition noted here is the inclusion of the 148-line poem \\"Mythopoeia\\" which, according to Christopher Tolkien's preface, Tolkien composed in response to C. S. Lewis' having \\"described myth and fairy-story as 'lies'.\\"  Also included is \\"The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth,\\" an ending Tolkien supplied to an Old English tale, \\"The Battle of Maldon.\\"  Those drawn to these works may find Paul Kocher's chapter, \\"Seven Leaves,\\" from his \\"Master of Middle Earth,\\" of particular interest.  Furthermore, Tom Shippey's introduction to \\"Tales from the Perilous Realm\\" links themes from \\"On Fairy Tales\\" and \\"Leaf by Niggle\\" to such Tolkien translations as \\"Sir Orfeo,\\" not included in the collections cited above.
B000B7QCKO|5.0|Hello!<br /><br />I first heard and saw \\"Yanni at the Acropolis\\" on Chicago's WTTW Station that were selling its VHS, CD, and DVD copies of it to profit their user supported TV Station.<br />Needless to say, I fell in love with Yanni's insperational and spiritually uplifting music! While watching Yanni and his Orchestra's performance at the Acropolis, I also fell in love with the performances of the 2 beautiful and very talented Violinists who performed beyond anyones' expectations in their enthusiastic and brilliant Violin Concerto performances of their Lifetime!!  They were my reason for ordering both the CD and the DVD as I want to see those beautiful women again and again on screen performing their Virtuoso performances simultaneously with Yanni's brilliant Piano background! This Concert is indeed One of the Kind that nobody could ever reproduce in our Modern History! No offense meant to Bach or Mozart, or other great composers whose music I also enjoy, but times have changed!<br />Yours Truly, Steve Horvath, Chicago, IL

B0011KQSZ4|1.0|I consider myself someone with a pretty broad base of humor, everything from Holy Grail to Airplane, but this movie has no redeeming qualities. I scanned the large number of 4 and 5 star reviews and concluded that most of them were either professionally added by someone associated with the movie or there are some people with a very low benchmark for comedy out there. There is nothing clever here other than the premise which was using a funeral setting for the basis of a humorous movie. Having experienced a personal humorous tragedy at a funderal myself, I was hopeful this might have some side splitting scenes, but the movie went downhill after the opening credits. And come to think of it, even those were lame. 3-4 minutes of a hand drawn casket working itself around the streets of London ala Pac Man. If you're looking for a solid British comedy that includes both a funeral and wedding setting, \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\" is by far superior to this one. Hugh Grant displays more humor in one wedding toast than appears throughout this entire movie. Also, there's a 30-minute episode of the Mary Tyler Moore TV series titled \\"Chuckles Bites the Dust\\" which will bring you to tears. Primarily because it is based on some real uncomfortable death/funeral experiences which most people can relate to and find humor in. I guarantee you, if my wife had written this review, it would have been even worse!

B001LRJH0U|3.0|Lots of things not so good about APPALOOSA.  Much of the dialogue between Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen (playing two lawmen who specialise in taming rowdy towns) is rambling, nonsensical, almost incoherent.  The movie lacks pacing, and often goes into deep, yawn-inducing lulls.  There is absolutely no redeeming quality to Renee Zellweger's character at all; she's one of the most annoying presences in this film.  And Jeremy Irons is mysteriously empty playing the villain.  When I first saw APPALOOSA in the cinema, a handful of patrons got up and walked out, and that's never a good sign.<br /><br />Yet there were several things I heartily enjoyed.  I liked the chemistry between Harris and Mortensen; they were very believable as longtime partners, and often their interaction sauntered over to subtle comedy (in a good way, mind you).  The film had the rugged and authentic look and feel of the Old West, and the action, while brutal, was never pretentious.  And much of cinematography, in a word, was spectacular.<br /><br />So there's the rub.  APPALOOSA is at times very bad, and at other times very good.  And it's demonstrably disappointing it couldn't have been better.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning
0061537969|5.0|I just finished this book. It's one of those that you want to keep reading and yet you don't want it to end.  I'm an animal lover, so I bought the book because of the dog on the cover. It more than lived up to what I had heard about it.  Reading from Enzo's point of view was really neat.  When I find one my dogs staring at me, I can't wonder - what are you thinking?  I'm not a racing fan, but still got a great insight into the art of racing.  Read this book - you'll be glad you did.

Whether you're an artist, writer, director, or designer, Mr. Pressfield takes a no-nonsense approach and shares his own struggle in finding out exactly what he was meant to do.

What makes this even more fantastic is Mr. Pressfield is a great writer.  One can almost feel the fine tuning, the crafting of this book and the critical editing that honed each chapter into a great read and a focus you don't see in most memoirs or other books on being creative.
B0028K3192|5.0|Okay, everywhere I turned, I kept hearing just how good this album was.  Friends, Radio DJ's, co-workers, mailman, etc, all agreed this album was \\"THE album\\".  After catching the album on sale, I scooped a copy and couldn't be happier.  I bought the CD last night but listened to it today for the first time while driving from Philly to New York City.  Not only did I play only this CD the entire trip, I played it for someone at my NY destination and subsequently ended up playing the song over and over for hours because every new person who walked in wanted to hear the album in full.  At a scant 36 minutes long, it wasn't too hard a request to grant.  Yes, the album is only 36 minutes long but what a glorious 36 minutes they are.  I would take an album with 36 minutes of goodness from 9 standout tracks over a bloated uneven album an hour in length, with 12-16 tracks, (half of which are songs, [out of which only 4-5 are decent], and the other half is filler tracks and/or skits), 8 out of 7 days of the week.  36 uninterrupted minutes of music while driving to work, instead of \\"Okay, that hit just went off, let me seek around the CD for the other hit\\".<br /><br />Now don't get me wrong, of course some songs are better than others, but there is nothing on this album that I would consider filler.  As a matter of fact, after playing it for nearly twenty people, it seemed everyone had their own personal favorite.  Me personally, although I don't skip any tracks, I do have my favorites (Pretty Wings and Help Somebody are the two I find myself hitting the replay button the most on on).  To be perfectly honest, the album is most listenable because it features a live band.  Now that is kind of a big deal.  In this age of autotune, synthesizers, drum machines, and instantly made \\"McMusic\\", it is refreshing to hear the return of melody in music.  Maxwell's trademark voice and the music constantly play off one another.  He just feels so much more connected with the music and the whole thing seems more like REAL MUSIC than most of the garbage masquerading on store shelves as \\"music\\".  How ironic would it be if they sat this CD, with clean family-safe music, a live band, and a real established top vocalist, next to say.... something like... Jeremih's CD?  Maybe I'm showing my age, but that's almost like sacrilege.  I wish more dudes like D'Angelo and Maxwell would keep bringing back that true soul.<br /><br />Anyway, I grabbed this CD and loved it.  My wife has all Maxwell's earlier CD's, and she loves it.  My friends all love it. It's a can't miss. Trust me.  Now, does anyone know when D'Angelo is getting his behind back in the studio????  One down, one to go.  (Although Musiq Soulchild has filled the void superbly, if not consistently).seems more like REAL MUSIC than most of the garbage masquerading on store shelves as \\"music\\".

1416585710|2.0|You'd think he was paid by the word. Another bloated text, this time made worse by the juvenile verbiage.
0307266303|5.0|If this book were a runner, it stubs its toes in two areas:    1) The author unfortunately writes in a Frat Boy prose style; irritating, but the story is gripping enough that the reader can overlook it. Some may not mind, as style is a matter of taste. It is an athletic story, but the editors should have recognized that there's much more here than just a yarn that interests \\"jocks\\". Please don't let this stop you from reading the book. It is a ripping yarn.    2) The book reads like a string of articles out of \\"Men's Health\\" magazine because that's what the writer does for a living, and it is how the book originated. The author has some awards in this category, so at least he's a \\"good\\" article writer. It is a bit choppy. Don't let this dissuade you either.      The book flies fleetly in these areas:    1) Bravely dispels running myth and flies in the face of tradition. Every *other* running book/magazine out there lionizes the likes of Bill Bowerman (Nike inventor) -- while this book, in nearly overwhelming fashion, exposes the downside of shoes (not all shoes, just super-cushioning raised-heel shoes, such as most running shoes since 1980).     This may as well be flat-out heresy in the running world, in which shoe companies rule. The author is not doing this to be cheeky, but rather stumbled upon what the running community is starting to accept as fact (Ask yourself why Nike is now manufacturing a shoe called the \\"Free\\" which mimicks barefoot conditions.)    2) Answers paradoxical questions that anyone has run for awhile has already asked themeslves, such as: If I keep buying more expensive shoes, why am I getting injured *more*? Why is it some people are able to run (even barefoot?) without injury? Why are old men in Mexican villages hiking 30 miles a day in flimsy sandals, while my dad can't get along without orthotics? Why don't the people I know who wear orthotics ever \\"get better\\"?    3) Excellent collection of the odd--yet very true--feats in running lore.Much of this book ties in to the running community in Colorado, where I live, and where my wife has been an \\"almost-elite\\" (yes she's way faster than I am) runner and marathoner for over a decade. The races, runners, and coaches mentioned throughout the book will be well known to anyone well-versed in the sport. The ultra-runners are a fringe breed of folks to be sure, but there are many trail runners and trail-running groups in mountainous states like CO, WA, NV, UT, etc, and the same coaches that study ultra running are the ones coaching the Deena Kastors and Paula Radcliffes, and even Haile GebreSelassie. Look, running 100 miles at 10,000 feet (Leadville 100 race) is more than even most die-hard trail runners want to tackle. I already live at altitude and even *I* think going to Leadville sucks. The fact that Copper Canyon tribe members can go there and run 100 miles of the trails sight-unseen and WIN in flimsy sandals (beating other champion trail runners with their Nikes and energy gels, mind you) *IS* a story, and a downright compelling one. Some people are accusing the author of exaggerating, but as insane as some of the antics are in this book, there is not a lot of hyperbole. Read about other races like the Pike's Peak race, or Badwater (Runner's World Bart Yasso ran it in melting shoes, and wrote about it), and you'll soon realize how insane these activities are. Sure there are slow runners trotting around on ultra-marathon trails, but running a race like that to WIN is totally different story. Even Lance Armstrong (as is explained in the book w/humorous anecdote) can't succeed at marathon running, despite his uber-conditioned body.    On a personal note, I have had running-related injuries in my teens (ankles), 20's (runner's knee), and now in my 30's (achilles). I now realize that the bio-mechanics of heel-striking is what's doing me in, and what has kept me from running more than a few miles at a time without injury. This book is only the *latest* piece of literature I have read that is advocating for barefoot training -- the other EXCELLENT work that comes to the same conclusion, just through a more scientific approach -- is BRAIN TRAINING FOR RUNNERS by Fitzgerald. Those of you dissatisfied with this book's science backing should check out Fitzgerald's approach, as he comes to it with a kinesiology background, but also as a runner himself, he mirrors the conclusions drawn in Born to Run.

B000M53GQS|5.0|I just bought a copy of the Collectables 2 CD set of Gerry Rafferty's City to City and Night Owl albums. Both CDs sounded great but City to City was amazing... just like I remembered the DCC sounding (an out of print gold CD mastered by Steve Hoffman that now sells for several hundred dollars). Hmmm, I grabbed my DCC disc and played it. Yep, sounded the same.  Quite a compliment as I often use song one (The Ark) as one of my reference tracks when auditioning audio gear and speakers.    I loaded both CDs into Pro Tools to see what was going on. It was obvious EMI/Collectables sourced this CD from the much sought DCC release. The two files didn't stay *exactly* in sync but they were so close and the waveforms were so similar I assume they made an analog copy of the DCC. One thing I noticed was the Collectables CD had a reversed polarity.  If you don't know what any of this means don't spend another second thinking about it.  It's more trivial than audible.    Again, I assume EMI made an analog transfer of the DCC CD. That would explain the slight sync variations.    Switching between the two I could only detect *minor* differences and most of that was probably my imagination. For all practical purposes these two CDs sound identical so unless you're into minutia this is an inexpensive way to get the sound of the wonderful DCC CD without having to spend a couple hundred dollars.    Night Owl sounds great too.  The transfer is from a great source and it sounds like little to no mastering has been done (that's a GOOD thing).  It has great clarity/fidelity and dynamics and I don't hear any hint of compression.  As was the style of the era the mixes are slightly on the lean side.  I'd rather it be presented as is than have some mastering engineer artificially pump up the bass into a bloated mess.    These two CDs were a pleasant surprise.  Well done EMI/Collectables!

B0029NY9YO|4.0|I was not impressed by director Zack Snyder's efforts in \\"300.\\"  While it was a visual feast with impressive special effects, I felt that Snyder used those visuals as a crutch to support a rather dull plot.  The actual historical account of the battle at Thermopylae was, to me, a much better story than Snyder's film or Frank Miller's graphic novel.<br /><br />With that said, I wasn't expecting much from Snyder's \\"Watchmen.\\"  Based on the comic series by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons, I thought that it would be just another special effects-laden, plotless film.  I was quite surprised.<br /><br />What Snyder has done is take a very good story and give it an excellent treatment on film.  From recreating panels with near perfection from the comics and retaining the bulk of the story, Snyder has outdone himself.<br /><br />The plot of the film revolves around the murder of one superhero, the Comedian, and the attempts of another, Rorshach, to discover the culprit.  Rorshach tries to drag other former heroes out of retirement with mixed results at first.  Eventually he gets Nite Owl II to help him in his quest.  Another pair of heroes, Silk Spectre II and Dr. Manhattan, also become involved, but they primarily struggle with themselves.  Silk Spectre is trying to find a reason to stay with Dr. Manhattan despite his becoming increasingly detached from her.  Dr. Manhattan has become bored with humanity and also accused of giving cancer to some of his colleagues and spends much of the film in solitude on Mars.  Another former hero, the very public Ozymandias, would rather keep his distance on all matters.<br /><br />As expected, Snyder does provide excellent special effects.  In fact, they are some of the best I've seen in the last couple of years.  Even the perpetually blue-glowing Dr. Manhattan looks rather convincing on the screen.<br /><br />Jackie Earle Haley rises above the rest of the cast as Rorshach, the primary catalyst in the film.  He keeps the tale interesting throughout.  He's a tortured soul intent on finding the murderer of his former ally.  Patrick Wilson does an excellent job as the depressed Nite Owl II, who's all but thrown in the towel on being a superhero.  He's somewhat like Batman had Bruce Wayne quit hitting the gym and became a homebody.  Billy Crudup does a good job as Dr. Manhattan, giving a cold and nearly emotionless performance.  Jeffrey Dean Morgan plays the rather unlikeable Comedian, who appears primarily in flashbacks.  He's a disgusting jerk and quite possibly the ultimate anti-hero.  Carla Gugino portrays the original Silk Spectre, and shines as a drunken, washed-up former hero.<br /><br />The only real disappointments in the acting department were Matthew Goode and Malin Akerman.  Goode just wasn't believable as the super-intelligent old soul called Ozymandias.  His performance was very flat.  Still, he wasn't as bad as Malin Akerman, who delivers a wooden and emotionless performance as Silk Spectre II.  Akerman comes across as a likeable person in real life, but I felt that she wasn't the right person for this particular role.<br /><br />Despite the subpar efforts of Goode and Akerman, I felt that \\"Watchmen\\" was a very good film.  Loyal to the source material, full of tormented characters, and giving the viewer a very unique spin on the mythos of superheroes, I highly recommend \\"Watchmen.\\"  It's a definite purchase for fans of the comic serial and anyone who enjoys an excellent mystery or solid action.finding the murderer of his former ally.

B001SN78JO|4.0|Synopsis:  Carl Allen (Jim Carrey) is a bank employee who's become reclusive since being divorced.  His friendships suffer, he's stuck in a dead-end job after five years of service, and he spends his time watching movies and being miserable.  Carl suffers a nightmare after blowing off his best friend Peter's (Bradley Cooper) wedding shower, so he decides to go to a seminar where he's embarrassed into entering a covenant where he has to say \\"Yes\\" to every opportunity that presents itself to him.   While it gives him some trouble at first, he ultimately finds himself meeting the quirky yet adorable Allison (Zooey Deschanel) and starts finding happiness in his life.  Will Carl be able to maintain the satisfactory results into saying \\"Yes\\" to everything, or will he have to break the covenant and eventually be forced to say \\"No\\" and go back to living a miserable life?      Now, Jim Carrey seems to be doing many of these romantic comedies lately but you know what?  It's still darned funny and was absolutely worth checking out.  The film was grandiose a lot of the time once Carrey's character learned to say \\"yes\\" to everything but the whole story is well supported from start to finish and there never was a dull moment.  There were times where you were compelled to get slightly misty-eyed but all and all the film was chock full of laugh out loud moments.  This was a great comedy.    I recommend this to all and highly recommend it to romantic comedy fans.

Wether   on 5.1 sound system or on an ipod, this album plays well, and the guitar overlay that Tony delivers is awesome. It   extends his warmer sound that is clearer in the Live at Radio City Music Hall DVD.  What really made me furious was how Amazon messed up the delivery on this one. The first one I received as a gift   and it was SHATTERED on two sides and cracked on the others and back. The second copy  which was sent was sent to me in the same way, so the jewel case was cracked on one side. This is part of  a collectors edition, and it is getting a bit too consistent that one division of Amazon can't package a CD/-DVD pack; The returns section sent both packages, and I know it is part of the division since the same lot sent a second package on a different order, and I got the same results. This was an item paid for, so Amazon, if you don't listen, then I think you will lose   customers. Its clear that at least some of your staff do not care, some of your outsourced staff ??
0061537969|5.0|If you are a dog lover, this book is a must read.  I loved the fact that it was narrated by the dog and we could see his point of view on life, you really get a sense that this is how a dog would think.  There are definitely sad parts of the story, but in my opinion it had a great ending that I was satisfied and happy with.
B000001FS3|5.0|U2<br />The Joshua Tree; 1987<br />Island Records<br /><br />My Rating: 10/10<br /><br />With THE JOSHUA TREE, U2 ceased hinting at greatness and became great. While the atmospherics of THE UNFORGETTABLE FIRE almost engulfed the band in a holy chorus of angels, THE JOSHUA TREE lets the foursome spread out in the wide open American West. The reason this album is so great is that you follow the band on a journey through all of the ghost towns and forgotten hollers of the wasteland. Everyone knows the first three tracks, stacked like the Yankees' batting order, and other tunes like the gentle \\"Running To Stand Still\\", the road song \\"In God's Country\\", and the flowing \\"One Tree Hill\\" are gloriously mystical in the vein of UNFORGETTABLE's better moments, but without the claustrophobic production. There are a few less than great tracks here: \\"Bullet The Blue Sky\\" aims high and falls flat, and the closing medley \\"Exit\\" and \\"Mothers Of The Disappeared\\" don't quite do the job they should, but the rest of the album is so good that you won't be bothered by it one bit.<br /><br />TRACKS:<br /><br />1. Where the Streets Have No Name (5/5)<br />2. I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For (5/50<br />3. With or Without You (5/5)<br />4. Bullet the Blue Sky (3/5)<br />5. Running to Stand Still (5/5)<br />6. Red Hill Mining Town (5/5)<br />7. In God's Country (5/5)<br />8. Trip Through Your Wires (5/5)<br />9. One Tree Hill (5/5)<br />10. Exit (3/5)<br />11. Mothers of the Disappeared (3/5)
B000YAA68C|4.0|I was wary of watching this one -- I avoid what I consider \\"chick flicks\\" like the plague. But I knew part of it took place in Ireland, which I love, and -- well, Gerard Butler is a hunk. And a damn good actor -- as is everyone else in this cast. It is romantic, it is sentimental, but it's not \\"sappy.\\" Definitely worth enjoying.
B0013LPS8E|5.0|U2<br />War; 1983<br />Island Records<br /><br />My Rating: 9/10<br /><br />U2's first great album, WAR began the long u2 tradition of writing five or six mind-numbingly great songs and adding in a few stinkers to round it out. The reason this one gets such a high mark is that there are two absolutely classic cuts (\\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\", \\"New Year's Day\\") as well as at least four great album cuts (\\"Seconds,\\" \\"Like A Song...,\\" \\"Drowning Man,\\" \\"Two Hearts Beat As One\\"). Still, the album as a whole undoubtedly lives up to its name. From the stark production to the explosive drums to the barbed-wire guitar, U2 and Steve Lillywhite crafted a masterfully anthemic group of tracks, all rounded out by Bono's Celtic war-cry. However, WAR's longevity is owing far more to its underlying spiritual themes than any political trappings. When Bono declares \\"I won't wear it on my sleeve!\\" he ties together punk and Christian sensibilities, forging a way ahead for an entirely new breed of rock and roll. It's true - back then, no one else was writing music like this. No wonder U2 became the biggest rock band in the world.<br /><br />TRACKS:<br /><br />1. Sunday Bloody Sunday (5/5)<br />2. Seconds (5/5)<br />3. New Year's Day (5/5)<br />4. Like a Song... (5/5)<br />5. Drowning Man (5/5)<br />6. Refugee (2.5/5)<br />7. Two Hearts Beat As One (5/5)<br />8. Red Light (3.5/5)<br />9. Surrender (4/5)<br />10. \\"40' (3.5/5)
0316035904|5.0|Very good collection of David Sedaris works around a holiday theme.  Enjoyable commentary on modern holiday life but very sad that much of it is all too true.  If you like Sedaris this is a good holiday read to make you appreciate what you have.
B001TIQT98|5.0|I won't go into detail about the performances here: Bernstein's earlier Mahler cycle for Columbia Masterworks is legendary, and on the whole, may still be the finest available - all except Symphony No. 5 (and to a lesser extent No. 1 - the middle two movements in particular, plus I could never warm up to tenor René Kollo in this Das Lied von der Erde, even if Christa Ludwig's \\"Der Abschied\\" is truly worth hearing, here as much as elsewhere) here belong among my favourite interpretations/recordings ever. What's really shocking to me is how much the sound is improved compared to earlier CD issues (let alone the original LPs) - this happens only rarely, but in this case, the new remasterings (apparently from the original session tapes versus the standard production master) are really fuelling my appreciation for the interpretations and the music themselves (one simply hears so much more of everything, all of a sudden it all sounds so fresh and lively!). It's too bad Bernstein's Columbia Mahler isn't complete (the song cycles are missing, this is strictly Symphonies plus Das Lied von der Erde), but I'm happy to have bought this latest reincarnation (that is, again) - and I'm really convinced it must now be a first choice for Mahler novices, too.    Greetings from Switzerland, David.
B000XTLUW0|5.0|I purchased this item after months of looking for the DVD version of the live Muse performance. It makes for a WONDERFUL gift for any Muse fanatic (or even Alternative Rock fan, for that matter). Initially, I felt like I was ripped off since it looked like the CD was simply the Audio version, sans the DVD that's advertised with the product. Anyways, the second disc is the DVD, and it is mind blowing. Definitely worth the ten or so dollars to view one of the most legendary concerts (at least, not as well known, for now).
0802130208|5.0|This book is the most cleverly worded and entertaining book I have ever read. It is so hilarious you will actually laugh out loud. Don't let the ugly cover art influence you...it won the Pulitzer prize for the contents, not the goofy cover. I love this book!
B001AVCFJM|5.0|I saw this movie twice on the IMAX and I was just as excited the second time as I was the first.  It was, in a word, spectacular!  I cannot wait until it comes out on DVD so I can watch it with my husband when he returns from overseas.  It was exciting, funny, suspenseful, and totally exhilarating...something one doesn't get in a lot of movies these days.  I just do not understand how anybody could find this movie boring.       I grew up watching the original Star Trek series during a time when \\"girls\\" were supposed to play with dolls.  Poppycock!  My brother's toys, friends, and interests were much more fun than dolls and, thankfully, he included me in all of his fun.  Needless to say, I have enjoyed all of the movies and series over the years, with the exception of a few.  This movie is, without a doubt, the most action packed of all the movies, to date.  That is not to say the others were boring, as I loved Star Trek IV; it is just that with the never-ending improvements in special effects, so too, will movies improve.
B00138F57G|5.0|I can't believe that you would knock Jenny's singing!!, home girl can sing, mind you she hardly speaks spanish. as for Marc, he won me over. I loved the album, the singing the memories. Puerto Ricans, Newyouricans, should stand proud that this music is still being played. Stop knocking Jenny.....she's the Tops in my book. Even the grand Lady herself \\"Celia Cruz\\" said \\"The kid has pipes\\" now if the Queen of Salsa liked her......HELLO!!!!
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I love this movie. It's fun and you'll find yourself humming around the house long after the movie is over. Sure it's a little campy like all musicals can be but I watched it twice today on cable and I've been smiling all day. I could identify with so many of the themes in the movie, espcially when your daughter leaves the house to get married. The acting was great and the scenery fantastic.  I'm a huge Meryl Streep fan so I watch anything she is in and I love the fact that she pushed herself to do something out of her comfort zone and take on a singing role. Her courage in her roles is one of the things I like so much about her.  I've seen the movie 10 times and for me its that kind of movie that I can watch over and over and never get tired of it.
0307588335|5.0|After reading various media reports for the past year about Mr. Fuld and his team at Lehman - sequestered on the 31st floor of 745 7th Ave - someone finally has written an insider account of what in the world actually happened at that place.  No one had been able to penetrate Mr. Fuld's circle, but Mr. McDonald's work and relationships with some of the most powerful people at Lehman have given us a unique, important perspective on Fuld and the Exec Committee.  Years ago, I wished Michael Lewis in Liar's Poker had a similar chance to get closer to the top guys at Solly.    The book itself is a great read - inspirational at times, hilarious at others - and Mr. McDonald does an excellent job of describing some of the most complicated transactions in plain, down-to-earth language.  The story itself - how one of the world's top i-banks was reduced to rubble - is heartbreaking in so many ways.  There are many important take-aways and lessons learned.  The book itself will certainly be an instant classic, now on my shelf next to When Genius Failed, Liar's Poker, Predator's Ball, etc.

We have a lawyer friend with early onset dementia and several relatives and friends' relatives who have or have had Alzheimer's disease.  This was both as an enjoyable book and an informative narrative of the perception of dementia from the point of view of the person stricken with it.  I have recommended it to my friends and have offered to lend it to them.  However, it's a book worth keeping in my personal library - to reread and to re-lend.
1595141979|5.0|I absolutely love Vampire Academy main reason Rose and Dimitri. Rose is a strong, beautiful, smart, loyal and at the same time knows she still has a lot to learn. Dimitri is simply great. He is intense, strong, brave, hot and still the sweets and loving when it comes to Rose.   Oh their love; this is one of the best love story written. Their emotion are so intense and true and leaves not doubts that their love is not just physical but spiritual and goes deep into their souls; they really are two half of a whole.    Shadow Kiss was so good but of so sad; I could not stop crying at the end but I think Dimitri will be back and we will see just how strong their love is. I have a feeling Rose will do what ever it takes to get Dimitri's soul back.  I think Rose leaving Lissa is going to be turning point for Lissa; she was unintentionally selfish when it comes to Rose. Rose leaving will force Lissa to look at life for all dhampir and this will change Lissa into the leader she was born to be.  I do not full trust Adrian, I think he is hiding something. Christian is right, Adrian is after both Rose and Lissa. Ralf said Adrian and the Queen wanted to brake up Lissa and Christian. Also why does the Nazar Bead (the gift Rose's mom gave her) kept showing up in the dream, what does she need protection from in the dream.     Why is no one talking the big picture?   1. Did the Strigio simply decide to join together and hunt down Morio or is someone else behind this all? If someone is behind this who is it?   2. Magic is often described as life but is being used to kill Strigio. I often wonder, what would happen if spirit was added to the stake. Would it bring back life, as in would Strigio get their souls back????? Not only savings Dimitri but all strigio therefore magic can be used for life again and not death.
0375842209|5.0|This book was one of the best I have ever read. The narrator, Death, leads the reader on a roller coaster ride of emotions in Nazi Germany. There were so many tender stories woven into the fabric of this book during such a dark and evil time in history, but in the end, each story boiled down to survival. Highly recommended for young adults and older.
B0000286CH|5.0|This collection is simply wonderful, a rich and haunting escape into atmospheric, moody, and ultimately stirring melodies and French lyrics delivered with perfection. Rarely am I able to play this CD without listening to it completely through. Over time, the entire album blends into one song, a symphony of emotive power. If I had to pick a favorite cut, it would have to be the title track. A true gem.
B001PPLJIQ|2.0|I was unimpressed with this one.  The first half was all about forbidden sex, and sex or no sex, the male lead never became a \\"real man\\" until the last minute or so of the movie.  I figured out the female's first secret on their 2nd encounter and just guessed at her other secret and got it right.  (I hate it when that happens!)The acting was good, but the story was blah!
1584282584|5.0|A subject that seems so simple yet so much to be learned, you may not think so until you start reading this book.  Although the title states for wedding and portrait phototgraphy, the information can be applied to just about any type of photography.  This book does a great job of breaking down elements of on camera flash to tailor the lighting to each image under a variety of conditions.  What also makes this a practical book is that anyone with a DSLR camera has or will have an on camera flash.  An explanation of equipment and tips and techniques are also great benefits this book has to offer.  If you use a flash, get this book.
0307454541|5.0|This book was recommended by the clerk in a book store. Business at this particular chain of book stores must be down because a clerk met me at the door and offered his services and as I was leaving with another book strongly recommended THE GIRL.... On his recommendation I took a chance and am extremely grateful.<br /><br />The plot has been discussed by many other reviewers and frankly, I think that this is a book that the reader would be better off not knowing anything about the plot going in.  The unfolding of the plot adds to the suspense of the novel.<br /><br />I will admit that I had a hard time getting started and getting used to the Swedish names and geography and a little bit of the syntex of the writing, since it is a translation.  But once you get into it, you will have no problems.<br /><br />One reviewer who gave the book a very low mark, thought that it was too long.  If I had any criticism of it, I do think that it goes on a bit long, but as far as I'm concerned it was all worth it.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to the next book by Larsson and was sad to hear that he died. He was a great spinner of tales.
B001FB55H6|3.0|[...]<br /><br />Wanted to see this movie mainly because I like the director, Zack Snyder, who did \\"300\\"---which was just a really fun, hyper-testosteroned but well-crafted action flick. S<br /><br />What I liked:<br /><br />- nice dark subtext, anti-heroic superheroes, zero pretense of moral piety<br />- nice soundtrack, esp. the opening 5 minutes set to Dylan's \\"The Times They Are A-Changin'\\"<br />- excellent pacing, atmospherics, special FX ... visually gorgeous, most of it.<br />- lotsa juicy bone-crunching, blood-splattering, limb-dismembering fight scenes<br />- Jackie Earle Haley as Rorshach, what an amazing stand-out performance!<br /><br />What wasn't so great:<br /><br />- Malin Ackerman as Laurie Jupiter. Cute, sort of, but not that great. So-so actress.<br />- the sex scene between Ackerman and Patrick Wilson where they get the big O in the hovercraft which then spurts a big jet of flame. Cheesy-ometer about went through the roof.<br />- the ending: not that I *demand* happy endings, but this one just felt a little redundant after having watched \\"The Dark Knight.\\"<br />- conservative bias --- there's a fair bit of liberal-bashing but no equal time for conservative bashing, despite the film's setting: a totally corporatist American dictatorship run by one Tricky Dick Nixon, big-time Republican scumbag.<br />- a number of dead spots in the script when things get a bit too corny and/or the cast is being asked to deliver far more than it can deliver<br /><br />Yeah, I'd probably see this film again. Would I want to own it? Probably not.<br /><br />3 and 1/2 stars.
1895565375|1.0|My dear friend gave me this book with loving intent and said that she had loved it when her children were little. I read it and was somewhat horrified. I have young toddler and lost my mom a few years ago. Why in the world would I want to burden a small child with thoughts of having to comfort her dying mother.    I haven't thrown the book in the trash because my friend gave it to me...but my instincts tell me I should.    I am amazed that others like the book and wonder how they find it suitable for youngsters.
B000URDE2Y|5.0|Robin Trower's BRIDGE OF SIGHS goes down as one of the greatest albums ever, in my opinion.  It's easily in the top five blues albums of all time, as well.  When listening to this album, it's easy to get mesmerized and drawn into the slow, easy bluesy-cold mood that this album establishes.  It starts out with the perfect kicker (Day of the Eagle) which is an up-tempo starter that eventually slows down near the end.  The next track, Bridge of Sighs, can easily be fused together with In this Place (the 3rd track). Bridge of Sighs is my second favorite song of all time, behind Are you Experienced? by Jimi Hendrix.  Bridge of Sighs/In this Place put you into a trance with their slow bluesy beats.  The sounds of wind blowing only add to the mood, and one just has to think that this is what the blues are all about.  The next song (The Fool and Me) is straight blues with a catchy guitar riff to start things off.  The next track (Too Rolling Stoned) is another classic of sorts, but not really one of my favorites on the album.  Instead, I like About to Begin, which is another slower, more hypnotic song that has similarities to the title track.  Lady Love is another song that deserves praise, as it's more up-tempo, yet still bluesy with the guitar solo.  The last track (Little Bit of Sympathy) starts off with a crushing riff going into straight rocking blues.  This album is a healthy balance of all facets of the blues, and is a must-have for anyone who loves the blues.  The other part of the CD (the bonus tracks) are very nice to have, but I'm more focused on the original stuff from the initial release.  This album never loses its appeal.  I can play it any day, and still get the same enjoyment out of it. 10/10
B0017V7GLC|4.0|I have been sort of underwhelmed by some previous Ladytron submissions, but some of the songs on this one are quite the diddy.  It feels very heavy on the organish synth, but it seems like a good amount.  It normally takes a few tries for me to get in to one of their pieces, but a few I got in to right away.
B002A9OJ0Q|5.0|This is a return to form from a-ha. Sounds like the 80s again, but very actual indeed.  Highly recommended.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|A must have for any real PS3 gamer. I've had my ps3 for a little over a year, and I'm not sure how I was able to live without these little things. They make using the real buttons on the ps3 controller must easier to use and keeps my fingers from slipping. Well worth the $5 I paid for these.
B0018O4YSQ|4.0|One of my first purchase of Blu Ray.    It's great to have both versions of the movie on 1 disc while I am not sure I'd recommend \\"The Director's Cut\\" to those first watching the movie. Feedback from friends whom I aired my Blu Ray version of this movie to was that the theatrical release seemed easier to comprehend with the narration. Director's seemed shorter... well, I guess it would be. I won't go into the story as most of you would probably already know.. as for those who don't others have more or less shared.    My take on Picture Quality would be fantastic! Audio is great!    Would I recommend that you get it? Absolutely... for the story and it's quality on Blu Ray.
B001P9KR8U|4.0|Jamal sits in a room, encountering an intense police investigation, as they try to figure out how a young, uneducated kid from the slums could possibly have known all the answers during his appearance on India's \\"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\\" We are taken through a series of flashbacks as he is questioned, and we learn about young Jamal's life with his brother, the difficulties and tragedies he's faced (such as the murder of his mother), the places he's been, and his initial meeting with childhood friend and eventual love, Latika. As perplexing as it seems, his ability to answer is based on some amazing coincidences, and he's also been able to find Latika several times and once even saves her from the clutches of a gangster. It seems that every time he catches up with her, fate intervenes and it is a short lived moment. The film moves back to the present, and the officers who interrogate the young man come to understand who he is. The two major conflicts within the story are: will Jamal be able to finally see Latika, his true love, and will he be the next millionaire. Certainly the love story takes precedent over his appearance on the show.     There's a certain Dickens-like quality to the film, as it has amazing coincidences and a \\"rags-to-riches\\" feel to it. From the depths of poverty, the protagonist experiences pain in life but rebounds, and is given the chance of a lifetime.  There's also an aspect to the production where we cannot expect to take things at face value; things have a fantasy element to them, and the story can be likened to a parable about love or overcoming one's roadblocks in life.     Slumdog Millionaire presents the often done \\"rags to riches\\" story in a unique manner and setting, and the film is worthy of its best picture status for 2008 (an award that has become a sham of late). Still, I felt that at some points the film dragged on a bit, and began to lose steam, and took some of the film's power with it. There is some violence, and some language, and the \\"feel good\\" label attached to Slumdog could be misleading without the resolution at the end.     Over all, though, this is a film with heart, and its story was presented effectively. I'm glad I finally had the chance to see it.
B001YYQ9SS|4.0|I liked advent children as it came out back then on dvd, but this one is much more enhanced. Picture quality is stunning and the images seem very very sharp and precise although it is a remake of the same movie released a while back. Packaging is good and the cover makes it worthy to sit on a collector's shelf. Don't expect to find any leaflets or accompanying booklets though as there are none. However, it more than makes up for that by including some awesome extras on disc. The movie itself has been extended with more depth and reason to the story. Japanese voice acting is excellent, while the English one... well, not as great, but a good attempt in any case. You also get a sneak preview of the upcoming FF game and reminescence of FF7 videos. All in all, this is a good buy for any fan of the FF7 game / story.
B001U0HBQ0|1.0|I wanted to like this movie. In fact I expected to like it. I was sorely disappointed.  Halfway through this film it became evident that the main point the filmmakers were trying to make was that they could pull off the technical feat of reverse-aging Brad Pitt. Frankly, I thought the CGI looked rather fake. Whenever the little-old-young Pitt talked, he looked like a claymation creature. Maybe that's why he spends most of the film looking mildly bewildered, doing and saying pretty much nothing. But let's allow for a moment that the filmmakers succeeded in this reverse-aging feat. What else does this movie have going for it?   Honestly I can't think of anything. The plot is nonexistent, the characters are phony and Pitt's character isn't really even particularly likeable. It's like _Forrest Gump_ if Forrest weren't particularly endearing and he never really did anything interesting. It's like _Beaches_ (ugh) except the characterization is too weak for words. Women fall for the old-young Pitt for no apparent reason at all. He really has no personality to speak of, except, gee whiz, he's aging in reverse. His lines are insipid and pointless. The movie utterly fails to justify why Cate Blanchett is infatuated with him, and their delayed love story creates the only real arc the story has. Then the arc takes a random turn [[spoiler alert]] when he abandons his love and their baby daughter, so the baby doesn't have to see him in his reverse aging process. Cate can't understand it and neither can we. Later we learn he writes letters to his daughter saying he \\"wishes he could have\\" been there for her first steps, her first day at kindergarten, etc., and we viewers are supposed to somehow feel empathy about this. Instead we feel contempt. What an idiot. He goes and looks at pyramids and crap, knowing his days are numbered, when all the while he could be raising his daughter -- which he claims is what he really \\"wishes\\" he could do. Ridiculous!  OK, I'm ranting. But I gotta tell you, I put off seeing this movie because I knew it had been over-hyped at the Oscars and I didn't want my expectations to be too high. But really it was just a waste of two hours. Benjamin Button is a great big bore!!!
B001ILFUDM|4.0|Visually, the re-mastering on this classic Disney animated feature is flawless. However, in terms of audio, there is a minor problem -- a few lines of dialog are missing! During the musically number \\"Give a Little Whistle\\" Jiminy's line \\"Right!\\" and his warning \\"Look out, Pinoke!\\" are absent. I realize it's a minor mistake, but it irks me just the same that, for all the care that went into the restoration of this classic, somehow someone missed this error. For that I have to leave off one star, because every time I watch my new Blu-ray disc of Pinocchio I notice what's missing.
0385737947|5.0|Have you ever read a book, then set it down and wondered, \\"How have I settled for reading so many mediocre books . . . when this one is fantastic?\\"<br /><br />\\"He began his new life standing up . . .\\"--begins The Maze Runner by bestselling author of The 13th Reality series, James Dashner.<br /><br />Thomas knows his name, but that's about it. He's forgotten everything else. Everything. Even his age.<br /><br />It's pitch black, and Thomas is in a metal contraption of sorts--moving upward. When the elevator stops, the top opens to reveal a group of boys staring down at him. \\"Nice to meet ya, shank,\\" one of the boys says, \\"Welcome to the Glade.\\"<br /><br />Thomas stumbles into a glade surrounded by a seemingly unsolvable maze. Each night the maze doors shut, and each morning the maze has reconfigured itself. The glad is ran by a group of boys, but no one can get in and no one can get out. Once a week the elevator delivers food and other goods. But the week that Thomas arrives, the elevator stops delivering food. Instead it delivers a girl. The first one to ever come to the Glade.<br /><br />Thomas not only has to learn to survive, but how to protect his new friends, and solve the maze before the entire population of the Glade falls prey.<br /><br />The Maze Runner is a definite page-turner that starts out interesting, then quickly hooks you. The dystopian world which Dashner creates is fresh, from the descriptions to the dialog to the actual names of the kids. I loved the puzzle-solving aspect of the book, which having read Dashner's other books, he is truly masterful at. I'm looking forward to the 2nd book in the series: The Scorch Trials. Dashner is a gifted story-teller.
B001EOQWF8|1.0|This movie was propaganda. Fat, mostly-white Americans have taken over control of the human race, and do nothing with it. I hated this movie. I made the mistake of buying this movie without seeing it first. The movie portrayed Americans in the worst light I have ever seen them portrayed in 'film'. If you like or have any faith in the human race, do not get this movie. We are not all fat and lazy Disney.
B00138EZIQ|5.0|Truly this is a masterpiece! The greatest jazz fusion album of all time! This album will also heavily appeal to Prog Rock fans exploring the Jazz Fusion genre. It doesn't get better than this, it is such a brilliant timeless classic of jazz fusion and musical imagination! It is also one of my favorite albums of all time across all genres and it still gives me goosebumps after listening to it countless times since I discovered it about 30 or so years ago.
0786838655|4.0|I have no qualms about admitting that while I'm an adult, I do enjoy reading YA. I've read Harry and loved the series. I've read Twilight and I'll just say I didn't enjoy that series as much. Then I stumbled upon Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief.<br /><br />Of course, my first thought was \\"Harry Potter Rip-off\\". Yes, the story does have many of the same elements as Harry, such as the boarding school for the children of the gods, separated into their different houses. The compliment of good kids and bad kids. The big bad guy, Cronos, is eerily similar to He Who Should Not Be Named. There are definitely others.<br /><br />Still, the adaption of Greek mythology in an extremely fast paced tale helps lend itself to a very enjoyable read. Having written about the gods, myself, I found myself attracted to the subject.<br /><br />As Percy travels from one perilous encounter to the next in search of Zeus' bolt, we are greeted with new interesting characters out of mythology. For example, Ares reminds you of Dog, the Bounty Hunter of reality TV fame.<br />Some of the traps are predictable and some of them leave you wondering \\"What were the kids thinking?\\". Still, it leads to more fun.<br /><br />The Lightning Thief is definitely darker than most HP books and some of the scenes (especially toward the end) could shock younge readers.<br /><br />Fans of Harry Potter expecting the same element in this book won't be disappointed.

I think that this is not a book for everyone, it does have a lot of violence and makes refrences to sex, drugs, rock-n-roll, and dog poop; but, it is a good read. I didn't necessarily like the heroine, but I didn't hate her either, which is something I like about the book. I know enough about human nature, to realize that not all women are the same and not all after the same things. I like seeing the ugly side of women; I'm not afraid of it, and I can appreciate Mrs. Flynn's exposing it. I would say that if you enjoy books that are about woman having beautiful emotional awakening thatnks to friendsthat offer support and encouragement, don't read this. If you scare easily, are very sensitive, or an animal lover, don't read this. But, if you enjoy a good mystery, an anti-heroine, and complex stories, than give it a whirl.<br /><br />please visit me at BookDevour@blogspot.com
0545123267|4.0|Shiver has the very basic plot we have seen before. Girl and boy meet, they fall in love and try to work through their problems so they can be together. Maggie has taken this storyline that feels as old as time and has written a love story that is beautiful and moving. Some will read Shiver and see a bit of a Shakespearian influence with the heroine Grace and her feelings for Sam, the werewolf who saved her from death when she was a child. Grace and Sam reminded me of Romeo and Juliet. Their story is both tragic and beautiful. Through an unimaginable horror, they both found each other. These two young souls yearn deeply for each other's touch. But the thing that separates them, where they know that their time is very limited is a sickness Sam has. Sam is a werewolf. He wasn't born this way, but a werewolf attack when he was a young boy has destroyed his life. Sam feels his destiny is with Grace. Sam also knows that he can't have forever with Grace because as he grows older, he stays as a werewolf much longer. The day will come where he won't be able to change back into a human.<br /><br />Grace has been obsessed with the wolf with the yellow eyes that saved her from being torn apart by his pack when she was snatched from her swing set in her backyard when she was nine years old. For the past seven years Grace looks for her wolf who keeps his distance. She feels he is always looking after her. It sounds so strange and implausible but they have a connection. Grace and Sam are able to come in contact again when it is believed a boy from Grace's high school is killed by the wolves in the area. The town goes on the defensive and will eliminate this threat with their shotguns. And when Sam is shot he goes to Grace.<br /><br />You would think finding a naked and bloody teenage boy almost dead on your front porch would be a shocking thing. But Grace keeps it together and brings him in her home and helps him heal. She just knows that this boy is her wolf. It all comes down to that connection they have. Sam is thrilled to be with Grace because she is so warm and giving; he feels safe. And the key word here is warmth. As long as Sam stays warm, he can remain human. Once the temperature drops, he will become a wolf again. And it is becoming harder for him to stay warm. As long as Sam has Grace he can hold his wolf change at bay.<br /><br />Grace won't let Sam succumb to his other nature. She needs him desperately. She does everything in her power to keep him. Grace wants to give Sam the life he so rightly deserves. As soon as Sam heals, they act like any teenage couple. They go on dates. Sam takes her to school and waits for her afterwards so they can just be together. Their bond continues to grow. But that isn't enough. The boy Jack, who was thought to be dead, is now a wolf and will do whatever he can to escape this new life. Jack's sister Isabel knows that Grace is keeping secrets. Sam has to deal with his foster father Beck, who helped raised him and wants to keep the pack safe. Beck wants to change other teens into wolves. The way Beck does this disgusts Sam. But this man saved Sam and gave him years of guidance.<br /><br />There is a great deal of teenage angst in Shiver. Think of this book as a paranormal Dawson's Creek. Grace and Sam are very deep people, perhaps too much so. Sam is more pensive and observant, which makes sense because of his wolf nature. Grace shows more emotion and enjoys communicating with Sam in most ways a young teenage girl would with the boy they care for. Small things such as Sam making Grace breakfast and driving her to school have special meaning. Things evolve where Sam and Grace and engage in such intimacies, such as kissing, touching and once scene where they go up to Grace's bedroom and enjoy their love. These moments are very touching. Another word that comes to mind is desolation because of the descriptions of the weather and the brutal nature of the wolves. Grace has hopes that Sam will remain human so they can have a future together. Sam is less optimistic. He takes each day is it comes.<br /><br />Maggie takes care with certain subject matters such as teenage social interactions and sex. Some readers may think Grace and Sam's relationship is not a very healthy one because they are so young. I believed in what Sam feels because he comes across as more mature and has seen so much. Grace's only life experiences are the ones with her friends and of her parents who give her too much independence. Grace assumes that her parents don't care for her because they are totally oblivious to what she really wants from them. I really think this comes out of what happened to Grace when she was snatched by the wolves. Where were her parents? Because of this, Grace has some emotional problems. She doesn't feel that she is loved enough. Perhaps that is why she is so stuck on Sam? Even with this question, I couldn't help but believe in what they have.<br /><br />Shiver brought forth my own memories of young love and the all consuming feelings one has experiencing it.<br /><br />Katiebabsgether.

1594481938|4.0|'A Long Way Down' is a curious piece of fiction.  While largely comedic, it centers around the strange friendship that develops between total strangers who meet atop a tall building in London while contemplating suicide.  All these characters have issues, and a couple characters are decidedly not huggable.  But they somehow learn from each other and are able to slowly come to grips with their reasons for wanting suicide and look to overcome them.  Although not believable for a moment, the humorous interludes and the kindhearted nature of the author's writing makes this book very enjoyable.      Bottom line: a funny-sad book that makes for perfect reading whilst on a plane or waiting for one.  Recommended.
B001A5HBJC|4.0|I enjoyed it. There are elements here that remind me of Rod Serling's \\"walking distance\\" (twilight zone) and \\"they are tearing down tim o'reilly's bar\\" (night gallery).  In those episodes you find disillusioned middle-aged executives of the early 1960s who feel the passaage of time, sense that the next generation is on their heels and who are hoping for an exit.  Add in some Serling-esque chain smoking, which is era appropriate of course.  It might just be convergent story evolution. I mean why write about happy middle aged executives in the early 60s, right?  But it could be that he's a Serling fan.<br /><br />Worth a look.
B001GAOY5U|4.0|I didn't see this movie in theaters, so I only saw it once I received the Blu-Ray .. I must say the 3D experience for me was lacking, plus the 3D glasses basically make the Blu-Ray useless as it really dims and takes out the detail.      As far as the movie - I thought it was enjoyable.  Certainly not a great movie, but overall I thought it was pretty good.     I wouldn't purchase the Blu-Ray for the 3D - I would purchase it if you liked the movie.  Blu-Ray quality, without 3D, is on par with other movies.      Enjoy!
B001041JKU|5.0|Very satisfied.  Got my order in a timely manner and it was just what I expected.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|This movie is one of the better movies ever made. I find it a shame that \\"Stranger than Fiction\\" did not have the kind of publicity it deserved when making it's debut. It has it's own mixture of dry wit and humour, a subtle yet powerful message about life, and leaves most every viewer with content. Will Ferrell plays his best, Emma Thompson continues to astonish and exceed, Maggie Gyllenhaal does not break any promises of a well delivered preformance, and Dustin Hoffman and Queen Latifah act with that which made them famous! Perhaps you will find hints of philosophical motion, or great literary \\"to and fro\\", but no matter! It is just an all around good movie. Sit down and enjoy it.

B000002L9J|4.0|Hot record, the Smith's definitely still had it on this set of cuts.  A little less bouncy than some of the great dance tracks on their earlier records, but still more than solid in terms of music, songwriting and production.  As for Morrissey, well, he's Morrissey.
B001CTDH76|5.0|Wow. What an amazing show! At first it seems like just another crime show, like Law and Order, CSI, Without a Trace, or any of the others. But this show has what the others lack. (In my opinion, at least.) HUMOR! Straight out laughs! This show is hilarious! Yet it doesn't take away from the awful crimes that occur, or Patrick Jane's tragic past. Truly the greatest show out there today.

David Halberstam presents what seems to be personal vendettas and anecdotal evidence to support his own political views. I made it as far as page 179 and then got tired of hearing his diatribes. Will someone please write a decent account of the Korean War?

B000DN5W4I|4.0|First of all, Joe Bonamassa is a blues god. My only complaint about this DVD, is the editing. There are FAR too many cut aways to the bass player (Eric Czar). Like in the middle of Joes blazing solos, they cut to the bass player. I did'nt buy this DVD to watch an arrogant showboating bass player. \\"Hey Eric, bass players are a dime a dozen, so get out of Joes spotlight and let him do his thang!\\"
B000FBFMFW|5.0|I know that Kindle/amazon and [...] both have the first book in this series for free.  Please start in the beginning. get the free book and you'll love this series.      I tend to read books that are atleast 3 or more in a series. There is;    The Farseer's Trilogy  The live ship traders  and the tawny man trilogy    these are in succession, and are wonderful reads.      I choose authors that have many in a series, as i read very quickly, about 650 pages per book and i tend to read 1 book per week.  If you are a fast reader, or just love to get caught up in a series that will hold you for a while.  Robin Hobbs's books are the ones for you.

B001MW0J2O|3.0|I love Animal Collective.  But I was one of the late arrivals, only having heard them when Sung Tongs was first getting attention.  It was morbid and catchy and though inconsistent, still a great album.  Their next album -- Feels -- continued this trend of inconsistency, perhaps heightened by the fact that AC's good songs were really, really good, and, in comparison, their filler songs seemed especially unnecessary.  But I still loved them.    It wasn't until Strawberry Jam that I felt AC had made an album whole, a record consistent all the way through.  I adore - to this day, still adore - this album.  It was disorienting and illuminating, scary and, again, catchy.  I put AC on a pedestal.  They could do no wrong.    Perhaps it is for this reason that I am disappointed with Merriweather.  Once again, when AC is on, they are on.  And for the first four tracks of the album, they go.  I've never experienced such wonder as I do when listening to Summertime Clothes.  Such wonder that is tempered by the fact that Daily Routine never quite goes anywhere, despite its promising beginning.  And Bluish is an example of Animal Collective sentimentality that is, oddly enough, too sentimental.  Guys Eyes satisfies, but the remaining tracks (with one extreme exception) seem more like experiments than songs.    Enter Brother Sport.  I can forgive so much in Merriweather because the album finishes on such a strong note.  Perhaps I am selfish.  I want every song to have the excitement and emotional impact and the tension of Brother Sport.  But when you look at what Animal Collective have already accomplished, how can you not maintain lofty expectations?      I wish it had been an EP.  Cut out Daily Routine, Bluish, and No More Running.  Maybe not EP length, but then at least I'm not patiently waiting for the track to end so I can again love this band.
B00288KNJU|5.0|Eerie, funny, tragic, inventive - all in the correct proportions and timed exactly right. The top notch animation and direction pulled everything together.

1594488916|4.0|. . . of a rare book thief, the rare bookstore owner who tried to stop him (and was somewhat successful) and the journalist who tried to chronicle the tale -- without losing her objectivity.    John Gilkey loves rare books.  Really loves them.  He loves to look at them, hold them, read them, and collect them.  Unfortunately, he acquires his treasures by unconventional, not to say, illegal means.    He steals them.    He has been (Compulsively? Let the reader decide!)stealing rare books for quite some time, using false identities, stolen credit card receipts -- and the odd \\"five-fingered discount\\"!  He has done jail and prison time, and habitually re-offends.    This book is an account of attempts by rare book dealers to catch Gilkey (who is likely guilty of far more than his conviction record might indicate) presented by a journalist who was granted multiple interviews with Gilkey (as well as many others).    The journalist asks herself an interesting question.  Did she, in the course of her research and interviews, lose her own sense of objectivity in dealing with a very polite, very persuasive, rather cultured individual -- who happened to be a habitual thief?    It is a fair question.  I leave it to readers to determine their own answers.    As a rabid book collector myself (although nowhere near the level as described in this book) I found this to be a fascinating read.  I suspect other bibliophiles will agree.    Recommended!
0439023483|4.0|I was a little discouraged when the book arrived and I discovered it was \\"Young Adult Fiction.\\" I'm forty-nine, after all.     What does Young Adult Fiction (YAF) even mean? I guess it is an ambiguous distinction (like \\"country music\\") - books for, let's say, teenagers that would definitely feature teenage characters and situations. When I think about it a lot of my favorite books are YAF - many of Robert Heinlein's mid-period works, which I love. *Citizen of the Galaxy* comes to mind. I would expect that there would not be much sex, but there is certainly a lot of violence in this book.    The novel is set in the future, in a North America that is ruled by a trendy capitol, and has twelve poorer districts (that seem like small villages) that are required to send two teenage \\"tributes\\" to the capitol each year in the fashion of the Athenian tributes to the Cretan Minotaur.     It seems to me that the author must have been watching one of those \\"voted off the island\\" reality shows when she had the idea for this book because this is basically *Survivor* for keeps. In the book, the Hunger Games is a popular television show and the entire nation watches it.    The book was engaging and a quick read. The narrator must use what skills she has and her cunning to survive the game. In some ways I felt like I wasn't quite reading a final draft. About 2/3 of the way through the book there was an \\"unprecedented\\" rule change made in the Hunger Games that was clearly an afterthought by the author that demonstrates that she didn't have a clear vision of where the story was going when she started. Details such as where all the cameras were and where the little parachutes come from are skipped. The concept was, more or less, \\"they are on a television show - that's all you need to know.\\"    As I said this is an engaging and quick read. Right now I'm trying to figure out which teenage niece or nephew I want to give it to. Recommended.
0385342020|5.0|I love all of Sophie Kinsella's books, but Twenties Girl is really fantastic. I devoured every page as quickly as possible. Ms. Kinsella crafts her characters beautifully and there are several riveting twists in the storyline which will have you hooked... Twenties girl is a story about a girl in her mid-twenties who is having boy troubles, job worries and then on top of everything else, she is forced to go to the funeral of a 105 year old great aunt that she never met. At the funeral, a strange thing happens. She meets the ghost of her great aunt Sadie and her life is immediately turned upside down and the fun begins... This book makes you laugh and think. It gives you a lifeline to what life might have been like for a twenty-something woman living in the roaring 20's. I love the overall positive message of this book and that it reaffirms that we can learn so much from our ancestors and our family, if only we're open-minded and willing to listen... Yes, a girl being visited by her dead great aunt is a stretch- but after all, Twenties girl is a work of fiction. A brilliant one at that :)
B000WMA6FA|5.0|Anyone who \\"reviews\\" this movie and gives it less than five stars should not be allowed to make any more reviews.  This is one of the very best movies to come out of Hollywood.

B001YYQ9SS|4.0|I found the original release of \\"Advent Children\\" very lacking as far as story-telling goes.  The 'Complete' addition has tons of little \\"tweaks\\" including a good deal of additional scenes and dialogue- making for the TRUE \\"Advent Children\\" experience.    And, of course, the quality is fantastic on Blu-Ray!  This HD flick seems to lack in quality in comparison to other Blu-Ray features I own (I presently own about 15 Blu-Ray titles) but it looks (and sounds) really, really good nonetheless.      (I had to watch the original \\"Advent Children\\" four times before I fully understood the story-line.  But with \\"Advent Children Complete\\" I was able to gather the story rather concretely within the first half-hour!  My girlfriend and I are gonna watch it tonight, and I'll see if a non-Final Fantasy player like herself will be able to follow the story and characters- I think she will.  I was nervous about watching it with her, because the original edition's story was so... sub-par.  So I watched about 45 minutes of it last night and was VERY impressed with the major 'upgrade' with the \\"Complete\\" edition.)    Lookin' forward to finishin' it tonight!
1582701709|4.0|I first saw the movie three or four years ago, right after it was released.  I found it to be very powerful.  I had read about similar concepts, but never really \\"got\\" it like I did with the Secret DVD.    Got the book version expecting that same \\"magic.\\"  It's good, but to me, not as good as the movie.  All the same concepts are here, and much of it seems to be a transcript from the movie, but I feel there is something missing.  The emotion just doesn't come through like it did in the movie, at least for me.    The layout is very nice.  This is a book that is very well done.  Nice photos to illustrate the content, color pages, and everything you'd expect from a book about abundance.  Looks great on the coffee table and makes a great conversation piece.      I thought everybody had heard of this book, but I have had a few people wonder \\"What is the Secret?\\" when they see it on my coffee table.    I loved the content.  I felt it was well-explained.  Some people have said it is more like \\"wishing\\" and lacked anything about action.  If you're one of those people, you may want to look at [[ASIN:1608420027 The Rich Switch]], which I feel explains this aspect of the Law of Attraction better.  It's about ALIGNMENT, not action specifically.  Action is part of being in alignment, of course.    A good book.  4-stars, because I feel the movie is a better version of it.      I have heard there is a \\"Secret 2\\" coming out.  I hope so!!

0141439513|2.0|I purchased and read Pride and Prejudice so that I would be able to understand Pride and Prejudice and Zombies before reading it.  In other words, I wanted to read Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, but in order to prepare I first purchased and read Pride and Prejudice.<br /><br />Pride and Prejudice sucks.  Basically, it is extremely boring, even for a character-driven story.  I consider myself an open minded person and I have read and enjoyed some character driven stories such as Jane Eyre, Crime and Punishment, and The Great Gatsby.  With all of those books I could tell why the books were classsic; they had well developed characters who interacted in a way that was either entertaining enough, or had sufficient underlying philosophical or social subtext, that a person could read these books with a sense of interest.<br /><br />The problem with Pride and Prejudice is that it essentially seems to amount to a story about a fictionalized idealized version of herself as an intelligent somewhat socially unacceptable woman in the context of English upper class society who is able to tell people off in socially acceptable ways, be smarter than her sisters, and meet a grumpy, intelligent socially unacceptable man to marry.  It is boring because it basically doesn't have any social commentary or philosophical suspect besides for \\"smart chix roxxorz\\" or perhaps \\"nerds for t3h win\\" and it is basically a self-referential story which continues ad nauseum.  I cannot understand for a moment why Pride and Prejudice is considered a classic and not the literary equivalent of trashy internet fan fiction with a Mary Sue lead character.  Actually, I recall reading somewhere that Charlotte Bronte basically panned Pride and Prejudice in a review as being boring as hell.<br /><br />I would recommend reading Jane Eyre over Pride and Prejudice because even though Jane Eyre is essentially another self referential fantasy about being a slightly socially awkward smart woman in the context of English society there are actual physical events that happen in the story that can somewhat hold your interest and actual entertaining fleshed out characters besides for the main character, whereas I get the feeling that Pride and Prejudice is basically a gripe about how everyone else is so shallow.  If you're going to do that at least be entertaining about it like in The Great Gatsby.  Trying to finish off Pride and Prejudice just caused me a lot of stress and pain and I had to force myself to keep reading.  And I've read a lot of things in my lifetime that would bore most people into depression and somnolence.<br /><br />Actually my real recommendation for if you want a good piece of classic literature with developed characters, but you don't want to deal with the anemic pale flabby social dissatisfaction of a book like Pride and Prejudice, you should instead read something by Alexandre Dumas like The Count of Monte Cristo or The Three Musketeers.  Those books are written in a convoluted classical style (read it in French for extra points!), they have real characters, they have character interaction, but they're also event-driven rather than exclusively character-driven; actual physical events, rather than conversations at dinner parties, drive the story lines.  The lead characters actually do things like engage in hand to hand combat, pilfer fine wines, and manipulate international politics, whereas the people in Pride and Prejudice just bad mouth each other at a dinner table.  (Jane Austen doesn't even tell us what they're eating and drinking; at least Alexandre Dumas tells us how his heroes infiltrated no-man's-land and were taking fire but had brought a picnic basket with food and wine from a specific region and were having lunch and making fun of the enemy from behind cover.)  And given how busy modern life is, do you really want to spend hours of your precious time reading about pale anemic English people bad mouthing each other over dinner over ridiculous inconsequential things, and not about musketeers taking fire while making snarky comments and knocking back wine? I mean, seriously.
1591391105|3.0|I have read a lot of these \\"management\\" books in my relatively-short career (more than I can remember while earning my MBA, and I've worked for two bosses who seem to think that handing out management books like candy at Halloween will magically make a business run smoothly).  Unfortunately, this book probably ranks near the bottom of the pile in terms of useful advice.    The book is filled with so many broad generalizations, especially in terms of the \\"case studies,\\" that they felt entirely made up.  I wanted names, dates, the real meat of the problems in the businesses...and the book didn't have any of that.  Without those details, I was left to wonder how much the author really understood about how his book applies to real businesses.    I also felt that the book is not applicable to \\"new leaders at all levels\\" and instead truly focuses on people at an executive level.  Sure, that may be a more exciting topic, but there are plenty of other new leaders at lower levels who could use some actual advice.    All in all, this book didn't meet my needs.
B001993Y2C|2.0|This is a review of the Blu-ray release, not the series as a body of work.  We all know that it's incredible.    I bought the series.  I popped it into my Blu-ray player.  I cranked up my HDTV.  Excited much?  You bet.  I had already read a few reviews of the Blu-ray box set online, and everyone was raving about how the series has never looked so good.  I must confess, I am now a double-dipper.  I already own the complete series on DVD.  I am a BIG fan of the show.  And ever since I heard that the series had been shot in HD from its beginning, I have been drooling to see it on Blu-ray. The plan (no pun intended) was to buy the Blu-ray set and trade in my BSG DVDs.  Sadly, in my opinion, the show looks worse on Blu-ray than it does on standard DVD.  Yes, I know:  \\"This is how the show was really intended to look.\\"  I mean, this is a message that has now been drilled into my consciousness.  Ron Moore is on every disc talking about how great the series looks in HD.  Interestingly enough, there is even a message that pops up on each disc that tells (or should I say \\"warns?\\") the viewer that the Blu-ray represents the show as the creators intended.   They wanted a \\"gritty, documentary look.\\"  If that is true, then why in the world bother shooting the show in HD at all?  I honestly think my BSG DVDs look better than these.  But everywhere I look, everybody is still glowing about how incredible the image is.  I've been back and forth multiple times between DVD and Blu-ray.    Bottom line, were it up to me to do over, I would just enjoy my SD DVDs of the show and skip the Blu-ray release.  I mean, if the image was intentionally designed to look flawed and grainy, then why bother spending a couple hundred bucks to get the best picture of how bad it was intended to look?   I just don't get what the draw is here...  I just don't get it...
B000FS9FCG|5.0|This is an intelligent super hero film that is becoming all the more relevant with each passing day. Propagandist? - only to the so-called intelligentsia.

B001PJRAUS|4.0|Amanda Price had no idea what her love for Pride and Prejudice would do for her or where it would take her. When she trades places with Elizabeth Bennet she does everything she can to keep things on track. But what happens when things start to go horribly wrong? And how is Amanda supposed to survive without electricity or toothpaste?<br /><br />One word: hilarious. I pretty much laughed my way throughout much of video. I had no idea what to expect, and I loved the amount of suspense throughout the entire show. Amanda knows the story by heart, and it was hilarious watching her trying to desperately keep things going the way they are written. How many times have you found yourself wishing that you had the chance to live in a different time? I know I've had a dream or two about that. Watching Amanda get the chance to do that was almost just as good!<br /><br />The character's were great. When they get thrown into these really weird situations, it was funny to watch them try to figure everything out. I definitely recommend Lost in Austen to those who are ready for a good laugh and willing to not take anything too seriously. :)

I THINK SHE WILL REALLY LIKE IT.  SEEMS LIKE A GOOD CHOICE FOR HER AGE. I THINK THIS FILM CAN TEACH HER IT IS O.K. NOT TO GO ALONG WITH THE CROWD & STAND UP FOR WHO YOU ARE NOT WHAT EVERYONE TRIES TO MAKE YOU.  I THINK IT IS A REALLY CUTE MOVIE WITH GREAT MORALS TO IT.  I RECOMMEND IT HIGHLY!!!!
0385340575|2.0|I really didn't think this was a very good book.    I do understand those following the series and reviewing and enjoying this book in the context of the ongoing character of Jack Reacher (as I actually enjoyed his character), however as a newbie to the series and as my first Reacher novel, I couldn't find much to love.    It was much longer than needed, with many themes going nowhere fast.     For those who have yet to read I don't want to give away the \\"plot\\" as I could do it in two lines, but it really goes nowhere, with no closure with a bunch of characters loosely connected that don't really tie in.    On the other hand, I did enjoy the main character and have an open mind as I like the wise guy nature of Reacher.  Those of you who are Reacher fans, maybe you can recommend what you think is the best and I will give it another try.

B002H1MCY2|5.0|Japanese films have always had the remarkable reputation of turning the simplest premise into something so full of moving emotions and sensibilities. Yojiro Takita's multi-award winning film \\"DEPARTURES\\" (2008) is no different. There is a lot of excessive hype surrounding the film as it has almost nearly swept the Japanese Academy awards and has been awarded the Best Foreign film honor in the recent 2009 Oscars. No film can live up to the hype it has gotten, but I have to say it has earned each and every recognition; well deserving of the commercial success it had achieved in its native land.<br /><br />Daigo Kobayashi (Masahiro Motoki) is a cello player whose dream is shattered when the orchestra he is playing with goes broke. Left with no choice but to sell his prized cello, Daigo together with his wife Mika (beauteous Ryoko Hirosue) returns to his hometown to live in his mother's old house.  In need of a new job, Daigo responds to an ad in the local paper for a job in \\"Departures\\", thinking that it may be related to travel. But much to his surprise and dismay, Daigo discovers that he had applied for a profession as an `Encofineer'; a man who performs the delicate and traditional Japanese ritual of preparing the bodies of the deceased for the departure to the next life--it pays quite well, and without even thinking about it, he accepts without even giving his wife the details of his new job.<br /><br />It is not often that we become privy to a film about the beautifying of corpses, director Takita takes on the grim subject matter and gives it a commercial charm and appeal. The direction is quite meticulous in exposing the world of the mortician as we become witnesses to the Japanese customs and traditions as to how they deal with their dead. Takita shows that the profession demands a certain amount of sensitivity as we see the different reactions of those left behind by the deceased; some are angry, some are funny, most are overwhelmed by grief and some are curiously joyful. In Daigo's profession, there are no religious affiliation; they do what they do to preserve the memory of the deceased, remembering them as the way they used to be and not who they are in the present.<br /><br />It is a safe bet that a premise such as this may be unusual even for Japanese audiences and one of the film's key to success is the way it executes its grim subject matter through some doses of subtle humor in the film's first act. Writer Kundo Koyama and the direction by Takita meticulously eases the premise into the audience, as we were privy to Daigo and Sasaki's encounter with an extra \\"thing\\" to a supposedly female corpse. We see Masahiro Motoki's deadpan humor as he becomes repulsed by his first job, and just how he eventually becomes comfortable with his new career. Takita cleverly illustrates the short moments in the ceremony that our morticians get to know the deceased quite intimately.<br /><br />After everything sinks in, then the emotional scenes begin to take hold, as we learn more of Daigo's childhood, his problems with his wife's disapproval of his new job and his anger towards his father who had left him while he was a child to run off with a younger woman. Now this is a commercial film and we know that eventually people close to Daigo will eventually come to respect what he does for a living, it is a little predictable but the journey with which the film gets to where it wishes to go is well-played that the screenplay becomes somewhat of a melancholy with a rhythm that just looks so beautiful. Mika (played by Ryoko Hirosue) is just so lovable as the diligent wife; she is just so full of love and trust that her character represents the goodness within the Japanese woman. It was touching to see Daigo perform a ceremony in his wife's presence and director Takita carefully manipulates the camera work to show pure emotion. Takita also injects some sequences that are beautiful to awaken the emotion (sort of serves as a vanguard) as wesee Daigo playing the cello on a hill as if he was reaching out again to his dreams. The film also has beautiful cinematography and emotion-inducing score to match its otherwise simple but grim premise to keep the film running at a brisk pace.<br /><br />The film has two significant scenes that seemed to induce quite a few sniffles, they were injected to give a twist that plays a significant part in Daigo's life. The first one does provoke a lot of emotion; it is full of tear-inducing sequences that can definitely touch its audience. However, it does feel a little overlong that the second twist may lose some of the narrative impact to the inexperienced viewer. The two twists do work in unison in the screenplay but some may argue that Takita was working too hard to induce emotion working one twist right after the other. I didn't find anything wrong with it and I thought it stuck to its sensibilities in reflecting just how life can sometimes throw you in for a curve.<br /><br />The performances are quite good, Motoki (who won best actor in Japan) and Hirosue has some dynamic chemistry between them and the supporting characters made up of Sasaki, Yuriko (co-employee played by Kimiko Yo) and the woman (Kazuko Yoshiyuki) who runs a bath house plays their own significance in the script. I loved the way Yamazaki played Sasaki, it was like a cool and quiet boss as he always seemed to say \\"its fine.\\"<br /><br />Despite some flaws in the screenplay that the film came dangerously close in becoming too sentimental, \\"Departures\\" is easily one of the best commercial films to come out from Japan. The last act will leave an impression that no matter how we see ourselves and others, death sometimes is the one thing that can bring a family together. The film's biggest ace would have to come from its ability to induce the proper emotion at the right minute with such simplicity. Such critical acclaim will no doubt raise the film to unreasonable expectations, and while it may not change the face of Japanese cinema, it is not pretentious and never hides behind its beautiful visual style. The way to approach this film is with tempered expectations, so that the film can touch you in its journey that is both surprising and pleasurable.<br /><br />Highly Recommended! [4 ½ + Stars]<br /><br />The 2-disc region-3 release looks great and sounds great. The 1.78 ratio anamorphic widescreen video transfer is vivid and clean.

1439157383|5.0|For any person who has a sister or brother, a child, a heart this tale will not close for you without a tissue box. This fascinating tales explores things issues most us never consider and from the most interesting view. This brillantly written novel is a superb read. As a first time reader of Jodi Picoult I now find my eyes seraching out her name every time I enter a book store. I, like many others, first heard of the story when I saw the preview. I still have not seen the movie but I know how it ends. Very different from the novel. I'm not sure which ending is better. But I think one is certainly more moving than the other. If you haven't seen the movie read the book. And if you've seen the movie read the book with an open mind. Point being: read the book!!!
0553582453|4.0|There seems to be just a touch too much intrigue in this book although it keeps pace and is a good addition to the four books before it.  What I certainly did not like was the missing pages in the middle of the story.  I decided to just read on hoping this would not make a difference.  Between wondering who \\" the Fool\\" is and whether there is a marriage kept me interested in the story and steadily reading.
0618918248|5.0|A devastating critique of religion coupled with a solid defense of scientific inquiry. Believers of all faiths as well as skeptics need to read this book.

B001PR0Y5S|5.0|There are only a handful of romantic comedies that I really enjoy, and this one is certainly on the list.  The story is not a new one, in fact it screams Taming of the Shrew a little too closely.  However, the chemistry between Bullock and Reynolds is spot on.  Chaos and comedy throughout with a charming ending make this a great movie.
B00006EXDM|5.0|Hey, in 2009 no one, including this reviewer, NEEDS to comment on the fact that The Rolling Stones, pound for pound, have over forty plus years earned their place as the number one band in the rock `n' roll pantheon. Still, it is interesting to listen once again to the guys when they were at the height of their musical powers (and as high, most of the time, as Georgia pines). This period from 1964 to 1971, moreover, unlike let us say Bob Dylan who has produced more creative work for longer, is the `golden era\\" of the Stone Age. While this CD has the rather definitive selection of \\"greatest hits' from this period so there are no bad tracks here the stick outs are \\"Gimme Shelter\\"( as always), \\"Street Fighting Man\\", \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\", \\"Under My Thumb\\" and \\"Ruby Tuesday\\"

B001PJRAUS|3.0|This movie had a lot going for it: great acting, interesting premise and nice blending of book dialogue and movie script.  Also, I was happy to see a reunion of Jemima Roper (Amanda Price) and Christina Cole (Miss Bingsly) from [[ASIN:B000OIOOVY Hex - The Complete First Season]].  I liked the nod to Colin Firth's Darcy [[ASIN:B00005MP58 Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E, 1996)]].  Unfortunately, all the pieces of this movie did not fit seamlessly enough to warrant more stars.<br /><br />The premise is interesting: a modern woman who adores reading [[ASIN:1848373104 Pride and Prejudice (Arcturus Classics)]] over and over again finds Elizabeth Bennet in her shower.  Apparently, there is a portal to fictional Regency in Amanda's bathroom.  Amanda walks in Elizabeth's shoes like she always dreamed. But things soon become complicated when characters in the novel do not act as Jane Austin intended.  Amanda tries her best to fix things and the movie moves along at a jaunty pace.  Purist will not like how Jane Austin's classic is jumbled by Amanda.<br /><br />Things start to fall apart at the end. Time portals start popping up all over and characters travel between the two at will.  A character's \\"need\\" drives the time portals but it becomes too sloppy a device for me.  The way Amanda kept pulling 21st century items, as needed, from her clothing seemed a bit much.  The ending was also problematic.  SPOILER:  Having those characters switch places without addressing the consequences felt like cheating.

Still, it is interesting to listen once again to the guys when they were at the height of their musical powers (and as high, most of the time, as Georgia pines). I would note, looking through the songs on this CD that a few of them are no longer on a Stones concert play list. Sure, \\"Brown Sugar\\", \\"Wild Horses\\" and \\"Sway\\" are in play. Yet some of the other work is still very powerful, if too drug-related to be \\"musically correct\\" today. If you want to hear \\"Sister Morphine\\" or \\"Dead Flowers\\" I guess you'll have to dust off the old CD (or download). A nice touch though, reflecting their blues roots, is the cover of Mississippi Fred McDowell's \\"You Gotta Move\\". I might add that the royalties from that cover helped old Fred with some medical operation that he needed. You've gotta move, indeed.
1582701709|2.0|This book could be somewhat of an inspiration, but most of the concepts within I've already read in the Bible. (Ask, Believe, Receive). It just supplants \\"God\\" with the \\"Universe\\". The book has nothing groundbreaking in it-it's mostly about positive thinking and manifesting things with thought. I'd simply recommend being more positive and expecting good things in life.
B000PKG6TE|2.0|like most of you, i LOVED songs for the deaf, and i enjoyed lullabies to paralyze enough to buy  era vulgaris. but when i got it home and started listening, i was thoroughly disappointed.i'll admit,some of the songs have a certain appeal that grows on you the more you listen. especially the first two:turning on the screw and sick sick sick. another halfway decent song is suture up your future. the only 2 good songs on the album are make it wit chu (a great song) and 3's and 7's (my favorite queens song.) but everything else is an obscure attempt at pushing artisitic creativity to the point where the album just becomes bad.i give this album 1 and a half stars.do NOT buy it.no matter how much you love the band.
0307588335|5.0|This book is a must read accounting of a financial tragedy that needed to be told.  The accuracy of the writting and the way the story was told made it understandable even to those that are less financially astute.  It is a story of pure greed on the part of the Lehman executives that resulted in the ruination of tons of ordinary folks.  This book reads like a fictional financial thriller but the only problem is that it is a true story.

B000HT3P7E|5.0|How I Met Your Mother is a blend of some other shows, such as Friends or Seinfeld, but to me takes the good points of each of those shows and makes it's own type of show.    It centers on Ted (the semi neurotic architect), Barney (the ladies man business man), Robin (a local newscaster) and the married couple Marshall (lawyer) and Lily (teacher).    Through flashbacks and hints on \\"How I Met Your Mother\\" that starts and ends the shows to introduce and summarize the shows, with some twists, the group find themselves in sometimes awkward and usually very funny situations.  Though it could quickly turn into strained comedy, it somehow avoids all of that and makes each episdode humorous as the back story to why each charactor is acting or reacting in a certain way gets filled in.    Very enjoyable show, with some overtones of other comedies without being a clone and manages to establish its own identity.
B0026RHR6K|4.0|I think a lot of people are getting too held up on the box. Yes, it's bulky but it's hardly the first case of a series set that looks cool but a bit hard to fit on the shelf (the \\"Family Guy Stewie Head\\" and \\"Charmed Book of Shadows\\" come to mind) and a lot of shows are pretty large in size (West Wing, Sopranos, Gilmore Girls, Stargate). It may be wider but length-wise it's about the same as all six season sets together so it's not a huge push. BSG always stood out so why not a set that does the same?     The disc sets are nicely done with each season in its own seperate holder and nice to have seasons 2 and 4 all together. Yes, it's annoying that Universal couldn't put in a guide but it's hardly a dealbreaker. Simply get a couple dozen inexpensive DVD envelopes, label each with the disc contents and problem solved. When \\"The Plan\\" comes out, just slide it into its own envelope to fit as well. For those who think that the lack of \\"Plan\\" and the \\"Face of the Enemy\\" webisodes is proof that Universal is putting out another set later this year, that's a bit of a leap. Sure, they've double-dipped before (\\"Razor\\" on the 4.0 set) but these things aren't exactly cheap to produce and putting out a second box set would be a bit much. Edward James Olmos has said \\"The Plan\\" won't be the last BSG movie so likely they'll put out more.     The fact is, it's the content that matters and we get plenty of it. Sure, it'd be nice to have additional bonus stuff like some of those nice Sci-Fi specials or cast interviews but what we get is still terrific. All four seasons with commentaries for every ep, extended eps at several places and more. BSG remains one of the single more brilliant and inventive shows ever created and that alone makes this set worthwhile. The acting, the effects and more, all in pitch perfect picture and sound If you've waited, like I, to get it all together instead of spread out and split among a half dozen boxes, this is the perfect set for you. A bit bulky yes but to get to such genius, it's worth a bit of effort.
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|I had an older 10-B that used an Algebraic input method, after spilling coffee on it, it died (lasted 12 years).  This machine has the ability to toggle between Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) and Algebraic, very nice since I am still getting use to the RPN.  This made buying the machine very easy since all the formulas I used on the 10-B I could use on the 12C Platinum.  So to sum up, when I get frustrated with RPN I just switch over and everything works fine. These are high quality machines that should last for decades so well worth the investment.
B0001I561E|5.0|Thanks so much for sending the Aladdin movie.  I first watched it years ago when my daughter was small.  It's great to see that it is still funny after all these years!    The package arrived very timely and in great condition.
1400063736|4.0|This book grabbed me from the first chapter, and I was annoyed when the narrative abruptly dropped the first story line and picked up another, seemingly unrelated one. Then, I got absorbed in that story line, and again, an abrupt shift to yet another one. Over the course of the book, the connections among characters gradually became clearer, and these shifts no longer annoyed me, although there were times when it was rather difficult to figure out what was going on as the story took such frequent sharp twists and turns. The device of the tightrope walker is a clever one, connecting seemingly disparate characters together despite the vast size of the city and its enormous population. They all have this shared experience of the twin towers tightrope walker.<br /><br />The descriptive language is very poetic and moving, and the author captures 1970's New York very accurately with impressive attention to detail. The story of the tightrope walker's walk between the Twin Towers set up a tone of foreboding, given what would happen in September 2001, and I half expected this to be a major plot point as the story progressed. The characters, though they appear for such brief times, are well-drawn, and as a reader I cared what happened to them, though no one character could receive an extensive plot line due to the format of the story.

0061231401|3.0|As a die-hard Rollins fan, I eagerly grabbed this book within weeks of it's release. The plotline revisited some of my favorite characters, including the mysterious Seichan. I was hoping for a resolution of the Grey/Seichan romance, but I will warn any potential readers that the resolution is a bit of a grey area (drum riff).<br /><br />The plotline of this entry focuses on an influential owner of a bioengineering company who has plans to \\"save\\" the world through controversial means as well as following along with Grey & company as they try to find a long lost \\"Doomsday Key\\" that is very much desired by Sigma's rival group the Guild. Grey has more than one thing on his mind as he has to figure out the clues as well as figure out his relationship dynamics with his previous lover Rachel as well as the enigmatic Seichan. (Well, first he has to figure out whether or not he can TRUST Seichan.)<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed the book but I will admit that there were one or two points that seemed to be a bit of a lull. Mostly the \\"in between\\" scenes that were necessary to move the plot to the next part. I enjoyed learning more about Seichan but I found the whole Grey/Rachel/Seichan dynamics to be a little wearing at times & I didn't really feel any romantic sparks between Grey & Rachel in this book. (Then again, that may have been the author's intent for the relationship to be more of a desperation thing than a romance thing.)  I did particularly enjoy Kowalski in this book. He's a meathead & a grunt, but he's great comic relief. It was a relief to have some plot movement with the Guild plot arc since that's something that has been dragged out for a while now. There is a bit of an ambiguous ending of sorts, but it's entertaining to think of the possibilities that could open up in the future.  In the end though, this just wasn't Rollins' strongest novel in the Sigma series. He's written far better than this. It's not enough to put me off the series, but it's enough to make me admit that this will disappoint some readers.<br /><br />Now I do have to put a disclaimer down. If you have never read any of the Sigma novels in the past, this is not the book to start with. While the bigger part of the plot is somewhat self contained, the overlying plot arcs & character dynamics will more than likely befuddle anyone who has no knowledge of anything that's happened before.

B001PPLJIQ|3.0|If you mixed Robert Mulligan's [[ASIN:B00005U2KD Summer of '42]] with Stanley Kramer's [[ASIN:B0002CR04A Judgment at Nuremberg]], you could likely come up with a melodramatic hybrid as lugubrious as this 2008 drama about post-WWII moral ambiguity and obsession. Adapted by playwright David Hare ([[ASIN:B00005OCJZ Plenty]]) from Bernhard Schlink's critically acclaimed 1995 novel, the film directed by Stephen Daldry ([[ASIN:B00005JKTI The Hours]]) offers the veneer of an important subject in reflecting upon the years-later psychological aftermath of the Holocaust.  The source book deals with the difficulties which subsequent generations have in comprehending the scope and magnitude of the war crimes However, the screenplay focuses more squarely on the passionate affair that develops between Hanna Schmitz, an enigmatic, controlling woman in her mid-thirties, and Michael Berg, an impressionable fifteen-year-old student in 1958 Berlin.<br /><br />The film begins well enough when the focus is primarily on these two characters with Hanna calling upon Michael to read to her during their discreet afternoon meetings. The affair ends abruptly, and he doesn't see her again until six years later when she goes on trial with several other women for contributing to the murder of 300 Jews while she was serving as an SS guard at Auschwitz. The plot turns on a key revelation that is quite obvious from the early scenes, yet it is at this point when the film loses momentum considerably. Daldry's excessive jumbling of the timeline does not help either in overcoming the increasingly convoluted storyline which has the older Michael conveying a deep sense of conflict over Hanna when she is found guilty and serves a life sentence.<br /><br />Making good cinema out of such introspection poses a challenge. We are meant to empathize with a man who is torn between protecting the subject of his youthful ardor and withdrawing from the horror of the crime for which she accepts accountability. When the plot threads wrap together with the characters' fates sealed, there is a pervasive sense of emptiness since Daldry and Hare cannot move us emotionally beyond the elliptical nature of Hanna and Michael's relationship. This leaves the principal actors to fill in the gaping holes. In response, Kate Winslet gives a strong, nuanced performance as Hanna, foregoing much of her glamour to track the oblique character over three decades of stoic concealment. German actor David Kross is genuinely affecting as Michael, and he brings the necessary vulnerability and eagerness to make more palatable the controversial sex scenes with Winslet. Ralph Fiennes has the diabolically difficult role of the older, haunted Michael, who must come to terms with his unresolved feelings toward Hanna. He is given precious little latitude to flesh out an obviously pained character.<br /><br />Give credit to Daldry and Hare, however, for attempting to tread a fine morality line in presenting a character whose sense of duty to the Nazis did not end up defining her life. At the same time, they fall short in dramatically connecting her lack of rehabilitation with the broader question of responsibility and culpability for the Holocaust. There are plenty of extras on the 2009 DVD beginning with five separate featurettes. The first is the standard \\"making of\\" puff piece with the cast and crew discussing the characters and the production, while another is a ten-minute interview with Kross and Daldry about the young actor's casting. Winslet is spotlighted primarily for the make-up and prosthetics she had to don as the aging Hanna. Two shorts focus on Nico Muhly's haunting soundtrack and Brigitte Broch's meticulous production design. The theatrical trailer is also included, although the best extra is a run of deleted scenes, 42 minutes in total, which provide added context for some of the more elliptical turns of the story.wrap together with the characters' fates sealed, there is a pervasive sense of emptiness since Daldry and Hare cannot move us emotionally beyond the elliptical nature of Hanna and Michael's relationship. This leaves the principal actors to fill in the gaping holes. In response, Kate Winslet gives a strong, nuanced performance as Hanna, foregoing much of her glamour to track the oblique character over three decades of stoic concealment. German actor David Kross is genuinely affecting as Michael, and he brings the necessary vulnerability and eagerness to make more palatable the controversial sex scenes with Winslet. Ralph Fiennes has the diabolically difficult role of the older, haunted Michael, who must come to terms with his unresolved feelings toward Hanna. He is given precious little latitude to flesh out an obviously pained character.    Give credit to Daldry and Hare, however, for attempting to tread a fine morality line in presenting a character whose sense of duty to the Nazis did not end up defining her life.

B000YIGNKE|1.0|Sally Hawkins was either poorly cast or poorly directed in this production of \\"Persuasion\\".  I wonder that the producer did not notice that she had her mouth open all the time!<br />And where were the people who were supposed to check for accuracy?  For instance, Anne was getting undressed when she heard the hullaballoo over her cousin falling out of a tree (at night????)- that late???) She greeted her brother-in-law without a dress on, only her undergarments showing!  Another example, in the last 10 minutes of the film, Anne ran all over Bath???  Young woman of that age (27), that period (and later) and that social status (sister of a very snooty baronet) did NOT run after they were \\"out\\". It would have shown a serious lack of breeding and composure, and it would have opened her up to all sorts of societal disapproval and shunning.  Elizabeth, her sister was quite plain.  In the book she is clearly very beautiful.  RPJ was wooden (I prefer the Ciaran Hines version of Wentworth).  Even though many scenes were shot in Bath (the Crescent was gorgeous) and Lyme, the repeated scenes of landed young men and women walking along the breakwater with the water going up over their heads was not believable.<br />Altogether, it was a disappointment and I got rid of it.  Not worth keeping, not even for an avid Austen fan!
0307120007|5.0|It was the first book my now-grown daughter thought of as her own when she was 8 months old, and 22 years later, I just gave a copy to a mother-to-be at her shower. Some may find it more appealing as a book for girls than for boys.
B002CAWNEM|1.0|Want to see a supremely watered down version of Fatal Attraction?  If so, look no further than Obsessed, a potboiler that holds back much more than it succeeds in terms of being a potboiler.  The Wire's Idris Elba stars as a successful corporate man who also plays loving family man to his wife (Beyonce Knowles), and soon becomes the target of psychotic young temp (Heroes' Ali Larter).  Wholly predictable and cliche, Obsessed is mind numbingly dull from beginning to end, but I guess this is the kind of thing that passes for suspense these days that mainstream audiences seem to eat right up.  Elba is disappointing wasted in his role, while Knowles and Larter do their respective parts at looking gorgeous, and doing nothing else as well.  All in all, Obsessed is something that you could easily save yourself a few brain cells by not giving the time of day, and spending your viewing time on something more worthwhile.
0312360266|2.0|I'm 24 years old and I didn't think I would be interested in reading a young adult book like \\"Twilight\\", but after all the fuss, I finally decided to buy the whole collection and read it.  I loved the books so much that when I finished all the books, I was looking for more books like \\"twilight\\" and maybe more adult.  I was referred by many, to read \\"marked.\\"     I don't think \\"Marked\\" is for anyone over 18 years old because the book pretty much takes place in your typical stereo typed high school(with the popular, the losers, the outcast, bullies, etc), and the difference is instead of human students, there vampire students in training.      The story plot is mild with your typical high school problems plus a few vampire world problems. There were a few parts in the book where great amount of details where I could almost live it, otherwise the rest of of the book, I felt like I was just reading with no pictures in my mind.      \\"Marked\\" was not a book for me, not because it was bad, but simply that I couldn't connect with the main character to really get into the book.
B0028SVXR6|5.0|I was a little skeptical when I first picked up this CD.  The Mars Volta is one of those bands that one can easily classify as \\"all over the place\\" or \\"crazy.\\"  They're a not-so-accessible tour de force of maniacal percussion, guitars, and screaming vocals.  They take a long time to appreciate, but eventually, after your brain manages to sift through the layers of complexity of chaos, a beautiful and impressive scenery often emerges that was previously invisible and unrelatable.    This album is far more subdued, hence the skepticism.  It's difficult to call any territory \\"familiar\\" to the Mars Volta, but this album surely treads into calmer and more unfamiliar waters than ever before.  Sure, it's a bit more poppy and classically-structured (often with the verse-chorus-verse, etc.)--but man, are these tunes awesome.  The opener, \\"Since We've Been Wrong\\" is laid back, emotional, and gives such an adrenaline rush when the drums finally kick in at the 5-minute mark that you know you're in for a ride.  Teflon kicks in with a radio-friendly up-tempo beat with all around great singing and energy.  Halo of Nembuttals is one that slowly grew on me as the time passed--I'd call it one of my favorites now.  The melody is one that I first found slightly annoying, yet soon realized I couldn't get it out of my head--and now I love it.    The next tune, With Twilight As My Guide, introduces how good The Mars Volta is at writing slow songs.  The two standouts on the album--this tune and the later Copernicus--are very slow but so full of emotion and build so well that you'll be playing it on repeat for days.  Juxtaposed with the accessible \\"Desparate Graves\\" and the album closer Luciforms--this album really holds a pleasing mix of slow, fast, and medium-paced songs.  The more I've listened, the more each tune continues to impress me.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Christmas love stories, entertaining, enjoyable, a feel good movie. I'm glad i bought this movie.
0887307280|4.0|I bought this book because it was recommended by the person who was helping me do a tune up for my business.  I never would have purchased it on my own because the title led me to believe it was about misconceptions people have about the internet.  I'm glad I did read it because it lays out the essential things every small business owner has to have in place to be successful.
B000088E77|5.0|This is a great album.  Got it for \\"Down Under\\" and was pleased to find the rest of the album was as good, if not better.  This is a classic 80s band.  They were a complete package of songs and performance.  Colin Hay is a great writer and singer.  If you're like me and liked \\"Down Under\\" or their singles, you will like the rest of this album.  Great pop music that sounds as good today as it did 20+ years ago.
B001CISHU4|3.0|I love Amon Amarth. With Oden On Our Side is my favorite death metal album ever, and the rest of their back catalog is either pretty good or incredible.<br /><br />For me, though, Twilight just wasn't as good as I was hoping it would be, and boy did I hope. I really, REALLY wanted to say this is a good album, but it just did not capture the same feel and intensity that the rest of the band's work did.<br /><br />The album starts off great. The title track is easily on par with, if not better than, the best of the band's music. It's in your face, loud, and just works, telling the tale of Thor's final battle during Ragnarok. Then of course there's Roope's solo. I only don't like its inclusion because it causes the sound to change when they play it live, but that's a small thing that can be overlooked, and it's also not to say it's a great solo, because it is. I saw them play it, and it was still a great set opener.<br /><br />But then comes \\"Free Will Sacrifice\\" and already the album's power, quality, greatness, etc. begin to diminish. Compared to the song that came before it, \\"Free Will\\" sounds remarkably weak. It reminds me of how \\"Where Death Seems To Dwell\\" seemed a rather weak second track on Fate of Norns, especially coming right after the brilliant song that is \\"An Ancient Sign of Coming Storm.\\"<br /><br />\\"Guardians of Asgaard\\" has become quite the fan favorite these days. I feel that this song is also weak as a whole, but it has an excellent chorus and solo (nice, soft, and slow, but it works).  The chorus is probably one of their best but the rest of the song feels too slow and generic. I really, REALLY wish that they could've done the rest of it so much better than it actually is.<br /><br />\\"Where Is Your God?\\" is one of my favorites on the album. The gallop beat is awesome and reminds me of an army of vikings on horseback in battle against their enemies. It's not another \\"Death in Fire\\" or \\"Pursuit of Vikings,\\" but for what it's worth it's a really good song.<br /><br />About the only other songs I really enjoyed were \\"The Hero\\" and \\"Embrace Of The Endless Ocean.\\" The latter feels like an appropriate closer. It really reminds me of the closer on their last album, \\"Prediction of Warfare,\\" and also \\"Fate of Norns.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Hero\\" sounds almost ballad-like and rather soft for the Norsemen, but it truly captures the feeling of what a warrior/soldier/etc. feels and endures during their lives. How can one truly believe these people never feel a sort of pain or guilt for people they kill in war? This song is about one such man, who calls himself \\"an evil man\\" for killing as he did, yet the title implies everyone else thinks he is a hero and he is about to lose their lives for their well being.<br /><br />All the other songs, though, feel like a mess, especially compared to their other albums. Many others will enjoy it (it's obvious this point has already been proven judging by both the star rating this album currently holds and that a user poll on AOL Radio listed this album as one of the top 10 death metal albums of all time) and if you like Amon Amarth's other stuff or just like death metal as a whole, give the album a try.<br /><br />There's enough here to satisfy new fans to get them ready for the band's earlier material, so it's also a great place for listeners to start. If you like this one, try one of the three albums that came before this one, With Oden On Our Side, Fate Of Norns, or Versus The World, then continue backwards from there. If you like the brutal viking metal end of this, I also recommend Borknagar, Enslaved, Immortal, early Satyricon, and Bathory (Blood Fire Death, Hammerheart, Blood On Ice, and their two Nordland albums). For simply the pagan viking genre overall, try Falkenbach (about half of their songs also fit the brutal category above), Tyr, Ensiferum, Leaves' Eyes, 3 Inches of Blood, and Therion (particularly their Secret of the Runes and Gothic Kabbalah albums).ong.<br /><br />About the only other songs I really enjoyed were \\"The Hero\\" and \\"Embrace Of The Endless Ocean.\\" The latter feels like an appropriate closer.

0061231401|5.0|My first Rollins book and I loved it. 'DaVince Code', was basically, 'Foucault's Pendulum For Dummies'. This one goes into historical depth but never leaves you wanting less. Rollins is a great adventure/action writer. You get an intriguing history lesson along with a roller coaster of an action novel. Every character has a personality that keeps you interested in each of their trials and tribulations. The biotech stuff is amazing.<br /><br />I will definitely read more James Rollins.<br /><br />PS. I loved Dan Brown's, 'Deception Point'. I think it's one of his best.
0446402397|4.0|If Tom Rob Smith can continually meet the standard he set in this novel, he can be the fictional chronicler of 1950s USSR in the way Alan Furst is for 1930s Europe.  Child 44 is absolutely brutal in its depictions of the Ukrainian famine Stalin generated in the 1930s (the Prologue) and the depraved culture of the Soviet Union in the 1950s (the remainder of the novel).  As a piece of period fiction, this is chilling.      The plot is not extraordinary -- investigator tries to catch serial child killer.  But the background makes the story: the investigator Leo Demidov is an MGB (KGB predecessor) agent and war hero whose dedication to the state should have been unquestionable . . . except he was good at his job and lived in the Stalin era.  After his demotion and disgrace, he is transferred to an industrial town and obtains evidence of a serial killer.  But there is no crime in Soviet Union workers' paradise.  And there is no serial killer who could be a respectable job holder.  And there is no unsolved murder of the numerous children who were found eviscerated in the snows.      With his former rival in the MGB trying to arrange his death, and the State incapable of any investigation of the crimes he discovered, and the killer preying upon children in startling numbers, Smith crafts an interesting thriller.  Add the character of Stalin's Soviet Union to the mix and a semi-routine catch-the-killer race to the finish becomes interesting on many more levels.    Nice debut for Smith.
B000WS4QJG|4.0|I had an LP of \\"Thriller\\" years ago when it came out, but over the years I stopped playing it and eventually sold it at a garage sale. Now, I'm glad I bought the anniversary CD, which has a bonus DVD showing MJ's amazing moon-dance performance of \\"Billie Jean\\" at the Motown awards, plus music videos of that song, \\"Beat It\\" and \\"Thriller.\\" Despite his personal troubles, Michael was an amazing performer. The only quibble I have with this set is the updated versions of several of his hits with more contemporary rap artists. I know I'm showing my age, but I strongly prefer the original versions.

B000002LFZ|5.0|I also own the two-CD greatest hits collection of Fleetwood Mac, but I prefer this one. It has their best songs on it, and I like the order in which they're arranged. They're still one of my favorite bands of all time.
B0029LCRCC|5.0|The band behind Steel Panthers has gone through many name changes but their music never did. Its an 80s sound meets Biker Joe Warren topics but is catchy. Certainly not something to be playing around the family, but it will make you laugh your a** off for a long time. The topical flavor in Death to All but Metal is hilarious, and really does explain the music industry in a nutshell. Its a shame you can't pick up this CD without paying import prices, but its worth it.
044661758X|5.0|The \\"Condrete Blond\\" was very exciting and is one of the best Bosch books.  I am sending it to my friends who have not read Michael Connelly yet. It has a good, interesting, and believable plot and is full of suspense.  Loved it.
B000WCBPOG|4.0|Having found the movie surpisingly good, I had to get the soundtrack. Some of the remakes on this CD are as catching and enjoyable as the originals were. Well worth the price.
B002IKLZZY|5.0|Without question, 1959's \\"North by Northwest\\" is one of the greatest films from one of the great directors and maybe THE greatest director. A favorite plotline of Hitchcock involves the \\"Wrong Man\\" falsely accused of crimes he did not commit. Cary Grant plays Roger Thornhill who is not Mr. Kaplan and Eva Marie Saint playing a Grace Kelly like part. James Mason is excellent as the suave villain and fine support comes from Landau and Carroll. The story moves at a very brisk pace and there are some justifyably famous scenes in the movie.  The really impressive thing is that you can watch the movie over and over and still be fascinated by the story, the scenes, the perforamnces and the direction. A great director in his prime and an all time great movie.
B0028SVXR6|4.0|I like all Mars Volta albums, but after the monster \\"Bedlam\\" Octahedron falls a little bit flat. TMV are known for their strong and touching ballads and I was excited to hear that they will come back with a slower album. It's enjoyable, but there is no \\"wow \\" song on it. It's just very good.  Omar just got this  new album \\"Cryptomnesia\\", the most aggressive and unusual music he and Cedric have ever recorded. I absolutely loved it and actually strongly recommend to TMV fans which are open to their craziness.
0393312836|5.0|I first heard about A Clockwork Orange around my college campus, a banned book made to film by the great Stanley Kubrick.  The movie poster presented a violent psychedelic trip from the 60's, and I was deeply intrigued, immediately attending a showing during the weekend.  That experience prompted me to find the book as soon as possible.  The author Anthony Burgess writes in his introduction (and this is paraphrasing) that he makes no affiliation to Kubrick's interpretation, and rightly so.  This edition of the work contains the 21st chapter that was originally cut from printing and later in the film adaptation.  Unjust!  Reality takes the grand finale in the life of the \\"humble narrator, Alex\\" and the 21st chapter symbolizes the natural change from adolescence into adulthood, deep into the unknown.  It does not provide hope, only speculation, as Alex finds futility in the \\"shopcrasting\\" and \\"ultraviolence\\".  This is the real \\"horrorshow\\", this edition and comments from it's \\"humble\\" author.  Enjoy the \\"old in-and-out\\" Burgess works on your mind and the classic language \\"Nasdat\\" as you read about Alex, the clockwork orange.
0553296981|5.0|What more can be said about this universally acclaimed literary masterpiece? The wonder continues to be that it was written by a young teenage girl, who was simply honest, no-nonsense, and exceptionally eloquent about the horrific circumstances which she had to endure. The everyday concerns of this young girl, which are so typical of any girl her age in any time period, persist despite the looming horror.<br /><br />Anne's phenomenal writing talent shows through in every sentence and makes the reader cringe, weep, and even rage that she was denied the opportunity to pursue her dreams of a writing career. What a loss to the world. But what a gift we have in this timeless, exquisitely written journal of an ordinary girl in a very extraordinary situation.<br /><br />Sarah Bruce Kelly<br />Author of THE RED PRIEST'S ANNINA
B001UDYI9K|1.0|My favorite tracks from the collected Alan Parsons Project CDs are nearly all sung by Eric Woolfson. However if you're expecting a lost Parsons Project CD (as the title implies,) you'll be sorely disappointed here.<br /><br />I'd expected to find at least an alternate version of \\"Time,\\" an acoustic version of \\"Don't Answer Me,\\" or like Alan did on his CD A Valid Path; an electronic version of \\"The Raven.\\" What I got instead in my opinion, were under/over produced original album discards and show tunes that gave me nothing that even vaguely resembled The Project, except for that long craved-for voice.<br /><br />In addition The Alan Parson Project CDs at least had an underlying concept, which is completely lacking here unless you consider songs recorded over the years but rejected for cause as a valid theme. APP CDs also had that infamous wall of sound that carries you thorough from the beginning to the end of each song that's sorely lacking here. On some tracks of this CD you can actually feel the empty space between the words<br /><br />Any casual fan (despite a sort of doubting bitter denial in the liner notes) knows of Eric Woolfson's essential contribution, voice and name to the APP since it's inception with Tales of Mystery and Imagination.<br /><br />From the liner notes:<br /><br />Interviewer: \\"As you are the creator and writer of The Alan Parsons Project, and sometimes lead singer, why is it not called `The Eric Woolfson Project'? Or perhaps the `Parsons/Woolfson Project'?\\"<br /><br />Woolfson: \\"I describe the decision to call it `The Alan Parsons Project' as both the best and the worst decision of my career. The best, because I have enjoyed the benefits of the APP success without having to deal with public recognition and media attention. The worst because outside my family and friends, few people have any idea of who I am or what I do, which is a price, I have always felt, was worth paying.\\"<br /><br />The above makes Woolfson come off as a bitter ex-wife, and this CD is a perfect explanation as to why they were called the Alan Parsons Project. Any fan would resent the fact that the above implies that Alan had nothing to do with the creation of the band by the use of \\"the creator\\" instead of \\"one of the creators.\\" If he'd simply titled this CD Eric Woolfson... My Latest Solo Effort instead, I wouldn't have anticipated another version of the Parsons Project and maybe it would be more readily acceptable... or at least palatable. But getting my hopes up for the \\"Alan Parsons Project that never was\\" in my opinion is at best false advertising.<br /><br />At least when Alan continued on, after Eric left in 1990 to write stage musicals, Parsons re-branded the band simply Alan Parsons. You knew his new efforts would be similar, but you weren't expecting the same essence you'd previously become comfortable with.<br /><br />As you listen to this compilation, one thing will quickly become crystal clear; The Alan Parsons Project without either Parsons or Woolfson is like being asked to eat a peanut butter and jelly sandwich without one of the two essential ingredients between the bread. While you'd be willing to eat either without the other, and both are digestible, it's just not as good if you've tasted both together previously. To be fair, I thought the exact same thing about Alan Parson's CD A Valid Path. The majority of that CD is great until he tried to re-imagine such classics as the aforementioned \\"The Raven\\" by subtracting Woolfson's contribution to it.<br /><br />Woolfson has presented here instead (as the liner notes make clear) a studio version of a high school produced stage play entitled, \\"Applaud me, for I am the unsung hero!\\" Instead of envisioning the music in your head as you listen to it, in its place you see Woolfson standing alone on an empty barren stage with no one in the audience. No more so than on the track \\"Someone In The Audience\\" where the request is made to ring the curtain down on him in the middleof his performance.<br /><br />So let's get down to the particulars:<br /><br />The first thing that hits you within seconds is that Eric's voice isn't being \\"doubled\\" as it was on the APP CDs, which means every wavering, strained or struggled note that he sings stands out like a sore thumb. Doubling is the studio effect of the singer singing with himself smoothing out the rough edges. Because of the lack of this one single effect that warm comforting and beautiful voice of his that you loved and instantly recognize comes off as just old and tired.<br /><br />For example, on \\"The Golden Key\\" I actually winced in pain when his voice cracked twice delivering the line \\"...no one promised me an island in the sun\\". Some songs are delivered in a pace that is so slow; you can almost imagine the track being dragged across the floor with a 200-pound concrete block chained to it. On several tracks he tries to sing either far above or far below his vocal range. \\"Along The Road\\" is delivered with the strain of a first tenor trying to sing the part of a second bass. The effect is so distracting that it's impossible to distinguish that it's actually Woolfson singing it, making it difficult to enjoy or comprehend the song.<br /><br />In fact it's nearly impossible to enjoy or comprehend this entire body of work. If you're planning to purchase this CD because you're a fan of Woolfson's post APP work and/or his stage musicals, you'll probably be delighted.<br /><br />All music and lyrics here are by Eric Woolfson. He produced this compilation too and it shows because without the balancing influence of Alan Parsons to refine it and apparently his ego, it in my humble opinion falls flat on its face.<br /><br />My general response to this volume of work would be to re-title it, The Alan Parsons Project That Never Was... and for truly good reason!<br /><br />A classic and long-gone cartoon series called BLOOM COUNTY had a penguin named Opus who did movie reviews for the local paper. I'd like to think he would've used his famous tag line on this CD: \\"...Well, maybe it wasn't THAT bad, but Lord it wasn't good!\\"of his performance.<br /><br />So let's get down to the particulars:<br /><br />The first thing that hits you within seconds is that Eric's voice isn't being \\"doubled\\" as it was on the APP CDs, which means every wavering, strained or struggled note that he sings stands out like a sore thumb.

0307266303|5.0|Being a former distance runner in high school and college and having had an interest in the Tarahumara Indians, a remote tribe of super athletes who I read about in Runner's World and National Geographic, I decided to give this book a try and was not disappointed.  This is one of the few books that I devoured in a short period of time.  I couldn't put it down.    The author takes us into the world of the Tarahumara and ultramarathoners.  The Tarahumara run as a way of life because they have to.  They are shy, soft spoken, and retiring, yet incredibly stoic and tough, both mentally and physically. They are almost the opposite of most modern people who are soft but loud.     Ultramarathoners are considered fringe kooks by alot of people in the sports media and are not given alot of press. They clearly aren't motivated by glory, recognition, or money yet they have their own inner society which is motivated by running for running's sake. They have a different kind of competitiveness.  They compete more with the land and the environment than with eachother. The harsher and more formidable the environment, the more they seem to relish the challenge. How else could you explain running across Death Valley in the heat of summer?  They have a camaraderie which would be difficult for alot of other athletes to understand and they will often sacrifice their own success to help their comrades conquer the landscape.    The climax of the book is when these two groups, the Tarahumaras and ultramarathoners, come together for a race in a remote region of the Sierra Madres, some of the toughest terrain on earth.  The result is a mutual understanding between them which outsiders would never understand.      The author introduces us to characters such as \\"Barefoot Ted\\" and \\"Caballo Blanco\\". I had some doubts about the existence of \\"Caballo Blanco\\", a white guy who lives a hand to mouth existence spending part of the year in the Sierra Madres to run with the Tarahumaras.  However, after doing a little web research of my own, he really exists.  I am convinced that nothing has been fabricated in this book.  The author spares us from any self-aggrandizement yet he is successful in winning the respect of the Tarahumaras and the ultramarathoners.    The author gives alot of insight about running which I don't think running shoe manufacturers would appreciate. Apparently, the more shoe you wear the more injuries you will get.  Running experts might find this interesting if not somewhat provocative.  However, at my age, I'm not about to run barefoot or with tire sandals on concrete and rock trails to test these theories out (neither did the author).    The book inspired me to step up my own running program and include mountain trail running to my regimen.  If I was a younger man with less responsibility, I may even have sought out Caballo Blanco in the Sierra Madre for a run in the canyons.  Who knows, maybe someday (after retirement) I'll get around to it, if I'm still in good shape.

0679420266|4.0|I liked The Stranger, although not quite enough to give it a five star rating.  It's a short novel and the plot itself is quite simple.  I suppose the reason that the novel doesn't warrant five stars (in my humble opinion) is that despite what one reviewer has written, I didn't find it to be especially haunting or challenging.  And that's what I want from a literary novel.  I want it to get under my skin.  I want it to be thought-provoking and insightful and I didn't quite find that with The Stranger (at least not to the degree I would have liked).<br /><br />The Stanger is a fictionalized expression of Camus' philosophy of the absurd.  The tale's hero Meursault (or anti-hero if you like) does not conform to societal norms.  He lives in the present and is influenced almost exclusively by physical experiences rather than emotional ones.  The novel essentially tells us that the choices we make in life are all equally irrelevant and that to try and make sense of the world is simply absurd.<br /><br />I'm not saying that this exploration of absurdist philosophy isn't interesting (certainly it's more engaging than reading essays on the topic).  It's just that it's pretty straight-forward.  In the end, I was entertained by the novel which I found quite captivating.  But it falls short of being truly great (in my mind at least) because it's a little too prescriptive and doesn't allow the reader to interpret the novel and find meaning from it for themselves.<br /><br />If I sound negative, that isn't my intent.  I recommend the novel with a healthy enthusiasm.  It's very good - it's just not exceptional (and in my opinion - neither haunting nor challenging).
B0026OE2NY|1.0|I Know this movie deserves 5 stars. Ok... but why ´not including spanish and portuguese subtittles??? (I work in a National Park in Amazon, I do speak english, but local people here don't, and they really should see it).
B0002F6AH0|5.0|The best American documentary on the big war was only recently made by Ken Burns. This \\"World At War\\" series was made over 30 years ago by some fine British people and it is superb.  It is compelling history with the personal realities and effects upon people of all involved nations seen and heard clearly.    I have some other multi disc collections on WW2 history. These others I have seen and will re-sell them.  This 11 disc set of \\"The World At War\\" I intend to keep for a long time and re-learn its history at least once a year.
0307346617|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this book.  I actually thought it was going to be funny but it's not.  I expected Christopher Moore but it's not that.  It's ironic, clever, suspenseful, and insightful into economics, war, environmental issues, and politics.  My only gripe is that Brooks focuses on the technical details of one too many weapons, tanks, and planes for my taste (those parts might please the boys out there).  A couple other minor issues are that I got bogged down with the details on the introductions of the narrators sometimes.  It slowed down my pace.  Also, the speaking styles of the narrators got on my nerves at times (like Brooks was trying too hard to make them sound normal and modern).<br /><br />A few standout parts include the ONE and only female narrator in the book and her tale of survival with the help of the phantom Mets,  the battle at Yonkers, and the defecting Chinese submarine.  I actually gasped out loud at this one image of hundreds of zombies crawling over the sub in the pitch black at the bottom of the ocean.  Brooks creates great imagery in some scenes.  It is also interesting how Brooks creates a modern post-war world.  For instance, when we have to completely rebuild America, 60% of the population have careers such as &quot;analyst&quot; or &quot;consultant&quot; and they have no tangible skills to help rebuild society.  Therefore, the class system is totally upended.  This book may actually make me want to pick up more zombie fiction in the future, or least more Max Brooks.
B00018TI6I|5.0|This is true rock and roll. I have never given these guys a chance as they were over played. Now that I got it a few years later, I am very impressed. Thanks for bringing a great sound back.
0061231401|2.0|This is one of those really, really bad books.  The characters are bad.  The dialogue is bad.  The plot is bad.  The descriptions are bad.  And any sentence involving romance or sex is beyond bad.<br /><br />However, I give the book 2 stars because some of the topics covered are quite interesting (the Black Madonna, GM seeds, theories about Celtic crosses).  And I learned more about peat bogs than I ever hoped to.<br /><br />I have not read any of his other works, nor will I, so I have no idea if this is typical of Rollins's writing.  If this book is typical, I'd recommend a ghostwriter for future works.  Seriously--Rollins has some good ideas here, but they are just really poorly executed.  With his ideas and a good writer, we might get a really good book.
B001ED7C58|4.0|I was thrilled with my purchase of the \\"Twilight\\" soundtrack with one exception, my favorite song in the movie, \\"Let Me Sign\\" by Rob Pattinson, wasn't included.  I would dearly love to have that song, but I can't seem to find it anywhere!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I am freaking out because this is so good.  I love BBC's period dramas.  This is by far the best I have seen in a long time.  Richard Armitage takes a great turn from a villian in BBC's Robin Hood to the sexy Mr. Thornton.  This is a must watch.
0316044695|5.0|This book was recommended to me by an employee at a bookstore and they read me perfectly. This book is one of those few that you read in a very short period of time, and then recommend to all of your friends. I usually don't read books twice, but this one I will read multiple times.
B001F6TXME|5.0|Great item for taking pictures. I took some excellent delayed shutter photos with my D90 and this. I couldn't have done it without this, but I should point out that I also couldn't have done without my D90 either. This shutter release is simple to use in every way and light to carry. I have even used it for some covert pictures that I wanted to take when I didn't want people to see me handling my camera.<br /><br />Overall, great product, worth the money and really the best way to take really delayed shuttered pictures. Stop reading now and buy it!<br /><br />...please don't tell me you're still reading this, if so, start over at the beginning.
0061231401|5.0|What I admire most about Rollins is that he is a true yin/yang writer.  He's not afraid to give his female characters power, control, lack of morality, the ability to kill and walk away.  All of his characters have flesh and his stories are a roller coaster ride without a safety bar.  This book is no exception.  Be prepared for your heart to race from the first page.  He ping pongs the reader from country to country, bad scenario to worse, fire, flood and mayhem.  It doesn't stop until the end and when you take a deep breath at the end of the ride and are prepared to jump off you find yourself looking for another Rollins novel - you are addicted.  This is a grand book and a wonderful writer.
B002436WFI|3.0|The Colour of Magic is a good effort which will be enjoyed by Disworld fans more than normal people. I won't rehash the plot because other reviewers have already done so. Here is a list of what I found dissapointing about this film.:    1. I was disappointed that Two Flower was not Chinese. It's like being a fan of Charlie Chan books and then when they make the films they cast...er, never mind.    2. Death was superb in Hogfather. Here (Christopher Lee- the Wicker Man) was good, I suppose, but they made an echo of his voice and half played it back over everything he said, the result being you couldn't understand a single thing he said. Didn't anyone LISTEN to this thing before airing it? The same complaint could be made about when the Spell in Rincewind's mind spoke over his voice, also indecipherable. I fear we lost some great lines.    3. One of my favourite characters in the books is the Librarian who was the most disappointing aspect of the film. They turned him into a joke. It was pathetic, really. They put a monkey mask on an actor, a small actor. Hardly comes across as an 800 orangatan. Didn't even \\"ook\\" properly.    Here's what I found excellent about this film:      1. The Patrician played by Jeremy Irons. He was brilliant. His \\"Do not let me detain you\\" was perfection. No one else should ever be allowed to play that role. The pity was he was only in two scenes. Made me long to see one of the more Patrician-rich books.    2. Rincewind (David Jason) was perfect. I didn't care for Rincewind in the books, he just wasn't one of my favourite characters, but after seeing the movie, I have a much greater appreciation for him. Jason did an excellent job pinning down the character.    3. Jean Astin (The Lord of the Rings) did a good job as the optimistic tourist Two Flower despite being a shade unbelievable at times. It's hard to maintain that kind of optimism without coming across all Nell Fenwick*. I suspect that the filmmakers felt that casting the role with a Chinese person who was a foolish tourist would incite too many complaints to the PC Obeisance Department and so cast the role with the only people we're allowed to make fun of anymore, young white men.    4. Cohen the Barbarian (David Bradley) was excellent and just how I pictured him.     5. The sets and costuming are excellent. You could practically smell Ankh-Morpork.    6. The Guilds of thieves, assassins, beggars etc who conspire to steal the luggage from Two Flower were wonderfully cast.     7. Finally, but hardly least, Dear Uncle Terry played a role himself. The author of all the discworld books, Terry Pratchett opened and closed the film. I'm happy to have him be part of his own film in a cameo. Like Alfred Hitchcock, only jollier.    So all in all, I offer 3 stars. If you're a discworld fan, you'll enjoy this. If you're not, why in the disc not?     * oh, and for those who can't figure out who Nell Fenwick is, shame on you, where is your cultural compass? From Dudley DoRight of the Rocky & Bullwinkle Show, of course.
B000TGQDZQ|4.0|If I were to just rate the main vocalist on this album, it would be a solid 5 on every song.  However gifted, to my ears she doesn't do enough to make up for the rest of the flaws.<br /><br />The male vocals are monotonic.  Some people might argue that it was a decision to give \\"a contrast to the beautiful female vocals,\\" however I would say that those vocals need no contrasting whatsoever, and in fact detract from the band's true source of power.  If this band didn't have her we wouldn't even see the album for sale.<br /><br />As someone who's a music aficionado, I also found most of the guitar riffs too \\"nu-metal\\" for the greater majority of the album.  I find it hard to justify the sheer number of open note palm-muted chugs that filled space.  The guitarists know how to shred--they do so on occasion, but opt much more often for the \\"tried and true.\\"<br /><br />There is some good keyboards from time to time, but being someone who has 350+albums of industrial music alone also makes me a little picky on what I consider \\"excellent\\" vs. \\"good\\" or \\"passable.\\"  The keys in *most* songs supply nothing more than a chordal bed, they very rarely harmonize with Ms. Simone.<br /><br />Who happens to be the angel of light to which shines light on this band.  This album is worth buying for her performance alone, I just wish the band would let themselves loose more.  Jansen is capable of much better guitar work.  Shame on him.<br /><br />In short, though I bet die-hard fans will completely disagree with me on this, This album is good, but doesn't deserve \\"great.\\"  (See Kamelot:  Epica)  The band could stand to gain from a bit more improv play and work to increase *all* of their performances so it won't be Simone carrying the whole thing forward.
B000NQRR1Q|4.0|Unlike the modern film makers that rely on special effects and a surplus of sexual provocation to continue their income status, The Ninth Gate is a throw-back or old school visit back to the times when a film had good acting, a solid/interesting plot, and inventive filming techniques (a quality musical score, as well). Roman Polanski lives up to his reputation with this worthy celluloid adventure.    Johnny Depp, Lena Olin, Frank Langella and several other notable actors do an admirable job in playing out this tale that shares intrigue, subtle comedy, and sarcasm. The theme revolves around a ethically-challenged rare book expert, Johnny Depp, that ekes a living by swindling unsuspecting owners from their valuable collections. Eventually, he is retained by a collector to evaluate and establish that his prize piece, a book co-written by Lucifer, himself, is the one and only and that the other two existing books are fakes/copies. Well, let the intrigue begin there and I won't spoil it by providing details. I will say, however, that plot involves such characters as devil worshippers, eccentric debutantes, dubious and unscrupulous book afficianados; all with one thing in common: their desire to obtain these books and the secrets held within.     So all are aware, this film has a lot of aspects to it and is interesting because of that, but it is not a fast paced, blur through events. Polanski spends ample time developing the plot so the viewer understands the issues being researched (the devil is in the details, you know). You will follow along with Mr. Depp's character as he investigates the authenticity of these ancient works and the subversive attempts to corrupt his intentions. If you are as interested as I and you are analytical of nature, you will pick up on some of the interesting foreshadowing and premise for the story. There are some things left unexplained, (I cannot explain them myself until I read the book for which this is based) but that is what is so appealing of this work - some of the plot is obvious, some revolves around comedic purposes, and some remains opaque. Finally, the film is shot on location in Prague, Paris, Spain and several picturesque places.    In every aspect, this film is a worthy view. You will enjoy the quality of each component of a film with The Ninth Gate. There's much to enjoy, just be an appreciate mood while watching. Quality works don't grow on trees in these days...
B001WCBPCW|4.0|Some of the scenester, music critics have panned this album and have focused their negativity on Kasabian's somewhat childish lyrics (what - MGMT, Passion Pit, Vampire Weekends, etc. have so much more mature and better lyrics?) . But what these 'critics' fail to realize, is that the music and beats are so strong and catchy, that it doesn't really matter what they are saying - the music outweighs. Plus, if you are familiar with Kasabian's previous work, then you won't mind the lyrics and like me; actually enjoy and sing along to the songs.<br /><br />\\"Underdog\\" starts the album out strong and aggressive with a sonic and visceral guitar lick that will get your blood boiling and your feet stomping. The second song is a typical Kasabain 4/4 drum beat that will have you playing air-drums and enjoying the catchy and well sung chorus. The rest of the album is just as aggressive and hook-worthy, with a few slower songs scattered throughout. The slower songs might need getting use to but they help diversify the album and get to showcase Kasabian's use of new and different string and percussion instruments.<br /><br />Interesting to note, how the song \\"Fast Fuse\\" somewhat reminds me of the song (mostly the chorus) \\"Out Ta Get Me\\" by Guns N' Roses. Both furious songs have unrelenting lyrics and make no apologies with their primal guitar and drum beats.<br /><br />Fans of Primal Scream's \\"EXTRMNTR\\", GNR's \\"Appetite for Destruction\\", and Kasabian's first album will like this comeback album. Definitely a Top 10 album for 2009. Get loose, get loose!
1423101499|5.0|i realyy like this kind of books and well i really lovedd this one! well the whole collection is one of the best things that has happend to me in a while! that may sound a little exagerated but i swear to god i havent read with that passion since harry potter!
B000ZEE3I6|5.0|The first time I hear Harry Potter'books it was by a friend who bought the book to her son. He has enjoyed the books and my friend too. I have to say I was not convinced. Another friend told me she was delighted to read the books that she borrowed from her nephew. She is a contemplative sister and as I know her I was not surprised. But I have waited to watch the first movie. I have liked all the movies til now.  When the last book was published I decided to buy all the books at once. However, if my mother tongue is French but I decided to buy them in English to enjoy more the books as I watched all the movie in English. I read all the books at once. I enjoyed them a lot. I read them again and again. I watch the available movie again too. The main reason makes me enjoyed Harry Potter is how the author offered us the story of a boy who is growing old in each book. In each book I have seen Harry Potter to act according to his age and no more. When I read the seventh book I was amazed to discover that the adult characters had a life outside of the books. I have started thinking to make the movies in these conditions was a big challenge because only the author has known where and how she wanted to lead us till the end of the story.    I understand that to make a movie with so many characters around Harry Potter is very difficult. And also the size of each book growing like Harry Potter growing older was certainly making the writing of the screenplays quite difficult. That is why I appreciate the Half Blood Prince a lot. It is different from the books but the spirit of the books is respected. The movies offer us another perspective of understanding sometimes. But I do not forget that it is movie language and not book language. The quality of the movie narration is very good. It is difficult to forget for a while the seventh book if you already read it and watching the sixth movie. But if you try watching the movie in the perspective of Harry Potter it becomes very dark with some moments of brief light as the movie director wants.    A last piece of advice go and watch the other movies made by each actors playing adult characters. You will realize how wonderful actors they really are. Even Ruppert Grint.    So enjoy Harry Potter'movie like me. Do not forget you are only sixteen this time and you are full of grieves to lose those you love one by one just like Harry Potter.
0439023483|5.0|This was recommended to me by a friend. My response? I told him recently that I wanted a money back guarantee! Eh, no need. I picked this up, waiting for any excuse to set it aside, and the only excuse I had, was that I just finished it. I've never heard of Suzanne Collins, and the opportunity to read something this good isn't something that happens all the time!<br /><br />Enter the world of Katniss Everdeen, who lives in district 12, which is part of a place that was once North America. Welcome to a world of survival. And welcome to The Hunger Games! Katniss shows great sacrifice by taking the place of her little sister, Prim, entering a fight to the death against other participants. The boy selected from district 12 is Peeta, who Katniss knows only as the baker's boy. They will take on a game of life and death, made up of skill for skill.<br /><br />This is a great story of survival, guts, heart, madness, and even romance at times. Nothing is taken for granted, and alliances are measured heavily!<br /><br />While immediately reluctant to give this a try, I find myself hungry for another helping of what Suzanne Collins will be serving up. Nothing could've prepared me for how good she really is. And when I say that, I could actually put her in a class with Gary Paulsen! That isn't to say that HATCHET has been replaced. But is now has some rather hefty competition. In saying that, there's only one thing that will satisfy the growling in my gut. And that's more HUNGER GAMES in a big, big way!!

B00005QGAV|4.0|&quot;Dangerous&quot; came out at a time when Michael's fame was so in your face you just couldn't escape it. And then, the video for &quot;Black and White&quot; debuts with the infamous temper tantrum and crotch grabbing at the end that really did me in. (But still, I found myself oddly entranced at the boldness of that section of the video. I still find the crotch grabbing really unnecessary. Yet, the temper tantrum....well, remained intriguing). I never liked &quot;Black &amp; White&quot; as a song very much and I still don't. And the face morphing was done more effectively by Diana Ross ironically in her promo video for &quot;Heavy Weather&quot; from &quot;The Force Behind the Power&quot;, her worldwide smash that came out about the same time. The execution of the morphing is not as seamless but infinitely more moving.  I had purchased the very special pop-up package that was quite elaborate. At a distance, the artwork looked like Michael wanted us to believe he was some super-human, god-like even. It was around this time that the press release had gone out to MTV, VH1, BET and all other music outlets dictating that they proclaim him &quot;The King of Pop&quot;. It was all a bit too much. That said, the Teddy Riley-produced tracks on &quot;Dangerous&quot; help to make it edgy and exciting. But I wasn't ready to concede this point in 1991. The chorus to &quot;Jam&quot;  .....&quot;it ain't too much, it ain't too much, it ain't too much for me&quot; caused me to say to myself, &quot;no Michael, it ain't too much, it's just a bit much for me&quot;. The riffs felt like recycled James Brown-licks, which were signature for Michael, hot, but, heard on many of his best hits previously.<br /><br />Though I found ways of escaping &quot;Dangerous&quot;, there would be moments like being in a cab in Rio de Janeiro and hearing the driver playing the CD. I would have to say to myself that it sounds better than I wanted to give it credit. And in a sense, the music from &quot;Dangerous&quot; would haunt me for years to come. Oprah's praise of &quot;Who Is It?&quot; left me feeling a little out of the loop. On the other side, my friends and I would chuckle at the title of &quot;In the Closet&quot; like if indeed we were in the know. The romantic entanglement between Michael and Naomi Campbell was not believable either. But the music kept coming back to haunt me. The 2nd biggest legitimate hit off the album, &quot;Remember the Time&quot; also reminded me of trying to recapture the light airy-ness of &quot;Rock With You&quot;. I still couldn't get the album out of my head though. So finally, as the year's ensued.....his mega-stardom was dimmed considerably, it felt safe to go back and listen to &quot;Dangerous&quot;. (And never forget the super cool pop-up promo package that I have to look at).<br /><br />Now, in his sad transition. I unfortunately, get to listen even more intently. And in that listening, I find that &quot;Dangerous&quot; may be as strong as &quot;Off the Wall&quot;. &quot;Thriller&quot; was great but far too calculated for my epicurean taste. I am completely enamored with the Teddy Riley-produced tracks including &quot;Jam&quot;, &quot;Why You Want to Trip on Me&quot;, &quot;Can't Let Her Get Away&quot; ....love that song right now, love it and the title track. As previously mentioned, &quot;Dangerous&quot; really should be weighed as 2 albums. The Riley tracks ARE the &quot;dangerous&quot; tracks in their brooding, hot rhythms. Vocally, it has always been fascinating how Michael takes the funky adlibs of James Brown and blends in Diana Ross cooing to come up with his own sound. The other tracks are good, some giving the album that &quot;global/world music&quot; feel in &quot;Heal the World&quot; and &quot;Will You Be There&quot;. It is that dichotomy that stops &quot;Dangerous&quot; from being superb. (By the way, the &quot;Dangerous&quot; album is currently not available for purchase as an Mp3 on iTunes or Amazon???). Butif &quot;Dangerous&quot; were a EP featuring only said tracks it would be a 5-star winner in my opinion.<br /><br />It is sad for me personally that it took his passing for me to come full circle and acknowledge that he is/was one of the greatest artists of all time. I have been a fan since Diana Ross &quot;presented&quot; The Jackson 5. I have always loved his melodic chord changes blended with his funkiness. If he had not become so obsessed with being the greatest, he would not have needed to try so hard because he was already there.
B0026OE2NY|5.0|This documentary begins with the beginning: how life and human beings emerged on this wonderful planet, how ecosystems arose that formed the atmosphere, how those ecosystems became more complex, how those ecosystems still serve us today, and what our cultural path has been on this planet.  It all went berserk when we began using fossil fuels, specifically: oil.  Capitalism handled this planet as if its resources were endless.  Forests have been cut.  This way, a lot of species inhabiting them were extinguished.  Fishing has become such an efficient, industrial process, that we are pushing big fishes on the verge of extinction.  We are experts in the destruction of ecosystems and create only waste instead.  Global warming is only one of its consequences.  The face of earth can change very quickly if all methane of Siberia will be released, like is shown in this documentary.<br /><br />Some see this video as a doomsday prediction; I see this video as an urgent call for action.  Personally, I don't believe in governments, since they are all corrupted by Big Corporations, Big Oil in the first place.  They won't do nothing we urgently need to do now.  However, I firmly believe in personal action, and would think of the following :<br /><br />1. Become a vegetarian; in this documentary you will see how the Amazon is being cut to grow the soy needed to feed cows; if you really care for tropical forests, cut on your meat consumption; eating vegetarian also serves your health.  My body is in greater shape now than 5 years ago, when I definitively switched to a vegetarian diet.  Just remember to take a supplement of vitamin B12, which is the only vitamin not found in fruits and vegetables.<br />2. Eat organic vegetables and fruits, bought from a local farmer, preferably through community-supported agriculture.  I would highly recommend other documentaries like [[ASIN:B000BQ5IXM The Future of Food]] and [[ASIN:B000WTVZ3U The Real Dirt on Farmer John]] for a broader perspective.<br />3. Compost all your organic waste at home, and deliver the rest to a recycling scheme.  You can use your compost in a kitchen-garden, or if you're too lazy for this, just put a seed of a cucumber or a pumpkin on ripe compost and you will receive a lot of fruits as a reward;<br />4. Use public transportation (subway, train or bus) as much as possible; who needs a car should consider to buy only a new one when electric vehicles become available again, which will be quite soon.  Next year (2010) a bunch of car manufacturers promised to make them commercially available.  Choose a 100 % electric car, not a hybrid one, since hybrid cars are still equipped with a fossil fuel motor.<br />5. Limit your use of airplanes, since they produce huge amounts of CO2-emissions.<br />6. Install solar panels and solar boilers on your roof, if you're a house owner.<br />7. Build or transform your house following the principles of the solar house, so you don't need central heating.ur organic waste at home, and deliver the rest to a recycling scheme.

B000W1AO0I|5.0|When I purchased this album when it was first released way back when, I had to return it because the vinyl was a little warped. The replacement was also slightly warped and I chalked it up to a manufacturing glitch and bit the bullet. Fast foward to the mid 90's when I found myself at a radio broadcast at Sony Studios in NYC for a performance by Boz Scaggs and Booker T. and the MG's who were both promoting new releases. The gig was on a Sunday, about 9 or 10 AM, not exactly prime time for blues musicians, unless they were up all night long and I suspect that more than one MG was regarding this gig as the last set for Saturday night. After the taping I approached Duck Dunn, bassist on Fathers and Sons and asked if he would be so kind as to autograph the album as I felt that this album was a seminal point in the Blues/Rock music evolution. I handed Duck the album and he looked at me and said, \\" Boy, where did you get that album, I don't even have it!\\" I offered to give Mr. Dunn the record but he kindly refused, thank God. Duck then went on about how the producer told him about a guitarist coming in from NYC, Mike Bloomfield, to work on the record. Duck told the story about the producer telling him that Bloomfield had an insomnia problem. As I recall Duck saying, \\" Man, at that point in time, I didn't even know what \\"coke\\" was, but we found out quick.\\" Classic, classic record, by some of the great characters of the Blues/Soul/Rock era that will never, ever be duplicated. Blues Forever!
0060763280|5.0|The basic proposition of this book is that to obtain your desired outer results, you must first master the inner game of wealth. \\"Secrets of the Millionaire Mind\\" is T Harv Eker's first book and it reached number 1 on the New York Times best-seller list. The first part of the book relates to Eker's own rise, but it is Part Two, \\"17 ways rich people think and act differently from poor and middle class people\\" that readers may find most compelling. As Eker put it bluntly, \\"Anyone who says money isn't important doesn't have any\\". Many people subsconsciously believe that they are not worthy to receive abundance. These people's money blueprint set them up to earn only a certain amount. They will rise to this amount and go no further, since this is the figure they believe they are worth. The trick is to celebrate any money that comes to you and the universe will give you even more. Poor people are focused on spending their money. Rich people are focused on making it.
B000WPDCTE|5.0|At a monthly dinner meeting, a group of intellectuals compete to introduce the greatest fool, but things do not go according to the plan.   Do not be deterred by the French dialog and English subtitles.   After viewing this extremely funny movie, you will rush to share it with your friends.
B001514J6O|5.0|The dvd was in excellent condition; the movie played very well being a very colorful, captivating story centered in an Australian barrier reef. The animation was superb, certainly a movie that is worth watching over and over again. The movie has a good story line, and some very funny and moving moments. It's use of current societal colloquialisms like, \\"Don't hurl on the shell, dude, just waxed it...\\" are charming and more than just a few in the script to enjoy. I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a beautifully colorful diversion that doesn't have any really objectionable violence, nudity, profanity, or sexual content. Excellent for younger audiences, or anyone young at heart... Pixar entertainment at its best!
B001GCUO1Q|1.0|I did not have high hopes for this movie. I knew that for a character with such a murky and tangled backstory that things would have to be simplified for the audience. But I was in no way prepared for it to be caveman stupid. Before I go on I would like to clarify I am writing this, not as a comic fan, but as a film fan.     This movie starts very strong with a well done introduction to wolverine, and sabertooth. We are then treated to an incredibly entertaining segment showing wolverine and sabertooth throughout their very long lives in  extremely awesome battles.     After that we are introduced to Stryker and his team of bad-asses. They put several generations of ninjas to shame, and then the movie ends. After that the movie shifts to Wolverine: the studio version. Wolverine gets his ass handed to him for the majority of the movie whether it be his first beating from sabertooth, or from the horrible soul searingly ineffective final villan weapon 11(sobs) Whyyyyyyyyyyyyy?! Outside of the opening, the action in the movie doesn't hold up well enough to excuse the awful story.     I'm sorry, I lost myself for a minute. Why? Well, the studios were able to get Ryan Reynolds to play deadpool, and he nailed the 5 lines that he was given. After that the next time you see him his mouth has been sewn shut. Not only is that poor writing, but we also lose out on hearing what could have been very clever final battle banter.    If you like action than you should watch Star trek. If you want an actual story Watchmen should fit quite nicely. If you want a movie that seems to forget what little plot it had half way through the movie, and either kills off or maims the majority of it's most interesting characters than X-Men Origins: Wolverine is the film for you!
1416955070|3.0|This summer I noticed a lot of people checking out City of Bones from the library. I'd never picked it up before because the cover and the summary didn't speak to me, but when something gets checked out a lot, that usually means it's good--so I took a copy home. And I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Cassandra Clare, the author, creates a fascinating world within our own, one where demons--more like malicious beings from other worlds; don't think biblical--menace \\"mundanes\\" (regular humans, like Muggles in Harry Potter) and need to be kept under control by Shadowhunters. Faeries wander New York City, vampires party at night, warlocks cast spells, and werewolves change at will.<br /><br />As for the people that populate this world, I love Clare's characters. Clary, the main character and viewpoint of Clare's third-person narration, is a strong and funny female lead. Her best friend, Simon, is witty and nerdy in the most adorable way. Jace, a Shadowhunter and Clary's main love interest of the book, is one of the most entertaining characters I have ever encountered. In fact, practically every character is funny. City of Bones is a very quotable book. Most of the best lines are between Clary and Jace, who have great banter:<br /><br />\\"It's not gray,\\" Clary felt compelled to point out. \\"It's green.\\"<br /><br />\\"If there were such a thing as terminal literalism, you'd have died in childhood,\\" said Jace . . . .<br /><br />That line still gives me the giggles.<br /><br />As I read City of Bones, I was reminded of the Harry Potter books. Both series include witty dialogue, close friendships, fantastic worlds, and adventures galore.<br /><br />No matter how much I like these similarities and Clare's characters, however, I did not always enjoy the plot. I had stretches of suspenseful, frantic page turning interrupted by boredom and impatience with the pacing. While I did enjoy City of Bones, it's not utterly un-putdownable. In spite of my complaints, though, finishing City of Bones is worth it, and I am so pumped to read the rest of the Mortal Instruments trilogy. I'm sorry I didn't read this one soonerMortal Instruments trilogy. I'm sorry I didn't read this one sooner
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|This is a great movie to watch centering a family's story around the Great Depression and dust bowl . Has always been one of my favorite Henry Fonda movies.
B001DU4DBS|5.0|It so sad that music today lacks the wonderful sounds I am discovering in so many artists from eras ago that I am finding while diggin in the crates. This one really touched my soul and I could listen to it all the time. This is truly beautiful music that really moves you and you have to wonder why this album is not considered a classic by the mainstream.
B000WMFZNS|4.0|The movie is a classic and Heston does a great job. Plenty of extras with this edition but why didn't they put the entire movie on one disc?!?!The movie is split on two discs. Very annoying. That is the only reason I stopped short of 5 stars.
B001QTXM5Y|1.0|This movie was a disapointment to me all around. I'm usually not hard to please and find other reviews of movies to be too harsh. This is the only review I have ever written, but this movie just did not deliver on the hype that surrounded it. I don't expect anyone to not watch it because of what I say, but heed the warning. Rent before you decide to buy.
B000CNESU8|2.0|I know I am kicking a sacred cow when I say this, but the preaching and pontificating in this film went on and on.  There were many good moments, but Network seemed never to end. When Faye Dunaway's character would not stop talking about the show, while walking with William Holden, while eating with Holden, and even before, during, and after sex with Holden, I wanted him to tell her to \\"Shut the Hell up!\\"    This is a classic film for its time, and I liked it when I first saw it, but now, in 2009, seeing it again made me want to say, \\"Do something, if you are mad as Hell.\\"  Sticking heads out of windows and yelling about one's angst just unifies everyone in his angst. What if we all stuck our heads out windows and yelled,m \\"I'm thankful to be here, and if there is anything you need, just call me.\\"? That's a good thing. The film got a response out of me.    I know this is a satire on the power of the media and its negativity. I was raised during the era it depicts. Walter Cronkite (his photo featured in the film) is one of my heroes. I thought that Face in The Crowd and Quiz Show were more entertaining.    I was considering showing this film to my English classes, but I am afraid they would be bored, and that I would lose them. I just wish there were more story and fewer long meetings, discussions about the meaning of media, and repetition.    Maybe I will change my mind upon another viewing, but that will not happen soon.

B002AT4K9G|2.0|Anyone with any intelligence knows these flicks are usually guilty pleasures that hinge themselves on car culture: bad teens, fast cars, racing, chases, crashes, and hot chicks. These kind of flicks usually contain a few bubblegum elements, but this movie careens wildly off the guard rail with an implausible and overly serious storyline, a lot of terrible acting, not enough real car stunts, and the completely humorless execution of a bad script. There are absolutely no jokes, winks, or smiles in this dented wreck of a film. There is a short ROAD WARRIOR gag at the front of the flick. And, only one good racing scene utilizing real stunt drivers. That's it. The two rips thru the border tunnels are CG.<br /><br />Even though Lucas Black's performance was a serious affront to the profession of acting (Black played the kid in SLINGBLADE), at least TOKYO DRIFT had some great set pieces for the cars. The opening race thru the construction site, the drift race up the parking ramp, the chase thru Tokyo, and the final drift race down the mountain in that muscular Mustang, made it worth watching for all the car enthusiasts out there in TVLand.<br /><br />Wow! Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are so bad in this flick it's almost laughable. The cars in this flick have more personality than these two guys. They're both sleepwalking thru their performances. Diesel squints and displays only two emotions. 1. \\"Don't mess with me, I'm concentrating on the road.\\" 2. \\"Don't mess with me, I'm concentrating on revenge.\\" Which is really just the same emotion. Diesel seems like a nice enough guy, but let's face it, he doesn't possess a great range as an actor. Paul Walker is just... well, Paul Walker. Paint him lime green, slap some rims and vinyls on him, and he's good to go. I was really looking forward to seeing Michelle Rodriguez strut her stuff in this flick because I adore her. But, it seems that these cola commercial filmmakers found a way to remove her early from the festivities before I could finish undressing her with my eyes. (sigh) At least she won't have to embarass herself in another one of these movies. So, something good did come out of this flick.<br /><br />Two Stars (and that's being generous), because the look of the film is decent, there are some cars in it, and the music, though certainly cliche, is good. But, this flick is not even close to being a guilty pleasure. It's a junkyard dog!<br /><br />Even the Gag Reel is awful. And completely unfunny.<br /><br />If you're looking for a recent, and decent car action flick, you might want to rent Paul Anderson's remake, DEATH RACE. It's entertaining enough for a Saturday afternoon, and it's certainly better than this CARBOMB.<br /><br />Just keep driving. There's nothing to see here, but a horrible car crash of a movie.<br /><br />UGH!ndressing her with my eyes. (sigh) At least she won't have to embarass herself in another one of these movies.

B000W10AEI|5.0|A year after Harry Potter (Daniel Redcliffe) has found the Sorcerer's Stone, it seems like another year for Hogwart's is coming out. It seems a house-elf named Dobby (Voiced by Toby Jones) has warned Harry not to go back to school but the boy doesn't listen as he goes back to Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardy for another year for he is reunited with Ron (Rupert Grinn) and Heromine (Emma Watson). But it seems some of the students have been petrified magically by something dangerous and mysterious, some bloody threats are written on the wall and of course a creature is on the loose. However despite all this stuff, it could lead to a mysterious Chamber of Secrets where the stuff of the past has been hidden from students for many years yet Harry has to find out.<br /><br />A superb second installment of a fantastic fantasy saga from Chris Columbus is quite faithful to the J.K. Rowling Book. The film reunites Maggie Smith as Professor Mcgaragle, Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, Alan Rickman as Professor Snape, and Tom Felton as Malfoy with the other cast of the first movie including new characters played by Jason Issacs as Malfoy's father, Miriam Margoyles as Professor Sprout and Kenneth Branagh as Gildory Lockheart. Here this installment improves over the first one with bigger pacing, more suspense and better storyline including some darkness abound as the series evolves into a bigger adventure series then ever.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray offers the sharpest picture and sound quality you can imagine like being in a theater with extras like additional scenes, Interviews, Building a Scene featurette, A fun interactive classroom, trailer and film recap of year one.
0316017922|5.0|How can you not be intrigued by a book with a chapter entitled, \\"Rice Paddies and Math Tests\\"?! Curious about how Gladwell connects the dots? Then you should definitely give this book a read. Think cultural factors including linguistics and the work ethic necessary to be a successful rice farmer in SE Asia. This is a very engaging and entertaining book pointing out the often overlooked circumstances (familial, cultural, geographic, etc.) that likely play a significant role in the extraordinary success of individuals. Gladwell punctuates his theories using antedotes from popular culture that we are all familiar with including Mozart, The Beatles, Bill Gates, and other just as successful but perhaps less known individuals.
055380684X|3.0|I liked the author's work. I think it was a diligent research and interesting discovery from his part. I even agree with his points. However I thought he got the message across withing the first 100 pages. Anything after that was just repetitive. So I wasn't completely into it but would still recommend it to readers. Therefore I gave it 3 stars.
1600243711|5.0|I just finished \\"The Lucky One\\" on CD. What a treat!  There were so many times we were waiting for \\"T-bow\\", tell her..... many times you wanted to yank that guy, to wake him up,  she's for you!!!!!  We were rooting all the way for \\"T-bow\\"  Clayton- we would have put him out of his misery long before Chapter 12.  It was the best story I've heard in a long time.  Mr. Sparks covered all the bases and then some.  I \\"talked back\\" to the guy reading several times with warnings about bothering the main guy. I just kept hoping for a great ending.  I'm the one who sneak-peeks the ending if I get antsy about what's going on.  On the road I could not cheat.  I had to hang on and hope for the best....I was not disappointed.  I enjoyed every minute of the story.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This video is great! It really kicks your butt and it only lasts 20 minutes!
B001O7SMRG|3.0|Although I was only about 7 years old when this album came out, it has been a permanent fixture in my life - from radio to friends to open mic nights, etc. These songs are everywhere (if you're a certain age). I tried for years - thru Punk and Post-Punk and Industrial and World and Hip Hop - to deny the squishy singer-songwriter rock vein that runs so deeply in my soul.     So, now that alt rock is awash in amazing singer-songwriters - Bon Iver, M. Ward, Justin Townes Earle, Wilco/Son Volt, Andrew Bird, etc. - these old songs reappear as brilliant strokes of genius that were honed by heartfelt emotion and real musical talent.     In the context of Classic Rock radio, I've had enough of CSN. But in the mix with some of my fave current artists this is seminal music.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|I never knew that our planet was so beautiful till I saw it on the hi def Blu Ray. Being a nature lover, this was one of my must haves. I invested into teh little too expensive DVD purely on an impluse and then never regretted the decision.    This is a great product to have even if you want to show off the capabilities of your blu ray player. Richard A is a great narrator and his commentary makes it worthwhile also.
B000W6EJEK|4.0|Well worth the money spent. I purchased this for my spouse as a gift and she adores it.
B00008PX8P|5.0|This is a far better DVD set than the \\"Song remains the same\\" You get two DVD s instead of just one. You also get at one or two live performances that were cut from the original \\"Song remains the same\\". video. The sound quality is outstandingly done in PCM stereo and Dolby Digital and DTS Surround. Another great thing about this set is there are live performances of songs like \\"Nobody's fault but mine\\", \\"Kashmir\\" and many others that are not on \\"Song remains the same\\". If you are huge fan of Led Zeppelin then this DVD is for you. Highly recommended.
0385342020|3.0|This book was definitely a good beach read, despite the fact that the main character was SO annoying. The whole first half of the book she just complains and complains about her break-up. I had to jump a couple paragraphs because I got tired of just READING about her whining! It was a good premise, but some of the story lines feel unfinished and not fleshed out enough. A quick, light-hearted read, but I do wish that I had waited and bought it cheaper in paperback!
B001LMU1JG|3.0|Top secret is in the vein of the Airplane, Hot shots series. Even if it is stupidly funny it's better than watching serious stuff that is on TV. Highly recommended for people who like to escape reality every now and then.
0634014331|5.0|Great instruction and simple to understand advise. You need to have at least a basic understanding of reading music. The CD is a great aid to the book so don't buy one if it's not included.

0312370849|5.0|I was looking for a book that I could not put down and this was it! I enjoyed the way the book was written but enjoyed it from Sarah's story more. While the outcome was not what I had thought  it was good story that was also sad and thought provoking.
0307454541|3.0|I had great hopes for this book as I had read many great reviews.  Overall it did not meet expectations, but was still an enjoyable read.  My main problems were that the book was overly long.  100 pages could have easily been cut out of this with no problem.  My other main issue was the number of characters, many of which had no real bearing on the overall story and just made things confusing.  On the positive side, I liked this enough to give the next two books in the series a chance.
1439102813|5.0|Alzheimer's is such a debilitating disease and those who are fortunate enough to not have it don't completely comprehend the devastating effects it can have on someone's life. Great accomplishments, fond memories, and even loved ones are completely forgotten, and the person with the condition ends up watching other people live life for them and around them.<br /><br />This story takes a strong, intelligent, ambitious, physically healthy woman at the peak of her existence and shoots her down with the Alzheimer's arrow. Readers are brought into her brain and we see first-hand how the brain just shuts down month by month by month. It's extremely emotional to see someone who used to be so intelligent (she had earned her PhD, for Pete's sake!) not even be able to answer the simplest question such as \\"Where do you live?\\".<br /><br />It was a very well written novel. It was so intriguing to be inside the brain of an Alzheimer's victim, and incredibly scary as well, knowing that there's a possibility this could happen to any one of the people I love or even to myself. The author did an excellent job keeping it believable and really showing us how Alice felt and thought and declined. The only complaint I would have is the names of the characters-- they were extremely similar, so it was hard to keep track. Anne, Anna, Alice, Allison...But maybe Ms. Genova did that on purpose to show the confusion that Alice went through during the course of her disease. Hmmmm...<br /><br />You just have to read it. I could go on and on about why I enjoyed reading this book, but I don't want to keep you from picking it up. Alzheimer's does not have a cure, so don't expect a happy, miraculous ending. But you definitely feel a sense of contentment and satisfaction when you turn that last page. And please please please donate to the Alzheimer's Association, so that we can finally find a cure for this horrible disease. [...]
B002CAWNEM|4.0|But it's still a very good feature. This can be a tool used in teaching about sexual harassment. I think it's also a film that can be used in marriage counselling classes as you really feel sorry for the husband, and the fact that he has to go through the come-ons by the temp, but he should've told his wife about it in the first place. I found this to be the dark side of going to work. I have come to the conclusion that work isn't a social outlet, and it doesn't pay to find out how the other co-workers are doing. It's also becoming where you have to keep yourself...just keep saying you're F.I.N.E. you can fill in the blanks. I honestly don't know if work was supposedly at one time a way of making friends, or not....who knows we may have been all wrong about socializing with our co-workers, giving hugs, dating each other. If that wasn't what we were supposed to do at work then we've put each other in danger. I don't know the answers to this. It's just a crying shame that something as innocent as a hug can be construed as a sexual come-on, and that some people are ignored, not part of the team, or part of the family while others are fortunate to have friends at work, possibly soul mates. Me being one of the many who are ignored sympathize with all the others out there who are ignored. The ones who get in trouble for being vulnerable, and feel like they don't just belong. I feel for each and everyone of you I wish I could say that your co-workers will like you, and everything will be fine...well it may very well be if you find the right place to work to have social outlets. However, don't do what was done in this feature....it may cost you your life. I know I've said I would rather work out of my house instead of going to work anymore, but I may not have that option, so until I find that job where I feel like I belong, and can have friends at work...possibly a soul mate I will just have to watch out, and be careful with who I want to be friends with at work.
1567184855|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. This book just confirm what my mother told me as a child what she witness and what I witness surrounding her which were being of light. I also believe this book is very comforting to those whom are afraid of death. Great read.
B001GCUER0|5.0|It's easy for me to understand why Mad Men is winning all these awards. The premise is a good one: ad men of 60's New York. It's interesting to note the way women of that era dressed, acted, and, most important of all, were treated by men. Practically everyone smokes, drinks and cheats on their spouses. Peggy's a great character, a woman who seemed so innocent at first but has proven herself to be as tough as the guys she works with. Don Draper's past is a secret, and I'm hoping we learn more about his past and why he took another man's name. His wife's finally showing some backbone, although she's turned out to be quite the manipulator. All in all, a very good show, one I love to watch.
0545123267|4.0|The romantic aspect of this book was incredible.  Even while Sam was a werewolf in the beginning I could feel the fondness that he and Grace had between one another.  I highly recommend this book, especially if you loved the first of the twilight series.  Now someone stated that in their review that what Grace and Isabel were about to do to Jack was ridiculous.  But Jack didn't want the life of a werewolf.  He was in agony.  I didn't really understand from Olivia's character why she chose a different route.  Maybe, I'll read the book again.  Anyway, it was a great read.  Also, look out for the times when Sam is calling Grace Grace and when he reverts to calling her \\"the girl\\".  Well written.
B00005V9HH|4.0|I have found it is the only way to go - should you need the latest CD, video, hard to find vintage works either as a gift or for your own collection there is no easier or faster way then Amazon!  Thank you.
0440241901|5.0|I have read a few of Sophie Kinsella/Madeleine Wickham's books but this one was my favorite so far.  It was funny, entertaining, and great quick read.  Like all of her books, there was a really cute love story as well as a story about friendship.  The main character is one that we all can relate with and you will be rooting for her the whole time.  I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for something light and entertaining...perfect to read while traveling or at the beach.

B00260HH3K|3.0|Now that I've seen it I can play devils advocate. This movie attempted to take 30+ episodes of a show a condense it into an hour and a half. I say they did a decent job considering the budget and source material. That's why I gave it 3 stars. They also kept closer to the source material than people want to admit.<br /><br />To ANYONE who has seen this and said this is the WORST movie they've seen they need to get out more(Desert Kickboxer, Vampire Assassin, Zombiez, Transmorphers, need I say more). Is it a good movie? NO. Sorry. But is it the worst ever. Not by far. First of all go see STreet Fighter: The LEgend of Chun-Li THAT was horrid. I actually wanted to watch the travesty that was the original Jean Claude Van Damme version.<br /><br />I am a DB/DBz fan. Have been for years, and I NEVER thought this was a good idea. Ok maybe when I first started watching it I said \\"Hey that'd be cool if they made a real movie,\\" and then I realized how bad it would be. NO ONE would take the plot of ths show seriously and there in lies the problem. The source material, as awesome as it is, is very weak. Carboard chracters with no real development over 400 episodes and 3 shows. Seriously. Here's the basic formula to the series:<br />-Evil villain appears or threat of villain in found.<br />-Heores begin training to prepare for battle<br />-Battle ensues, someone dies.<br />-Battle continues, Hero gains new power level, defeats villain<br />-Deceased are wished back to life with Dragonballs.<br />REPEAT!!!!<br />That's it in a nutshell.<br /><br />THE GOOD...okay, fine the ACCEPTIBLE:<br />-Gokou's perosnality. Gokou in the manga/anime is a very naive, good hearted, and brave character who loves to eat and fight. In the film he's been aged to his teens (Thank god cause the idea of watching a 12 year old as the protagonist for this is just scary), and yet his personality remains wholy unchanged. Yeah they use High School as a setting for him, but he's still good hearted, loves to eat, but instead of naive they made him slightly shy and out of place (which his son Gohan ends up feeling like later in the show). Justin Chatwin wasn't a great choice but he wasn't as bad as I thouhgt hed be. On another note though they should have spent more time training as his lack of any real fights was upsetting.<br />-Piccollo. At least he looked the part. Wish he was on screen more. And with Marster's already being not only a fan but already being familiar with action, he should have had some kick ass fights, but I guess they didn't want him upstaging the hero.<br />-Ki manipulation/energyballs/KameHameHa! Stuff looked good to me. The fight between Piccolo and Gokou at the end is the best, though still lacking. But it definitely invoked the spirit of the anime. The aura around Gokou as he powered up, the more intricate hand motions, and he definitely said it right. I actually got chills seeing that part. I wonder if the rest of the movie suffered because of it, cause it looks like that's where most of the budget went. Everyones crying about Gokou launching himself when he threw the KamHameHa, but Gohan did something similar in movie 9 against Bojack. Check it out.<br />-Oozaru. So what if he wasn't 30 feet tall and there wasn't a tail. The tail woulda looked bad and so would a 30 foot tall were-monkey. They got the look right for the creature, and granted it didn't look that real, but it woulda looked worse at the giant size.<br />-Roshi. Over the top is part of the character. If you don't like it then you hate the character. He was more perverted than the americanized cartoon version, and yet still had his moments of sagely advice. Yeah I know he wasn't bald, but hey Chow Yun Fat still did a great job bringing the character to life.<br /><br />THE BAD, and THE WORSE<br />-Dialogue. Seriously? \\"Believe it punk, you're getting your clock cleaned?\\" Wow man.<br />-Fights. What fights? Chi-Chi Vs Chi-Chi was the only real fight. Every thing else was pretty muchthrowing a punch or a kick at the camera or the generic bad guys they fight ONCE! The end fight looked cool until they get to the hand to hand stuff and it just falls apart. They basically embrace, spinn and punch each other in the face. An extra month or so of training and that coulda been a real DB fight. And thats the thing, thats what the show is all about, and to take that out of it is taking away the best part of the show.<br />-Yamcha. UM WHat? Personality was right (minus the fear of girls), but other than that he was useless. I woulda loved to see him and Gokou go at it, and knock the crap outta him with the \\"Wolf Fang Fist.\\" I understand they gave him blonde hair because in the anime his hair is kinda similar to Goou, but you have an asian playing him so I really don't think we'd get them mixed up. The character could have really brought more to the movie, again if there was more time spent training. Yamcha versus nameless minions, and Chi-Chi Vs Mai part 2, woulda have been a great juxtaposition with the Goku vs Piccolo fight.<br /><br />NEEDED WORK<br />-The story. It was an adaptation. Toriyama himself said he saw this as an alternate reality of the universe he created. That being said I didn't have an issue so much with what they changed as how half assed they did things. Everything felt rushed. Gokou pining after a girl didn't bother me so much as the whole cliched, the girl can get him to focus scene. Also the fact that they threw things like Namekians in there but didn't try to actually explain that PICCOLO was Namekian was a little silly. They had all the beats but failed to hit them on time to get an impact. Also alot of the deleted scenes really should have stayed as they illustrate thins a little better. One such example, is when we see Gokou being bullied early in the film. We know he can take these guys apart, but he's made a promise not to fight. His frustration is shown as we see him put his hood up and walk away. What was cut is him trying to remove his bike from under the car, and we see him lift the car, WITH EASE, before the alarm sounds and he let's it go. That would have perfectly shown exactly how much he really is holding back.<br /><br />Like I said I never thought this was a good idea, but people should be happy they got anything at all with what the source material was.

B001993Y2C|5.0|This series is superb, and rates up there with other excellent TV dramas such as \\"The Tudors\\", and the HBO series \\"Rome\\".<br /><br />This set includes all four of the aired seasons, including the extended version of the series finale along with two other extended episodes, and the Razor movie in HD 1080p  Blu-ray, and 5.1 HD DTS Master Audio. And it looks great, but don't expect everything to be in sharp focus because this series was often shot in a gritty, grainy manner in order to accentuate the harsh life being portrayed, or in a softer manner when presenting the idyllic, convalescent other-worldly, Cylon environment on board their base ship. The images have more punch,  vibrancy, and richness of color than the DVD, because of the greater range of darks and lights offered on Blu-ray. The scenes seem to sparkle in their detail like a Vermeer. And with the HD sound one hears with a clarity one didn't before. Unaired extended episodes include \\"A Disquiet Follows My Soul\\", \\"Islanded in a Stream of Stars\\", and \\"Daybreak\\".<br /><br />The only downside here is the labeling which fails to list the contents of the episodes on either the discs or the individual boxes for each season, as well as the awkward packaging which has the discs slotted into sleeves instead of the usual type of solid DVD, Blu-ray holders. The box set is a robust and clever design with the image of the Cylon peeking at us from inside the box. The box isn't as tall as I expected and it fits easily on my bookshelf only a bit higher than my DVDs. The plastic Cylon figure seems to be a bit of an afterthought resting as it does on the top side of the box as if in a sarcophagus.<br /><br />All in all it's an excellent series which I'm glad to finally see in Blu-ray. Perhaps this series will soon come out in Blu-ray with all of the individual seasons so that one doesn't have to deal with the faulty packaging. And in November the next Battlestar Galactica movie \\"The Plan\\" will be released so the fun doesn't stop here.<br /><br />Interesting footnote: the word Cylon comes from the name of an Athenian. Cylon is mentioned in Thucydides' book \\"The Peloponnesian War\\"(the war between Sparta and Athens: 431-404BC). Cylon was an Athenian noble, and victor at the Olympic games who attempted a coup in 632 BC. The coup was thwarted and Cylon and his supporters took refuge in the temple of Athena on the Acropolis. Cylon and his brother got away but many of the others did not. The \\"curse of the goddess\\" comes about from the killing of the suppliants who had been persuaded to leave the temple believing that they would be unharmed, but they were put to death, some of whom had taken refuge in among the altars of the Dread Goddesses. It was the killers and their families that were accursed and guilty before the goddess of Athena.The Spartans asked the Athenians to drive out the \\"curse of the goddess\\" meaning to ask the Athenians to stop their aggressive ways so as to detour a war between their people.sting footnote: the word Cylon comes from the name of an Athenian.

B002APNQF4|4.0|I love Slide it In and was stoked to see this release.....however a couple problems....why resequence the U.S. Version? What if Machine Head by Deep Purple was resequenced when it got the remaster treatment? Strange..also why leave off 2 songs from the UK version (Love Ain't No Stranger and Hungry for Love)then add a '97 acoustic Love Ain't No Stranger from Starkers...just doesn't fit...subsequently I had a buddy in Sweden send me the 2 missing tracks so I now have both versions complete...The great part is the b-side bonus track and the dvd..again w. Starkers footage but whatever...I'm a completist and this package fell short even though it still is incredible overall...the US Version really smokes and is interesting to hear the UK version and the differences....to me a totally different LP.....grab this cd no doubt but beware of the 'little' drawbacks.
B001QTXM5Y|2.0|I'm so glad I did not buy this! I rented it, and didn't think it was all that great! There were some sweet bloody scenes, and some cool special effects, but the rest was very boring. When a superhero called The Comedian is killed, Doctor Manhattan, Rorschach, Silk Spectre II, and Night Owl II try to figure out why. Rorscach was my favorite character because of his attitude. I really didn't like the way the movie ended. I wouldn't recommend WATCHMEN!!!
B002AR9YPI|1.0|This is a general rule when purchasing any MP3s from Amazon. Although Amazon states that \\"Songs are encoded at 256 kbps\\" [http://www.amazon.com/gp/dmusic/help/faq.html/ref=sv_dmusic_0] they actually use a variable bit rate which means sometimes it's 256 kbps, sometimes it can be, say, 195 kbps. If you care at all about audio quality, and prefer MP3s, at least purchase this from iTunes where the songs are all at a constant rate of 256 kbps. I was initially attracted to Amazon over itunes because of the lower pricing, but it appears it comes at a compromise of quality. In the case of this recording, Grizzly Bear \\"Veckatimest,\\" all 12 songs are under 256 kbps and as low as 205 kbps.

Some of the reviews have criticized the book for being a bit lightweight, but that was exactly what I was looking for.  I loved the emphasis on the importance of reading/literature and enjoyed the quirky characters and humor.  To me, it was a bonus to learn something of the history of the island, even with the painful events of war.  It was a quick read, and I would recommend the book to my friends.

B00005LC1H|5.0|Too bad, there are only 12 episodes of Fawlty Towers. There should have dozens of episodes. While there is talk of a remake, nobody could touch this cast featuring the genius and unknighted John Cleese who probably won't be knighted by the Queen after all. His character, Basil Fawlty, would be appalled by John Cleese's statements about their native Britain. Basil Fawlty runs a small bed and breakfast called Fawlty Towers with his long-time wife, Sybil Fawlty, played by the brilliant Prunella Scales CBE. She could become the next Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire and probably will and hopefully or Lady West if her husband, Timothy West CBE, gets knighted. Cleese's wife, who plays Polly, an aspiring artist, was American born and raised Connie Booth who has become a therapist in London, England and has given up acting. Andrew Sachs plays the always funny Manuel who is from Barcelona and often the subject of Basil's anger and abuse. Poor Manuel, Sachs does him brilliantly. There are supporting characters like the two old senior ladies who are permanent residents and the late funny Berkeley Ballard as a retired military man. Fawlty Towers takes place in Torquay, a seaside town in Southern Britain. As one guest jokes about the lack of sights have been reduced to a page or a brochure.    Every episode is brilliantly mastered to fit the right effects of the audience which is constant laughter no matter how silly the circumstances or bizarre. I wished John Cleese well and I can't imagine anything that could replace Fawlty Towers. He gave us this brilliance only leaving us wanting so much more. It's hard to imagine that British sitcoms have a 6 episode season in comparison to American sitcoms where they can range from 14-22 episodes and that is recently. I loved watching guests like Geoffrey Palmer OBE and others in these episodes.

B000UPGQQW|5.0|This movie doesn't take the vampire-film theme too seriously...and that's what makes it so great!  There is plenty of humor thrown in to balance out the \\"horror\\" aspects.  The cast is superb:  the 2 Coreys do a perfect job in this film of bouncing one-liners off of one another.  Kiefer Sutherland is a convincing bad guy, and Jason Patric is great as the protagonist caught between human and vampire.  One of the vampires in the bad guys' clan - Billy Wirth, the one with the long dark hair - was a semi-finalist on Season 1 of American Gladiator, for those of you who like useless trivia :)  You also get Alex Winter before Bill & Ted fame (albeit with a horribly fake weave in this one).  The only low point is the female lead, who plays the character of Starr...I forget her name, she is so unremarkable, she \\"acts\\" as though she is reading right off of a Teleprompter, and has some serious overacting on display.  But overall, this movie has everything.  I've watched this movie so many times over the years, and it never loses its charm for me.  This isn't what I'd call a hardcore horror film - there are too many comedy aspects - but it's definitely enjoyable and a lot of fun!

0307588335|3.0|A Colossal Failure of Common Sense: The Inside Story of the Collapse of Lehman Brothers - by Lawrence C. McDonald<br /><br />Reviewed by David L. Bahnsen<br /><br />My new series reviewing each and every book that comes out regarding the economic collapse of 2008 is bound to cover a lot of topics - many factual and historical, while many others philosophical and ideological.  The intent of the series is to not allow any major books to get away with a revisionist portrayal of what has happened over the last year or so, while simultaneously repudiating many of the economic fallacies that play into much of the commentary currently being written about the debacle.  I am trying to tackle this assignment with nuance and fairness, and I am thoroughly enjoying it.<br /><br />McDonald's new 350-page book about the fall of Lehman Brothers gives me the opportunity to review some of the history of went on there, and also to clarify some major misunderstandings about the great collapse of 08'.  It is difficult to stay on task of merely reviewing his book, as one is awfully tempted to review the actions of Lehman itself when addressing all that happened here.  I have a lot of good and a lot of bad to say about this book, but one thing is for certain: No comprehensive addressing of the financial collapse of 2008 can possibly exist without substantial coverage of the Lehman failure.  It was, as fate would have it, the catalyst to so much more.<br /><br />When I began reading the book, I was somewhat turned off by McDonald's long rendition of his own biography (and even his family's).  I was anxious to get right into the main course as it pertained to Lehman.  However, the book grew on me, and I do believe one of the more entertaining parts of the book is following McDonald's road from youth, to boiler room cold-caller, to failed Merrill Lynch stock broker (with successes along the way), to dotcom convertible bond analyst, to distressed debt trader at Lehman.  One thing McDonald spends a lot of time doing in the book as blasting their disgraced CEO, Richard Fuld, as having no feel whatsoever for what was going on in the organization.  He uses the fact that many traders never met Fuld as evidence for his lack of connection to the daily grind of the firm.  The \\"I never even met Richard Fuld\\" play cuts both ways, though. Yes, it really does show Fuld as a disconnected, arrogant, aloof CEO.  But it also discredits the author to a certain degree, does it not?  He is writing the \\"inside tale\\", but is clearly not an \\"inside guy\\".  I wish the author could have gotten us inside the 31st floor (the book's metaphor for the offices of Fuld and company President, Joe Gregory) more effectively.<br /><br />With that said, the book brings to light many things that must be considered.  I do not know if it is true or not, but the author states on p. 214 that Lehman Brothers spent more money on, and had more people employed in, their \\"diversity\\" division, than all of Risk Management.  If that is true, than this wonderfully multi-cultural and minority-friendly beacon ought not be surprised at the destruction which pulverized this once great firm.  Sadly, people of all ethnicities were devastated by what happened to Lehman Brothers.  A focus on diversity worked, here - it was an equal opportunity time bomb that went off.<br /><br />One of the most annoying things about this crisis has been the amazing supply of people who \\"knew all along what was going to happen\\".  There are so many bar patrons, newsletter writers, media pundits, and taxi drivers who \\"totally called all of this\\" that it really is remarkable that we suffered any kind of crisis at all.  I do not have any right to judge McDonald's claim that he and the entire bond trading crew he worked with knew everything that was going to happen, and tried their best to stop it; I just know that he is now in a club whose membership apparently includes everyone in society - people that swear they had this thing pegged.  Forgive me for thinking that there may be some serious revisionist history going on.  Maybe I am wrong, and every guy at the gym and the coffee shop who \\"called this\\" got rich by \\"shorting subprime\\".  But suffice it to say, hindsight is always 20/20, and I am more than a little tired of third rate newsletter writers and other such bystanders who had no skin in the game whatsoever lying through their teeth.  None of this is directed at McDonald in particular; I just question the book's assertion that his whole bond desk called the real estate collapse as early as 2005.  I would prefer to save my criticism of this book for a few factual and ideological catastrophes it delves into, as opposed to the cartoonish claims that he figured out how bad the subprime mess was going to be by having a secret beer with some hot shot mortgage brokers in Southern California (though his description of the parking lot at New Century, and extraordinary arrogance of sales people he came into contact with, was humorous, and did provoke some painful memories of similar encounters with that breed).  McDonald does not have a lot of importance to say in this book, but he does talk a lot about important things.<br /><br />One of the things McDonald does very well is document not just the greed of Fuld, and not just the stupidity, but the pathology.  The idea that Lehman went on a commercial real estate buying binge because of Richard Fuld's jealousy of the success the former Lehmanites who ran the Blackstone Group were having in that space is very interesting, and not at al surprising when one thinks about human nature.  After all, wasn't this entire crisis caused by someone's envy and covetousness?  If homeowners of the Inland Empire in Southern California just had to have that home (which they could not afford) to keep up with their co-workers, why would Fuld be different when it came to billion dollar projects and acquisitions?  The 10th commandment is universal, and not class-specific.<br /><br />I think the strongest part of Fuld's book is the last chapter, and the epilogue, at least in terms of suspense and drama.  For those who lived through this crisis post-Lehman, day by day, hour by hour, it is painful to read.  As he was describing 500 point down days in the market that were followed by 600 point down days in the market, I mentally and physically recalled those very incidents like they were yesterday.  There is no doubt that each and every day from the moment Lehman declared bankruptcy, until at least October 13 (and frankly, well past that), were made-for-TV events.<br /><br />McDonald all but asserts that the reason Lehman was allowed to fail was because of the personal animosity that existed between Richard Fuld and Hank Paulson, Bush's Treasury Secretary who happened to be the former CEO of Goldman Sachs.  There is no doubt in my mind that one of the major issues that will have to be addressed by historians and economists is why the decision was made to let Lehman fail.  I do not believe Geithner or Bernanke or Paulson when they hide behind a laissez-faire philosophy in making this decision, and they apparently have been abundantly non-laissez faire in every other aspect of this escapade.  On one hand, I do suspect that they regretted the decision, and found themselves mortified by the effects it had on AIG and the credit default swap market just two days later (not to mention the effect it had on money market stability, as trillions of dollars were pulled from money market funds after the Fidelity Reserve fund \\"broke a buck\\" a couple days later).  The post-Lehman effect on financial credit markets were hellish, from top to bottom.  And it was not Richard Fuld who suffered, as Paulson would have known quite well (he was a centi-millionaire who the world was never going to see again).  It is easy to look at the devastation that Lehman's BK caused, and pontificate in hindsight that we would all be better off if they had been rescued.And frankly, relative to the massive bailout programs that ended up being implemented post hoc, if it were really just a matter of a $30 billion lifeline to Lehman, surely the taxpayers would have been far better off.  But my thesis is this: Lehman was allowed to fail, because we were well past the point of no return, anyways.  It was time to take our medicine.  Paulson and Bernanke could have used Lehman as the catalyst, or Merrill, or Citi, or any number of other firms, but the dam had to be broken, because we were just delaying the inevitable.  That 44-to-1 leverage Lehman had taken on was not going to be rectified by a temporary government inflow.  The credit markets needed to hit the fan, and hit the fan they did.  I believe that a combination of government leaders not understanding the full gravity of what the trickle down effect would be, and a basic understanding of the inevitability of it all, is a far more plausible explanation of Treasury's letting Lehman fall than any personal grudge or contempt.<br /><br />I do believe that Lehman Brothers is a company that deserved to go.  The employees and bankers and traders who represented the honor and nobility of the company did not deserve the painful outcome, but somehow, some way, the rest of Wall Street began raising equity, deleveraging assets, and finding financial partners, after the subprime mess and Bear Stearns blow-up of March.  Lehman did not.  When one sees a train coming, and stays on the track, we have no right to be surprised when they get hit.  Sadly, the train hit much more than just Lehman Brothers.  A sad tale, indeed,<br /><br />McDonald has written a fine book here, the real merit of which is his analysis of the dysfunctional pathology of leadership that brought this company down.  But the few times that he waxes and wanes ideologically, he does make some critical errors, one of which I am duty-bound to correct.  He starts off the book by blaming the economic collapse of 2008 on the repeal of the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act (a bipartisan repeal that took place in 1999).  This lame and baseless accusation has gotten a little traction (thankfully, just a little) in the mass media as well.  If the Republicans were still in leadership, Phil Gramm's authorship of this repeal would surely lead to it being blamed in a much higher profile manner.  But since Gramm is lost from the public scene, and Bill Clinton and Robert Rubin are mostly off limits, this explanation for the financial calamity we endured does not have the political legs some wish it would.  However, McDonald teases readers by claiming early on that the repeal of Glass-Steagall led to a co-mingling of bank depositor funds with risky mortgage assets, and he knew back in 1999 that this was going to be a bad thing.  He basically skips over this for the remaining 350 pages, and that is a good thing for one simple reason: it is patently absurd, and completely false.  Glass Steagall was an effective act in the sense that it forced financial consumers to visit a plethora of financial experts to receive a comprehensive financial plan.  It did a good job at keeping a modern financial system from working for middle class people.  But its repeal did not \\"open the door\\" for this mess, as this mess had absolutely nothing to do with bank depositor funds.  What is shocking and disappointing is that McDonald knows this ...  Lehman did not lever up its client deposit accounts 44-to-1.  Rather, it leveraged up its own balance sheet 44-to-1.  Prior to the 1999 repeal of Glass-Steagall, banks were still allowed to lend out $10 for every $1 they brought in.  And that ratio still applies today.  The balance sheet leverage Wall Street put on in the 2000's had nothing to do with this legislation.  It may be rhetorically effective, but as McDonald ought to know from the case of Drexel Burnham Lambert, and Kidder Peabody, and too many others to count, Wall Street has never needed bank depositor funds to blow itself up.  Bothpre-1999, and post-1999, Wall Street is plenty capable of doing that on its own!  Glass-Steagall was in need of \\"modernization\\" last decade, because consumers were asking for it. Nothing that has happened in this calamity has changed that fundamental fact.  Certainly not the psychotic dealings of Richard Fuld and Lehman Brothers ...being implemented post hoc, if it were really just a matter of a $30 billion lifeline to Lehman, surely the taxpayers would have been far better off.  But my thesis is this: Lehman was allowed to fail, because we were well past the point of no return, anyways.  It was time to take our medicine.  Paulson and Bernanke could have used Lehman as the catalyst, or Merrill, or Citi, or any number of other firms, but the dam had to be broken, because we were just delaying the inevitable.  That 44-to-1 leverage Lehman had taken on was not going to be rectified by a temporary government inflow.  The credit markets needed to hit the fan, and hit the fan they did.  I believe that a combination of government leaders not understanding the full gravity of what the trickle down effect would be, and a basic understanding of the inevitability of it all, is a far more plausible explanation of Treasury's letting Lehman fall than any personal grudge or contempt.        I do believe that Lehman Brothers is a company that deserved to go.  The employees and bankers and traders who represented the honor and nobility of the company did not deserve the painful outcome, but somehow, some way, the rest of Wall Street began raising equity, deleveraging assets, and finding financial partners, after the subprime mess and Bear Stearns blow-up of March.  Lehman did not.  When one sees a train coming, and stays on the track, we have no right to be surprised when they get hit.  Sadly, the train hit much more than just Lehman Brothers.  A sad tale, indeed,    McDonald has written a fine book here, the real merit of which is his analysis of the dysfunctional pathology of leadership that brought this company down.  But the few times that he waxes and wanes ideologically, he does make some critical errors, one of which I am duty-bound to correct.  He starts off the book by blaming the economic collapse of 2008 on the repeal of the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act (a bipartisan repeal that took place in 1999).  This lame and baseless accusation has gotten a little traction (thankfully, just a little) in the mass media as well.  If the Republicans were still in leadership, Phil Gramm's authorship of this repeal would surely lead to it being blamed in a much higher profile manner.  But since Gramm is lost from the public scene, and Bill Clinton and Robert Rubin are mostly off limits, this explanation for the financial calamity we endured does not have the political legs some wish it would.  However, McDonald teases readers by claiming early on that the repeal of Glass-Steagall led to a co-mingling of bank depositor funds with risky mortgage assets, and he knew back in 1999 that this was going to be a bad thing.

B0029358GM|5.0|Whereas Wilco's previous release, Sky Blue Sky proved a more subtle, subdued offering than the highly ambitious A Ghost is Born, their newest album Wilco (The Album) is a return to form of sorts. Not in the sense that it is a better record, as AGIB will always be hard to out-do; I think, though, that Sky Blue Sky was more of a physical and psychological confessional realized by Jeff Tweedy after how hard life crashed when AGIB was released.  Both Tweedy and Wilco are recharged with their newest, self-entitled album.  Lyrically and musically, it delivers a stronger punch, representing one who has just dusted themselves off after being kicked to the curb. Symbolically, it's evident throughout...from the choice of the gruff desert survivor of a camel to adorn their cover to the songs titled I'll Fight and Everlasting Everything.    Wilco delves into the stuff \\"deeper down\\", the realization of one's dead weight, what it takes to shed it and get back to flying again.  And instead of it being something as easy as say, handshake drugs, it is something more communal.  At once the listener will recognize that it's a sense of unity, not only with Wilco's fans but with loved ones in general.  Be that as it may, this isn't necessarily a happy album.  Tweedy slyly muses how every generation seems to have it worse than their predecessors and how not caring may be the only reasonable comfort available to us.  Powerlessness is indeed a major theme, for in the face of crushed cities, little more can be done beyond than just taking care of ourselves.    Typical of any Wilco album, their characteristic sound contains equal parts of Tweedy's vocals and acoustic guitar, mixed with atmospheric piano and keyboard, catchy percussion and the ever-deft artistry of Nels Cline at electric guitar.  Tweedy's lyrics aren't watered down as they are simply concise and uncomplicated, with standout tracks being Deeper Down, One Wing, I'll Fight and Country Disappeared and Everlasting Everything.  Overall, Wilco is poised for yet another ascent.

0786915749|5.0|This is the Book  that Started all for me. In 1984 I was in High School when I was looking for a Book to read at the local bookstore.  Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman are The best Writers Ever. The Dragonlance series  is my favorite series of books and I've read nearly all of them.  From the first word the  Story draws you in.     The story is basically  Good vs Evil about a group of friends bonded together by a deep friendship, The world of Krynn is rich in detail and history and you come to love  the Companions or Heroes of the Lance as the world of Krynn sees them, they are drawn into a brewing up and coming war.    you will meet the Companions, Tanis The Half-Elf, Flint Fireforge the Dwarf, Tasslehoff the Kender, Caramon and Raistlin Majere Storm Brightblade, GoldMoon and Riverwind, and Kitiara (Caramon and Raistlin's Half-Sister.)     My favorite character is the dark mage Raistlin, with the Fun-loving Kender TassleHoff as 2nd favorite.      I highly Recommend this book and the 2 that follow  in this trilogy.  Dragons of Autumn Twlight, Winter Night, and Spring Dawning.. are the 3 books that introduce you to the world of Krynn.

B001GZ6QC4|5.0|I knew that this movie would kill at the box office. One of the best movies i have seen. I went to see it with my 2 bros and it was packed in the theater. We couldn't even sit together. I knew Heath Ledger would get nominated and win the Oscar for his fantastic portrayal of the Joker after seeing it. It has a great cast but, Heath does steal the show. It was an easy decision for me what I was going to be for that halloween I'll tell ya that much. I was never really a big fan of Heath before it and I had seen a couple of his movies. It was shocking to hear he passed away after finishing the movie. At least he left with a Big Bang. It is also much more than just a superhero movie I really don't even see it as one. The movie has it all drama, action, comedy, romance. It has something for everyone and the movie is just one of the greats.

0143038583|4.0|The Omnivore's Dilemma is a decent book. In short, it traces the natural history of food beginning with corn, into corn-fed cattle, and ultimately onto your plate. Of course, there is a little more to it than that, but that's the gist of the book. Overall, it's quite entertaining and presents some very interesting information. For example, I was not aware that salmon, catfish, and tilapia were corn-fed, or that cows that nomally (i.e. if grass fed) take 4 to 5 years to reach slaughter weight are now killed as early as 18 months because of diets rich in corn, protein, and fat supplements. The food industry's influence over politicians and legislation was also quite interesting, though not necessarily surprising.    My main disappointment with this book was the author's writing style, especially since it was listed as a top 10 choice by the NY Times Book Review. His attempt to creatively color his sentences sometimes led to confusing or long-winded passages. As a long time contributing writer at The New York Times Magazine and a Knight Professor of Journalism at Berkeley, I would've expected a higher quality of writing. In any case, the book is not bad. He gets his point across. I recommend reading the book if you've ever been curious about what it is that you are eating everyday and how your typical American meal made its way to you.

B001PR0Y5S|2.0|Redictable is a word I made up while watching this.  It's a combination of ridiculous and predictable.  Allow me to explain before ripping into me.<br /><br />After considerable kicking and screaming, and putting up a fight similar to a gorilla on PCP being wrestled into a wave pool, the ball-and-chain managed to drag me to the theatre to watch this movie.  I tried to give it a fair chance; I really did.  But then the stupid started.<br /><br />Man (Ryan Reynolds) works for Woman (Sandra Bullock) for three years.  He hates her.  He loathes her.  She's the Devil's bride, and causes fire hydrants to combust when she flaunts her wealth in poor neighborhoods on Christmas.  Everyone at work despises her, calling her a witch behind her back, and warning one another of her presence via instant messenger.  Guy is essentially an indentured servant (think Daniel in Karate Kid but without learning the karate), and has been Girl's doormat the entire time he's been with the company.  But when Woman gets served her deportation notice, she concocts a plan to marry Man, stay in the country, and keep making tons of money while making everyone else miserable.  Together, the two make their way to a remote Alaskan town to meet Man's family, proclaim their \\"love,\\" validate her visa (giggity), and blah, blah, blah...yadda, yadda, yadda.<br /><br />Only the willfully ignorant don't see the rest of this movie coming a mile away.  And THAT'S the problem.  Had there been one deviation from the norm, one step outside of the box, one remotely original idea, this movie would have had a chance with me.  Instead, it's ridiculously predictable, redicatable.<br /><br />There are only two bright sides to this movie:<br />1) The beautiful Alaskan countryside (i.e. Bearskin Neck in Rockport, MA)<br />2) The insight into illegal immigration, and the lengths to which the problem is exposed in the U.S., are scandalously subtle in this film.  While there are countless people at the bottom of the totem pole of illegal immigration (e.g. those packed 20-deep clown-car-style in late 70s station wagons), the security sieve on our borders will not be secure until those with higher status and business involvement are prosecuted and deported to the fullest extent of the law.<br /><br />This is only for the mush-brained who honestly believe that three years of hatred-filled murderous thoughts are overcome by an awkward weekend and the awesome song [[ASIN:B00005YKD8 It Takes Two]] by Rob Base and DJ Easy Rock (and without the song this movie is probably a 1-star).ked 20-deep clown-car-style in late 70s station wagons), the security sieve on our borders will not be secure until those with higher status and business involvement are prosecuted and deported to the fullest extent of the law.

B000HEZF0O|3.0|MI is one of those franchises like Superman or Transformers, which lends itself automatically to HD. That might make the job of putting these titles out on HD look easy. It seems studios fall into this trap easily, without recognising a very important \\"difference\\" between the general viewer & the evolved HD fanatic. Fans of this genre form a large part of these fanatics, yours truly included.    Therefore, when I buy MI on BD, I \\"expect\\" the complete frills, bells & whistles. Pristine video transfers, sexy menus, Full HD lossless audio in both DTS (DTS is somehow lsing turf to Dolby of late) & Dolby etc. etc.    We also know that transferring a full width theatre quality content to an 1080p is no big deal. So, there is no excuse for shoddy work at all! HD video must look \\"very good\\" on a HD screen, period. Unfortunately, the difference between an MI DVD & BD is almost insignificant. At least on a PANASONIC LCD.    Gripes with audio quality remain with most BD transfers. Surround pans are at times too artificial & lack proper progresson / regression. MI BDs suffer from a similar fate. BDs, in general suffer from a slightly muddled center output. I do not know the exact reason behind this, but guess that the adjustments while considering a home audience are done more via pre-set algorithms, rather than by a physical SPL calibration. I may be wrong, but I have seen this happen with way too many (same titles sound different when compared between a DVD & HD-BD)titles.    I am certain that most recent converts will miss these apparently trivial issues with MI & viewers of our ilk will be termed nitpickers :) But then, HD is special to us!    The MI4 is due soon. Hope that will exceed our expectations.
B001RIY4WE|1.0|I was very disappointed with Amazon this time.  The product page says nothing about this BD's region coding. I ordered this with the 1st Terminator BD, which played on my Indian PS3. The T2 did not!  Amazon, like always, promptly refunded the charges. For which I am ever grateful :)    But then, when do I get to experience this supposedly fabulous edition in its full HD glory?
159102594X|5.0|This is the first book in what is probably the best three-book series I have ever read.  The characters are rich and full, the action is far from formulaic, and the plot is interesting without being too difficult to follow.  I have bought several copies of this book to give to friends to get them hooked on this author's work.  A really great read.
B00065MDRW|5.0|What is there to say that hasn't already been said about this masterpiece? Released in 1969, King Crimson's \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" is one of the most credited albums in the kick-starting of the prog rock movement. An album that's atmosphere, creativity and style remain nearly unsurpassed forty years later. King Crimson's mix of poetry, trippiness and mood on this record truly makes for an experience like no other in the genre, or even in music in general. A completely essential record that easily measures up to the best efforts of Pink Floyd and Rush.
B000OJFV3S|1.0|I only watched the first 15 minutes but, as a historian and a mother, I was appalled.  The sex scene was so graphic that it ruined any possibility of it lending itself as an educational resource.  Totally unnecessary to the historicity and story.  Henry's character or lack thereof could have been expressed without the borderline pornography.  Wonderful costumes and attention to detail.  I write history curriculum for children and love the study of this period.  Unfortunately, just too crude for this viewer.
B0001M0A4I|3.0|Keyboardist Tony Banks' (b. 1950) recordings, whether with Genesis or the half-dozen or so solo albums he's done over the last 30 years, have been both praised for their influence and criticized for their bombast and pomposity. His, at times, overwhelming synth sound can be either the source of much fragile precision and profound emotion, or a block-chord wall-of-sound that threatens to destroy all in its path. This is especially the case with his use of the string synthesizer, which has yielded mixed results over the years.    So it was with some interest when I first heard Mr. Bank's `Seven - A Suite for Orchestra'. Recorded at Air Studios with the London Philharmonic Orchestra in July of 2002, Seven is big on strings and melodies, which often wash over the remainder of the orchestration. The first track, `Spring Tide', although new in composition for this recording, is the most Genesis-sounding, echoing back melodically  to albums such as  `A Trick of the Trail' or `...And Then There Were Three...'. It features Mr. Banks on piano, and is easily the track that most Genesis and TB fans are going to liken to, which makes it no surprise that it is featured first on disk.       From there, Seven is largely a pastoral sound-scape of slow tempos and gentle melodies, and although none of it is boring, it does come across as being a bit too-Disney and self-animated. It is as if Tony Banks wrote Seven for the wide-screen, which some of his solo projects (such as the soundtrack to The Wicked Lady) were deliberately crafted for. At the same time, Mr. Banks cannot seem to leave his pop / rock sensibilities behind, as the melodies are so strong as to be almost in your face. Genesis music has always been known for its drama, but some pieces, such as `The Ram', easily the most aggressive and bass-heavy piece on the cd, are so dramatic and bombastic as to almost be laughable due to its pretentiousness - again, the melodies are strong throughout this cut, but the overall effect isso pompous as to make one want to turn down the volume so that no one else passing by might hear it!    My understanding is that Tony Banks does not read standard music notation, and so much of the music recorded for Seven was originally performed on a string synth and then notated later for orchestra. If that was the case, then the fact that Seven exists at all is an accomplishment in-and-of itself. It must be said that Tony Banks succeeded more than failed in his first effort as a composer for orchestra with Seven. I can only hope that he will be given a second opportunity by Naxos to record a follow-up album and see if Mr. Banks' musical muse can next time lead to a more sophisticated creation.
0393061310|2.0|I'll keep it short.  If you were to begin reading this book with the crazy notion that you would be enjoying a history on Guns, Germs and Steel, you're in for a surprise.<br /><br />Fortunately I was still somewhat interested in Evolution, Archaeology and Agriculure, because it had almost nothing to do with Guns, Germs and Steel.  It spent 90% of the time fascinated with the events of the world 30,000 years ago, made mabe 1 or 2 mentions of a gun, spent a half of a chapter on germs, and I think the author somehow forgot about steel all together.<br /><br />The title was madly decieving, but the book was still a decent read overall with some interesting theories about evolution.
B001FB55H6|2.0|Unfortunately, Zak Snyder (perhaps proving Alan Moore right that the book is not translatable to film) brought the same flash-over-substance ethic that he displayed in \\"300\\". At least in general terms, the adaptation was fairly spot on, as was the casting. In my opinion, this movie fails because the flash, in the form of gratuitously violent fight scenes, obnoxious stop-motion work and painfully long closeups, crippled the complex and otherwise thought provoking story. Add a horrifyingly bad soundtrack and you have 3 hours of movie that inspires *headdesk* at the high points and suicidal tendencies during the rest of the film.
0439023483|5.0|After the destruction of North America the nation of Panem emerges, in the middle, a shining Capitol with twelve less scintillating nations surrounding it. In order to remind all of the residents of Panem of the brutal war and the power the Capitol holds, the Capitol forces each district to send a boy and a girl, between the ages of twelve and eighteen, each year to the Hunger Games, a fight to the death, survivor style, broadcasted on live TV.<br /><br />In the devastatingly poor District 12, lives a sixteen-year-old named Katniss Everdeen. She lives alone with her mother and twelve-year old sister Prim, being the sole provider for their family, making sure that they just scrape by. When the day of the reaping comes (the event where names are drawn for the Hunger games) Katniss herself feels that she has a greater chance of being picked, but never would expect Prim to be chosen. When the worst happens though, Katniss immediately volunteers herself to participate in Prim's place, becoming the girl to represent District 12 in the Hunger Games.<br /><br />Without even realizing it, Katniss soon becomes one of the top contenders to win the games, as survival is second nature to her. If she is to win though she will have to call upon her keen sense of intelligence and expert survival techniques.<br /><br />Oh my goodness, this book is jaw droppingly good! Every single sentence left you grasping for more and wanting to turn the page so fast that you have to be careful they don't rip. Everything about the book worked and fell so easily into place that it was absolutely impossible to put the book down.<br /><br />The plot itself was extremely unique and was filled with adventure that kept you extremely riveted. Even though Panem was a fictional world it was very easy to see many parallels to our world, which I found extremely interesting. Suzanne Collins also made this imaginary world very lifelike and made the events of the games so real that it felt like I was sitting in my living room watching them on TV along with all the other residents of Panem.<br /><br />Another aspect that really made the book shine were the characters. Regardless of how big of a role the character played they were well developed. Katniss was an amazing and strong character and had a nurturing side that was completely unexpected, but very welcoming. Peeta, the second main character, was a sweetie. He was funny and genuine and I loved how he added the romance element to the story, which in my opinion made the book that much better.<br /><br />As for the author's writing, it was impeccable. She threw you into the arena and made you breathe the same air as Katniss, Peeta and all the other contestants. She created a fascinating world, using fantastic imagery, which made it easy to picture the beauty of the Capitol, all the amazing outfits the contestants wore, and of course the brutality of the arena. She also created one heck of a cliffhanger with the ending of the book, setting up for the next book (CATCHING FIRE) to start right away.<br /><br />Overall this was one heck of a book. The author combined a ridiculous amount of suspense, a ridiculously cute romance, and so much adventure that this has easily become one of my favorite books. As soon as I had finished it I immediately wanted to read it again and again and again. I strongly recommend it to absolutely everyone and cannot wait for the sequelTV along with all the other residents of Panem.    Another aspect that really made the book shine were the characters.

B0026ZNL7Q|5.0|I have been a big fan of \\"Riverside\\" for some time and I must admit that they just keep getting better and better with each new release. This album is plain awesome and it really rocks! There is not a bad song on the disc with # 3 and #5 being my favorites. This is a must have for all progressive rock fans whether you have heard \\"Riverside\\" or not. You won't be disappointed. I suggest that you purchase the double disc set with the bonus DVD of their concert \\"Live in Amsterdam 2008\\". Although it is only about 40 minutes it is an excellent treat thanks to INSIDE OUT recording. This is the 2nd CD I have purchased this year from INSIDE OUT that came with a bonus DVD, the other one was IQ's \\"Frequency\\" another must have for all prog rockers. By both of them and enjoy!!!
B000WS4QJG|5.0|This combo CD AND DVD set is beyond cool. Michael's raw genius and diverse style are captivating beyond words. Every song on the CD is a favorite. Actually recently learned the lyrics to \\"HUMAN NATURE\\" amazing lyrical and musical talent is an understatement. This CD is great for the car where I BLAST the CD, and people smile. But much more than smiling, the songs go to my soul.<br /><br />The DVD has special effects that are phenomenal when Michael transforms into a creature that captivated my imagination.<br /><br />I want to share one of the most poignant parts of this 25th Anniversary set, and this is an actual letter from Michael on the inside front cover of the lyrics booklet.<br /><br />Quoting what Michael wrote verbatim:<br /><br />\\"To My Fans Around the World<br />I would like to thank you for helping me make THRILLER the biggest selling album of all time.<br /><br />As we celebrate the 25th Anniversary of Thriller, I know that I would not have been able to reach any of the historic accomplishments associated with this album, without the love and continued support of you...my fan.<br /><br />I hope you will enjoy the new and previously unreleased bonus tracks included in the 25th Anniversary Edition, as well as the new remixes by my friends, Akon, will.i.am, Fergie, and Kayne West.<br /><br />I've worked very hard to make this a memorable CD and am hoping you will enjoy it.<br /><br />Thanks again from the bottom of my heart!<br />Sincerely,<br />Michael Jackson\\"<br /><br />Mr. Michael Jackson certainly came through for us all big time. It's poignant and bittersweet to read what he wrote so close in time to his passing. From the beginning and all the way through his career, he poured his heart and soul into the music he created for us.<br /><br />I HIGHLY suggest this edition - it is a treasure, as Michael still is!<br />OUTSTANDING!!!
1881273156|5.0|This book was excellent.  it really opens up your eyes in how you relate to your partner.  If you are in a relationship, have ever been in a relationship that wasn't what you wanted it to be or if you ever plan to be in a relationship, this book is a must read.  Enjoyed it immensely.
B00260HH3K|4.0|As I watched this film I went in knowing that there was no way it could meet the greatness of the original DBZ cartoons. In result the plot and character meetings were completely changed around to in a sense recreate the film. The action sequence were not mind blowing but still cool to watch the movie as a whole was good my only complaints about the film were yamcha being a horrible actor. other than that this is a great family film.
B00005QGAV|5.0|Anything that Michael does is great. This has great content and the music is nothing less than brillant. Michael is and always will be the King Of Pop!

B0016CP1QY|5.0|\\"Lost Masterpiece\\", \\"Forgotten Classic\\", \\"...An Album You Must Hear Before You Die\\" - take your pick, because 1972's \\"Occasional Rain\\" genuinely fits them all - it really does.<br /><br />Hailing out of Chicago and a childhood pal of Curtis Mayfield, Terry Callier had put out only 1 album before this called \\"The New Folk Sound Of...\\" on US Prestige in early 1965. It did little business. Session years then went by until his signing to the Chess offshoot label Cadet, where he made 3 albums with legendary producer and writer CHARLES STEPNEY - the other two albums are \\"What Color Is Love\\" (1973) and \\"I Just Can't Help Myself\\" (1974) which are equally good - especially \\"Color\\".<br /><br />Charles Stepney is another big name in small circles - a hero of sorts for soul lovers. He was involved in The Rotary Connection with Minnie Riperton, produced four albums with The Dells and even twiddled the knobs on the iconic and now much-vaulted psych-blues-fusion album \\"Electric Mud\\" by Muddy Waters. I'd personally scour down anything he had a hand in...a genius...<br /><br />Two other words printed on the back inlay beneath the CD also give this reissue the edge - GAVIN LURSSEN. He's an American sound engineer and I've sung his praises before (see separate reviews for \\"Gold\\" by THE CRUSADERS and \\"Careless\\" by STEPHEN BISHOP). Lurssen has just short of 900 mastering, remastering and audio restoration credits to his name (Universal, Hip-O Select) - his work stretches back decades, so  he knows his way around a master tape or two.<br /><br />I mention this because a lot of the songs on here are quietly soulful, Stepney didn't clutter them with instruments except when it complimented the melody - so the remaster needed the deftest of touches and Lurssen has done that. The sound quality isn't trebly or loud or showy - it's just there - sweet as a nut - the music just 'sails' out of your speakers in the most gorgeous way. You're left with a genuine sense of shock on two fronts (a) why has this beautiful soul album gone unnoticed for so long by the vast majority of music lovers out there and (b) a sense of relief - that in finally releasing \\"Occasional Rain\\" in 2008, Universal have picked the right guy to do the job.<br /><br />Musically it breaks down like this - there's eight 8 songs separated by five 40-second \\"Segue\\" bits. No one knows why the first Segue is called \\"Go Ahead On\\" and the other 4 \\"Go Head On\\" (which is what the lyric is)? Some people think the Segues cool, while others feel they haven't worn well and now sound gimmicky. Personally, I find the songs surrounding them so beautiful that I don't notice...they're that good. I would love to hear the full song proper...<br /><br />The most famous track off the LP is \\"Ordinary Joe\\" which has turned up on Acid Jazz type compilations and was a big draw in the UK. Other highlights are the acoustic urban trouble song \\"Trance On Sedgwick Street\\" which along with \\"Blues For Marcus\\" features the beautiful Cello work of EARL MADISON - and combined with Callier's impassioned vocals makes the tracks sound like Cat Stevens meets Nick Drake - really lovely and soulful. The love songs are up there as well - \\"Do You Finally Need A Friend\\" and the truly gorgeous \\"Golden Circle\\" (lyrics above). There's a strange guitar ping that floats over \\"Occasional Rain\\" giving it an ethereal other-worldly feel - very soulful and very Donny Hathaway in structure and churchy feel. Then comes the album's big finisher - and what a peach it is. \\"Lean On Me\\" is an impassioned six and half minute long friendship song with backing vocals from Minnie Riperton and Kitty Haywood - it's just gorgeous and finishes the mellowest of LPs on a genuine high.<br /><br />Downside - although the gatefold card digipak is nice to look at, for me one of the big let downs is the complete lack of a booklet and therefore a sense of history, photos, insights etc... If ever a soul album deserved a little more luxury shown, then \\"Occasional Rain\\" is it.<br /><br />If you're unconvinced and have heard too many praising reviews before - the entire LP is available on iTunes as a download - I'd recommend trying \\"Golden Circle\\" or \\"Occasional Rain\\" or \\"Lean On Me\\"- you'll be hooked. (The 2008 \\"Originals\\" remaster of \\"What Color is Love\\" is also available on iTunes).<br /><br />Like Marvin Gaye's \\"What's Going On\\", Donny Hathaway's \\"Extension Of A Man\\" and Stevie Wonder's \\"Innervisions\\" - this is a proper soul album - a gem all the way through and still beautiful and inspiring to this day - some 30/40 years after the event.<br /><br />Of late Terry Callier has morphed (like Richie Havens) into a sort of elder statesman of soul still spreading his gospel of love and understanding - check out \\"Timepeace\\" from 1998 - unbelievably good and relevant to the now and not just past glories.<br /><br />I've warbled on a bit I know, but this album deserves it.<br /><br />Buy it, cherish it, enjoy it - and I envy you the journey...<br /><br />PS: This disc is part of Universal's \\"ORIGINALS\\" CD Series - digipak CD reissues of Jazz, Soul, Funk, Fusion and Latin albums (120+ and counting) spread across a vast number of the company's famous record labels - see the 'comment' attached to this review for a full listoo many praising reviews before - the entire LP is available on iTunes as a download - I'd recommend trying \\"Golden Circle\\" or \\"Occasional Rain\\" or \\"Lean On Me\\"- you'll be hooked.

B000H6SXMY|5.0|product true to description. Shipping time good- quality better than expected. Will def order again!!!   Thank You!!
031606792X|5.0|First, I can understand why so many people find Breaking Dawn a let down after the first 3 books. The tone is completely different, the characters go through some pretty dramatic changes and they don't get the typical fatal ending that comes from star crossed lovers, or even the struggle and pain of being torn between two loves. That being said, let's try to remember Stephanie wrote this book for teens. While many of us adults absolutely adore Edward and Bella, let's try to remember that they were not created with us in mind.    Now, to touch on a few points I read in previous reviews. Like I said, Stephanie wrote this book for teens, so while many of us may have been expecting J.R. Ward's or even Christine Feehan's hot vampire love making, it just couldn't be done while keeping it strictly PG. As disappointed as I was with the honeymoon, that particular detail still did nothing to ruin the magic of the story for me.    Second is the wedding. If you pay attention in the first 3 books, you realize Bella is not exactly fond of attention. So getting all dolled up while a room full of people watch her intently, is probably no her idea of a good time. Alice however, having been the one who orchestrated the birthday party that set the event of New Moon in motion, is more than giddy about the idea of planning a huge party. So it would make complete sense that the wedding is Alice's vision, not Bella's. Not to mention Bella's strong opposition to marriage due to Renee and Charlie's failed relationship, and the fact that she only agreed to the wedding to please Edward, it makes perfect sense she'd be a little less than enthusiastic about the entire ordeal.    Third, the \\"turning Jacob into a pedophile\\" comment. Come on, we can buy the whole story of filthy rich vampires that work in hospitals, attend normal high schools and survive only on the blood of animals. Who are also sworn enemies of young men who turn into wolfs, have abnormal body temperatures  and heal at an impossible rate. But you can't however buy a little thing called imprinting??? If you got to the 4th book then you stretched your imagination pretty far already, stretch a tiny bit more.    I'm not exactly sure what people mean when they say they were let down by the ending. What exactly did you want? Jacob pining away for Bella while Bella is consumed with guilt over Jacob? Or better yet, Jacob and Bella riding off into the sunset while Edward runs off to South America again to escape the pain? If you understand the story, then you understand that the bonds between Edward and Bella and Bella and Jacob, are far stronger than normal teen romance. Only something equally powerful could mend Jake's broken heart, and so the imprinting is introduced. In my humble opinion, I think it was an excellent way to wrap up Jacob and Bella.     Overall, I enjoyed Breaking Dawn. While it didn't have all the romance of the first 3 books and we saw all of the characters in a different light than what we were used to, it was an excellent way to wrap it up. I mean, why shouldn't Bella get the happy ending? Why shouldn't she have her cottage and her baby and both her first love and her best friend? Maybe Romeo and Juliet had it wrong after all.
0671027344|5.0|Chbosky uses his character Charlie's first-person narrative to explore those moments in day-to-day life that mean so much, but so often escape words.  I loved getting to know Charlie through his letters and seeing him grow up throughout the book, sharing his deep and honest perspectives on freshman year of highschool.  I am looking forward to re-reading this book again and again, and would reccommend it to anyone!
B000B7BRMM|2.0|I'll be brief: Diana Krall has become the vanilla ice cream of the jazz world. Granted, her music is occasionally very good -- at times, even gourmet -- but vanilla, it is...and has been for some time now.<br /><br />This holiday money grab is yet another example.<br /><br />IMO, there are three standout tracks -- ones in which she breathed a little life into otherwise over-recorded tunes -- Christmas Time Is Here, White Christmas and Winter Wonderland. The others are just as you'd imagine they are...across-the-plate, perfectly fine, unspectacular DK.<br /><br />Perhaps she is to be forgiven on this one; after all, this is her holiday season CD -- the one she wants you to put in your heavy rotation for years to come. Maybe that's why she put such a \\"provocative\\" photo of herself on the cover...because frankly, there isn't enough music on the enclosed disc to justify purchasing the whole thing. But wow, Mrs. DK MacManus certainly is one holiday hottie, right?<br /><br />It's a shame that someone with her chops (vocally and on the keys) has to resort to such measures to get our attention during the most wonderful time of the year. It's even more of a shame that Verve would dare put her in that position just to sell a few extra copies.
B001FB55H6|5.0|The first thing I want to inform you about is that this Watchmen Director's Cut Blu-Ray is indeed region free.  I put this in my bog standard UK Panasonic DMP-BD55 Blu-Ray player and it played perfectly with no issues.    Furthermore I ordered this using the cheapest shipping option on July 24th and despite the predicted delivery date of August 20th, it arrived at my door in the UK on July 30th.    Now the film.  I read the book back in the eighties, so I was looking forward to this.  When I saw Watchmen in the cinema, I had mixed feelings.  Yes, it was a fantastic realisation of the novel.  But I felt it lacked pace in places and that those that were unfamiliar with the story might be quick to get bored.    Those expecting the usual superhero gung-ho fayre are going to be disappointed.  This is a much darker type of film, and it's more of a thriller type of plot.  And be warned: this film contains some quite graphic depictions of violence.  Definitely not for youngsters.  It's definitely a cult film.  You'll either love it or you'll hate it.    When I rewatched this on Blu-Ray in it's Director's Cut realisation, I enjoyed it much more than in the cinema.  I can't quite remember which bits were cut from the theatrical cut and what wasn't.  But it seemed a more complete and flowing storyline.  This time I didn't notice any lack of pace and the experience was much more satisfying.    If you are considering buying this, I suggest finding a way to watch it first before you commit to spending your money.  Because while I and many others find this to be an excellent and fantastic movie, it's definitely not everyone's cup of tea.
B001DCQI8W|4.0|Bruckner is a great set, but I like it better enclosed with the contents of the 38 disk set of HVK in the DG SYMPHONY EDITION.  There, you get not only Bruckner's cycle but a Beethoven, Brahms, Schumann, Mendelssohn, and a Tchaikovsky cycle of symphonies, plus Mozart's greatest symphonies, and Haydn's \\"Paris\\" and \\"London\\" symphonies for not even twice this price.  This set?  Too pricey to pay for it a la carte like this.  I give it five stars for the music, as Bruckner's cycle is the strongest cycle in the bigger set.  I give it three stars here for the price of it in paper sleeves.

B000YIGNKE|5.0|Shipping was very fast. I enjoyed the movie immensely!! I am a huge fan of Jane Austin movies, & this was no exception. I hope to see more of them soon.
0978607651|4.0|A brilliant book about a brilliant mind artist, from the nice cover/box treatment to the extremely now days made in 70's illustrations, this book shows some immortal and modern style artworks that has no predecessors. This is a really great source for inspiration and study for everyone that wants to say: \\"I am a illustrator\\". There is a lot of Mr. Harper's artworks with complete informations about it. A must have for any illustration nerd or maker in this decade and next.  The editors of this book didn't took any extra care on researching high definition images to print this book, some illustrations got a totally different colour from the original publications, the exception is the beautiful cover treatment and the box that came with it. Beautiful collection of Mr. Harper life works.  Amazon really makes what they mean in the shipping options, delivered just in the right time to Brazil.
0805086846|5.0|When I started reading this book, I was in shock to learn that my white ancestors were so inhumane and evil.  Even our presidents wanted the Native Americans anhilated, wiped off the face of the earth.  Every single page is full of the atrocities that white people inflicted upon them.  It immediately made me think of the atrocities the Nazis inflicted on the Jews.  Our ancestors were no better, and it's still happening, just not quite as inhumane.    Too bad our Native Americans don't control the lands.  They know how to treat it and care for it.  We're destroying it.  The United States really does have a lot of reconciling to do; a lot to make right.  Read this book and you'll see what I'm talking about.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|This is one of the best MJ live performances. I can watch it over and over again.
B00000DCWR|4.0|Producer Jeff Lynne has always favored a big sound, and this release has it. Rhythm guitar parts frame the soundfield by staking out the territory to the extreme right and left, and then the voices and other action take place in between. Every little nuance rings clear, making it fun to listen to Petty's chameleon-like voice--now sounding like Bob Dylan, now like Roger McGuinn, and sometimes even like Tom Petty, one of our favorite TV stars from The Gary Shandling Show.<br /><br /> Although Petty has always seemed like much more of a craftsman than an artist, this collection of tunes has its artistic moments, and the lyrics are surprisingly interesting. By not overreaching, Petty was able to lift himself beyond his limitations, and the sound was nicely polished by MFSL's GAIN II system, making this an extraordinary release that is, after all, only rock and roll, so don't be crushed if you van no longer find it.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|So we all know that Al Pacino is one of the greatest actors of all time. In his lifetime, he's been in so many classic films (The Godfather Trilogy, Dog Day Afternoon, Heat, Carlito's Way, Scent of a Woman, etc.). Scarface is definitely one of his greatest performances. Everyone who is a fan of this film, including me, can always enjoy the amount of F-words that Tony Montana (Pacino) bellows out of his mouth, or how much the character really just kicks a**. Sure, it's dark and disturbingly violent, but that's what makes it so recognizable. And it's almost amazing how this film has become a direct influence in the hip hop genre. I like hip hop, but I don't think this film should be connected with a particular music genre because it should stand on its own.<br /><br />So Pacino as Tony Montana, the gruesome violence, the insane profanity, the supporting cast (especially Bauer and Pheiffer), the 80's music, and the epic battle at the end of the film (\\"Say hello to ma little fwend!\\") makes this one of the greatest cult hits of all time.
B00002DEIX|5.0|There are recordings that take a while to grow on you, then there are recordings that capture your imagination on first hearing; Beyond, by young saxophonist Joshua Redman, is a prime example of the latter. Man, this is one fine recording! I have tried to analyze just what it is about Redman's playing that is so persuasive, but I can't quite put my finger on it. He just seems to have a knack for melody, and his solos seem to take little twists and turns that are always delightful. Another quality of his music is that many of his compositions have a song-like quality about them. Even his more abstract compositions seem to have a tune to them, or snatches of tunes running through them, giving them a communicative feel. Granted, that's a pretty weak stab at musical analysis, but the point is, this guy's just a natural on the saxophone.<br /><br /> On Beyond, Redman fronts a tight band that includes Aaron Goldberg on piano, Reuben Rogers on bass, and Gregory Hutchinson on drums. Tenor saxophonist Mark Turner joins the group on one cut, the burning \\"Leap of Faith.\\" All the cuts are Redman compositions, and except for his back-and-forth (really more of a side-by-side) with Turner, he is pretty well the featured musician throughout. His sidemen provide good accompaniment, but never really take the spotlight.<br /><br /> This might sound like a recipe for musical boredom, but Redman and his cohort just settle into a groove and play the music, and the music carries the day. From the opening notes of the opening cut, \\"Courage (Asymmetric Aria),\\" it's all good stuff. There's not a weak cut on the CD; special highlights include the interplay between Redman and Turner on \\"Leap of Faith\\" and the somewhat exotic atmosphere on the provocatively titled \\"Last Rites of Rock 'N' Roll.\\" The sound quality is excellent, not at all bright or hard, and overall this is one of the most exuberantly enjoyable jazz albums to come down the pike in quite a while.
B000SNUMFC|1.0|There is something very wrong with this recording. I can't remember ever having a recent recording with such poor sound. I'm NOT talking about the artists or their performance; I think somebody on the technical staff made a serious error at the recording session or during mastering. This CD sounds thin, distant, and monophonic -- like an old mono recording from the early 50's. There is no real bass, the treble is shrill, and the soundstage has no width, even with Dolby Pro Logic II Music and Panorama engaged.     Maybe the recording session was botched by the engineers and they had to use a backup copy made from a single suspended house microphone -- I'm just guessing. In any case, Sony should get hell from the artists (and the public) for allowing their work to be released in this shoddy manner.
B00009XITP|4.0|This is a cute, upbeat movie.  It is suitable for the whole family.  I reccommend it.
0307266303|5.0|Great book! I read this in one sitting and am waiting for my friend to give it back to read again;but they have lent it to their spouse after doing the same thing. With strong proof for the theories presented this book tells us that we've totally missed the boat on how to run....oops.This is done within a fascinating read regarding a super race between super runners.  I had stopped running due to a painful knee but now now have hope that maybe I can run as I apparently did when I was a kid .

0895260131|5.0|Well written and broken down well.  The author breaks down pc myths and refutes pc opinions.  Many excellent points are made about the Crusades, Sharia law, and contemporary situations where islam has shined through as an example of it's primitive violent nature.  I've never read the koran but this book cites it often and gives several excellent arguments against libtards.  Pick it up and read it slowly.  I underlined through out my copy and have gone back to it several times.
B0024RID60|5.0|It's sad to see these tight wad Stones fans dismiss,(and talk themselves out of purchasing)these new remasters, which are superior to the 1994 Virgin issues, just because they wanna save money. One listen and your ears will know better; one look at the wave form of \\"Beast Of Burden\\" and it will surely register with you: There's more clean separation of the guitars, tighter bass with more presence than ever on the bottom end, and louder drums. This leaves more room in the center channel for the vocals to stand out - should you be listening in Dolby PL II music surround mode, and surely by this day and age, you are. Yes there's some compression, but this achieves an overall fuller sound to the better. It's what 15 more years of technology does to the recordings. Deal with it.
0307266303|5.0|I liked the book a lot but I loved the digressions from pp 168-183 about how modern running shoes are largely useless if not a source of problems and the one from pp  214-244 about the anthropological history of distance running and its place in human evolution.      The rest of the book got a little, well, not quite tiresome but it was edging that way as everyone was zany and crazy and exceptional and out there and . . . give it a rest, Chris.      I'm sure some of the ideas about running shoes and the human propensity for distance running put forth in this book have been advanced in more scholarly venues but McDougall's done a great service by bringing these ideas to popular discussion.
B001WCN23W|5.0|This new remaster from UMD eats up the road in sound quality compared to past versions. The horns in \\"I Got the Blues\\" have punch and fullness, the organ solo sounds like it is the room with you. Forget what that other guy said about \\"Sister Morphine\\" opening with a fade in - that's rubbish (he may want to invest in a new player or something) anybody with a decent system with marvel at the presence in the drums and bass throughout. The acoustic guitars in \\"Wild Horses\\" gleam. Nicky Hopkins piano is more vivid on the fade out of \\"Sway\\" to nice effect. Gone is any trace of hiss, and for anybody who owned the LP growing up will attest - that's an absence no one will miss. \\"Moonlight Mile\\" is sturdy and grounded with full body acoustic guitar (a little compression for loudness sake benefits this track). If you are listening in surround mode, you will especially notice the clean and wider separation on the guitars and the vocals are more upfront in the center than the Virgin release.  As far as packaging goes - I'm keeping my Virgin limited edtion with the real zipper and all that - but I'll be listening to the UMD CD.
B001FB55I0|1.0|Terminator movies should have stopped after the amazing T2 movie directed by James Cameron. Terminator Salvation is by far the worst Terminator movie out of all 4. It really makes T3 look like a masterpeice, eventhough I did not likt Terminator 3 that much. Christian Bale does not fit as John Connor at all. I can't believe from what I heared that he will be in 2 more Terminator Films.<br />LET THE TERMINATOR MOVIES GO TO REST. IT IS LOSING ITS PLACE IN THE GREAT SCI FI MOVIE LIST.
B0029358GM|3.0|I'm really not a fan of this Wilco album.  I hear signs of a sellout similar to when it happened to U2 in the mid 90's.    The opening song is pretty average.  The vocals are just interesting enough to keep the melody going until the end, but I don't need to hear it ever again.  \\"Deeper Down\\" has some background instruments that remind me of the Beatles \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\".  It's both beautiful and eerie.  I like this.  Also reminds me of classic Electric Light Orchestra.    \\"One Wing\\" tries to be a heartfelt ballad but misses the mark.  \\"Bull Black Nova\\" has a terribly bland verse melody that reminds me of a U2 moment at their very worst.  Please don't tell me THIS kind of vocal performance passes for brilliance these days!    \\"You and I\\" is the bands attempt at a pop song, and it's not a bad one.  In fact it's pretty decent.  It actually strikes me as a well crafted pop song unlike most of the album.  \\"You Never Know\\" is good enough to please me, though it's not NEARLY as good as most people think it is.    \\"Country Disappeared\\" is the kind of song where you really have to be an incredibly big fan of the lead singer in order to appreciate, which I'm most certainly not.  \\"Solitaire\\" is decent enough for a really quiet verse melody.  It took me until now to realize if maybe Wilco's entire gimmick is to be like John Lennon with the meaningful lyrics and touching vocal melodies.    The rest of the album has some hit and miss moments... just like the previous eight songs I reviewed above.  It's good enough music to please either the emotionally devasted or all the moms and dads out there, but the album is honestly more like a 2.5 rating out of 5.
B001FB4W0W|2.0|HBO took the low road.      I am on book four of the Sookie Stackhouse series.  I hadn't seen the series and bought season one to get a visual on the characters.  For the most part I liked Sookie, Bill and Sam.  I knew it was HBO with vampires and I clearly wasn't expecting \\"Father Knows Best\\".  My complaint is the far too excessive profanity and the bad taste softporn.  What could have been an excellent opportunity to build on Charlane Harris' books just once again showed Hollywood's poor judgment. By episode three or four I was fastforwarding through scenes.  Toward the end of the series it was being somewhat toned down compared to the beginning. Disappointed with the writing not Anna Paquin, Stephen Moyer and Sam Trammell,
B000PKX2KA|3.0|I am angry and frustrated.  I have both Delorme's Street Atlas 2008 and Topo USA 7.0.  Since Delorme's Earthmate LT 40 gps which came bundled with Street Atlas is such a poor product, (We took at four thousand mile trip this summer with the LT 40.  Over and over it lost the fix and we had to stop and put the gps on the roof until if got a fix.)I have searched for another laptop gps.  Globalsat BU 353 seemed to be the answer.  Good reviews, right price!    I have only had it a week. It gets a fix very quickly and it works inside the car! However, my Delorme products don't like it.  I had a lot of trouble installing it and getting them to see it in the first place. Now that the programs recognize it I can drive around and it tracks very well on my screen.     THE CATCH!  I use the programs to plot routes and find addresses.  The programs both freeze up when I plot a route and try to use the gps! It my be a wonderful gps, I am not sure, but don't expect it to work with Delorme products.
B0000CDL93|5.0|\\"JFK\\" is not really so much about President Kennedy as it is about New Orleans D.A. Jim Garrison and his attempt to find the truth about JFK's assassination, and if there was a conspiracy, to bring the conspirators to justice. Though he didn't get a conviction, he at least went farther than any other law enforcement entities. He brought a murder and conspiracy charge against one of the alleged participants. According to this movie, the jury believed there was a conspiracy, but they didn't feel his case met the burden of proof as far as the individual charged was concerned. Subsequently, it was revealed that he worked for the CIA.<br /><br />\\"JFK\\" is Oliver Stone's favorite Oliver Stone film. He considers it his 'Godfather.' \\"JFK\\" is also Oliver Stone's most controversial film, with some who share his high opinion, and others who consider it blasphemy, tantamount to treason. Walter Cronkite, who was at one time the most trusted man in America, thought it was rubbish. The head of at least one media empire suppressed a 34 word capsule review that was too favorable. The writer complained about it and was fired. I think they were killing the messenger because they didn't like the message.<br /><br />-----------------------------<br />Jim Garrison: Thank you for your time, David. I'm sorry this has to end inconveniently for you but I am going to have to detain you for further questioning by the FBI.<br />David Ferrie: Why, what's wrong?<br />Jim Garrison: David, I find your story simply not believable.<br />David Ferrie: Really? What part?<br />==========================================<br /><br />Likewise, some may find Oliver Stone's story simply not believable, but it is a lot more believable than the conclusions of the Warren Report.<br /><br />-------------------<br />Jim Garrison: Once you conclude the magic bullet could not create all seven of those wounds, you'd have to conclude that there was a fourth shot and a second rifle. And if there was a second rifleman, then by definition, there had to be a conspiracy.<br />===========================<br /><br />The director of a film can manipulate the truth -- omit certain details, highlight others, cherry pick certain facts to support his thesis, or completely fabricate from beginning to end. Fiction, as a literary form has been called \\"lies that tell the truth\\" and when you are talking about film, you just might be more in the realm of lies that tell even bigger lies.\\" But I think that JFK was researched and put together well, and it was much more than either mere entertainment or propaganda. It actually was very entertaining, but in a way that makes you think. Though the truth of what happened that day in November may be \\"a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma\\" -- obscured so much that we may never know the real truth, Oliver Stone has really done a masterful job. I think that just like Jim Garrison, Stone has shown that Lee Harvey Oswald didn't act alone, if he was in fact an assassin and not just a patsy. The sequence in the courtroom where Kevin Costner, as Jim Garrison, lays out his case that there was at least a second rifleman is a masterful sequence. Filmed in one long take, requiring prodigious memorization by Costner, it is the compelling highlight of  JFK. Once you get past the hurdle of the idea foisted on the American Public by the Warren Commission that JFK was killed by a lone assassin, then all kinds of questions open up. It really gets you thinking.<br /><br />-----------------------<br />X: Fundamentally, people are suckers for the truth. And the truth is on your side, Bubba.<br />===========================<br /><br />Most people who were alive when JFK was killed remember where they were that day. It seems that when JFK died, our innocence died also. Jello Biafra of the punk band, The Dead Kennedys says that the name of his group was thought up by some hippies, Grateful Dead Heads who threw it out as a possibility in a long list of possible names. Hegrasped the significance of that name, as it expressed the death of our innocence. Jerry Seinfeld, trying to deal with the fundamental contradiction -- the rift in our society, used humor. In a parody of \\"the single bullet theory\\" called, \\"the single lugie theory\\" a baseball player is spat on in an incident after a game. Wayne Knight, who played Newman, Jerry's nemesis, is in both the TV Show, and the film, \\"JFK.\\" In both, he plays the same part in the courtroom reenactment. I don't know exactly what all this means, but I would submit for your approval that the JFK assassination is the tragic touchstone of our generation, and that Oliver Stone, in taking it as the subject of his film, was tackling the biggest issue of our time. It was bound to be controversial. Perhaps you will walk away from it still unconvinced. But even if it just gets you thinking, \\"JFK\\" has done its job.<br /><br />--------------<br />Guy Bannister: Camelot in smithereens.<br />=========================<br /><br />SELECTED FILMOGRAPHY OF JFK CAST MEMBERS<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000P0J0B0 Natural Born Killers]] (1994) ....

014144116X|5.0|This book is amazing. First of all, it's a good thing we have artifacts like this from the past. It gives an incredible view into the mind of liberal humanists/Orientalists. It is also a cool view of India from a homo-social view. Really cool.
1594481717|1.0|The central premise of this book is that people with slightly more right-brain skills will dominate the work force in the 21st century... or at least be much more important than the past 20 years. I bought this book because that is a premise I agree with, so I was curious to see how he demonstrated his point, or any advice he could offer.<br /><br />What I got was page after page of uninformed conjecture, hyperbole, cliches, and self-important blather. His premise? Left-brained work has dominated the industrial age, and the next \\"phase\\" of human development is what he decided to label the \\"conceptual age,\\" where right-directed people will dominate.<br /><br />Really? You really think that? That's a hell of a statement... I hope you can back it up with some hard data... statistics, job growth numbers, etc? Anything?<br /><br />Nope.<br /><br />He claims the drivers towards the \\"Conceptual Age\\" are Abundance, Asia, and Automation. That's it. No further proof. Let's take these one at a time:<br /><br />Firstly, because of \\"Abundance\\", people are looking for better designs, even for ordinary household tools... thus designers become important. And apparently this is a new idea??? He believes that the words from the latest CEO of GM -- who said his job is to produce works of art that people drive -- as being somehow monumental. Oh my god! GM designs cars! They now care about \\"form\\" as well as \\"function!\\"<br /><br />Really??? You really think that's a new thing? So I guess then those fins on a 1956 Chevy are there for aerodynamic purposes... and the mountains of chrome were there to make it more visible at night. Apparently the author is equally ignorant of the real drivers of the \\"left-brained\\" industrial revolution in the 19th century: the production of cheap textiles for clothing. YEP! The industrial revolution existed for the benefit of fashion designers and other \\"right brained\\" people who were tired of the ordinary abundance of the tunic. And how much of the computer revolution existed because people wanted a more \\"personalized\\" computer experience for their home or business? Ever hear of the iMac???<br /><br />The author should try to do some research once in a while...<br /><br />Secondly, because of \\"Asia,\\" a lot of left-brian jobs -- computer programming, accounting, and legal -- are moving to Asia. Whereas right-brian jobs that require artistic design, communication, empathy, play, and meaning stay right in the USA. Since these jobs are \\"high-touch\\" jobs, they can't be outsourced.<br /><br />Really??? You really think right-brain jobs cant be outsourced? I got a graphic designer in the Philippines who says differently. I got a dozen \\"empathy hotlines\\" you can call if you're feeling like killing yourself, and they'll do a hell of a lot better talking you down from the ledge than your friends or family. I also know of some really good customer support centers in India who are highly trained in empathic communication. Ever hear of teleconferencing or telepresence? Right-brained jobs are just as easily outsourced with the right technology.<br /><br />Jobs are moving to Asia for one basic reason: SUPPLY AND DEMAND. Nothing more. Most American businesses prefer American workers, simply because culture differences, currency exchange rates, and time zones are a pain to deal with... but Asian workers are so much cheaper that they are worth the extra pain. However, these wages are only low in Asia because Asian industries are not big enough to demand local software developers, lawyers, and accountants. Once Asia becomes more industrialized, local businesses will be demanding up the local talent... which decreases their supply... which drives Asian wages up... which makes American talent more attractive to American businesses again.<br /><br />This is just cyclical unemployment on a global scale: no more. Again... some research by the author would have been nice...<br /><br />Thirdly, because of \\"Automation,\\" those who just follow awell-defined process will be easily replaced by robots, computers, or Asians (apparently). In other words... technology eliminates low-skill jobs. SHOCKER! But of course, this isn't actually true. As any economics professor will tell you, technology is disruptive, but it doesn't eliminate jobs in the long run. The simple fact is that workers who learn how to use the new technology become more productive, and therefore more valuable to their employers! Yes, job responsibilities shift around a bit, but overall productivity increases, which creates more jobs in the medium term.<br /><br />Then the author goes on to the second section of the book, which contains anecdotes about what skills will be important in the 21st century: design (agree), story (maybe), \\"symphony\\" (give me a break...), empathy (big agreement there), play (agree), and meaning (agree). The stories are good reading, but they are never supported by any hard data. There is evidence of a fad, but no evidence of a trend.<br /><br />The single saving grace of this book are the right-brain exercises. They are pretty fun ways for a left-brain-leaning person to step out of their comfort zone and flex the right brain a little. If you find this book in the bargain bin for $5, then its worth it just for the exercises.<br /><br />Otherwise, you'll probably want to avoid it...ther words... technology eliminates low-skill jobs.

1416584072|1.0|I read this for a literature course. Had I not been required to read it, I would have stopped long before page three-hundred whatever.     Personally, I found it too long for the low quality detail and plot Monica Ali gives us.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|Great movie from a one of the greats in my view. Really can't fault any of Audrey Hepburns movies. No matter what role she undertok she always gave it her best .
B001CD3PLU|5.0|I'm not sure why there are those that rated the Warner UK Blu-Ray release so low due to picture quality but I found it to be a step above and beyond the DVD release. I experienced no graininess or flickering in dark areas of the film on my 42\\" Panasonic Plasma. On the contrary, the quality of the picture was outstanding. There were no artifacts, dust or debris and the picture was clean and sharp. The audio, Dolby True HD 5.1, was another huge improvement. The dialoge was clear and the effects were a pleasure to hear from my rear speakers. All-in-all a pleasurable experience. I've always loved this film and this Blu-Ray release makes my favorite film even more enjoyable.
B0017HMF6W|5.0|This is one of those pictures you can watch again and again--totally delightful -- like eating a big dish of ice-cream.  Wonderful photography, Hitchcock's great directing skills and a superb cast.  James Mason is the perfect \\"nice\\" villain--just what Hitchcock always said a villain should be.  The picture has many memorable Hitchcock set-pieces that are now movie legend -- the kidnapping of Grant in the Plaza hotel, the assassination in the U.N., the crop-dusting sequence, the chase across the Mount Rushmore monument.   Add to this a good deal of humor and Bernard Hermann's brilliant score.  How can it miss?      Sorry to see  so many reviews that complain of defective discs.   It's a dual-layer disc and apparently the place in the picture being described is the layer transition point, where the player must switch from layer one to layer two.  It sounds like a run of defective discs.  I got my disc in 2000 which I believe was the original release and it plays OK.  I plan to buy the Blu-Ray version when the price drops a little.  Incidentally, some Blu-Ray players, when playing standard DVDs, take a little longer to negotiate the layer transition point than many late-model standard DVD players.    My original release by Warner of this MGM classic, which is anamorphic, looks wonderful on a Blu-Ray player and a large screen.  I can just imagine what the Blu-Ray will look like.
B001FB55H6|5.0|This edition is an improvement over the theatrical release and is closer to the book.  My only disappointment related to this edition was that I opened the package to find a coupon for the ULTIMATE edition, which is to be released Decemberish.  The next (and I hope final) version will have the Black Freighter story woven into the main story as it is in the book.  If you don't want multiple versions of this film, hold off buying until the end of the year.    I agree with the other reviewers who note the film's ending is an improvement over the book's.  It just makes more sense in the context of the story.  This is not a knock on Mr. Moore, of whom I am a big fan.     I don't understand the folks who are so down on this film, unless it is that they just had the wrong expectations and/or didn't do their homework before watching it.  It was never meant to be another Spiderman, Superman or Hulk story.    Kudos to Mr. Moore.  Kudos for the team who produced this film.
B001NN4162|5.0|This release appears to be the UK release. Therefore the description above that states    Import 2 x Blu-Ray/Region All pressing. US version delayed until late 2009. Please note the special features are in the PAL format and not viewable on US PS3/Standard Blu-Ray players    is FALSE. All extras from the UK release are in NTSC format, so everybody in the US can watch all the extras. Enjoy!
0060730552|5.0|...just a couple of details that may help you if you are not familiar with this story.<br />Joe with a friend are trying to summit a peak in Peru, is two days walk from the last vehicle's road to the base camp.<br />The peak is around 21000 feet, around 6300 mts, but I should say that looks pretty hard, and they have a nasty weather.<br />Joe and his pal are Brits.  Don't read if you are looking for a trash book, hope you understand what I mean it.
B001NFNFNU|4.0|Angelina Jolie is no less than excellent in this film.  With little effort she demonstrates both the heartbreak and the strength of a mother whose nine year old son disappears.  What I also found interesting was director Clint Eastwood showing his versatility by helming a film with a strong female at it's center.  The look of the film is also impressive with it's impeccable period art direction and costume design.  The film I realize is based on a true story so I can't really testify to it's accuracy.  That said, it smacked a little bit like warmed over James Ellroy.  Also, the depiction of the film's villains, in this case the L.A.P.D., was a little heavy-handed and one-dimensional.  I would recommend the film for Jolie's work but the story at the center should be taken with a grain of salt.
B001KZI2WW|2.0|Love crocs.  Thought this cool looking casual would be just the thing for me.  Great look. comfortable as regular crocs. BUT!!!It rubs badly in the back.  I had a blister after a half hour of wearing it.  I really hate to give crocs a bad riview as that is about all I wear being recently retired, but the rub in the back is BAD.  Buy at your own risk.  Also, I'd like to add that I did not wear socks w/this shoe, I live in Florida where socks are not happening. Anyway, beware of heel rub, it's bad...
B00007KWI9|5.0|Yes' first release is one of the greatest debut albums ever.  All of the songs are outstanding, and there is a little bit of everything, from soft songs like YESTERDAY AND TODAY to the faster I SEE YOU.  The re-mastering of this 1969 release is nothing short of amazing.  BEYOND AND BEFORE sounds crystal-clear, and is a vast improvement from the earlier CD release.  There's a certain mood with this album, and maybe the original album cover depicts it best, as they're outside on a cloudy day.  For some reason, the mood of the music fits that album cover.  I was disappointed to see the new and far simpler cover, but was delighted that they decided to scrap the original cover for TIME AND A WORD (their 2nd album), because Peter Banks isn't even on that cover in 1970.  Instead, they put Steve Howe on the cover, as he was just entering the band, though Banks played on it.  Speaking of Banks, I'm blown away by some fans and critics that say that Peter Banks is \\"No Steve Howe.\\" Okay, let's put this into proper perspective: This album came out in 1969---before Moog synthesizers, and while the band was obviously still developing their definitive sound.  Why would ANYONE want Peter Banks' work to sound like Steve Howe's on this album?  It wouldn't fit!!!  Peter Banks was awesome on the first 2 albums, and his stuff is impressive for the type of material they were generating.  No one knows what he would have done after 1970, so people can't judge him against Howe.  Peter Banks sounds pretty damn good to me!!!!  He has some very recognizable riffs, and ones that have withstood the test of time.  He also does very well acoustically.  To sum up, one can't judge Banks, because he was from a different technological era, as well as a different style of music. However, he is the one who invented their signature unique guitar sound. The song, I See You is the first song to feature the moody carnival-like guitar sound that defines Yes.  I highly recommend this CD, because it's their roots that we're listening to, and the sound is outstanding.  You'll love it, and YES.....you'll love the guitar!!!!  10/10  P.S. It was Peter Banks who named the group!!!! Also, Jon Anderson asked Peter Banks if he'd like to rejoin the group in 1995----he knew how talented he was!!!!ts that we're listening to, and the sound is outstanding.  You'll love it, and YES.....you'll love the guitar!!!!  10/10  P.S. It was Peter Banks who named the group!!!! Also, Jon Anderson asked Peter Banks if he'd like to rejoin the group in 1995----he knew how talented he was!!!!
1905492073|5.0|This title lives up to its reputation. This is a very thorough historical and technical presentation of decompression theory yet it is presented in a language everyone can understand. The book, however, does contain a large amount of typos and misspelligns but this does not interfere with the content. It covers decompression theory as well as all related subjects including recompression, hyperbaric medecine, neurological examinations, nitrox and bubble models, etc.  If I had to use a text as a basis for a course, this would be it.    If you are interested in decompression, ratio deco and how this has evolved over the years, this is the text to use.     I would only recommend that the publisher have the manuscript re-edited for typos and misspellings.    Christian L.
B001PR0Y5S|5.0|I loved this movie. I saw this movie in the theaters and thought it was one of the best chick-flicks ever. It is a typical love story where they end up falling in love but it was really well done. The acting was fantastic and had many memorable scenes. I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good pick me up movie.
B0026UV77C|5.0|After listening to this cd over and over again i gladly say its one of placebos best work!<br />songs like Kitty Litter,Julien, Battle for the Sun, Never-ending Why among others will stick into your head<br />the lyrics, the sounds, the voice, its quality of course its Placebo. Buy it you wont be dissapointed, cant wait to see them again in concert soon. This is my favorite band.
B001SN78JO|3.0|This is not a typical Jim Carrey movie.  He's about at a level 4 or 5 instead of 7 or 8, which makes the comedy settle and not so over the top.
1584282584|5.0|As one of the leaders in the industry in wireless TTL flash photography I must say reading this new book by Neil is truly a \\"must have\\" item for any photographer who wants to take their art to the next level. From just picking up your camera to being a professional for many years, this new book offers something for everyone. From simple tips and tricks to detailed flash explanations, Neil allows each reader to expand their creative mind to gain more or even complete control over the flash in their photography. From amazing bounce flash techniques to details on gels and other lighting methods, this book really is a foundation for flash photography.  My company, TriCoast, believes in honest and educational items, the author has given the photography community just that, a great book filled with straight forward educational aspects.    I strongly suggestion everyone wanting to learn about their flash units to pick this book up, truly it will change the way they see forever.
B001UV4XU6|5.0|500 Days plays as one of the most inventive and original movies I have seen in a long time.  Not all relationships are love stories, and we may not know  going in, if this person is the 'one.'  We may wonder but we may not know..<br />This is not such a relationship, and every relationship carries with it the seed of an equal or greater benefit..<br /><br />When you listen to a story you immediately tend to identify with the lead character.  Here though, the writer cleverly flips and reverses the male female duality, so that we experience a shift and a split in perception, she is the one with walls, the realist, neat and organised, emotionally unavailable, he is the one seeking relationship, looking to break those walls and make an emotional connection, the romantic fantasist discussing the relationship  with friends. She focuses on the present. He focuses on the future.  The further you get into the movie the more you may notice yourself looking at relationships in new ways.<br /><br />If you're into personality types:  He is feeling and intuiting. She is thinking and sensing. Through interaction with opposites we absorb from the other person's way of doing things.<br /><br />What  I love  most about this movie, is  not just the acting, not just the directing, not just the storytelling, but it's fresh inventive unabashedly non linear non formula Indie beating Hollywood's formula way, giving us scenes, emotions and insights that linger long after the credits roll.<br /><br />What still lingers: The elated morning after scene, when you feel like high fiving the world. The Ikea scene. The French movie metaphor scene.  When the robot cries. The split screen expectations reality sequence.<br /><br />The story unfolds in a non linear fashion, dipping in different days at random, with a recurring skyline motif the connecting thread between scenes.  This time distortion technique somehow makes sense, partly because this is how we remember relationships.  My favorite scene is the park bench where he tells her his dream of changing the skyline, and she asks him to draw it on her forearm, and then it fades perfectly into the skyline motif, planting that seed.  The park bench becomes turning point and bookend.<br /><br />Joseph Gordon Levitt, whose facial expressions resemble Heath Ledger sometimes, excels as everyman Tom Hanson, who writes greeting cards but really wants to be an architect.  He played lead in  one of my favorite movies of 2006 -[[ASIN:B000QFCD8Q The Lookout]] as a young man with amnesia sucked into a bank robbery.<br /><br />As an avid movie goer I noticed Zooey Deschanel first in Cloverfield. As the handheld camera zoomed in her baby blues reminded me a little of Meg Ryan.  Then we saw her in The Happening.  I had seen her in several other movies such as Teribithia, and I must have seen her in Weeds, and The Good Girl but I have no actual recollection.  She was outstanding as the lead in [[ASIN:B0010X744G Tin Man (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]] mini series, the reimagining of Wizard of Oz. Now, like in the bus she seems to be everywhere.<br /><br />She does seem detached from her emotions, does great  deadpan facial expressions, and does seem delightfully quirky.  All these aspects contribute to her brilliance as a comedic actress as in [[ASIN:B0002F6BRE Elf (Infinifilm Edition)]] with Will Ferrell.

The park bench becomes turning point and bookend.    Joseph Gordon Levitt, whose facial expressions resemble Heath Ledger sometimes, excels as everyman Tom Hanson, who writes greeting cards but really wants to be an architect.  He played lead in  one of my favorite movies of 2006 -[[ASIN:B000QFCD8Q The Lookout]] as a young man with amnesia sucked into a bank robbery.      As an avid movie goer I noticed Zooey Deschanel first in Cloverfield. As the handheld camera zoomed in her baby blues reminded me a little of Meg Ryan.  Then we saw her in The Happening.  I had seen her in several other movies such as Teribithia, and I must have seen her in Weeds, and The Good Girl but I have no actual recollection.  She was outstanding as the lead in [[ASIN:B0010X744G Tin Man (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]] mini series, the reimagining of Wizard of Oz. Now, like in the bus she seems to be everywhere.     She does seem detached from her emotions, does great  deadpan facial expressions, and does seem delightfully quirky.  All these aspects contribute to her brilliance as a comedic actress as in [[ASIN:B0002F6BRE Elf (Infinifilm Edition)]] with Will Ferrell.  What remains to be seen is whether she continues to play to her strengths and build on that or boldly expand her emotional horizons.  Perhaps we should rename the third rock from the sun.

B0002J4X1Q|4.0|Resident Evil: DVD Review<br /><br />Grade: B-<br /><br />O.K.--I'll admit it. I stayed away from everything Resident Evil for a while, passing them off as lame movies, unnecessary books, and lack-luster video games. I really don't know what motivated me; it was just something I never bothered with. Boy, was I wrong. Although the first live action film--this one--definitely has it's problems, I am now what you could call, or as close as a living person could get to obsessed with the RE universe. I've now seen all the movies, ([[ASIN:B0002J4X1Q Resident Evil (Deluxe Edition)]], [[ASIN:0767834739 Resident Evil - Apocalypse (Special Edition)]], [[ASIN:B000YPUF9W Resident Evil - Extinction (Widescreen Special Edition)]]) played the [[ASIN:B000P297F2 Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles]] and [[ASIN:B000P46NKC Resident Evil 4]], am currently playing [[ASIN:B00269DXXO Resident Evil Archives: Resident Evil]], am going to watch [[ASIN:B001I9XOQO Resident Evil: Degeneration]], and I have just checked out three of the novels from the library, [[ASIN:0671024418 City of the Dead (Resident Evil #3)]], [[ASIN:0671024426 Underworld  (Resident Evil #4)]], and [[ASIN:067178496X Nemesis (Resident Evil #5)]]. (Oh, and I'm patiently waiting for the Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles....)<br /><br />Now back to the movie--yep, you heard me, it has its flaws. Alice is the head of security at a top-secret base miles underground called \\"the Hive\\", a secret, high-tech facility owned and operated by the Umbrella Corporation. The scientists there specialize in bioengineering and viral weaponry; and one morning their T-Virus, a virus which revitalizes dead cells and has it's side effects, is unleashed on the unsuspecting workers there. Now a team of highly elite trained officers must infiltrate the Hive and find out what went on down there. They stumble upon Alice who can't recall who is she and what she is doing there; they bring her along anyway. They open the Hive, and almost immediately stumble upon the dangers in there...Did I mention the \\"side effects\\" that may occur are A: death, B: waking up again after dying, due to the virus revitalizing dead cells--there for reviving you, and C: after you wake up, you want to eat something, namely, people. And that means that our people down in the Hive are in serious trouble.<br /><br />Now of course the actors play it cool, going through the clich&eacute;d motions, and getting picked off one by one. Milla Jovovich, soon to be seen in A Perfect Getaway, is sort of bland is this movie (although she gets into the grove of her role in Apocalypse and Extinction, giving excellent performances), and doesn't really do much. (Well, aside from doing the Matrix on some wickedly awesome zombie dogs.) Michelle Rodriguez on the other hand seems to always have a dirty look on her face; when she's not shooting zombies, she's busy pouting. All the other actors that had potential die to early in the movie...<br /><br />That brings us to the special effects: surprisingly varied, they range from awesome (the zombie dogs, which are a mixture of CGI and make-up, are realistic and ferocious), to mediocre--the Licker, a monster that terrorizes the group towards the end of the movie, looks straight out of the video-game, graphics wise. I would say they could have done way better, but the special effects group started work on the Licker late, therefore it wasn't exactly up to par. (They solved this problem in Apocalypse though; they started working on the Lickers during pre-production.) As for the zombies--they have a ton of detail, and it looks like they seriously put some time into them.  After sending the actors to a \\"zombie boot camp\\", they intricately placed their details, creating effective and creepy zombies.  Bravo to the special effects team on that--you need it after that horrible Licker.<br /><br />Now I'll also admit--I was going to give this an even lower grade, but decided the positives-negatives canceled each other out. The positive? I loved the ending. Although it too obviously sets up for a sequel, I just loved it. It has a desolate, creepy feel to it, and it kind of assured me that the sequel would be better. The negative? The editor should have been fired. It almost seems as if whole scenes are left out; therefore the movie at times gets highly confusing. For example: Alice and Matt--an environmentalist who befriends Alice--are talking in a room. The next moment they are running from a horde of zombies! How did THAT happen? After examples like this happen at least three times throughout the movie, I got fed up. They should be happy they made the ending so good...<br /><br />So, in the end, is Resident Evil really the best effort they could have given? The answer is no, but it still has its fun moments. Whether it's seeing the zombie dogs, getting scared by a random loud noise, or seeing elevators kill people in particularly gruesome ways, Resident Evil still packs a (mild) punch.it too obviously sets up for a sequel, I just loved it.

B000002TQV|5.0|Radiohead<br />The Bends; 1995<br />EMI/Capitol Records<br /><br />My Rating: 10/10<br /><br />We all know the story by now: one-hit wonder mope-rockers fated to follow their alterna-rock debut into oblivion go and record an album of beautiful, esoteric, and glorious Brit-rock, humbly putting loud-mouths like Oasis and Blur to shame. Where PABLO HONEY sounded a bit too rehearsed and over-produced, herein the band manage to let her breathe just enough to capture 12 cuts over-flowing with heart and vigor. Producer John Leckie wisely guided the band to emphasize their noisy streak, utilizing just as many live recordings as in-studio sessions.  Every song here could have been a single at the time, and every song is literally perfect. Simply put, one of the greatest rock records ever created. \\"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\\" is the greatest album closer in the history of rock music. \\"Creep?\\" Never heard of it.<br /><br />TRACKS:<br />1.

0385341008|2.0|I know I am in the minority here, but I really did not enjoy this book.  While the book did have a few interesting and quaint stories to tell, I never felt totally invested in the book.  The book itself highlighted the problem when Juliet's publisher tells her that she needs a narrator to bring the book together.  And ultimately, I do think this is what is wrong with the book.  A single narrator would have unified this book for me and would likely have helped me to care more about the characters.
B000001DTM|5.0|U2<br />Achtung, Baby; 1991<br />Island Records<br /><br />My Rating: 10/10<br /><br />In the four years between THE JOSHUA TREE and ACHTUNG, BABY, the world around U2 radically changed in a hundred different ways. Corrupt political regimes were falling all over the world, disparate cultures were beginning to converge in a universalist mish-mash, and the old guard of rock and roll was forgotten in favor of fresher, more idealistic sounds. U2 certainly faced the possibility of their own extinction - if it could happen to others, it could certainly happen to them. But like fellow alterna-rock heroes R.E.M., U2 somehow managed to not only find its own place in the music revolution, but to ride said revolution to the top of the charts with another classic album. In fact, ACHTUNG, BABY not only achieves classic status, but manages to capture the international zeitgeist of the early-90's like no other record, combining sounds as disparate as garage rock, euro-pop, and world beat into a completely cohesive and romantic aural experience. The collision of worlds - in this case post-modern relativism with a definite hunger for spiritual experience - is once again U2's thematic recipe for success. ACHTUNG, BABY is doubtless one of the band's top 3 albums, and in the opinion of this humble reviewer, probably their best.<br /><br />1. Zoo Station (4/5)<br />2.

0307588335|5.0|Anybody with a 401k, working for a public company, who refinanced their house, or thought they could outsmart the market can look back and ask themselves how could I have missed that? It's that sinking feeling knowing that you saw some of the cracks and fissures in the fundamentals but ignored them because of haste, short-term greed and self doubt. This book puts that feeling into words. Yes, of course, the author has perfect hindsight. But, it's the organization of the story that makes it so poignant and important. This book showcases the historic facts that were overlooked by the trusted mortgage and credit risk takers but should never be overlooked again. Business school instructors should make this a monitory read.     I give Mr. McDonald a lot of credit for seeing some of doomsday signs as they happened and did what he could to balance the risk and protect the investors. I don't know that most people working well below the 31st floor would have done the same with \\"other peoples' money.\\" Clearly, that was the problem.     This book has been an inspiration.

0060555661|5.0|I started investing because I was very unhappy with all my portfolios. I managed several thousands of dollars of my own and kept finding myself making one bad decision after another. I used all the nifty research tools. Paid for all the newsletters. Went to investing meetings. I kept loosing money. I stumbled across this daunting book and was determined to read it. It was like reading and great text book with awesome insights added in between chapters. I started to apply my new found knowledge and found myself actually beating the market. Then the bottom dropped out and in 2008. I was a lucky one. I had hedged my assets and when everything became discounted I had enough in my warchest to attack. I am very happy with the advice. I avoided a lot of pains, heartache and emotional attachment. I also learned that people that don't put there money up are speculators, as is anyone that has not read this book. It really makes investing simple and calculated. I recommend it to all investors of any style. It enhances your strengths and adds a couple new ones!

B001NERPHS|5.0|The Basement Tapes makes me feel warm and comfortable, like putting on a warm flannel blanket on a chilly night.  The songs are relaxed and low-key, with an unpretentious style that invites the listener into this timeless collection of real Americana tunes.  Many of the songs feel like they could have been written in the 1800's, they have such a timeless quality.      As far as the actual music, most of the songs are generally what you could call folk-rock, in that eclectic style The Band did so well.  The singing is relaxed and pleasant, with none of the vicious snarl that Dylan had used when he moved from acoustic folk to electric.  I think a lot of the charm of this album is because the musicians believed they were only recording rough demos that were never meant for public release.  Hence, there was no pressure to be perfect.  But what perfection they achieved in their relaxed, low-fi setting.  If you like The Band, you will like this album.  If you like Dylan, you will like this album.  Even if you don't like The Band or Dylan, you may still like this album, which stands as a unique musical accomplishment.
B000WOWWXC|5.0|Frances the Mute is (For The Mars Volta) a challenging piece of music. Though it is an album, I hesitate to use the word, mainly because an album consits of songs, and there are no songs on this album, just more organized pieces of sound strategically place in a sea of noise. This album is a dense concept album whose story is quite difficult to decipher. It involves a man (Vismund Cygnus) and his search for his birth parents, and is a tale of addiction, abandonment, and eventual revelation regarding the real meaning of family. Lyrically, it's on par with any other Mars Volta album, employing the same verbosity and indecipherability, further adding to the confusion. Some critics will mock the Volta for Cedric's unusual lyrics, saying that he's really just adding words like \\"cuticle\\" and \\"taxidermist\\" to seem deep, but the lyrics really are deep, and each bit of what seems like nonsense may be either a convoluted metaphor or a red herring. The instrumentation on this album is wonderful, with amazing guitar and frantic, complex drumming throughout. It is composed of five distinct segments or \\"songs\\". \\"Cygnus...Vismund Cygnus\\" provides a wonderfully complicated and thoroughly heavy introduction, split asunder by a great canyon of quiet jamming. The second track, \\"The Widow\\" is the shortest of the five segments. It's a slow piece with a great chorus and some nice horns in the background. Then it's back to the heavy rock and roll of \\"Cygnus\\" with the third segment, \\"L'Via L'Viaquez\\". The majority of this song is sung in Spanish, and the chorus conveys a sense of desperation and melancholy. The next track, \\"Miranda that Ghost Just isn't Holy Anymore\\" is another slow, sad number, which takes quite a long time to get going, but gets there in the end, with more horns and another memorable chorus. The last composition on this colossal masterpiece is the thirty-two minute \\"Cassandra Gemini\\". This is really the only way that an album of this magnitude could ever really come to a concise and justifiable end. It follows a similar pattern to \\"Cygnus\\", just magnified and saturated, as the jams are longer, the heavy moments are more complex, and the build-up throughout is glacial and perfectly composed.concise and justifiable end.

B00005JL0I|3.0|I did not enjoy this film when I first saw it on television, because of the incoherent plot, but my opinion has changed after watching it again years later on DVD.  After all, this is the only James Bond film that unabashedly makes fun of the world of 007 through sarcasm and slapstick, and incorporates the psychedelic atmosphere of the mid to late 1960s, with an all star cast including David Niven, Peter Sellers, Deborah Kerr, William Holden, Orson Welles, Woody Allen and Ursula Andress, arguably the best known Bond girl and only actress to appear in both an official Bond movie (Dr. No) and an unofficial one.  The musical score is pleasant, topped off by Dusty Springfield's memorable rendition of \\"The Look of Love\\".  Casino Royale is a welcomed alternative to the dark and humorless official Bond entries of Timothy Dalton and now Daniel Craig.  Life is frequently somber and challenging, let's at least have fun when watching 007.    Even if you dislike this movie, you may still want to purchase it to complement your James Bond collection, and for the bonus material; the 1954 CBS television program Casino Royale, the first ever 007 production for either TV or cinema that features American actor Barry Nelson (not Sean Connery) as the first James Bond, Linda Christian the first Bond girl, and Peter Lorre the first Bond villian.
B0028DRGDQ|4.0|Rec is comparable to that of The Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield with one camera filming all the action. A young female TV reporter and her cameraman are covering the night shift at the local fire station. (Yummy hot firefighters!) The fire station receives a call about an old woman trapped in her apartment. They go to the building and the old woman is bloody and out of control. She attacks one of the firefighters by biting is neck as if he is a steak. She is ravenous. They are able to take her down but can't leave the building. The police have locked up the people inside, which includes the reporter, her cameraman, some police, EMTs and the firemen who arrived on the scene first. They have been quarantined inside the building. No one has any idea what is going on until one by one the building's residents become like the old woman, enraged and hungry for human flesh.<br /><br />Rec taps deeply into the viewer's fears. We see everything from the cameraman's view. He keeps filming the carnage and zombie attack that takes place in this building. Not even children are immune. There is one little girl and her mother who will be taken out if they start to show any zombie like reactions. No one can get out. If anyone tries to escape, they will be shot and killed. This virus must be contained so it doesn't go out into the world. Unfortunately those unlucky enough to be in the building are living on borrowed time.<br /><br />Rec is very much like Night of the Living Dead. Where as Night of the Living Dead had people closed up in a farm house trying to stay safe from the undead trying to get in, Rec has the same idea, but the twist is that the zombies are lurking inside. The question is how to escape them and not end up dead or become one of them?<br /><br />Horror movies need to evolve. It is become harder for people to enjoy them or be scared. After watching so many through the years, you become immune to the senseless murders and death. Even though Rec has great moments of gore and bloodshed, it gives us great psychological look into people and how they will react if they know all hope is lost. You come to care for these people, especially the reporter and her camera man because you see their fears grow. You don't want them to suffer and die.<br /><br />The intimacy in the way Rec was filmed makes it work on so many levels. There are no big special effects or even music to set the tone. The viewer becomes part of the movie. And when it is all said and done, the viewer is the last witness and the only one to know what really happened and why.<br /><br />Want to be sacred stupid? Watch Rec. If I ever am in an apartment building and somebody is foaming at the mouth, I will be running the opposite way to my own home, safe and sound.<br /><br />Katiebabsit gives us great psychological look into people and how they will react if they know all hope is lost.

B002BX4VEK|5.0|I had this CD when it first came out (had the vinyl album for years and years).  Then I got THE MEMPHIS RECORD.  Then the anthology SUSPICIOUS MINDS.  They all included the same songs here, a few more in one, a different line-up in another...but I will definitely will be getting this newly remastered 2-CD set.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />Because Elvis never sang any better.  I will make an exception for his gospel recordings, because I really think Elvis believed he was doing what God wanted him to do in Life when he sang gospel.  In the 1968 Singer Comeback Special, he was fueled by fear that he couldn't win his public back and he was great then.  And before he knew he had us along, there were songs during his Vegas comeback that he completely threw himself into (like \\"Bridge Over Troubled Waters\\" from THAT'S THE WAY IT IS).<br /><br />But I honestly believe you can hear this man's soul in the songs in FROM ELVIS IN MEMPHIS.  I've heard \\"Long Black Limousine\\" my entire life but I still can get choked up listening to it.  For Elvis, it was all about connecting with the listeners, giving himself to the emotion and pulling that from everyone who heard him.<br /><br />I read in the Garulnick biography (a great read, btw--if I spelled the author's name correctly) that Elvis \\"performed\\" during his recording sessions.  He liked to stand in the middle of the studio with the musicians all around him so he could feel all the instruments all at once.  He hated singing to recorded music in a booth because he \\"couldn't feel it.\\"  The session musicians would marvel at his movements and performance in a recording studio as if he were onstage.  Getting to the emotions of the song, expressing all the pain and power and feeling.<br /><br />I still hear that in this music.  I still hear the king at his best.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I would never have thought a book on running (ah...so boring and repetitive) could be so engrossing. The book winds its way like a great novel - a compelling look into a secretive tribe, an adventure into the jungles of south america, and then leading up to the grand finale, an ultimate race in the mountains -- with some twists/reveals and hilarious moments thrown in for good measure. The pacing of this book is perfect and it weaves its way through crazy characters, scientific research, to historical stories and back again effortlessly - it's pretty amazing. I don't recall being ever bored while reading this book. But it's not all flulf - I came out with a better understanding of running, biomechanics and how I look at exercise and life itself. Highly recommended for runners but I would bet even non-runners will be pulled in by this amazing book. Go get it!

0634089358|5.0|This is an excellent bass book, a great study of the blues and how the bass functions within the genre. The author breaks the genre down clearly and provides exercises that have real world examples. It's great that he describes the example and points to a song that exemplifies the technique used. (I put together a nice blues playlist using the examples in this book.) The author moves us gradually through levels of complexity and finishes the lesson off nicely by providing a section of several blues standards that are most likely to be called out at a gig. The examples are provided on the CD and are great little jams in themselves, very entertaining. The bass track on the CD is provided on one side. Tabbed notation is included, which speeds things up for those of us with limited time reading music. To get a grip on blues bass, get this book.

1905654294|5.0|Stephenie Meyer cannot be discredited for what phenomenon she has created in the literary world. I mean, to have the ability to make millions of otherwise illiterate teenage girls pick up any book, let alone the text-book worthy twilight volumes, is really baffling in itself. The profits from the Twilight juggernaut themselves can bring California out of debt. She may not be a strong writer, but the woman sure is an economist.    Meyer's concepts were fresh and intriguing in the beginning of her career, but plateaud somewhere immediately after Twilight. This explains the dissapointment felt by fans who were expecting just as much vigor in volume 4 as they found in book one. It's like a new boyfriend. You fall for him, his hair, the idea of him, etc. But by the fourth month, you're getting less and less fond of him, his \\"spend-all-morning-in-the-bathroom-getting-ready\\" hair, and teh general idea of his presence. You stay with him because you're hoping you can rekindle what you had in the beginning.     In short, Stephenie Meyer's Breaking Dawn has had success in part to riding the coat tails of the Twilight hype and also because of the extreme committment of the fans(something I like to call TWIHILISM). I personally loved the book. Try it. If you don't like it, return it.

B00275EGWO|4.0|The Hurt Locker rolls across a gritty wasteland of rocky sand and onto the screen and engages the viewer at once. Visual shots flash out from the point of view (POV) of an autobot, a Humvee and the voluntary, three-man explosive ordinance disposal team. They are there to diffuse a bomb. A sense of danger and an almost palpable tension comes from an intense surveillance of scanning from behind rifle scopes and helmet visors. The editor Bob Murawski (TV series American Gothic) seamlessly fuses the images of the men and the dusty location together in such a way that keeps the action at a contrarily slow but steady anxiety inducing pace. The viewer doesn't know who any one soldier is at this point. Individuals don't matter; the unit matters. Thus Kathryn Bigelow's (Near Dark, Strange Days and Point Break) decision to use talented actors who might not be recognized immediately really works for the film. The team leader suits up. He heads out and about ten minutes later? Kaboom! The first of several explosions comes. In a thunder of death it launches a section of ground in Bagdad 2004 helter skelter. Then it unearths the ground in a dramatic slow motion close up. The film, The Hurt Locker begins.<br /><br />The title is actually a phrase that journalist/screenwriter heard while embedded with a unit in Iraq, The Hurt Locker.  It is a place of ultimate pain. Being in Iraq in a war isn't what hurts, though at one point one of them says \\"If you're in Iraq, you're dead.\\" No. The soldiers expect the hardships of being stationed in a warzone. Each soldier's locker is opened up and his psychological anguish is revealed as they go through the rigors of living in truly barren surroundings while participating in the OED unit and trying to cope with one another's quirks. Mark Boal's dialogue is sparse, but meaningful and intelligent. There are a couple of predictable or clich&eacute; scenes such as the interaction with the foreigners they run into in the desert (no spoiler), the \\"drunken buddies\\" wrestling and the psychiatrist's trip. For the remaining, two hours his script runs by without any jars. He cleverly takes his characters whose goal is completing the rotation alive and pits them against something amazingly simple but complex, time. Every now and then the remaining days stretches across the screen to mark it. When it read \\"two days\\" the audience let out a tense collective gasp and a sigh.<br /><br />The Hurt Locker is not in any way a film extolling the virtues of American soldiers abroad. There were only a couple of flags and there was no great adulation of the U.S. or any scenes of Iraqi's expressing obsequious gratitude. In many ways it isn't even a military film. The men are portrayed as men who doing a job. It is also not about military camaraderie. In fact, the men do not really like one another, but they suck up their differences for the sake of the team. It could be any job or sport's team, but the stakes for not following through in this case are high...death.  The three soldiers who, in military tradition, go by their surnames are: Staff Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner) and his subordinates Sergeant J.T. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty). It would have been really easy to simply play these roles as stereotypes, but each actor brought the various dimensions of his character to light. They all put in believable performances. Surprisingly Ralph Feinnes turns up in the small role of a foreign contractor Team Leader.<br /><br />The Hurt Locker is raw and realistic but not raucous. It is very quiet at times due to the intelligent use of music only when necessary. There is an incredible power in silence and film composer Marco Beltrami exploited those moments and respected the images by employing a light touch with the music. There is at least one instance where the moment smacks of the Wild West, and it sounds as though Beltrami may be giving a nod to the Western. For the most part, the music does exactly what it should, it supports the film. There are only one or two instances where it is quite loud, and it should be.<br /><br />Kathryn Bigelow directs with an almost visible control: juxtapose the young kids' faces with those of the soldiers here; contrast the relaxed residents in loose flowing clothes hanging over balconies with the stressed soldiers in their tight uniforms poised with their guns aimed. The end result is a gorgeous psychological drama told in the fluid flow of shots of the monotone desert splattered with patterns of fatigues, splashes of the occasional turquoise, or pools of blood.  The end result is a wonderfully-told tale of being human and being a soldier in The Hurt Locker.sic does exactly what it should, it supports the film.

B00065GX64|5.0|From the elongated opening scene of \\"M\\", you know you are in for more than a simple film could ever imagine.  The elongated lunch scene as a mother waits for her daughter to return, as we, audience members watch the daughter stray from her journey home with a stranger with a sharpened whistle.  It is foreboding, it is depressing, it is mesmerizing.  It has been a very long time since a film, especially one made 78 years ago, seemed so delicate, so thought provoking, so timeless as \\"M\\" does.  From these opening shots, Lang let's us know that this isn't going to be your happy utopia where criminals are caught the next day by the police and our world goes back to liquorish and lollipops, but instead a world where the locals collect like a mob and trust is thrown violently out of the window.  With excellent cinematography and a strong balance between humor and honesty, Lang creates this visceral world where the line between truth and justice get blurred, where good and evil are similar, and a man defines his actions as \\"uncontrollable\\".  This merely scratches the surface of \\"M\\", a masterful film that ranks amongst the best this world has offered.<br /><br />What makes \\"M\\" shoot ahead of anything modern, anything by cult directors, anything close to popular?  It begins with the actors, goes to the man behind the camera, and finally the skillful craftsmanship of the story.  Each of these elements never lack, never fall behind, and constantly build upon each other until that final breath that encourages you to repetitively rewatch.  To begin, Peter Lorre.  How could you not talk about \\"M\\" without mentioning this doe-eyed murderer.  From the beginning, we know his role in this film, yet Lang pulls every emotion out of us as we follow his route.  We feel sympathy for Lorre when he is tried, we feel scared when he is trapped in the attic, we feel hatred when he voyeuristically looks at the children - and yet, he isn't the only character in this film.  Lang introduces us to other well placed personas throughout.  The infamous Inspector Lohmann (not to mention that great floor-up shot) is the perfect example of Lang's impressions on the local German police.  The fact that Lohmann whistles, counter productive to what Lorre represents, only solidifies that idea.  To add to these already dynamic people, we have the background criminals that decide to take the matter into their own hands in hopes to eliminate the looming police presence.  The \\"Safecracker\\" is idealistic of what Germany was to become, the classic SS look, with the idea of eliminating the opportunity to be tried in a true court of law.  Each one of these characters provide humor, excitement, and full-blown emotion to the screen, adding to the overall impact to this film.<br /><br />With Lorre already bedazzling us with his range and taut emotion, it is up to Fritz Lang himself to ensure that edits, angles, and direction doesn't hinder the power of his actors.  Lang steps up to the plate and delivers with his avant-garde film making.  I use the words avant-garde because the techniques used in this film are far beyond 1931.  Lang incorporates powerful close-ups, amazing track following, and shots nearly unseen at this time.  The overhead shots, the ability to make the crowds look ravenous, the camera puns adds just as much as another lead would.  If you were impressed by his ability in \\"Metropolis\\", \\"M\\" is only going to solidify that idea of Lang.  A favorite is the raid on the office complex by a group of criminals.  Every shot, every detail is directed with ease, but complexity.  It is easy to be in awe of this film, but to take the time to see Lang's ability behind the camera will take \\"M\\" to a whole new level.  Personally, it is my belief, that he announces himself with this film.  A pioneer of the camera, a grandfather of what cinema is today - one cannot watch anything released today and not see Lang's influences.  See Fincher's \\"Zodiac\\", a nearly identical film in themes to what Lang was trying to produce here.<br /><br />Finally, we have acting and direction, but one must also credit the story for being not just creative and unflinchingly original, but for supporting a strong message.  The idea of being more careful was impressive to watch due to the time being 1931, a time well thought of that children could be anywhere without any worry.  The story brings evil into an American thought that good guys always prevail, that suburbia is always safe, and that the police actually do keep the streets safe.  The story of \\"M\\" challenges you as a viewer even today, one could argue even more so today than in 1931.  With crimes continually on the rise in this country, with the idea that pleading insanity cures the disease of murder (or is an easy innocence) the idea of \\"M\\", especially that final dialogue seems more important today.  The fascination also arises with the concept of the mob within this story - the horror that simple events, kindness even, could turn on anyone in a moment of panic.  Police arresting anyone that even looks at children in a peculiar way - a fascinating concept that Lang is not afraid to develop.  Imagine if this film were made two years later, what a different theme Lang would have tackled.<br /><br />To conclude, I loved, perhaps loved is a soft word, I worship this film.  It is intensely powerful and timelessly accurate for a 78-year old film.  I cannot wait to watch it again - not only to bath in Lang's glory, but to really see if the \\"true\\" killer was caught.  There is plenty left unknown, and I just want to ensure that points connect.  This is a slice of cinema that could be watched again and again, knowing that something new would be encountered each time.  A deeply enticing film, Fritz Lang proves that he was a ground breaker in his field.  Not only could he handle Science Fiction, but nearly every other genre imaginable.  \\"M\\" is no exception to his skill.  If you have not seen this film, watch it - experience it - know what it means to be marked like Lorre.<br /><br />Grade: ***** out of *****s trying to produce here.

0307341569|2.0|I didn't like this book.    I honestly cannot say why, because there is nothing obviously bad about it, but neither is there anything that I found particularly appealing.  I was not inordinately bored but I was not excited either.  I've actually struggled to write this review because I could not pinpoint what made this book so unappealing to me.    I do not think it is because of the darkness:  it IS dark but I have read books as dark or darker without a problem.  I did think that a lot of time was spent establishing the protagonist as troubled and the brother as perhaps not guilty.  But the pacing was not horrid either.  I have read books that proceeded much more slowly than this.    The thing I have come up with is that I do not like the main character.  The author has painted a complex woman with issues and complaints and gripes and likes and dislikes and needs and wants and issues (yes, it was worth a repeat).  So it certainly is not because she is one-dimensional.  I find though that despite this, I have little sympathy or empathy for her though everything written about her calls for one or the other if not both.  I just don't like her.  And since all revolves around her, I find myself uninterested in her and therefore the events surrounding her.    I am taking pains to say all this because while I cannot recommend this book, I also find it difficult to say 'don't read it'.  Even as opinion, this particular opinion seems based less on any concrete failing of the book/author/writing than to some undefinable personal \\"thing\\" that should really probably not be used to make up the minds of any other reader.    I think the best thing I can do here is say: if you think you want to try it, go ahead.      I can't bash it.  All I can say is despite a formula that usually works for me, this book isn't my cup of tea.

B001FB55H6|1.0|VIOLENT, boring, endless, a waste of time.  I quit watching after an hour.  My husband gave up after 2 hours.  He said it was a torturous endless ending.
B001W79MBI|5.0|There's not much I can add to the already great reviews. I will say that there is no sexual content. There is a brief nude scene but not much is shown. I'll also add that young children should not watch this only because there is a lot of blood, limbs cut off and one scene of torcher. But really this is an absolutly spectacular movie. It's well worth the money, good story line and for a change, the story does end quite decently, it doesn't just let you hang there wondering what the hell happened or will happen. Hope this very short review was helpful. For another sectacular anime series that's well done and worth seeing check out Samurai 7.[[ASIN:B0018RCN54 Samurai 7: Box Set (Viridian Collection)]]
B000IOM1Y6|5.0|Had this in cassette a while ago and it was stolen; therefore, I am very pleased to be in possession of a great album once again.
B0011NVC98|3.0|This movie could have been really good. The animation was good but it actually lacked colour where it should have had more. I feel like they were trying to create an atmosphere here but just didn't quite make it with this film. The actors were good but could have been better. I suspect this movie could have been better directed. Otherwise, it is an okay film. I'd give it about a C plus at best<br />if it were on a grading system. I got bored about half way through the film and wished the ending would have been a bit different. If they had better music for the film, it might have created a better atmosphere for the story.
B0025X4P24|5.0|First off folks, this is on Blue Note, it's a Jazz vocal album.  If you are looking for Pop this isn't your album.  Ms Williams has recorded a fine album in The Real Thing which shows off her exceptional vocal talent.  As some have said there is a variety of styles on this album traditional to modern.  This not only helps to showcase Ms Williams talent but keeps things interesting as well.  My favorite stand out tracks are I Fell In, the title track, and, Lazy Afternoon is not only a nice song but I can relate to the sentiment.  The Real Thing is the type of album you put on, sit in your listening chair, relax and enjoy the performance.  I don't think it's fair to rate this album based on what you thought it should be but rather what it is.  And, what it is, an outstanding vocal album.  Hope she decides to do more of this in the future<br /><br />The recording has a nice sound stage with the instruments nicely spread out across it.  Nothing overlaps or covers any detail.  Ms Williams vocals are nicely done and balanced with the accompanying music.  If I had to criticize the sound it would be that it comes off as a studio album.  Meaning, I don't get the live in the studio feeling from the background instruments.  For instance, the strings are off to the left, properly balanced and mixed but they don't have that floating or live presentation like strings on some Jazz or Classical recordings.  But this is not the type of thing most listeners would pay any attention to.  Nor, would it even be noticed unless played on exceptional hi fi gear.

B00006JKOM|4.0|Jethro Tull took a lot of heat when this one came out in 1976, and Ian Anderson confirms this in the updated (2002) liner notes of this cd version.  The title of this album was not supposed to imply that Jethro Tull were Too old...etc, but rather the central figure in the enclosed cartoon and story that backs it.  Ian and Co. were around age 29-30 when they released this album.  Mere babies!!   Is that too old?  Never!      I think the issue was that the lead character in the cartoon sort of resembles Ian Anderson.    The album itself has many high points and somehow has earned it's place into that lower-echelon of the Tull catalog for millions of Tull fans.   So what happened?  Is it too \\"different?\\"  Not hard rocking enough for some?  It does have a few similarities to the previous year's \\"Minstrel in the Gallery\\" (1975) but doesn't have the bite.  It certainly does stray away from anything pre-Warchild.  Since the following year's \\"Songs from the Wood\\" (1977) would be an entirely new direction for the band with more folk-based rock than ever, this album seems to stand alone in a category of it's own as it captures not only some mid-70s rock n roll but also showing us exactly where Jethro Tull stood circa 1976.  New bassist John Glascock debuts here, taking over for Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond.  This would be the only change in staff from 1972-79.    Taxi Grab is one of the best songs Tull I've ever heard.  This song alone is worth the price of admission.  Quizz Kid is also amazing, as is Salamander, Big Dipper, Pied Piper, A Small Cigar (with a lovely piano by David Palmer) and the bonus track \\"Strip Cartoon\\" is pretty good.  The album does have some forgettable tracks IMO, but others will almost certainly disagree.      I must say that the title track is not one of my favs but that was the hit single this album generated.      Fans of liner notes and CD booklets take note.  This re-release features excellent photos, Ian's notes as always, lyrics, a cool cover, and agreat color scheme.  Love the yellow!  Easy to spot, that's for sure.      Overall, I'd give it a 7/10.  It's a fun listen indeed, and closes the book on an era that gives way to the next two awesome releases by Jethro Tull -- Songs from the Wood and Heavy Horses.
B001P9EQH8|2.0|I truly have to respect the E5 and the good people who made it available in the US at such a low price.  You get better-than-average build quality and ergonomics (though the accessory cables are a bit cheap).  The one thing that you don't get is much improvement in sound quality.  While I don't have the software and instrumentation to verify my suspicions, some other purchasers and reviewers have put this amp to the test and report a somewhat-startling rise in gain above 500 Hz.  Anybody who has ever sold hi-fi equipment knows that adding a few dB of volume in that range will make ANY piece of equipment (cough, cough) sound more attractive in an \\"A-B\\" demonstration.  (How do you think I made my quota each month?) And herein lies the problem...the E5 is not really so much a headphone amplifier as it is an active tone control.  Frankly, the gain (volume increase) on the unit is pretty limited and it does nothing for my better-quality headphones.  It just doesn't have any guts.  What's more, it has a noticeable hiss from the electronic circuit.  Now, you may not notice this right away, but it's there.  There are also any number of other nice CMOY amplifiers out there that will exhibit virtually NO hiss at any volume level, and they're priced about the same as the E5 (at the price shown on this website).  In summary, the E5 can make your headphones sound a bit more attractive, if you have the right \\"taste\\" and happen to have a set of compatible headphones.  I just think that you could spend a few $$$ more and get a very-good to excellent headphone amplifier instead.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I am almost at the 30 day mark, and I am in awe that I have found a workout that I can really stick with!  It is hard to make an excuse when the workout is only 20 minutes long... and even with 2 children under 3, I have made time every single day to exercise, thanks to Jillian.  That doesn't mean I look forward to it each morning- this stuff is WORK!    To give some background: I have worked my way through all 3 levels.  I spent 5 days at level 1 (just enough time for the extreme soreness in my calves to burn off!) then spent 2 weeks at level 2.  Though level 2 never became easy, I decided to push it to level 3, where I have been for a week and a half.    I started this DVD being in decent shape, just flabbier than I used to be.  I am now definitely firmer, stronger and have much better endurance than just 4 weeks ago.  However, I have not come close to losing 20 pounds... more like 4.  That being said, I tend to gain muscle easily, and I do seem more trim these days.  I am disappointed to not be losing weight faster, but I am very glad that I now have a daily exercise routine.  I did substitute 1 day of cycling (45 minutes) for 1 level 3 workout, and the 'day off' for most of my muscles helped me feel a little less muscle-fatigue during my level 3 workout the next day.  Though I don't have a 6-pack (yet!), this was a great investment- not only does it kick my butt every single morning... I actually DO it every single morning!  It has gotten me into a great habit, and I am very, very glad I got it.
B00005S6K8|5.0|Sydney Pollack's remake of the movie starring Humphrey Bogart, Audrey Hepburn and William Holden is very well done. Aside from some mild language, the movie is family-friendly. The plot is probably familiar to even those who haven't seen the original version directed by Billy Wilder (I sure haven't), but the remake is very entertaining, humorous, engaging and...words simply fail to describe this enjoyable confection of a movie. Indiana Jones himself, Julia Ormond and Greg Kinnear star.<br />Everyone involved in this movie did a wonderful job. And...John Williams, what else can be said? The man is simply another Mozart in composing music for movies (virtually every film for Steven Spielberg, the \\"STAR WARS\\" movies, \\"Superman: The Movie,\\" etc); his work is simply brilliant. Everything he touches turns to gold. Enough said. Be prepared to find your heart. Rated PG for mild language.

0307588335|5.0|What a page turner!  I was moved, inspired and educated.  I know many people at Lehman Brothers and I have spoken to members of the risk committee that helped McDonald provide one of the most riveting inside stories ever written about a Wall St. investment bank.  As an avid reader I am amazed at how many financial books these days are written by academics and journalists.  McDonald was there on the front lines and made millions shorting subprime time bombs like New Century and Countrywide, I felt like I was right there with him.  This is a real human story that keeps you interested and turning pages NOT some boring pile of depressing complicated financial dribble.  McDonald and Robinson have clearly written this book for main street, they make the complicated simple.  Anyone can enjoy this book!
B001GCUNYO|5.0|Had put off buying this because of the short (91 minutes) duration.  The disk went on sale at a local store so I decided to take a chance  because I have always like Liam Neeson. He was great in Michael Collins.  Highly recommend this for the action. Some of the brutal behavior exhibited  by Liam the father of a young girl who was abducted for the slave trade is  believable but shocking. He gets the job done.

It still managed to be one of my favorite movies! Any fan of the Wolverine character will absolutely enjoy this film. Hugh Jackman plays him to the T. Bottom line, if you enjoyed the XMEN series movies, you'll enjoy this film.

0142001104|5.0|This is a feel good, motivational book but also with substantive advice, illustrative examples, and actionable tips.  I am keeping The Art of Possibility in the front of my reference shelf.  I may be biased as a former classical musician because the Zanders are artists (Benjamin conducts the Boston Philharmonic) so the creative and music stories really resonate with me.  But I think their easygoing and fun storytelling will hook anyone.    With 12 memorable frameworks to help the reader embrace Possibility as way of approaching life, The Art of Possibility is practical as well as motivational.  There are many gems:  Rule Number 6 for not taking yourself too seriously; Giving Way to Passion memorably encapsulated in Benjamin Zander's story of the one-buttocked pianist (you have to read the anecdote to get the full flavor); and Being the Board about taking responsibility are just a few of my favorites.  I love the index of anecdotes at the end of the book so you know exactly where to find the one-buttocked pianist (page 118 in my edition) and all of your favorites.     This is a must read.  I read a lot of business, self-help, non-fiction books and this is at the top of the list.  In this down market where anxiety and doom and gloom rule, this is an even more important and transformational read now.

B001FB4W0W|1.0|The graphics on the cover are awesome!  That is where the good part of the review stops.  The show could have been fantastic but the acting is less than b film quality - and it seems that the writers did all they could to throw in vivid sex scenes everywhere they could - including adding more that were not even in the story.  Just for the \\"SEX\\".  The problem is that what they did took away from the original series.  Never did it say that Vampire blood would give a person a hard on.  And where the heck in the book was Lafayette a drug dealer.  The makers of the series took a great story and did all they could to make it something worse than the worse redneck trailer park you have ever seen - smothered with porn, major liberties.  It was so ridiculous that the stupidity of it made it comical (almost - Or I should say I had found myself vomiting in my mouth more than once.) I could not even complete the series.  Just when I thought it would get better - it had to - it got worse.  Finally, enough was enough.<br /><br />There is a thought that has been heard - Have you ever watched a show and felt like you came out Stupider than before you watched it?  - Well this is what can be said of this series.

As Paul completes the rite of passage from child to man a new generation make their mark and it all begins in Dune.  Rarely, does a story capture me from the beginning like Herbert does here. The characters leave an indelible mark on the reader and move the story at a brisk pace. This is not an average sci-fi story. It has many levels of religious, political and ecological overtones that still hold significant meaning in today' world. I highly reccomend this brilliant Hugo and Nebula Award winning novel.

0374139563|5.0|This is a personal view of the author, however, I think she is very convincing in her arguments.  I remembered the Ethiopia's  massive famine 30 years or so ago. I was a small child and remembered the whole event.  I remembered breaking my piggy bank for the starving children in Ethiopia, which I do not even know where the country was.  After almost 30 years, Ethiopia has not develop much, and any disaster would wipe out any gain that was made during this 3 decades.     I think the fact that there are about 1/2 million western workers, diplomats and non-profit groups, NGOs, and UN depended on the Aid industry, there may never be a true solution to the poverty and misery in Africa. Since this at least 1/2 million people's living depend on misery in Africa.  I think her points of arguing against the aid are valid and profound, especially the example of the mosquito net maker in Africa, and what the aid did to these small businesses.      When we are kicking and screaming about the despots in Africa, we cloak our rhetoric with compassion, when chastising China and India, who  are actually doing the building work in Africa.  If we can overlook the Cuba's Castro Brothers as good men, I think we should overlook the, if there is any benevolent dictator that can help push through the changes that African countries desperately need.      I guess my point of view is a bit utilitarian, but for everyone who stays in misery's sake, maybe a little utilitarian is not too bad of an idea.
B0029LXGXG|4.0|Neo soul has been on life support for a while now, sorry Alicia, India, Neyo, Erykah, Bilal, Jill, and Anthony but the king has returned and I am ecstatic he is back.    But could you imagine after eight years returning with the same \\"do\\" and the same sound? Now THAT would have been disappointing.    The young Maxwell is like a distant but comforting childhood memory, but the older, mature Maxwell is just \\"real\\".  As much as I loved the lush instrumentation and the romanticism of Maxwell's towering falsetto, I am definitely \\"feeling\\" the emotionally raw Maxwell along with the blistering brass section, the gospel tinged piano/organ and those very, very wicked percussions that are front and center on his new album.    \\"Bad Habits\\" is classic Maxwell and \\"Pretty Wings\\", well is just plain pretty. Those two songs I believe are concessions to the fans who wished Maxwell would appear magically after eight long years, not one day older, rocking the Afro and Bryan Ferry's wardrobe.     A lot of fans complain about the brevity of the album but I say it is \\"compact\\", why run a marathon when a sprint will get it done.      The album cycles through the emotions of raw need, anger and disappointment, and ultimately sorrow in just under 36 minutes and you don't want to miss one nanosecond of this musical journey through an entire relationship.    Favorite tracks, \\"Stop the World\\", \\"Love You\\", \\"Fist Full of Tears\\" and \\"Playing Possum\\". Solid ballads and mournful pleas, nothing better than a sorrowful, beggin' Maxwell.    Is it a great album? Is it a classic? The answer would be no but it is a VERY GOOD one. The man is on a journey and for better or worse, I think going to get my ticket to ride.
0307588335|4.0|This is a terrific \\"insider\\" account of the collapse of Lehman Brothers as seen from the firm's distressed debt trading desk.  It's by no means definitive, the author is candid that his access to the thinking of the firm's top executives was basically non-existent and that his disdain for them was boundless.      Mr. McDonald doesn't pretend to be objective.  But the case he presents is both compelling and truly, truly troubling.  Lehman Brothers was destroyed by its own top management, with repeated and willful acts of recklessness and negligence that would have been inconceivable a generation ago.     Having read the Bear Stearns collapse books and much of the other (often very good) reportage about Wall Street's hyper-leveraged insanity, I hesitated to read \\"another book\\" about another group of lunatics.     But once I started the free excerpt I couldn't stop.  It's must reading, if you are interested in what happened, how it happened, what allowed it to happen and what it felt like to be there as management destroyed a Wall Street Institution.

B0020MKTOS|5.0|There's not many Hmong-American movies out there. I think this DVD has a lot of heart, a great anti-gang message, and demonstrate the evolution of a racist mentality to enlightenment.
B000U7169W|3.0|but nothing to hate either.  The biggest problem with this film is the script doesn't have a single original idea.  It is a rehash of devil-worshipping movies going back to Rosemary's Baby.  You get the standard windows blowing open, the priest who knows the truth but gets no one to believe him, the idiot hero (heroine in this case) going off alone into danger, the obligatory thunder storms, plagues, crazy characters, the silent stare of a supposedly evil child, and a variety of other horror movie cliches.  Hilliary Swank is hardly a slouch as an actress, and I am surprised that she did a low-budget film like this, although she brought it some credibility.  The acting overall was acceptable, although Englishman David Morrisey's Southern accent was more nondescript than identifiable.  Idris Elba, also English, did, however, sound like an escapee from the 'hood.  Watch the film but neither praise nor damn it because it deserves neither.
B001S35KG2|4.0|This book is not an easy read, and I'm not certain that I understood everything that it was trying to say, but I agree with Robert Pirsig's basic message about quality, which is that it's not only in the observer, nor is it solely in the object. Quality is something that occurs when something is done consciously...okay this is not quite right. But in my defense, the author had trouble defining exactly what quality is. If you really want to know, read the book!  Karen L. Jett, CMA - Author Grow Your People, Grow Your Business
B0028K31CE|5.0|This is a cd that you can listen to without a single break (you may even hit repeat several times).  There is something about Maxwell and the background talent and if anyone has the opportunity to see him live (What a show!!!).  I can't wait for his next cd!!!

Shantaram has given my private moments the multi-faceted tastes, smells, and complexities of India and lifestyles that were new to me. I hope many others enjoy this book as much as I have.

0446618306|5.0|This novel is a departure from the others that Nicholas sparks has written, and while I enjoyed all of them, this one really seemed to stick with me because of the point.  It's not about what we do to keep those we love.  It's just about what we are willing to do for those we love.

B0026OE2NY|5.0|I was... Blown away watching this film.  Visual presentation is simply stunning.  It starts as if we are looking into an earth's diary.  All of the facts of our planet is shown.  After 20 minutes or so, the depressing facts are presented.      It is very educational.  Truly a must see film for all mankind, to save our planet.      Earth is our only home that we live.  If we do not take care of it, mankind will be destroyed sooner or later.
1433502399|5.0|In the few weeks I have had this Bible, I have had ample opportunity to determine that it is by far the closest to the Greek of any translation I have (and I have them all). I have been amazed at the number of times this Bible has translated a word or phrase according to what some  refer to as \\"the best translation.\\"  With its extensive concordance, in-depth articles and resources, and its maps, illustrations, and tables, this Bible is a storehouse of information   the serious Bible student will appreciate and value.  The introductory material found at the beginning of each book and the commentary on the verses within the books are good sources of information as well.      My only problems with this Bible are that I prefer the words of Christ be in red and that all pronouns referring to the deity be capitalized, but these omissions do not take away from or hinder my appreciation or use of this Bible.  It is extremely readable and easy to understand and I highly recommend it. (And you can't beat the price!)
B001FB55H6|5.0|Who'd've thought a comic book (okay, a 'graphic novel') would've spawned such thoughtful reactions from viewers. But there is a lot of thinking going on in WATCHMEN to think about. Social issues from vigilantism to mob mentality to sociopath skirting liberal laws to... Well, this is a thinking person's action movie. So much have been written already, I'll just cop out and say I agree with all the raves. It's fine film which will be talked about for years to come.<br /><br />One reviewer said see the movie first, then get the graphic novel. I think it would be better the other way. But I'm from<br />a generation brought up on comics. The graphic-novel version is a piece of art. I was surprised it was in a fixed, regular panel format. But the creators said why they did and, okay, they're the creatives. (But I maintain it's a graphic concept,<br />and as the movie has done, the more dramatic, innovative formatting, the better.)<br /><br />Last kibitz: I liked WATCHMEN the first time I viewed it. So much so I viewed it again, and the second time through I saw/understood/appreciated it all the more. I waited a 10 days and again re-viewed it. And more came up and out.<br />If you agree with the really enthusiastic reviews, I'd suggest you see more than once. or twice. And next year, see it some more.<br /><br />As a 69-year-old I often think many of 'you kids' are dumbed-down vis-a-vis those of us from the Gutenberg Galaxy (go google that phrase and be enlightened). But seeing the smart acceptance of this complex film and the sharp way reviewers have applauded it, I have hopes for the future after all.  Amen, and see it again and again.
059305704X|3.0|This Reacher story is much better than the last one I had read, \\"Nothing To Lose\\".  In this installment we find Reacher riding a 3AM subway in NYC with a few other passengers and a potential suicide bomber who is not.  I enjoyed Reacher's first person as he moves along and the story starts to develop.  If you are in a plane or looking for a beach read this will keep you interested at a fairly fast pace.  The beginning is the best part of the story.  In truth it is Reacher who is the only developed character in the story relegating everyone else to small cardboard bit players.  Of course Reacher is a rather big guy but he does need some good support to play off of or it is just..Reacher. And the cardboard cast does get rather large with the Congressman and his security guy, Dept Of Defense, NYC cops, FBI, all the many bad guys and girls Reacher grinds-up.  No big deal here it is all just some entertainment on the meaty and beefy side and it ain't for everybody.      WARNING:  SPOILER ETC:  Once you get to the middle things start to bog down quite a bit.  On the final night Reacher must be on steroids of some kind and he is in a killing mood and he has 20 terrorists and girl terrorists to take down and take them down he does in typical Reacher fashion.  Now the funny thing is when you finally finish the book you start to realize that all Reacher's mayhem and murder was all because of a photo of Bin Laden???  Huh?  Thats right.  (Supposedly embarrasing, but nobody knows for sure.  Even the 2 guys who were there can't think of why.) A 25 year old photo of OBL.  Something the terrorists wanted too.  After realizing that it does seem Reacher and Child got all heated up about very little.  All those people for Reacher to kill--for such a puny little photo and the bloody knife fight with the two women at the end was just a hoot.  You have got to be kidding me...it is stupid. It was good all the way to the middle.  Thats entertainment!
B001DHXT6G|4.0|As someone who has long enjoyed and appreciated the original Star Trek series, I think this newly remastered set is fantastic.  The video is exceptionally clear and crisp.  The re-recording of the theme in it's original score is wonderful.  A number of the episodes have little additions given advances in technology.  Those additions take nothing away from the origial and are a very pleasant surprise.  This set is well worth acquiring for the die hard Trek fan.
1573300403|3.0|Good selection of Jackson's hit videos.  The Billie Jean performance at the Motown Anniversary clearly indicates while the dancing was live - the King of Pop was lip synching ... no way was he singing!
B00288KNL8|3.0|I loved this movie in the theater, but it loses a lot in transition to the small screen. The red-blue 3D on the DVD has nowhere near the \\"wow\\" factor of the polarization 3D used in the theater. And in the 2D version, the shots designed to show off the 3D effects seem very awkward.    The story itself is a great, spooky, modern-day fairy tale, but on the small screen this movie just doesn't hold up.
B002A3N2BY|4.0|Heroes was the second album in Bowie's trilogy of [[ASIN:B000A3MHWG Brian Eno]] produced electronic albums. It follows the pattern of [[ASIN:B00001OH7W Low]] in its mix of short pop/rock songs and moody instrumentals and semi-instrumentals. Somehow it lacks the trenchant edge of Low, although the title track is truly spectacular in its evocative imagery and great emotional impact.<br /><br />On the title track, Bowie's voice is as emotive as on Word On A Wing (from [[ASIN:B00001OH7U Station to Station]]) over the wailing drone of the synths as it paints a scenario of lovers meeting beneath the Berlin wall. Truly breathtaking, this song was also released as a single in German and French versions in the seventies.<br /><br />The melancholy Sons Of The Silent Age has a spacey feel, beautiful lyrics and a ghostly chorus, while Blackout is harsh and discordant. I love the sax and the driving beat of V2 Schneider as Bowie's voice intones the title. Moss Garden is a delicate instrumental, a sound I recognized later in some pieces by e.g. [[ASIN:B0009NSDQQ Autechre]] and Cabaret Voltaire, but Secret Life Of Arabia drags a bit.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000LZ52YS Lodger]], the third album in the trilogy, is nowhere near as good as the first two. Heroes remains my favorite of the three, primarily on account of the unsurpassable title track.
0439023491|5.0|I, too obtained an ARC at BEA. I thought I was very lucky to get Catching Fire before September. I was so wrong! Now I have to wait longer than others to read the last book, and it's pure agony wondering what will happen next.<br /><br />The Hunger Game was a great book, but Catching Fire is even better. The story is getting deeper and more complex. As another reviewer stated, it's a \\"rollercoaster ride of a read\\". You'll never be able to guess what happens next.  And once you start, you can never stop until the end.  Relationships between Katniss, Peeta , and Gale are also getting more complex. This separates the Hunger Games from other shallow YA romantic fantasy. Their relationships reflect social issues and humanities this trilogy deals with.<br /><br />It's categorised as YA fantasy book, but I highly recommend it to adult Science Fiction fans. The Hunger Games trilogy should be and will be a classic like 1984, The Giver, and Fahrenheit 451.
0143038583|5.0|It is fantastically written, well researched with plenty of depth, and balanced. It's hard to think about the food you eat in the same way after reading this. An absolute must read for anyone who doesn't want to remain ignorant about the food they eat.
0307454541|4.0|I'm not quite sold on Dragon as the groundbreaking work it seems to be sold as, but there's no denying that it's a pretty great little thriller with as much interest in interesting characters as a complex story. Essentially tying three stories together - a reporter with a vendetta against a major corporation, a girl who disappeared 30 years ago in a locked-room situation writ large, and a third, more sinister plot thread that develops as the book proceeds - Larsson eschews a lot of the thriller standards, writing as much about Swedish finance and politics and the way they shaped their characters. For some, I suppose the result could be boring, but I found the view into a foreign culture fascinating. Of course, none of that would matter if the plot weren't so engaging, but Larsson keeps the twists and swerves coming in some really great ways, keeping me reading far beyond the time when I needed to stop. And running through it all are his deeply flawed protagonists, the idealistic Blomkvist and the rebellious and far more cynical Salander, both of whom really engaged me and kept me fascinated. A little slower and more gradually paced than your typical thriller, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo more than makes up for the wait with some absolutely knockout scenes as the book builds towards its climax...well, and then keeps going, for what has to be admitted to be a little too long. Still, it's a great little mystery thriller, and it's left me quite interested in the sequel, which is supposed to be even better.
B0016CS0IK|5.0|One of my favorite records of all time.  I was taken back to my youth and loved every second of it.  I adore this album
B000VZLN8C|5.0|I bought this cd when it came out and I think it's still in my cd changer. This disc is so good that I'm still mad about the reunion tour 13 years ago that broke up this lineup. As much as I love Gene and Paul, I wish they would just think about the music instead of the money for a change.
B000F8O35U|2.0|When I first saw this movie a decade ago I found it enchanting.  The music is wonderful, the voices perfect, and the movie is full of beautiful scenes and choreography.  Once I started to ponder the message it sends however, I became far less enthralled with the movie.<br /><br />When you get right down to it, this is the message:<br /><br />Young girl sees good-looking guy one time at drunken party and on sight alone develops a crush on him.<br />Same young girl subsequently defies her father and risks everything--life, family, future--on a chance to hook up with the object of her crush.<br /><br />Now don't get me wrong, I am very pleased that it all worked out for our beautiful and charming cartoon heroine.  I'm glad she didn't get killed, didn't end up homeless on the streets prostituting herself for survival, didn't contract an STD, and that against the odds she got her man, that they actually ended up loving one another, and the man turned out to be of good character and not a mentally or physically abusive sociopath.<br /><br />I am sorry to have to bring up the grim realities of life and human relationships, but in any thorough analysis, we must all look on the product as a whole.  In senior English, we were expected to find the underlying theme of the book, as well as aspects of the book's tone, any symbolism, or other literary techniques.  The fact is that the underlying theme or message in this Disney movie is grossly irresponsible.  I like the movie for a number of its aspects, but it is NOT appropriate for children.  The fact that it is a Disney cartoon and is G-rated and thus PURPORTS to be appropriate for all ages makes that message even more disturbing.<br /><br />As a parent I will not allow this movie to be in my house.  With the whole world full of options for enriching experiences to have, books to read, and far better shows to watch, this will not be missed.
B00002Z88D|5.0|I've only recent gotten into Metallica, thanks to Guitar hero.  As such i was quite thrilled when I heard \\"No leaf clover\\" in Guitar hero; Metallica.  I like very few bands, but Metallica is the sort of thing I do enjoy listening to, I also like Classical, oddly enough, so you can Imagine S&M was right up my alley, i ordered it at ocne when I discovered that iit existed.    needless to say; AWESOME AWESOME AWEOME and so on

B00005QGAV|4.0|Following [[ASIN:B00005QGAX Bad]], it arguable to some that Michael Jackson's impact had waned (some cite [[ASIN:B00005QGAZ Thriller]]). I say BAD because BAD had five number one singles (\\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\", \\"Bad\\", \\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\", \\"Man In the Mirror\\", \\"Dirty Diana\\") as well as \\"Smooth Criminal\\" (#7), and less effective singles (\\"Leave Me Alone\\", \\"Liberian Girl\\"). [[ASIN:B00005QGAV Dangerous]], unfortunately doesn't have the track record, as far a performance of singles as BAD does, but it does showcase a still very vitally important Michael Jackson in my eyes.  I won't lie, it isn't my favorite Michael Jackson album, however, I think it is still a very strong, influential album.  It does showcase one of my favorite Michael Jackson songs of all time (\\"Will You Be There\\") and did spawn two other major hits (\\"Black or White\\" [#1], \\"Remember the Time\\").  What I do appreciate about DANGEROUS is the new-jack swing R&B feel added with the inclusion of R&B producer/singer Teddy Riley (Blackstreet). I think that the main problem, if it is a problem, with DANGEROUS is there is more of a \\"disconnect\\" with some of the songs than there were on [[ASIN:B00005QGAT Off the Wall]], [[ASIN:B00005QGAZ Thriller]], or [[ASIN:B00005QGAX Bad]]. Despite this notion, there is nothing 'bad' (no pun intended!) about DANGEROUS; it is 'another superb Michael Jackson album'.<br /><br />The album opens with the great, new-jack swing sounding \\"Jam\\". Here, Michael Jackson's 'machine' sound, capitalized on BAD particularly on songs like \\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\" or \\"Speed Demon\\" is updated on \\"Jam\\". Michael Jackson sounds phenomenal. \\"Jam\\", in addition to a new-jack component to the production (again via Teddy Riley) plays on James Browns riff-based tunes on the chorus of \\"Jam\\" in particular. Sure, he doesn't go as far to ad lib like Brown, but the chorus is very minimalist and hearkens back to an earlier time in R&B/Soul/Pop Music. A rap appears on \\"Jam\\" - it is short, which makes it both forgettable yet also effective. Jackson would pull the similar trick of putting a rapper on the track ([[ASIN:B00005Q4JH Invincible]]), though it felt a bit more calculated later on within his career. \\"Jam\\" proves to be a , five-star performance, or slightly shy of one in comparison to untouchable tracks such as \\"Billie Jean\\" or \\"Bad\\" from Michael's past.<br /><br />\\"Why You Wanna Trip On Me\\" easily shows why there was a rival-ship between Prince and Michael Jackson. This track could've just as easily appeared on 1992's [[ASIN:B000008JLP The Love Symbol Album]].  The production features the typical boxy-sounding drum programming of the time with slightly out of tune synthesized instruments and funky guitars. \\"Jam's\\" equal, \\"Why You Wanna Trip On Me\\" finds Michael Jackson as hip as ever.  The fun doesn't stop with the addictive \\"In The Closet\\", one of my personal favorites from DANGEROUS.  \\"In The Closet\\" proves to be another lengthy, though incredibly enjoyable track off a DANGEROUS, giving Michael Jackson a home-run. If nothing else could be said of DANGEROUS, Michael Jackson certainly knew how to adapt and assimilate to changes in music, despite his lengthy hiatuses between every album.<br /><br />\\"She Drives Me Wild\\" continues the uptempo, dance-driven feel of DANGEROUS effectively without missing a beat.  If \\"Jam\\", \\"Why You Wann Trip On Me\\", \\"In The Closet\\" and \\"She Drives Me Wild\\" were more pop-based, funky dance tunes, The Riley co-penned \\"Remember The Time\\" finds Jackson squarely placed in the new-jack swing style that was pervading R&B/Soul music at the time.  Sure, the boxy-drums and 'clanky'-Jackson signature programming remains, but there is a definite soul sensibility about \\"Remember The Time\\" that hasn't necessarily been so overtly shown in Jackson's music sense say [[ASIN:B00005QGAT Off the Wall]], his most soul-driven solo album. \\"Can't Let Her Get Away\\" is as solid as anything else, sounding more similar to tracks like \\"Jam\\" as opposedto \\"Remember The Time\\".  It doesn't necessarily eclipse a track like \\"Jam\\" or \\"Remember The Time\\", but it is clearly above average.<br /><br />\\"Heal The World\\" arrives just in time as the listener finds DANGEROUS getting close to sounding \\"too similar\\" or \\"samey\\".  \\"Heal The World\\" finds Jackson resurrecting the socially-conscious message of past tracks like \\"We Are the World\\" or \\"Man in the Mirror\\"(BAD).  It may not be considered the hit of \\"Man In The Mirror\\" as it didn't perform nearly as well, but it is just as much touching, poignant, and as sincere as that track.  \\"Heal The World\\" is a classic, period.<br /><br />\\"Black or White\\", the sole #1 hit from DANGEROUS is definitely the valedictory track from DANGEROUS. Controversial among fans questioning Jackson's changing skin color, the rock-leaning pop track seems to be the \\"Beat It\\" or \\"Dirty Diana\\" of DANGEROUS. Brilliantly performed, brilliantly written, it is easily consistent with the best of Jackson. \\"Who Is It\\" continues to make DANGEROUS another superb Jackson album, returning to the sounds of previous listens \\"Jam\\" or \\"In The Closet\\".  \\"Give In To Me\\" changes the production up from anything else on DANGEROUS - it has a pop/rock feel, not completely dissimilar from something that say Sheryl Crow might do today.  It is slightly forgettable in comparison to the rest of the album and the majority of Michael Jackson's catalog, however Michael Jackson still sings the hell out it.  Not my favorite, but still solid, particularly at the bridge when Michael harmonizes within himself (and any other background vocalists that might be singing as well).<br /><br />\\"Will You Be There\\" (in it's original extended form) is quite the anomaly.  The introduction sounds like the beginning of a mass as opposed to the beginning of a pop song. Only after nearly two minutes into the song does the melody, that most of us remember from the movie [[ASIN:6304698569 Free Willy]] come in.  The sharp sounding drums instantaneously captivate the listener, proving to be one of the most memorable rhythmically-driven beats, until 1995's socially conscious \\"The Don't Care About Us\\".  Here, Michael Jackson is in top-notch voice, accompanied by Andrae/Sandra Crouch's exceptional sounding choir.  I say as I always have that \\"Will You Be There\\" is one of Jackson's very best as well as one of the best, most memorable songs ever written. A top ten hit, in my eyes, it should've hit #1.<br /><br />\\"Keep the Faith\\" keeps up the inspirational tinge, established by \\"Will You Be There\\".  \\"Gone Too Soon\\", equally alluring is touching, poignant, and sad. I find \\"Gone Too Soon\\" hard to listen to without getting depressed or thinking about a person in your life that was indeed 'gone too soon'.  The lengthy album closes with \\"Dangerous\\", a strong closing track. As with most title-tracks, other tracks eclipse the title-track, though \\"Dangerous\\" is good (though \\"Jam\\" and \\"In The Closet\\" prove to be better).<br /><br />Essentially,DANGEROUS is another fine Michael Jackson album. The biggest complaint is length and sometimes some of the material sounds too similar.  Despite these small qualms, it is another fine album in Michael's discography.  4 stars.e\\".  It doesn't necessarily eclipse a track like \\"Jam\\" or \\"Remember The Time\\", but it is clearly above average.     \\"Heal The World\\" arrives just in time as the listener finds DANGEROUS getting close to sounding \\"too similar\\" or \\"samey\\".  \\"Heal The World\\" finds Jackson resurrecting the socially-conscious message of past tracks like \\"We Are the World\\" or \\"Man in the Mirror\\"(BAD).

Brilliantly performed, brilliantly written, it is easily consistent with the best of Jackson. \\"Who Is It\\" continues to make DANGEROUS another superb Jackson album, returning to the sounds of previous listens \\"Jam\\" or \\"In The Closet\\".  \\"Give In To Me\\" changes the production up from anything else on DANGEROUS - it has a pop/rock feel, not completely dissimilar from something that say Sheryl Crow might do today.  It is slightly forgettable in comparison to the rest of the album and the majority of Michael Jackson's catalog, however Michael Jackson still sings the hell out it.  Not my favorite, but still solid, particularly at the bridge when Michael harmonizes within himself (and any other background vocalists that might be singing as well).     \\"Will You Be There\\" (in it's original extended form) is quite the anomaly.  The introduction sounds like the beginning of a mass as opposed to the beginning of a pop song. Only after nearly two minutes into the song does the melody, that most of us remember from the movie [[ASIN:6304698569 Free Willy]] come in.  The sharp sounding drums instantaneously captivate the listener, proving to be one of the most memorable rhythmically-driven beats, until 1995's socially conscious \\"The Don't Care About Us\\".  Here, Michael Jackson is in top-notch voice, accompanied by Andrae/Sandra Crouch's exceptional sounding choir.  I say as I always have that \\"Will You Be There\\" is one of Jackson's very best as well as one of the best, most memorable songs ever written. A top ten hit, in my eyes, it should've hit #1.     \\"Keep the Faith\\" keeps up the inspirational tinge, established by \\"Will You Be There\\".  \\"Gone Too Soon\\", equally alluring is touching, poignant, and sad. I find \\"Gone Too Soon\\" hard to listen to without getting depressed or thinking about a person in your life that was indeed 'gone too soon'.  The lengthy album closes with \\"Dangerous\\", a strong closing track. As with most title-tracks, other tracks eclipse the title-track, though \\"Dangerous\\" is good (though \\"Jam\\" and \\"In The Closet\\" prove to be better).    Essentially,DANGEROUS is another fine Michael Jackson album. The biggest complaint is length and sometimes some of the material sounds too similar.  Despite these small qualms, it is another fine album in Michael's discography.  4 stars.

1853262390|4.0|Virginia Woolf caught a break in the publishing world, which is comparable to a 365-bedroom estate. But like Orlando, Woolf needed more than that. As a member of the working class, I found myself thinking 'nice that you have so much time to pontificate on life'. Is Orlando one of the rich and bored? One who dishes out but can't take it?    Take Sasha for instance. He calls her faithless when he's bedded every wench in town and is engaged to marry someone else when he meets her. Hard to sympathize with the guy. It's only a tragedy when he's the one hurting. Throughout Orlando's lives, he/she strikes me as a spoiled rich kid who wants to be useful and good but can't help being a punk sometimes. Very true to real life.    Woolf takes the reader through history fantastically; every scent and sense is unique to the years. Her observation on clothes being related to the person within is great. And even though people put a homosexual spin on the subject, I felt it was more about what a person is capable of and why a 'man' or 'woman' label is slapped on certain traits and abilities. If a woman is mechanically inclined, does she have to give up being feminine? If a man has a fashion sense, must he forfeit his masculinity?    In the end, I found myself wondering how Orlando would have turned out if he/she weren't so rich. Maybe it's my working-class distaste for pampered complainers that made we want to smack Orlando. But as a non-traditional woman, I also heard my thoughts echoed in Orlando's, especially when she 'yielded to the spirit of the age' and got married. That entire description of the pressure to marry was brilliant because it comes from without and within.    All in all, there are perks and drawbacks to being male or female. But Orlando shows we're not the only one who finds our talents stretch beyond what is considered a man's job or a woman's. Did Orlando have to become a woman to know love? Did his maleness make him a better ambassador? Nowadays we say 'of course not'. But Orlando personifies those questions, makes the reader aware of the chains of tradition. And just like Orlando's ancestry, are they anchors or dead weight? Or both?

John Mayer is simply the heir apparent to the throne of those Guitar Gods. This album is a well colored canvas of artistic courage and supreme skill. John is a fearless composer/performer and everyone with any doubt about his soulful guitar supremacy should listen to this album from beginning to end and prepare to be blown away.

1594202249|5.0|Those that know, know the writing of Thomas Pynchon can be a rough row to hoe--featuring convoluted, paranoid plotting, byzantine sentence structure, alternation of genres and modes of presentation within a single opus--sometimes even a single page--funny names and multi-layered puns, revisionist history and anachronisms galore. And pizza--plenty of pizza. What most folks who've read Pynchon expect is a rough but rewarding time decrypting encoded messages pointing to vast conspiracies both right and left, and being able to pat themselves on the back for being so wickedly erudite as to be able to follow at least some of the multiple, overlapping plotlines found within each of his six novels. Those that don't know Thomas Pynchon usually bail out on page 150 of Gravity's Rainbow.    But note this down and burn this deep into your collective forebrains--Inherent Vice, Thomas Pynchon's seventh and funniest novel, is a beach read.    The grand master of literary obfuscation actually did it this time--either he made a conscious decision to express himself via comparatively stable characters and plotline of a more traditional make & model or he said \\"screw it--it's time to cash in!\\" Inherent Vice has sentence structures and vocabulary more akin to Tom Robbins than Henry James, an overall shape more like Christopher Buckley than Henry Adams. You'll knock this one back like chugging down a Corona during a Fresno mid-summer heat-wave. Inherent Vice is cool and refreshing and funnier and easier to comprehend than anything else Pynchon's written so far.     And yes folks, in spite of various smack-downs from some of the more self-conscious members of the professional lit-crit establishment, Inherent Vice has meaningful connections to Pynchon's larger collection of cabals and conspiracies including a lot of what appears to be the author's personal back story.  There is a major element of autobiography to this novel, a Palimpsest buried in so deep that it's more like a solid concrete foundation--you'll need some heavy-duty construction equipment to work your way through it. Once I opened the book I knew that this stuff had to be ripped from the tattered casebook of Thomas Pynchon, professional cryptic `n sleuth--from cloak and dagger to croak and stagger!!! I was seeing where stuff in Gravity's Rainbow could have come from--what lunch might be like Under The Sign Of The Gross Suckling, places where you'll find boysenberry yogurt and marshmallows on your pizza --or a joint along with your hamburger available during Tommy's Hamburger's 2-4-1 special. No fear dude, this little pamphlet will be plenty re-readable, with loads of evidence of mindless pleasures to unearth as you dig through the narrative rubble.    While many readers of Inherent Vice will note the resonances to The Big Lebowski, & some to the Robert Altman/Elliott Gould \\"Long Goodbye\\"--fewer still recalling \\"Nick Danger, Third Eye\\" and an even more miniscule slice of that demographic recalling Bonzo Dog Band's \\"Big Shot\\"--the key element connecting all these works is Raymond Chandler. If any writing of the last 100 years deserves James Wood's Lit-Crit damning-with-faint-praise pejorative \\"Hysterical Realism,\\" it's Chandler's Noir with Literary Pretensions. The Firesigns, the Coens and Altman 'n Gould were all making variations, comments and carom shots off of Chandler's high-gloss pulp. As does Pynchon. The nominal Dame of these stories, usually a lady who's doing her best to reinvent herself with a different haircut, clothes, identity, address--is THE  figure at the core of  Noir.    In Inherent Vice, that \\"Dame\\" is Shasta, ex-girlfriend of hazy P.I. and protagonist Doc Sportello--a L.A. beauty queen who wanted to make it big in the movies but settled for money from her rich, married-to-someone-else real-estate-mogul boyfriend, Mickey Wolfman. Wolfman has been kidnapped in the immediate wake of the Tate-LaBianca Murders, leading to many a nervous mishap among hypersensitive members of the L.A.P.D. Naturally, as in Raymond Chandler's Pulp Fictions, things get really complicated real fast and the rot leads all the way to the top of L.A.'s food chain. The symbolism of Shasta can be spotted by anyone who knows what Pynchon was writing about in Vineland. By the time you've zipped through Inherent Vice's 369 pages, you'll probably want to start all over again to figure out what you missed. The name on the cover changes nothing, this is still a beach read.    Who'd 'a thunk it?

6305308659|5.0|Seriously, was \\"Pleasantville\\" the best movie of the 1990's?  I know I'm overlooking a lot of superlative work to say that but I just happened to watch it again last night and got clobbered all over by its wonderous ingenuity and charm.  \\"Pleasantville\\" is a movie I NEVER get tired of and by golly, now that it's only $5.99 to buy it new you really have no excuse but to give it a shot.<br /><br />I will forgo a synopsis here because so many other reviewers preceding me have already done so.  Let me just observe that if you want to experience full-frontal allegory, you cannot do better than this.  There is so much symbolism and social commentary gently packaged in this sweet parable of an Eisenhower era sitcom come to life!  I must confess for this 51 year old reviewer the demographic and generational arrows launched by \\"Pleasantville\\" score a direct hit on my boomer-era heart.  I would hope younger viewers unaware of the '50's TV conventions being employed as background here can still understand the social strictures and conventions referenced, and even if they can't, can still marvel at the incredible comic/dramatic performances AND the spectacular b&w/color photography that is SO important to the storytelling.<br /><br />The cast--KILLER!  Reese Witherspoon, Tobey McGuire, Jeff Daniels, Bill Macy (where's my dinner!), J.T. Walsh (alas! His last role--RIP)--all sublime REALLY in every respect.  But I gotta RAVE at you about just how POWERFUL and INTENSE Joan Allen's performance as an archetypal sitcom mom awakening slowly, and painfully, to a fully 3-D technicolor life, turns out to be (the same journey the entire town takes, albeit grudgingly).  I believe this was my first exposure to Joan and her tortured but determined journey depicted here still gives me shivers. I can't imagine any other actress giving such a finely calibrated and sympathetic portrayal.  This performance--really ALL of \\"Pleasantville\\"--are prime examples of just how GOOD \\"comedy\\" acting can be.  So much more than just slapstick here!<br /><br />I can't overlook Don Knotts--who better to provide 1950's \\"cred\\" than Barney Fife himself?  If you can find it, check out the criminally forgotten Knotts movie [[ASIN:B00009VU05 The Love God?]] for Don at his most comically surreal; Yeah, maximum \\"guilty pleasure\\" for your reviewer, but I love the outrageous '70's Dacron Polyester Mens' fashion parade and especially the hysterical courtroom faceoff; Don goes on trial as a porn merchant, and gets denounced in open court as a \\"capering libertine, a lecherous goat, partaking in depraved orgies\\"--Truly comedy from beyond space and time as we know it!<br /><br />For those of us who remember the 1950's, \\"Pleasantville\\" is ESSENTIAL viewing that will pluck every emotional string you still have.  No doubt there are stone hearts who can watch and not be moved, but I'm certainly not one of them.  So many memorable & quotable lines of dialogue too: \\"I don't WANT it to go away!!!\\" \\"Those are Whitey's cookies!\\" \\"Where's My Dinner!\\"  \\"You're safe for now, you're in a bowling alley!\\"  \\"I'm wearing three pounds of underwear here!\\"  \\"You can pin me anytime!\\"  And I could go on--share your own favorites later.<br /><br />Also highly recommended, and on a similar wavelength: [[ASIN:B000IUTNBO Matinee [Import]]] starring John Goodman as an early '60's schlock horror movie producer flogging his new monster epic as the all-too-real terror of the Cuban Missle Crisis unfolds. Then, if you're ready to graduate to the \\"hard stuff\\", steel yourself for the almost psychedelic melodramatic swoons of the incredible director Douglas Sirk in [[ASIN:B00128TX6G All That Heaven Allows Jane Wyman, Rock Hudson, Douglas Sirk (NTSC All Region Import)]], or if you're really feeling daring, [[ASIN:B0016SM06W WRITTEN on the WIND (NTSC All Region Import) Rock Hudson, Lauren Bacall, Robert Stack, and Dorothy Malone, Douglas Sirk]].<br /><br />Let me close as I began: \\"Pleasantville\\" is a landmark modern masterpiece and let me declare here publicly, given its unprecedented and amazingly deft use of color in the plot (as you'll see) is especially deserving of the best picture (and sound--OUTSTANDING Randy Newman orchestral score) possible.  So--I say again--WHERE'S MY BLU-RAY?!?rpiece and let me declare here publicly, given its unprecedented and amazingly deft use of color in the plot (as you'll see) is especially deserving of the best picture (and sound--OUTSTANDING Randy Newman orchestral score) possible.

B001UW58YU|4.0|I give this Blu-ray four-star rating for a dissapointing styling of Josh Groban. I have the DVD title \\"In Concert\\" a live in Pasadena California. That one, I think, rightfully deserves a five-star rating. Comparing to it, this one has to fall down to four! Somehow, maybe it is my personal bias, this one packaged Josh Groban wrong although it was a good-hearted try. Josh gives me the image of a good neighborhood boy, going to church every Sunday and singing gospel and patriotic songs. His hair should be nicely cut and trimmed, dressing style should be conservative. But, in this production, Josh was different! His hair was messy and his dress was sloppy. It is like David Foster producing a song. He tirelessly looks for the right voice and style to match the singing of it. Once that song is produced, it becomes minted to our heart. I like to listen to music with my heart and imagination. This new styling of Josh Groban is hard to digest.
B00243FQFA|3.0|For many fans it seems season five proved to be a divisive one, with people either enjoying it or throwing SGA's clothes out on to the lawn while calling a divorce attorney. Unfortunately I was one of many packing a suitcase.    Stargate was never in the league of Firefly or BSG as far as critical aclaim was concerned, but it was able to provide some cheap and cheerful fun with a good use of humour and a good cast that had excellent on-screen chemistry. Over the years however SGA suffered through multiple cast changes and no real direction which culminated in a final season where the main four characters barely seemed to share a screen together, where laughs were few and far between, and where everything had become too episodic and formulaic - the show was no longer just paying homage to other shows but cannibalising it's own scripts from previous seasons.  Season Five seems to be the season of writer malaise.     This was also the season of McKay: Search For A Wife, Ronon and Teyla: Search For Lines To Say, and Sheppard: Search for #45636 Further Ways To Commit Suicide. For me this was time to: Search For The Remote.    Which is not to say that there isn't some good individual episodes to be found on this set, plus it's packed with enough features to keep many fans happy, but it's a pity that such a fun show wobbled rather gracelessly to it's cancellation rather than going out with a bang.
0545123267|5.0|This is the interview I had with Maggie on my blog at Yankee Romance Reviewers (Blog Spot)<br /><br />*******************************************************************<br /><br />Thanks so much Maggie for being with us today and for this delicious book.<br /><br />Terra ~ What makes Shiver so much more unique from other tales of Werewolves?<br /><br />Maggie ~ Well, I suppose the fact that there is not a lot of slavering and shedding and general monsterness going on. My werewolves are wolves when they are wolves and humans when they are humans, and the horror comes from losing yourself rather than from monstrous rampages. Also, my werewolves are subject to the seasons rather than to the moon; they become wolves as the temperature drops, hence the title.<br /><br />Terra ~ You have done a great job with details such as sight, sounds and colors and the emphasis that each one has on the other. Do you think this makes the story stronger and more interesting? How hard was it not to overdo the details and lose some of the storyline?<br /><br />Maggie ~ It was actually terrifying to write this novel, because I let myself really linger with the details and the tiny bits and pieces that build character. After writing LAMENT, which was really plot-driven, I kept thinking: \\"maybe I need a cadaver in this scene to move things along.\\" I had to be brave and just trust my instincts that the novel could afford to move more slowly. I really wanted a novel where the characters would remain in the reader's head long after they finished that, and to do that, I needed to include those tiny pieces that make up a real person. I really wanted the places to feel real; for the reader to felt they'd been somewhere else for the four hundred pages that I'd had them.<br /><br />Terra ~ I read your story Lament and loved it but I must say that Shiver stands in a class all by itself. An exceptional class I might add. What are you ultimate hopes for Shiver and why?<br /><br />Maggie ~ Wow, you ask tough questions! I do think SHIVER is in a whole different place from LAMENT, and when I wrote it, I thought it was the best thing I'd ever done. I was terribly afraid I'd never do anything better. But then I think BALLAD was another step forward again, and LINGER, the sequel to SHIVER, I think is even better than SHIVER. I really hope I'll keep getting better with each one. My ultimate hopes for SHIVER? It's already exceeded them in so many ways -- its sold in seventeen different territories already, it's hit so many crazy milestones, I've gotten so many lovely emails from readers already -- really, I hope that it keeps a tight hold on reader's attention until I'm done with the trilogy. And . . . I'd sort of like it to be a movie. Hee. But I could live without it.<br /><br />Terra ~ Sam and Grace are such complete opposites but yet have gone through some very similar experiences. Is it because of this that they find equal ground and a love that is sure to out live the ages?<br /><br />Maggie ~ That's really perceptive! Yes, I really wanted them to be well-matched. I wanted readers to believe that they were not only in love but that that love could last. I wanted readers to see Sam and Grace doing absolutely mundane things together -- a really quiet, compatible love rather than one made up of grandiose gestures. And so I gave Grace absentee parents so that she learned to stand on her own, utterly independent. And Sam, of course, even with the support of his foster family, has come to independence through a completely different route. I think complete opposites work well together as long as they want the same things out of life.<br /><br />Terra ~ I'm not going to be a spoiler here but what are the chances of more Shiver to come? Do you think you can keep the storyline going as strongly as you have here to acquire a following?<br /><br />Maggie ~ Well, I certainly hope so, because I'm doing a trilogy -- LINGER is coming out next fall, and FOREVER is coming out thefall after that. It continues the story of the wolves of Mercy Falls, Minnesota, and features a lot of the same characters from SHIVER. How's that for a non-spoilery description? LINGER is already done and is in the final editing stages, and I'm about to start on FOREVER. It was pretty terrifying to write LINGER -- expectations were so high and I figured if I failed, Scholastic would take me out back and bury me with other authors who had failed to deliver a good sequel. So I breathed a huge sigh of relief after my editor read it and said \\"this is everything that SHIVER readers will want.\\" Phew! Avoided the Scholastic author cemetary. At least until I turn in FOREVER.<br /><br />Terra ~ With the way Shiver ends you had my emotions going in so many different directions that I was on an adrenalin rush. Unusual choices for our characters with even more unusual outcomes. How much research did you do for the ending and what do you personally think of the hopes and fears of our characters?<br /><br />Maggie ~ Oh, man. So much research. I was on the phone with my dad, who's an E.R. doctor, multiple times, working out the logic behind the werewolf \\"disease\\". I had spreadsheets and scratched on pieces of paper and flow charts and endless terrible google searches of various awful diseases. I knew where I wanted to get, but I had to really twist and turn to get there. I had a particular scene where I really, really wanted readers to cry. And the awful part is that I cried when I got there. Not much. Just one tear from each eye. But I thought, if no one else cries at this part, I will be forced to turn myself into the looney bin. Thank goodness my agent and my sister both cried there.<br /><br />Terra ~ What is your favorite part of Shiver and why?<br /><br />Maggie ~ There is a scene with Sam and a bathtub that I am very, very fond of. Because it really pushes both characters to the absolute limits of what they can tolerate.<br /><br />Terra ~ What and who was your inspiration for Shiver and why did you choose this particular title for the book?<br /><br />Maggie ~ I actually was inspired by two things. 1) Reading THE TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE and crying at the end and 2) a werewolf dream inspired by a werewolf short story contest. I really wanted to write a novel that would make people bawl like I had, and I had a very vivid dream about wolves in a wood after trying to think of a plot for a werewolf short story contest. A combination of the two sparked the idea. As to the title, it was originally STILL WOLF WATCHING, because that's what Sam was. But when I sold it to Scholastic, they said, \\"Is it Still Wolf Watching? Or Still Wolf Watching?\\" They asked me to come up with something pithier, and I came up with SHIVER -- because it is something that invokes both the kissy aspects and the dangers of winter for the werewolves.<br /><br />Terra ~ If science suddenly found out that werewolves were indeed real, how do you think the general population of the civilized world would take the news in comparison to the third world countries? Do you think the creatures would have a chance at staying hidden or would they be hunted to extinction?<br /><br />Maggie ~ I'd like to think we're a lot more decent about these things, since we're taught from day one not to stare at people that have weird moles and acne and disfiguring illnesses. But I think that in reality, even the modern world would be terrified by the contagious aspect of it and the thought of losing your human body entirely. I know that's what keeps my characters from going out there and saying \\"hi, I'm a werewolf. Cure me.\\" That and the fear of living your life as a test subject. I don't think they would be hunted necessarily, but certainly quarantined. Can you imagine Americans letting contagious werewolves live alongside their kids? Nah. We're sissies.<br /><br />Terra ~ One of the things that impressed me about Shiver was the purity and innocence of Sam and Grace considering the trauma thatthey experienced many years earlier. Is there something of a lesson to be learned here and what do you think it is?<br /><br />Maggie ~ I think it was actually harder for Grace to stay innocent and positive than Sam. Sam had role models after he became a wolf: Beck and Ulrik and Paul. Despite his weird and awful situation, he had people to look up to. People who were handling their tough lot the best they could; people capable of the best sort of unconditional love. Grace, on the other hand, lived in the hope of finding that sort of love. In my head her books helped her with that, because they give you window into another world and show you people that you hope exist even if they aren't in your life yet.<br /><br />I don't know if there's a lesson, but I know what I believe: you can't control everything life throws at you, but you can control yourself. You can keep hoping for the best and be the hero in your own life. And rest easy knowing that if Maggie ever writes a novel about you, the reader will have been rooting for you all along.TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE and crying at the end and 2) a werewolf dream inspired by a werewolf short story contest.

I don't think they would be hunted necessarily, but certainly quarantined. Can you imagine Americans letting contagious werewolves live alongside their kids? Nah. We're sissies.    Terra ~ One of the things that impressed me about Shiver was the purity and innocence of Sam and Grace considering the trauma that they experienced many years earlier. Is there something of a lesson to be learned here and what do you think it is?    Maggie ~ I think it was actually harder for Graceto stay innocent and positive than Sam. Sam had role models after he became a wolf: Beck and Ulrik and Paul. Despite his weird and awful situation, he had people to look up to. People who were handling their tough lot the best they could; people capable of the best sort of unconditional love. Grace, on the other hand, lived in the hope of finding that sort of love. In my head her books helped her with that, because they give you window into another world and show you people that you hope exist even if they aren't in your life yet.    I don't know if there's a lesson, but I know what I believe: you can't control everything life throws at you, but you can control yourself. You can keep hoping for the best and be the hero in your own life. And rest easy knowing that if Maggie ever writes a novel about you, the reader will have been rooting for you all along.
0743298039|5.0|I tell the truth when I can say, without hesitation, that Diane Setterfield's \\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" is one of the most splended, well-crafted books I have read in a very long time. Not only does give credit to Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre and lesser-known Villette, but also many other literary heroes, who take their place as the object of the Margaret Lea's affections.<br />You yearn for the mysterious author Vida Winter to tell the truth, and you wait (albeit not always patiently) as she tells her story, slowly. You ponder some of its mysteries until you are able to realize the truth, when, for Margaret Lea, Vida Winter's chosen biographer, it clicks like a lightbulb in her mind.<br />With twists and turns aplenty, and a delightful, old-fashioned feeling, The Thirteenth Tale pays homage to the 18th and 19th century novels. It is everything a book ought to be, and more.

0394827996|4.0|A baby fish and a tadpole in a pond become friends.  When the tadpole grows into a frog, he leaves the water to explore the land above.  Upon hearing from his friend about this wondrous world, the fish decides to go see it.  But he leaves the water at his peril, only to be rescued just in time by the frog.<br /><br />This is not a moralistic story, but it lays some groundwork for an understanding of what constitutes truth.  This especially relates to the postmodern idea that reality (especially spiritual reality) is whatever we perceive it to be.  In this story the fish imagines birds, cows, humans, and other animals as fish-shaped beings.  His perception does not alter the true form of birds, cows, humans and other animals -- and chortling children will understand this as the fish's funny conceptions are juxtaposed with reality.<br /><br />The point is driven home not only with humor but also with dramatic tension.  Although the fish perceives the world above as a place where he can thrive, he is proven wrong when he attempts to breathe air.  After returning to his own environment, he admits that \\"fish is fish\\" and accepts his place in the pond.  So the story dramatizes the truth that there are certain laws inherent in the created order, and that to ignore them is dangerous.

0307269981|5.0|My first Review ever. I read a lot of books and have become enchanted with the characters and setting of Stieg Larsson's trilogoy. I walk around the house trying to talk in a sweedish accent saying Blumquest, Salinder, and Susslin (my wife thinks I am crazy) . I am only half the way done the second one and can't wait for the 3rd. I  Highly reccomend this series to any fan of the historical murder-mystery genre.

1439586128|4.0|I knew it wouldn't take long for J.K. Rowling to produce some other book related to her bestselling \\"Harry Potter\\" series.<br /><br />Admittedly the main link is that the \\"The Tales of Beedle The Bard\\" are all given a hefty postscript by the late Albus Dumbledore, headmaster of Rowling's fictional magic academy. It's a very quick children's book with some old-fashioned fairy tales in the Brothers Grimm mold, and a slightly tongue-in-cheek (but overly long) examinations afterward.<br /><br />First there's the tale of an extraordinarily selfish young wizard, whose father bequeaths him a cauldron and a slipper. When the wizard refuses to help the local Muggles, the cauldron suddenly sprouts a brass foot and starts pursuing him, making his life a living hell until he starts helping people other than himself.<br /><br />Then three young witches are attempting to get to the Fountain of Fair Fortune -- one is seriously ill, one is poor, and one got dumped. They end up accompanied by an extremely unlucky knight, and they are forced to handle three obstacles before they can get to the fountain.<br /><br />Then it's a somewhat darker tale about a warlock who lives alone because he cares nothing for anyone, until a visitor bruises his ego by suggesting that he can't get a wife -- leading him to pursue a sweet, wealthy and gorgeous young woman. But she is frightened by the warlock's heartless nature -- and when he reveals his \\"treasure\\" to her, tragic consequences ensue.<br /><br />There's a tale about a king who tries to gain control of all his kingdom's magic, capturing all the witches and trying to learn magic himself. His instructor is nothing but a greedy faker, who quickly enters into a minor war with the king's washerwoman Babbitty -- who may be an actual witch. Finally, the story of three brothers offered three gifts by Death -- who, of course, has an ulterior motive. Don't they always?<br /><br />For the record, \\"The Tales of Beedle the Bard\\" is a very short book -- only about a hundred shortish pages long. Unlike the bestselling \\"Harry Potter\\" series (where \\"Tales of Beedle the Bard\\" apparently took on a pivotal role) this book is clearly for children -- especially since each one is a clear moral message.<br /><br />And at least half of that is made up of the preface (explaining the fictional history of the stories -- including that this is a new translation by Hermione Granger) and the quirky analyses (apparently by Albus Dumbledore). In fact, too much space is taken up by the analyses, although they are cleverly written and have a touch of satire (such as the account of someone trying to \\"clean up\\" the tales, with nauseating results).<br /><br />And J.K. Rowling's slightly tongue-in-cheek prose and sprightly imagination work well with the fairy tale format. She gives the stories some nicely gruesome imagery (the twisted, hair-covered heart) and a medieval flavour with tiny rural villages, magical quests, kings, knights, a deathly psychopomp and a sprightly witchy washerwoman who's far cleverer than anyone expects. And though witches and wizards come into play during the stories, the focus is on their personalities and trials rather than their magic.<br /><br />J.K. Rowling's \\"Tales of Beedle the Bard\\" is way too short, but her fairy tales are clever and well-written, and the afterwords are even cleverer.like the bestselling \\"Harry Potter\\" series (where \\"Tales of Beedle the Bard\\" apparently took on a pivotal role) this book is clearly for children -- especially since each one is a clear moral message.

B001NLL0RW|3.0|Possessed tremendous descriptions of weather that was totally unneccessary.  Is a ping pong match between 2 sets of main characters and left wondering when any of them slept since the book was written in time frame.  Still can not fathom the main character's deductive skills in the unbelievable escape from the ancient entrapment.  Can best be summed up as a combination of Raiders of the Lost Ark and James Bond with the obvious romantic interludes.
B0001O3YD0|5.0|Imagine the legendary \\"Flight of the Phoenix,\\" except the crash is on a barren alien planet... and there are nasty flesh-eating monsters. And a serial killer.<br /><br />That describes David Twohy's most artistically adept movie, the raw and dusty \\"Pitch Black. This cult movie starts off as your average gang of embattled, ill-matched castaways struggling to survive, but it that becomes utterly brilliant as it slowly slips from gritty sci-fi to harrowing, claustrophobic horror. And yes, even Vin Diesel gives an awesome performance in this one.<br /><br />After a meteor storm, a sleeper transport crashes on a desolate desert planet. Most of the passengers survive, including a stowaway kid and a dangerous prisoner, Riddick (Vin Diesel). Unfortunately, it turns out that the entire planet is a desert because it's blasted by three suns all throughout the day, and the survivors have little food, water or shelter. Oh yeah, and Riddick has broken out.<br /><br />To find the necessities, a small group led by Carolyn Fry Radha Mitchell) sets out across the desert -- and discovers a swarm of vicious omnivorous creatures in a cave. Fortunately they can't come out into the light. But when the group finds a geological survey station, they learn that a monthlong eclipse is about to fall over the planet -- meaning the creatures will soon eat them all if they don't escape from the desolate planet, and some of them aren't gonna make it.<br /><br />Personally I haven't liked David Twohy's work except the 1996 sci-fi film \\"Arrival,\\" but \\"Pitch Black\\" is the kind of brilliant cult movie that almost makes up for an otherwise okay-to-bad filmography. This is not a polished space opera, but a dingy, grimy, dirty sci-fi movie full of recognizably ugly technology and stained morals -- not to mention some truly grotesque deaths. And not all of them are from the winged beasties either (think chest impalement).<br /><br />And Twohy gives the movie a very bleak, vaguely disturbing look -- endless chalky deserts filled with bones, grimy ships torn to pieces, empty skies, and searing pale light that makes everyone look half dead. Even the beautiful colourful expanses of space seem vaguely ominous. But the whole thing suddenly becomes jump-in-your-seat scary when the monsters attack, and start eating people as they run. The one problem? COME ON, what are the chances that they would JUST HAPPEN to arrive for the once-in-two-decades eclipse?<br /><br />And the feeling of suspense is heightened by sharp-edged, pared-down dialogue (\\"You're dancing on razor blades here\\") and a warped sense of humor -- we're assured that \\"No similarity to actual persons or predators, living or dead, is intended or should be inferred.\\" Nice.<br /><br />The characters are a pretty mixed bag, and there's always the haunting realization that most of them would easily turn on each other to save themselves -- and in fact, the main character even does that in the first few minutes of the film. There's benevolent Muslim pilgrims, a hard-nosed bounty hunter, a prissy dude who hoards booze, and an annoying urchin of ambiguous gender. The standouts are Claudia Black as the tough Shazza, and Keith David as the kindly Abu \\"Imam\\" al-Walid.<br /><br />As for the leads, Diesel gives a pretty good performance as a wisecracking killer with a distinctly creepy edge (ew, he took a hair sample) and \\"shine\\" eyes that let him see in the dark. But I was most impressed by Mitchell's Fry, as a selfish hardened leader who learns to defend other people's lives in a crunch.<br /><br />\\"Pitch Black\\" is a fast, eerie, bloody little sci-fi movie with a nasty little planet full of even nastier creatures that are just waiting for dark.

B0002GTWQA|3.0|It's still good, but at times hard to follow, and also incomplete in some areas. For example what were they fighting about? The film didn't go into good detail about what the fighting was about; was it religious? was it political? what what? The scenes were flawless, and the acting was rather good, and the chemistry between O'Toole, and the girl was splendid, but what was the fighting all about? I did get what the story was about, and that was about a man who needed a second chance to redeem himself after he blew it the first time around. The film stars Peter O' Toole as the main character of Lord Jim, and he was an officer in the British Navy, and he would end up being disgraced as a coward during a hurricane he instead of saving the passengers jumps with the rest of the crew. After being ousted by the British Navy he wanders for a period of time, and then fate brings him to an island that he's trying to open a trade route to, and he ends up leading a coup as a group of islanders(not New York mind you) are fighting against a corrupt group of pirates to bring law and order to their land, or so that's what I got out of the movie, and Lord Jim pays the ultimate price. This was still a good movie despite being hard to follow at times as it kept my interest going. Perhaps now I will venture into reading the book, and see if I can find out more about this story.
B001AQMBKA|4.0|It was bound to happen -- after a breathtaking first season, expectations were high for the continuation of \\"Lost,\\" a creepy, semi-mystical series with a checkered cast and an exotic island setting.<br /><br />\\"Lost's\\" second season builds on the story of the first season, picking up where it left off. Though it has some flaws -- a bit of bad casting and some lag in the \\"island\\" stories -- it's still intriguing and eerie, and solves old mysteries as it introduces new ones, with shocking twists on characters you thought you knew.<br /><br />As the season opens, Locke, Kate and Jack finally enter the mysterious hatch. But they didn't count on finding a concrete bunker, a button that might postpone doomsday -- and a frantic man who is very familiar to Jack. Meanwhile, Michael, Sawyer and Jin manage to make it back to the island -- and are promptly captured by a band of strangers.<br /><br />These people turn out to be castaways from the fallen plane's tail section, led by the suspicious Ana Lucia (Michelle Rodrieguez). They make the trek to the opposite side of the island, but as they arrive, Ana makes a fatal mistake -- she shoots Shannon. Nice way to start integrating the groups.<br /><br />As the season goes on, new personal crises arise when Locke loses faith in the island, Michael goes off to find Walt, Hurley falls in love with one of the tailies, Claire explores what happened to her during her \\"missing month,\\" and Sawyer scores an unexpected coup which gets him all the guns in the camp.<br /><br />As the season goes on, things start to heat up. The mysterious French woman gives an \\"Other\\" she trapped over to Sayid, but is he really an enemy, or just an innocent castaway? And as Locke and Eko discover the true purpose of the hatches, one of the lost returns to the camp -- and treachery is guiding the castaways into a trap...<br /><br />\\"Lost\\"'s second seasons started out strong and thrilling, then hit a dead spot for a few episodes, before picking back up again. While the middling episodes are solid enough, the best parts are at the start and finish, where the writers throw several shocking twists into the storyline.<br /><br />The mystery of the island itself is not solved -- the presence of the mysterious Dharma Corporation is revealed. But the corporation doesn't explain how the island has healing powers. Some answers are revealed, and some mysteries simply get more complex. On the character backstory front, the castaways' problems still haunt them, from imaginary friends to torture to drugs.<br /><br />The returning cast continues the compelling job they did in the first season, especially Dominic Monaghan, Evangeline Lilly, Daniel Dae Kim, Naveen Andrews, and Jorge Garcia, who all get their pasts raked up again; the actors do a magnificent job with guilt, sorrow, longing, and love. In fact, all of them do a good job, including ex-star Maggie Grace, who manages to make us actually LIKE Shannon in her final episode.<br /><br />As for the \\"tailies,\\" there are good and bad choices. Michelle Rodrieguez was an appalling choice, since her butch ex-cop is the same character she's been doing for years. But on the flip side is Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, who quickly won fans' hearts as the spiritual Mr. Eko, a mysterious and dangerous priest/drugrunner. Think a Christian counterpart to Locke's animist believer.<br /><br />The extras are a fairly good bunch -- the video and sound are beautifully spruced up, and it has deleted scenes, a bunch of featurettes (on everything from the awesome Sawyer to the strange theories that the show provokes), Easter eggs, audio commentary with writers, directors and actors, cut flashbacks sneak peeks, bloopers, and so on and so forth.<br /><br />\\"Lost\\" stumbled a bit in the middle of the second season, but regained its footing for shocking, explosive episodes leading up to the finale.

B00288KNJU|5.0|Besides The Dark Knight (Batman), this is the finest BR implementation of a movie. The details are exquisitely high. The shadow, reflection and glare are so real in this animation and the details are beyond words.     Sound fidelity is also up there, with more crispness that's significantly higher than any other BR I own --- very pure.    I only wish other BR productions have put in as much effort as this one. It is a pure delight to watch. And, the plot is full of surprises as well. Creative plot with a creepy touch.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|Up until a couple of weeks ago, I had never heard of a headphone amp. Well, I guess part of the reason is that I never owned a good pair of phones. I recently bought a pair of [[ASIN:B0001FTVE0 Sennheiser HD-595 Premier Headphone]] (here on Amazon), which are tight (see my review). The Senns have pretty high impedance (50 ohms), and my netbook and ipod don't have enough juice to power it. Therefore, the need for a headphone amp arose.<br /><br />One of the first HP amps that I came across was the FiiO F5. I had never heard of this brand. I think a reviewer mentioned that its Chinese. Anyhoo, The features that hooked me was its price, size(it's the same size as the iPod shuffle), and simplicity. Seeing a majority of positive reviews, I decided to go for it. I received it in 3 days from Head-Direct (which I would recommend since it was under $25 with shipping, and they use Amazon for payment).<br /><br /> Upon first trial through my iPod, I was a little miffed because there was a high frequency \\"noise\\", is the best way I can describe it. But it went away when I played the music, and it never recurred. I played music with, and without the amp, and the difference is quite remarkable. With thew FiiO connected, aside from a big boost in volume, the depth is also enhanced. The bass boost is subtle, but noticable. I would recommend maxing out the volume on the amp and controlling the volume from the source, as the button is quite small and right next to the output plug.<br /><br />Other than the sound, the things I like about it is its size, internal rechargeable battery, on/off button, clip, and blue/red  light, which indicates when it is on/off or charging/charged. It also comes with a 6\\" and 3' cord, and a USB to mini USB charging cable.<br /><br />The only things I can think of that I don't like is the fact that it charges through the computer, which means that, 1) you need access to a computer, and 2) the computer has to be on. I also find it a little disturbing that the instruction manual states that the battery can be charged and discharged hundreds of times, BUT the battery will eventually wear out and is irreplaceable. Hopefully, it will last 25 bucks worth of charges! Which brings me to question how long the charge will last. And since I just got it, I have yet to figure that out. Highly recommend it.hat the battery can be charged and discharged hundreds of times, BUT the battery will eventually wear out and is irreplaceable. Hopefully, it will last 25 bucks worth of charges!

0307454541|5.0|I began this book wondering what in the world they could possibly have as interesting crime in Sweden to lure an American.  After all, the Swedes are notoriously civilized and socially responsible compared to us, aren't they?  Just cross reference any Ingmar Bergmann film, or Lasse Hallstrom film.  After reading this book plus its sequel, THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE, I now have an entirely different view of Sweden and Swedish crime, especially sexually based crime.<br /><br />I really love Elizabeth George and Val McDermid as crime writers.  Their novels are very well structured and layered. Larsson is very much like them as a writer and he even has one of his main characters reading their books as part of the story!  There are two main characters.  Blomkvist, a Swedish financial journalist and publisher in his mid forties (somewhat like the author) and Salander, a brilliant yet odd investigator for a private security firm in her mid twenties.  I like Blomkvist but it is Salander who makes the novel.  She is what is totally new and fresh on the mystery scene.  She is also the girl with the dragon tattoo.  Although we learn just about everything we need to know about Blomkvist early in the book, Salander only becomes gradually known to us and then not entirely.  The second book in the series uncovers her past even further.<br /><br />Perhaps what is most unique about Salander is that she has been incredibly victimized by the underbelly of Swedish criminal society yet she also has triumphed as a survivor and a vigilante with her own moral code.  She can save people or destroy them with a flick of her computer mouse as she is the best hacker in Sweden, known as the WASP.<br /><br />At the heart of this novel are terrible sexual crimes in Sweden.  Salander is a victim of these crimes and as the mystery unfolds we discover the many sexual criminal secrets of the Vanger family.  Both Blomkvist and Salander have been hired by the Vanger family patriarch to discover what happened to his niece Harriet who disappeared in the 1960s without a trace.<br /><br />Blomkvist is trying to redeem himself from journalistic disgrace in this tale but Salander is much more interested in the bigger picture of Swedish sexual crime.  Both Salander and Harriet Vanger are at the core of sexual crime in Sweden today and thus are at the heart of the book.<br /><br />There are only three books in this series because the author died after handing in the three manuscripts to the publisher.  I am dismayed that I only have one more book to look forward to by Larsson.<br /><br />I tried listening to the audio of this book instead of reading it but I just couldn't get into it that way.  So I read it the old fashioned way instead--in one day!<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

0307269981|5.0|I read Larsson's second book in one day as well.  It is summer time and it is a fabulous book to have poolside.<br /><br />Larsson goes even further with his heroine Salander this time and uncovers more in Swedish sex crimes. Although the victims often end up murdered too, it is the depravity of the sex crimes in modern Sweden which is truly awful and thus the linchpin of Larsson's interest.<br /><br />Salander is once again the girl in the title.  It is she who literally put someone on fire.  But it is also a metaphor because Salander cannot walk away from anyone who is being victimized and most especially women who are being victimized.  She risks everything every time she takes up the gauntlet but she can't even begin to stop herself from doing so.  In this book we find out why this is so.<br /><br />Blomkvist returns too and it is his magazine MILLENIUM which sets the story in motion.  He has a young male journalist working for him who is just about to publish a searing article and book with MILLENIUM on the sex trade in Sweden.  His girlfriend is a criminologist from the university who has provided him with all of the technical expertise.  Just before he can finish both works, he and his girlfriend are gunned down.  It turns out that Salander's guardian is executed the same night.  Worst of all, the same gun is used on all three victims and Salander's prints are on the gun.<br /><br />One would think therefore that this book is all about clearing Salander and finding the real murderer.  Well, the book does go about doing that.  However, it is so well layered and developed that we find out so much more.  The best part of all is that we find out about the entire childhood of Salander which led her to becoming who she is today.  This also fits perfectly with the case she must solve.<br /><br />There is an interesting thing that Larsson does in this book and the prior one.  Blomkvist at 45 has led a sexually open existence.

The best way to remember the good old times when we dance, laugh, cried and lived with MJ's music is having this collection. If you are looking for something more complete, I recommend Michael Jackson: The Ultimate Collection, also available on Amazon.

1401307787|5.0|This book started me down a path -- a path I am still on -- studying Buddhist principles. It is written in a gentle voice. Kabat-Zinn shows through his language, his voice, his clarity, and his ideas that he genuinely cares about the people's well being.     This book is a place to start, but I wouldn't classify it merely as a beginner's beginning. It is useful and helpful for anyone in the early part of their journey into Eastern ideas.    The book is in three main parts with several short chapters in each part. It works well to read a chapter and then ponder it. At the end of a few chapters, Kabat-Zinn suggests exercises, though that is a poor name for them. He labels them \\"Try.\\" Much better. And indicative of the care with which the book is written.    There are podcasts and videos of Kabat-Zinn speaking around the 'net. Check them out. He comes across with the same gentleness, and absolute brilliance, as he does in this book.
0385339682|3.0|Book is intriguing enough to keep you interest like any other John Grisham movie. Can't remember all the mistakes, but one that stands out is his mention of 9mm \\"Glock\\" pistol collection of Harry Rex, but Glock was introduced in US in the early 80s. I guess everyone that isn't familiar with firearm history is just happy to mention the Glock pistol name to fill some pages.    There are some more, but I am surprised that John Grisham has failed to perform this simple research.
B0011V9CKG|3.0|This movie is well done but has a few problems.    When the alleged \\"father\\" shows to Libria the images of the Rodney King beating in L.A. and Hitler and speaks of hate crimes, why do we see his loyal subjects entering the 'nether' to shoot up people hiding record players, paintings, and fancy lamps? Although the dreaded subject of 'feeling' is considered a crime in this flick, the idea of what positive feelings are is totally ignored. It's as if Libria is more of a cult than a society attempting to quell man's hatred and disdain for his fellow man.    The problem with this movie is that it shows one faction of the human race (doped up, unfeeling, murderous automatons) remorselessly killing people who hang out staring at art, when according to \\"father\\" they should be eradicating despots like Hilter, and racists who commit hate crimes. The makers of this movie either left out or cleverly avoided religion and all its historical crimes thus leaving the true message of the movie vague, if not incomplete.    This is a good movie, is well done with solid acting, unpretentious sets, and the necessary tension required of such a tale, but its message is far from clear.
0307588335|5.0|As painful as it is to read about the failure of Lehman Brothers, Lawrence McDonald does so in a straight-forward, easy to read fashion, incorporating bits of humor and various interesting anecdotes throughout. His story is engaging, funny and informative without being overly technical.  As someone who worked as a \\"mid level manager\\" at an Investment Bank, I appreciated hearing the Lehman story from a \\"Peer's\\" perspective.  It was very well researched and gives great insight into the Lehman Brother's culture.  Would highly recommend it.
1594201927|3.0|N. Ferguson treats shortly but fairly such well known events in the financial history of mankind as, among others, the rise of the houses of the Medicis and the Rotschilds, the stock market crashes of 1914, 1929 and 1987, the German hyperinflation after WW I, the Bretton Woods agreements, Argentina's economic downfall, the Enron hyper manipulation (of gas prices) or John law's disastrous experiments with paper money.    His monetary history is divided in five parts: the ascent of money and banking, the invention of public bonds, the creation of joint-stock companies with limited liabilities, the protection against risk (insurance, derivatives, the welfare State) and the all importance of real estate (as a collateral for public and private loans).    One of his heroes is Milton Friedman and his theory of monetarism. But, as James K. Galbraith explains clearly in his book, `The Predator State', monetarism is not an option as an economic policy, because interest rates, not the money stock, drive the economy.  The author praises highly the late Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet for choosing MF as his main economic adviser, but his treatment of the coup d'état against the democratically elected Chilean President, Salvador Allende, is blatantly false and unacceptable.    Another of his heroes is G. Soros. As Business Week journalist, Gene C. Marcial, wrote in his book `Secrets of the Street', G. Soros had a mole in the highest echelons of the Bank of England, who apparently informed him of the decision that the value of the pound would not be defended anymore. Nobody talks about the second party (the buyer of the pounds) involved in this apparently rigged transaction.    One of his main targets is Nobel Prize winner, Joseph Stiglitz. The latter is insidiously attacked on one aspect (the risk of inflation through money printing) of his criticism of the IMF policies imposed on its members (the `shock doctrine'). From the disastrous impact on the economies and the populations of those IMF members, not one word (see, N. Klein's `The Shock Doctrine' and J. Stiglitz's `Globalization and its Discontents').    The book ends with a short discussion on the global shift of economic power from the West to the East. A mighty important item indeed.    I recommend this book only as an introduction, as a first global view, on the history of money and its derivatives on our planet.
0307588335|5.0|\\"A Colossal Failure of Common Sense..\\" by Lawrence McDonald is an outstanding book about the fall of Lehman Brothers.  This book is well written, easy to read, and very informative.    It's a well written masterpiece about the life and career of Lawrence McDonald and how he came to work at Lehman.  The personal touch detailing his background from childhood through early career (dot com startup to Morgan Stanley to Lehman Brothers) was very appropriate.  Additionally, Lawrence teaches about the world of finance, while keeping the reader engaged in the story of Lehman.  This book is a must read for anyone who wants to learn about Wall Street. I was surprised that this book was so good and entertaining that it could be classified as a \\"fun\\" beach read.  Lawrence McDonald does such a great job of bringing the reader from Main Street America into the corner offices of Wall Street.     \\"A Colossal Failure of Common Sense..\\" is an awesome read and I highly recommend it to everyone!  Enjoy.
B000GKW4I0|5.0|I have been a dinosaur nut ever since my preschool years.  My collection of dinosaur toys and models once numbered over one hundred, and I was always on the scout for more.  However, I had pretty much moved on in the past fifteen years, deciding that collecting toys was something only kids should do.  I gave away all but my faovorite \\"Jurassic Park: The Lost World\\" stegosaurus, which I kept as a sentimental paperweight.  However, a couple of weeks ago, I happened upon the Papo collection and was delighted to discover that these were what I had always been searching for:  True replica figurines that did not look like toys in any way.  I decided to splurge on myself and ordered the entire set.  They now adorn the shelves of my home, and I could not be more pleased with them.  And my childhood favorite, the stegosaurus, is the most beautiful replica I have ever seen.  I would advise anyone to buy the set, but, for heavens sake, don't let your kids play with them!  They're too nice for that!  Looking forward to Papo's next installments.  (Their newest one, the allosaurus, is the first one not to be modelled directly from the Jurassic Park designs of legendary creature designer Mark \\"Crash\\" McCreery, but it, too, is at the same level of perfection as the rest of the collection.)  My suggestion can be summed up in one word: BRACHIOSAURUS.

B001QTXM5Y|5.0|The watchmen movie was an amazing movie-    as best as could be done with a few exceptions all considerations given.    the addiciton of the music and the extended version (have not seen the original theatrical release) director's cut is very true to the original storyline and makes valid attempts to improve on it for the transition of the story to a different medium.    the addition of music and choice of the scores added to the story (which is why i wish it could be more true tot he original source material- but transition of mediums makes that near-impossible).    the one problem i had that they seemed to senselessly veer from the source material for no real reason was the endings. not the overall plot by the (you can't really call him/her an antagonist really- don't want to spoil it, nor a protagonist- thats the beauty part).    but i think the original source material dialogue could have been done a lot better at carrying the point rather than the last scenes in the arctic devolving into wtf?    almost like the director wanted to differentiate \\"his\\" version but failed miserably.    other than that a great adaptation of an even greater story and different where necessary in most cases.    i see why the lives of the \\"generic\\" people were left out for time constraints, they were IMO an important part of the story, but given the time constraints on the movie- extending the plot might not have worked out well.
B001DJ7PNW|5.0|When Oliver Stone sat down to write and direct this picture, given that 95% of the data contained within was available in numerous books since the '60s and '70s, he must have expected the typically dismissive reaction those paperback treatises had largely received.<br /><br />Instead, all Hell broke loose.<br /><br />Not since the jaw-droppingly racist epic THE BIRTH OF A NATION seventy-six years earlier had a movie received such a startlingly prickly response or would become such a controversy.<br /><br />Based rather loosely on New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison's prosecution of local businessman Clay Shaw regarding Shaw's alleged complicity in setting up Lee Harvey Oswald in the 1963 JFK assassination (\\"loosely\\" because the investigation and trial is used as a format for presenting data uncovered in some cases by other investigators and at a later date) the picture is a mesmerizingly rich montage of fact and educated theory, Stone's quick-cuts editing style then highly unusual (though now used incessantly in movies about absolutely nothing) and evocative. He does an impressive job of communicating a massive amount of information to the audience in only about three hours. But it's exactly Stone's cinematic skill which caused \\"JFK\\" to explode into reviled critical consciousness in a manner all those assassination books never would, could or did.<br /><br />Any honest student of the assassination won't be stunned by the content. But the media and governmental overreactive upsurge against the movie was almost more damning that the movie itself.<br /><br />Even today, nearly two decades after the film was released, it's astounding how infamous it remains. Also astounding is how the LoneNut/Oswald-did-it mindset continues to hold on. If one checks out the numerous assassination Internet websites, for example, they are nearly all stalwart defenders of the Warren Commission, some surfacely affecting objectivity, some rabidly direct --- they are essentially the cyber version of Gerald Posner's 1993 \\"Case Closed\\", once called \\"the most dishonest book ever written\\" and a literary response to Stone's movie. \\"Case Closed\\" (and those websites) clearly know the data: they go into great, intricate detail in an effort to meticulously deconstruct all of the pro-conspiracy material.... only they deconstruct falsely. As anyone who knows the material will quickly realize. But, to the uninitiated, such sites' endless, 24/7 \\"debunking\\" (a favorite phrase by the fervent and on-message-beyond-belief LoneNut bloggers who haunt the Internet) of the conspiracy can appear quite convincing, just as these more casual audiences are so easily fooled by the authoritative yet selectively sloppy Untruths of Peter Jennings' 40th Anniversary Special for ABC in 2003 or (that other Stone's) \\"Oswald's Ghost.\\"<br /><br />The eternal rationalizations, the endless manipulations from the pro-Warren Commission crowd. The unending assertions of, \\"Oh, I use to be a conspiracy believer, too, until I learned that.... ,\\" and the ubiquitous world-weary faux tones of, \\"Let's just finally get this behind us, people. If you would read the superb and painstaking investigation by ...... then, you would know that this was all concretely disproved years ago when.....\\"<br /><br />On and on and on.<br /><br />Apparently, the only massive conspiracy this seething, vitriolic army of LoneNutters finds credible is that countless otherwise unconnected witnesses --- even those first-hand witnesses from Dealey Plaza! --- all somehow colluded in their shameless efforts to clear Oswald, frame the CIA, or just to frame faceless gunman in the trees behind the picket fence. All for money or attention or to achieve some other unspecified spineless agendum.<br /><br />At this late date, however, with nearly all of the conspirators presumably long gone (and ~75% of the American public still convinced of the conspiracy, as they have been since the '60s) why is maintaining The Lie so important in some corners? As clearly it is. It has, after all, been nearly half a century since Kennedy died on the streets of Dallas.<br /><br />Perhaps because the dynamic behind the assassination of the 35th president (or the dynamic behind misrepresenting it) is still essentially in place. 'The Secret State' is an awfully mysterious phrase, but it simply reflects large corporate business interests and those interests' determined defense of their rights to circumvent our democratic processes at every possible turn... Up until the recent near-Depressional economic downturn, the national news media (generally in bed with the same corporations) wouldn't even fleetingly address arguably the most pressing issue of our time: corporate corruption and Big Business's stranglehold on all levels of our government. And even now, such coverage is superficial and grudging at best.<br /><br />So when famed Watergate burglar E Howard Hunt's 2004 handwritten and audio-taped confession of personal and CIA/LBJ involvement in JFK's murder can't even receive coverage in the national media decades after the event, where are we still?<br /><br />It seems there is no pro-conspiracy revelation, no matter how dramatic and credible, which can receive coverage. And no anti-conspiracy evidence, no matter how flimsy and contrived, which can't.<br /><br />Many detractors have sneered that it's dreadful that millions of youngsters perceive the JFK assassination thru the \\"distorted lens\\" of Oliver Stone.

B001CN2WXM|5.0|After watching Hollywood virtually incapable of producing a convincing period piece during the stultifyingly self-conscious '80s, what a relief to see that the 1990s didn't have the same problem.<br /><br />LA CONFIDENTIAL is a splashy, game cinematic display of slime, corruption and intrigue set to the backdrop of 1950s showbiz-obsessed Los Angeles and its infamously dirty police department. With Jerry Goldsmith's CHINATOWNesque score adding immeasurably to the thing.<br /><br />Oh, I suppose it's not perfect. But darn near close to it.<br /><br />Don't be turned off by (as a result of expecting too much from) Kim Basinger's Oscar'd performance: she's okay and certainly acceptable given the role, but her award-winning stature was largely overhyped because, as 1997 was the year of horrid TITANIC (which was guaranteed an Oscar sweep due to block voting from two studios) the much-superior LA CONFIDENTIAL was thrown a consiliatory bone which landed in Kim's lap... Again, she's just fine, but don't sit down to watch this thinking she's going to be the main attraction; she's really a lesser light in the picture.<br /><br />Anyway, it's interesting how rarely Tinseltown has ever managed to do a really captivatingly gossipy, warts-and-all (if fictionalized) expose on itself. But LA CONFIDENTIAL has succeeded in doing exactly that.<br /><br />I have essentially no complaints.<br /><br />Except, perhaps, for the Lana Turner scene: Turner was far too famous not to hire a model who more closely resembled her; as a result of not doing so, the moment is nowhere near as funny as it could've been.

1416562605|4.0|An interesting read. I loaned the book from my local library and finished it in a couple of sittings. The style of story telling keeps you wanting to read more. The detailed description of each character, their behavior and habits should be very interesting to westerners. This novel offers a glimpse into the \\"other\\" India much like the movie Slumdog did. The author is quite successful in portraying a character with gray moral shades who you want to root for.     I wouldn't be surprised if most Indians find the material unoriginal. There are countless Indian Bollywood movies which show similar gray characters and have similar plots.
0385751060|2.0|I really enjoyed the movie and had to order the book.  This was my all time favorite movie which set high expectations on the book.  I felt it was poorly written and felt very conjested.  I also did'nt like how the author expressed character expression by saying \\"he opened his mouth in the shape of an O\\" that just annoyed me.  He also repeated himself a lot in the beggining he must have talked about the maid Maria finding things he hid in the back of his closet 10 times.  What could a 9 year old boy possibly be hideing?  I also found i really did'nt like or care for Bruno in this book he was a naive, pouting, spoiled brat in no way like the movie in which he seemed innocent and kind hearted.  Another thing that annoyed me was i don't think the author was very clear and i can't believe i'm saying this but he was'nt nearly descriptive enough.  I hate books that are to wordy and move to slowly but this was just the opposite i found myself saying wait what about that.  I was very disappointed.  The movie is still my favorite movie of all time but this book left a sour taste in my mouth.
B0010YSD7M|3.0|Please believe me, I'm a very big fan of Stargate SG-1.  The only episodes I didn't like were the 100th (Wormhole Extreme) and the 200th - and even these had a few good moments.  So when I say I was disappointed in \\"The Ark of Truth,\\" I say that as someone who greatly appreciates almost every aspect of this show.  I think I may have expected too much from this movie.  When the Ori story arc began, it not only breathed new life into the show, it created an expectation of almost non-stop excitement.  Each new Ori-related episode kept the excitement going and kept adding a little bit more, until I (like so many others, I'm sure) couldn't wait to see the resolution of the story arc.  That's why this was somewhat of a let-down.  It almost seemed in this move that they just wanted to get the Ori over with so they could move on to some other story line.  The final resolution had a very artificial feel to it.  I realize that the show's  weakness (other than it's forays into comedy, which never quite worked) was a tendency to rely too much on a \\"Deus Ex Machina\\" type of resolution; and that's exactly what happened here.  The resolution didn't proceed from or rise out of the struggles of the SG-1; it was just kind of tacked on at the end.  Don't get me wrong: it was still well worth buying and watching; and I guarantee you, if I had never seen any other Stargate SG-1 story, I'd be shouting its praises from the rooftops.  But I have seen other stories - ten seasons worth of stories.  And that's a hard act to follow.

B0000DJE9R|5.0|Even though many of these songs have been on previous greatest hits albums and such, a few like Black and White, and Thriller are re-edited for the beginning of the songs to delve right into the music.  It also includes two great songs from \\"Invincible\\" that haven't been included on any other greatest hits albums to add to his top most played songs.  Even though not all of these songs have been number one on the charts, they seem like they have been just because they are Michael Jackson's songs.

0618871713|4.0|In this graphic memoir, Bechdel focused on her relationship with her father.  She gradually reveals his struggles with his own sexuality, as well as her own coming out.  She grapples, too, with the possibility that her father committed suicide.      The title refers to the family's funeral home; her father was a high school English teacher but also worked part-time as the funeral director.  He was, too, an obsessive decorate and renovator.  He seems to have been a very unhappy man, frustrated in his limited life, and perhaps believing that he should have had a more glamorous, artistic, and open life.  These resentments come out in coldness and even violence toward the children; a sterile, angry marriage; and secret homosexual affairs (sometimes with teenaged boys.    But Bechdel seems to come to some understanding of her father by the end of the book, and she sees their commonalities.  She doesn't deny his shortcomings, but she comes to greater acceptance of him as a full, complex person, just as she does of herself.  Their childhood was not completely bleak, either.  Many of the pictures show the children playing and laughing--including in the funeral home.  She had a good relationship with her two brothers, and she had multiple friends.  While her mother was not warm or open, either--she had her share of anger and resentment--Bechdel eventually develops a stronger relationship with her, too.  And much of the book is funny, with quirky, precise observations.    There are two techniques in the book that I really liked.  First, each chapter is centered on a literary character or idea, a reflection of Bechdel's (and her father's) interest in books.  These central allusions focus each chapter, serving as a kind of theme or unifying principle, but not heavy-handedly.  Second, the pictures don't always directly illustrate the words.  In many cases, something different is going on in the pictures from what's being said in the narration.  The words and pictures then complement, reinforce, or even contradict each other, and so Bechdel uses the graphic form to add more depth to the work.
B000Z0OX9O|3.0|As the other reviewers comment, this only adds a little bit of actual new music from the film previously unreleased.  The rest is re-composition, re-orchestration and disc 3 is all new material from Vangelis.<br /><br />For blade runner fans, it's still worth having, the material on disc 2 is crisp and of a higher quality than the bootlegs.  You can also finally hear a version of \\"fading away\\" that does not include Rutger Hauer's magnificent speech.<br /><br />For Vangelis fans, it's worth having as the first new release in a long time from a composer who more or less appears to be retired at this point. (He is 66 as of this writing and has not released an album or score in 8 years.)<br /><br />The last few tracks on CD 3 are very good, Spotkanie Z Matka, Piano in an Empty Room and Keep Asking.  I am not fond of the remixes-to-a-beat of some of the other songs, but some Vangelis fans might find them to their liking.<br /><br />Overall it's a good buy but nothing incredible.  In the sound track world, a lot of wrongs have been righted, but this looks like one that will never completely be righted by one set of CDs. In the context of all the other blade runner material out there, it rounds off and finishes the collection, though not how many of us would like it to have been.  Owing to the ages of the film itself and the people involved, this will probably be the last item we will see related to the film, along with the excellent \\"Final Cut\\" version of the film.
0316154687|1.0|As a huge Sedaris fan, I was excited to pick this book up when it came out in hardcover, about a year ago.  While I generally 'inhale' Sedaris, trying to read one story a day so I don't go through it too quickly, this one I found to be a major chore to read.  I kept putting it away for weeks at a time, and then struggled to get through a story.<br /><br />If you've never read Sedaris, I highly recommend 'Naked' and 'Me Talk Pretty One Day.'  Those are masterpieces.  So funny.<br /><br />This one is just not funny.  Maybe there were two or three mildly funny stories.  The rest were just boring.  I guess that his two great works were based on 30 years of funny things happening to him while this one was based on one year.<br /><br />I almost decided to just not finish it, but I saw there was a long essay about his quitting smoking at the end.  I figured this would be great, but it turned out to be mostly about his time trying to quit in Tokyo.  This enabled him to write a less funny version of 'Me Talk Pretty One Day' where he struggles through language classes.  There's a lot about the culture there, but it's just mildly amusing.<br /><br />I still love Sedaris.  I just wish I had spent my time rereading 'Naked' or 'Me Talk Pretty One Day.'

0517548232|5.0|In the tradition of Bastiat's - The Law, Haizlitt slays his philosophical opponents with clear, biting truth; and, packs it all into 100-odd pages.  Especially appropriate given the time period in which it was penned, Haizlitt effectively puts to rest Keynesian notions of mathematical precision and makes the best case for economic freedom produced in the 20th century.  Highly readable...a \\"Human Action\\" for the masses.
B000LC55F2|2.0|Adapting the novel which \\"The Prestige\\" was based on was no easy feat. The film's scenarists, brothers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan wisely jettisoned the subplot from the novel set in the present time which chronicled the machinations of the descendants of the two principal characters. The Nolans also should be congratulated for turning the novel (which features separate diaries of the principal characters written in the first person) into a more coherent third person narrative. Some of the first person diary narration is retained in a series of voice overs but it's not overdone thus preserving the flavor of the novel.<br /><br />'The Prestige' concerns the running battle between the two well known stage magicians in turn of the century Victorian England, Borden and Angier. In the novel, Borden, a total stranger, initiates the conflict by attempting to expose his rival as a charlatan while Angier moonlights as a medium. In the film, Borden and Angier already know each other while working as apprentice magicians. The Nolans seek to create a stronger motivation for the conflict between the two. They introduce Angier as already being married. Borden is warned by Cutter (the engineer/impresario played by Michael Caine) not to use a certain knot because it's too dangerous when tying Angier's wife's hands during a magic trick. Borden ignores Cutter's advice and as a result of his pig-headedness, Angier's wife drowns when she is unable to untie the knot after being placed underwater in a glass booth. Visually it's a stunning scene but not all that convincing. Borden is depicted as being almost monstrous in the way he crassly ignores all safety procedures; what's more, others take no concrete action during the performance to prevent the mishap from occurring.<br /><br />Borden's pettiness is matched by Angier later on when he seeks to sabotage a series of Borden's stage acts. As the story develops, Angier shows up in a disguise at Borden's performances on more than one occasion. At one point he rigs a pistol causing it to misfire, which seriously injures Borden's hand. Soon afterward, Borden introduces a new stage act, \\"The Transported Man\\", where he steps into one door and then amazingly steps out of another door on the other side of the stage almost instantaneously. We later learn that Borden's assistant is actually his twin brother and the two have been working together to fool the public into believing that 'The Transported Man' is not an illusion.<br /><br />Angier ends up hiring a look-a-like so he can duplicate Borden's act. For a time it works, but his double is a drunkard who ends up blackmailing him for more money. Angier wants to know the secret to Borden's act, so he enlists his assistant, Olivia, to steal Borden's diary. When he gets his hands on the diary, he realizes he is unable to decode it, so with the help of Cutter, he kidnaps Borden's assistant and holds him for ransom. In exchange for his assistant (who is actually his twin brother), Borden gives him the 'key word' to decode the diary: \\"Tesla\\".<br /><br />Tesla of course is a real character in history who was Edison's rival in the early development of electricity. Borden had met Tesla earlier and employs electrical sparks from Tesla's 'alternating current' generator in his act. Angier goes to Colorado to meet Tesla and offers to buy his generator which he believes can transport matter. As it turns out (and this undermines the film's entire plot), the machine doesn't transport people but actually clones them. Angier goes back to London and every time he uses Tesla's device, a new Angier appears. After each act, ludicrously, Angier is forced to murder each newly created double (and stores the corpses in tanks underneath the stage).<br /><br />The Prestige has a subplot involving Borden's wife. Sarah, who is unaware of the existence of his twin brother. She learns of Olivia but doesn't understand that its Borden's twin brother who is having the affair with her. Ultimately she commits suicide.<br /><br />The film's scenarists introduce a new twist in the story's climax different than the novel: Borden ends up murdering Angier by placing an open water-filled glass booth under a trapdoor during one of Angier's performances. Borden is arrested and found guilty at trial of the murder. After Borden is executed, Borden #2 shows up and murders Angier #2. We learn that the man executed was actually Borden's twin brother and the Angier who ended up drowning was actually one of Angier's clones. Borden returns to his daughter and in classic Citizen Kane 'Rosebud' style, Angier's nefarious plan is revealed to the audience. As Tesla's machine along with Angier's 'glass tanks' go up in flames beneath the stage, we can see inside one of them: it's one of the 100 Angier clones, still preserved and evidence of the failed career of a monomaniac.<br /><br />'The Prestige' must get high marks for art design. The costumes and sets make you feel like you're right there in turn of the century Victorian England. Generally the actors acquit themselves well especially Michael Caine as Cutter (a very minor part in the novel). Christian Bale is convincing as Borden but Hugh Jackman's Angier is ordinary. Surprisingly, David Bowie does quite well as the enigmatic Tesla. The women are not developed at all in the novel and unfortunately nothing much is done with them here in the film.<br /><br />The principal characters' obsession in attempting to undermine one another takes on a one-note quality thus exposing the characters as one-dimensional. In addition, once the plot veers off into science fiction/fantasy where people are cloned in a blink of an eye, the best one can say about the film is that it would be more fitting as a third-rate Twilight Zone episode. Nonetheless, 'The Prestige' still manages to hold one's interest as it is 'different' and wins points for mood and atmosphere, providing a glimpse into the rarely looked at world of magic during the Victorian era.m's scenarists introduce a new twist in the story's climax different than the novel: Borden ends up murdering Angier by placing an open water-filled glass booth under a trapdoor during one of Angier's performances.

1600240526|4.0|STONE COLD takes up again the characters introduced in THE CAMEL CLUB and continued in THE COLLECTORS.  \\"Oliver Stone\\" is the pseudonym of John Carr, an ex-CIA \\"666\\" assassin, now war protestor.  He and his conspiracy theorist odd fellows--Reuben Rhodes, Caleb Shaw and Milton Farb--form The Camel Club,\\" which had previously helped to prevent a nuclear war by defeating a couple of rogue elements in U.S. intelligence, including the head of intelligence himself, Carter Gray, and then later wrapped up (\\"skewered\\" might be more accurate) a spy who had been colluding with terrorists.<br /><br />This novel follows two plot lines that are only loosely intertwined:<br /><br />(1) a con played against a Jersey casino gambler by Annabelle Conroy (first introduced in THE COLLECTORS) and her washed-up father, Paddy Conroy, and<br /><br />(2) John Carr's teaming with Harry Finn, the assassin son of a Russian spy, to defeat the murderous scheme of his former boss and now nemesis, Carter Gray.<br /><br />The tight, fast-moving plot of STONE COLD fulfills the expectations of a Baldacci reader, although the climactic gun battle is wrapped up a bit too hastily, as if the author got a little bored with the scene and wanted to move on.  What follows the gun battle then feels a little melodramatic; it almost (but not quite) works because Baldacci has given the characters a degree of depth.  One can feel some empathy for characters like Harry Finn, whose killings, done at the behest of his mother, are to avenge the death of his father, and yet undermine the integrity of his other life as a loving father and husband.  As a result of the more rounded characterization, STONE COLD is a more satisfying read than the series debut.  On the other hand, John Carr, a.k.a. Oliver Stone, still seems removed from the reader, so when he has an emotional breakdown, it's less moving than weird--especially since the catalyst was so totally gratuitous a plot device.<br /><br />Baldacci introduces religion in the lives of his characters (for instance, Carter Grey, we learn, is Presbyterian), but it's unclear why since religion never really seems to inform the conduct of his characters.  Maybe that's the author's point.  I think it would be more effective, though, if the religious and moral lives of these characters actually meant something, even if it was struggling with their faith convictions in the face of a cold realpolitik.<br /><br />The reader on the audio CD version, Ron McLarty, is the best reader I've yet had the pleasure to listen to.  He differentiates the characters through the skilled use of different voices, and does so without going over the top (notwithstanding Paddy's Irish brogue).

1416955070|3.0|This book-or series of books-has been compared to both Harry Potter (perhaps because the author is known for having written fanfic loosely based on the series, as I see little resemblance between the two) and Twilight (to which I do see a fair amount of resemblance).    Thanks to Visual Bookshelf, I was lucky enough to be able to read this first volume in the series for free. I enjoyed the book enough to keep reading until I had finished the near-500 page volume in one day...though this dedication was partly due to the uncertainty of whether or not I'd be able to access the preview again in the future.    I was also sufficiently interested in the book to be interested in reading the remaining two installments in the series, however, I will be borrowing the books from the library. Based on what I've seen, the books are decent reads, but hardly ones I would recommend shelling out $8-12 (on a conservative estimate) a volume to read.    The good parts of \\"City of Bones,\\" the parts that kept me reading, include:    Some snappy and culturally literate dialogue. I happen to enjoy lines with a high level of quotability.    The tortured Edward Cullen/Heathcliff-esque character of Jace...okay, so I do see one line of resemblance w/ Harry Potter, as he is very similar to Draco Malfoy, and may perhaps even mature to resemble Snape at his best. As a Snape-lover, I find this an intriguing character-development course.    The main character, Clary, does have a somewhat different way of viewing the world with the eye and interpretative perception of a visual artist.    The idea of a city teeming with underground supernatural elements is hardly limited to Ms. Clare, but it is still a perfectly good and enjoyable alternate universe.    One part of the book involving a questionable drink and a transformation is extremely active and entertaining...if rather reminiscent of Alice in Wonderland...or, oh, hmm...Harry Potter. I guess I was hasty in claiming there was no resemblance.    Clary's best friend, Simon, is the most realistic character in the book, and he is awesome.    The bad parts of the book, the parts that made me wonder why I wasted a day wading through 500-pages of it, include:     The fictional world may have plenty of interesting details that have been carefully thought out by Ms. Clare, but things often seemed to me to drop out of nowhere and into the text with minimal background or explanation. For example, I still don't know what the apparently most important tool in the book, the Stele actually does as it appears to do absolutely everything...but only when convenient. I certainly don't have the slightest conception of how it works.    The same can be said of the action of the book. Things often seem to happen without having much lead-up in the text which not only makes it difficult to follow WHY things happen, but also the significance of the events that have occurred.    Many of the actions in the book seem stilted and/or a bit rushed, as if no one really knew what to do and all of the characters were dancing around one another trying not to step on each others' feet. Awkward.    The idea of Jace as an \\"agnostic\\" descendant of angels is cool, but I would have liked to have had a better feeling for the culture of the group to which he belongs. The demons and the mixed-blood offspring (like werewolves) have seem more well-rounded than the culture at the heart of the book.    Perhaps some of these problems will be addressed in the remaining installment of the books.    In closing, I will say this is a perfectly adequate and even enjoyable read for the sci-fi or fantasy fan but not particularly memorable. At least, not yet.
B001GCUO1Q|4.0|Now, beside the fact that everyone thinks they are a critic, how can you rip a movie that has never been a direct adaptation of the comic?  Generally the point of a movie at least in my opinion is to give people an imagination, especially those that dont have one for themselves.  You want to the point, read the comics, imagine it in your mind as a movie, isnt or wasnt that the point of comics in the first place?  Fantasy and what not.  I see a movie to see the story someone wanted to tell, and most of all, to entertain myself for 2 hours with the thought \\"I wish I could do that.\\"  For everyone who wants the direct adaptation from the comic, stop complaining and go make it, see how that one sells.  For everyone else, which anyone who knows anything about making money would know the more people you appeal to the more money you will make.  That being said I think the movie did a great job of appealing to the masses, with the only people ripping the movie being the comic nerds and the wannabe movie critics who all seem to be biased, and then I waste my time reading review after review of these people who somehow only rip a movie that they obviously saw one time, and write a long review of what the movie didnt have, and one line about what it did.  Yes some of the characters were underdeveloped, but what about everything else?  For the others, yes I noticed the representation of the alkali lake part was different, in X-men 2 you see striker as a old man saying \\"he'll have no memory\\" and for anyone who has any sense at all for what you can do ONCE A MOVIE IS ALREADY MADE! would understand that there will be differences.  Hence the fault of making a prequel.  You do the best you can.  You gotta go with the \\"oops we didnt realize we were going to make this, but now it makes sense, how can we make it fit the best we can?  What kind of movie would have him lose his memory after he comes back to life, because lets not forget he did technically die after they injected him, butthey also did a good job at making the point his body would reject all other metals except this one very rare one.  which is where the bullets come in.  back to the memory, enlighten me guys, where would you take the movie if he lost his memory right after that?  suddenly it isnt origins wolverine, its the origins of the entire x men, at least i think.  for making a movie about one of the characters they did a great job, and left it open to make another about the entire x-men and how they came to be.  Enough of they why didnt they crap and why not try something new, think about why they did and why they had to, and after you waste time with that, get a job, and enjoy a movie for what a movie is.... A MOVIE.  God i would pay money for a Foamy rant about all the reviews here that are up before the movie even comes out on dvd, that would be perfect for a video review
B0028K3192|5.0|What a musical talent, what a man, what a Maxwell! I can't say anything negative about  the Blacksummers'night CD.  He made us wait over seven years and with that itch came, Pretty Wings, Bad Habit, and Fistful of Tears. And he promises more since this CD is the first in a trilogy. I can't wait.
B0026RHR6K|1.0|Everyone looking at this set obviously knows this series is awesome.      BUT, this set is HORRIBLE.  Packaging is HUGE.  It looks cool though so I open it up.  Turns out 75% of the space is wasted.  But that's not the worst part.  As soon as I opened it up I figured I'd toss the big box and keep the four smaller DVD boxes included.  Then I opened them - HORRIBLE.  DVD's are in heavy cardboard sleeves virtually guaranteeing scratches every time you take a DVD out or put it back in.  Oh and there is no list of what extras are included in each set.  I can't believe any studio would release such a horrible design.  Do not buy this set.
B000N3ST3Y|2.0|When I first bought this  I thought it was going to be great! It wasn't until I listened to the whole thing through I noticed this. RADIO EDITS!!! A lot of the songs on here where chopped in half! this is why im never going to buy a  greatest hits album ever again! Because of the radio edits!  I wouldn't recommend buying this album this album unless you are just becoming familiar with their work.
B000UAFDP2|4.0|It's just what I was looking for, since I lost my non blu-ray Starship Troopers. I was really surprised by the great picture quality, since some older movies I've seen on blu-ray don't seem to be that much better than the standard DVDs. The movie is released by Sony.    I thought it was defective at first too, it loaded and all I saw was a black screen. I had to look on the internet to figure out how to play it. That was lame. But on my blu-ray player Sony BDP-S350, I had to put a USB drive in the back of it, which is how you extend the memory on that model. Don't know how much it needs, but I put a 2 GB drive in and that worked for me.    If you like the movie, I'd recommend getting the blu-ray. You surely won't be dissapointed with the quality.
B00009Z576|4.0|Okay, Drama may not have the talents of Jon Anderson leading the band, but it is still a really good album overall.  With Anderson, I would give it the fifth star.  However, the rest of the band sounds great, and honestly, Trevor Horn does a fine job filling in.<br /><br />Many Yes purists dislike this album, but I believe that the music itself is vastly superior to that of the preceding four albums, it was at the time the best album put out by the group since Close to the Edge.  It was kind of a bridge between the old prog-rock Yes of the 70's and the new radio-oriented rock of the 80's that was coming (and by the way, I love BOTH styles of Yes).  You really had elements of both eras represented in this album.  Machine Messiah was an epic song more in the old style, but with elements of 80's synth sprinkled in.  Into the Lens brings more of that 80's sound to it, and Tempus Fugit is altogether a fun, fast-tempo, rock classic where Chris Squire really shines on his bass.<br /><br />Still hung up on the fact that Jon was not part of this album?  Don't worry, Trevor Horn really does well here and brings a style similar to Jon's yet uniquely his own, all at the same time fitting in well with the band's overall style.  Squire, Howe, and White all sound as good as ever, and new member Geoff Downes brings some of his own creativeness to the keyboards.<br /><br />Overall, a solid album without any duds in the original 6 songs.  The extra tracks included in this extended version are pretty good as well.
0316776963|5.0|I randomly picked up this book, and I'm glad I did. I had no knowledge of David Sedaris' writing personally. By the middle of the book, I was laughing out loud for the first time ever while reading a book.
B001RTP3Z0|4.0|What a show! I saw this live during Leonard's tour of the U.S., and out of all the concerts I've been to (there have been many) this was the BEST I've ever seen. Leonard and the band were on top form, the best I've ever seen him perform. His voice has retained his richness, and the sardonic inflection and emotion are as profound and as present as ever. He performs various popular songs that span his entire career, and the run-time is quite long (over two hours). To give such a performance, and at his age - the passion, the philosophy and, most of all, the humility that he emits is staggering. Like I say, he is on top form, and to see him live was a magic spectacle I shall never forget, but, sadly, the DVD of this tour, as Live from London, fails miserably at capturing that magic. The filming and editing techniques used are totally unimaginative and, frankly, very boring. It's a travesty. Furthermore, the DVD contains minimal extras, not even subtitles, let alone interviews and behind the stage footage that I was hoping for. The DVD was done quickly with no extra effort put in for the Leonard Cohen fan to enjoy. I found the half-ass production quality of the DVD quite disappointing... but am I saying that the whole product is bad? No! My God, no. Whether you're a longtime fan, or a newbie just discovering Leonard's music, or just a person with an appreciation of great music, you will benefit greatly from seeing this recording of a true poet giving his all, his best, in delivering his musical message to his ever-growing multitude of fans. So, my consensus of the DVD is the same as that of most of the other reviewers, \\"that while the technical aspects are disappointing; Leonard, the band and the backup singers are superb.\\" So, all in all, this makes for wise, but tragically underdeveloped purchase.
0143038419|4.0|It seems that this book really struck a chord with people. Judging by all the negative reviews, a dissonant one. Yes, this book seems contrived and somewhat of an exercise in self-absorption, but the writing is pretty decent and it did hold my interest. It's obvious the author is doing something right because I read that they're making this into a feature film.
0670020745|4.0|I found the book fascinating in the way Dr. Taylor describes her stroke. The connection of her physical symptoms to specific brain areas was a major highlight for me, and can hopefully remind people that stroke victims are rarely complete \\"vegetables\\" - depending on the site and type of stroke and the length of delay before treatment, the visible effects can vary greatly. Likewise, her powerful description of the recovery process - and the refusal to accept that recovery happens over a very limited amount of time - is both encouraging and awe inspiring.
B001P9KR8U|4.0|This is masterfully filmed and acted but I had a bit of difficulty following the story in the beginning. Overall, I have to grudgingly admit that it probably does deserve all the accolades it received, but overall it just didn't do it for me. I have to say that the slims of India make East LA look like Beverly Hills! This film may have put India in the map in the American film world, but I don't think I'm quite ready to take a vacation there.
0198326769|5.0|Mr. Boyne did a fabulous job with the story line. You really get to see the world at that time through a naive child's eyes. The beliefs that were held at that time show through this book. The black and white way of life is again shown very well. I'm not sure how the writer was able to write this book but it was well done.<br /><br />I'm not really sure what more to say since I don't want to give away the plot. After finishing it up, I couldn't pick up another book. It's an emotional roller coaster and I am so glad I finally read it. It's definitely a favorite of the year so far since it expounded on so much that I knew. To see the inter workings of the Nazi from a child's perspective was something that I haven't come across before. Bruno is a little boy who will stay with me for a long time.

B00288KNJU|5.0|People keep declaring stop-motion dead, but every couple of years, a movie is made of the very format that used to comprise all mainstream visual effects films. \\"Coraline\\" is 2009's entry in this not very long list of feature-length films.    \\"Coraline\\" is basically a darker \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" with much worse things waiting on the other side of the \\"Rabbit Hole\\"(here, a tunnel behind some wallpaper). Director Henry Selick, who's only previous directorial works comprise of \\"the Nightmare Before Christmas\\" and \\"James and the Giant Peach\\", adapts the book written by Neil Gaiman extremely well, keeping the creepiness intact. If you have kids, at least let them see the movie around the age of 6(the age Gaiman's daughter was when he first read her his book). No one takes such a predictable moral and ending, and makes it worthwhile like Gaiman. In fact, parents are known to be more likely to be scared by this movie than kids. Depending on how old you are(and your outlook on life), you'll either see this as a wonderful, empowering story, or a truly terrifying one. The thing that makes parts of thisith movie (conceptually) disturbing is it's story, which makes it scarier than most horror films of recent years.     The blu-ray's visuals are top-notch, with sharpness, vibrant colors, and very good black/white ratio. The DTS-HD audio track is excellent, with everything heard clearly, and nice use of surrounds for atmosphere. With 3 pip tracks, BD-Live connectivity, all the bonuses on the standard dvd, and a DVD of the film(forget the digital copy. It's useless with the DVD), this film is highly recommended.

B0028K3192|2.0|I'm a big fan of Maxwell. But I am more a fan of music so I have to call it like I see it. After such a long wait. This was not worth it. It has nothing to do with the number of songs on the CD. But it's all about the songs on the CD. He could have done a Re-Mix CD that would have come off better than this. Or a Greatest Hit that would have done just fine. But this new stuff is lame. It's kind of like a Sade CD without Sweetback. Sounds like Maxwell, but something is missing.

I find the art work to be too dark for my tastes and the front and back of the cards are too similiar in color to easily distinguish between front and back.  Maybe I'm picky.  The book that comes with the cards is nicely written with good illustrations of the cards.  Overall it is simply a matter of taste.  The cards are of a good quality and the text is fine.  You may just love these cards.  Consult another deck about buying this deck and I'm sure you'll be fine.
031606792X|1.0|This was the book that my friends and I had been talking and obsessing about since the release of Eclipse.  Everyday we would look up the sneak peek quotes that she would put up on her website, not to mention we all tried to prophesize the plot of Breaking Dawn.  Nothing could have prepared us for what happened.  I was there at the midnight release bubbling over with excitement that I hadn't really experienced since the release of Deathly Hallows...although I was more exicted for that (I dressed up).    Twilight was the light at the end of the tunnel for me when Harry Potter ended.  I thought to myself \\"At least Twilight is still going strong.\\"  Needless to say, that light has gone out. I was anticipating this perfect ending to the series: a kind of Deathly Hallows like ending in the sense that the series would go out with a bang because that was what that book did.  In contrast, Breaking Dawn kind of sizzled out. I read this book in a total of 10 hours-taking me almost twice as long as Deathly Hallows (which is longer).  I have a lot of comments having to do with this book:    1. All of the characters seemed to have been completely out of cannon.  Take bella for instance: I was under the impression that she didn't care that much about starting a family.  She was willing to give all of that up in the first place in order to become a vampire.  Instead, she takes on a Rosalie-like persona and suddenly becomes obsessed with this child.  I get that she was pregnant, but still, she never gave off the impression that she was remotely interested in children.  It was always Rosalie who was bitter/sad about not having children.  She also becomes this perfect being.  I have to say that Bella wasn't my favorite character to begin with.  She really got on my nerves with her winey attitude and her ability to trip and fall over everything.  She was just plain annoying.  Plus she was obsessed with having a guy. As soon as Edward leaves, she begins to string Jacob along.  I felt that she was that kind of girl who needed a man to define her existance.  GET A BACKBONE, BELLA! GOD!  Edward was acting pretty strange as well: He even goes to Jacob for help to make her see reason.  Don't even get me started on the rest of Edward's family.  I just have one thing to say about them: um...where exactly were they?  They were completely non existant.  And the fact that Alice left with Jasper?  I was so confused.    2. Reneesme: Stupid child.  I do not have much to say except that She is weird and the fact that Jake imprinted on her was kind of annoying.  Also, the name bothers me.  Bella should never name someone ever again.  On a side note: Why were the people so reluctant to giving Bella the child after she woke up from her transformation?  I highly doubted that she would kill her kid.  If I was Bella in that situation, I would have fought all of those people to the ground.  It's not their kid, its hers, and damnit: she went through the hardest pregnancy ever, almost died, and then got transformed into a vampire-missing three days of Reneesme's life.     3. The standoff...or epic fail of a battle was stupid.  No one died...okay one person died who wasn't even a major character.  Where is the sacrifice?  What was the point of the whole Volturi showing up if they aren't going to kill a few people.  Seriously: I was prepared for this epic vampire fight scene.  Meyer was leading up to it for like half of the book, and there was nothing to show for it.  There was just this stupid standoff where everyone just talked about their problems and talked about this misunderstanding.  JK Rowling wasn't afraid to let a few people die.  WHy couldn't have Meyer done the same thing?    4. The book dragged.  All of the intersting stuff happened at the beginning.  She got married and had sex...in like the first 4 chapters of the book.  Then she got pregnant.  So for the rest of the book, you have pregnant bella (who isn't any better than regular bella) who sits around allday in the Cullen's house telling us constantly how much she wants this baby-even if it kills her.  She goes on and on about it for legit half of the book.  I thought that bella couldn't get more annoying, but I was wrong...she did.    5. Um..was this book written by the same person?  Stephenie, where did you go?  enough said.    I was so excited for this book to come out.  I was anticipating another Twilight-full of the teenage angst/Lust/love that we had come to know that Meyer would provide.  That was why millions of readers fell in love with these books.  We all developed a huge crush on Edward-even my mom.  We all wanted to find our edward some day in our lives.  Breaking Dawn ruined the whole series for me.  It was an anti-climatic conclusion to a series with so much potential.  I haven't been able to read any of the series anymore, and there seems to be some sort of radar screaming DANGER DON'T COME NEAR radiating from Breaking Dawn because I haven't been able to go near it-much less read it.    I understand, Mrs. Meyer, that you are the author, and that you are happy in the way this series ended.  I understand that you wrote it for you, and it was the way YOU wanted to end the series.  My regret is that this ending wasn't for me and for countless other readers who were so drawn in by Forks and its inhabitants. Being the selfish person that I am, I wish that this series had ended with me and I- that way I could have true closure and not have been left with a bad taste in my mouth.

B000P6BFGM|1.0|Amazon will deceive you with this Video on Demand version of \\"Charlie's Angels Full Throttle.\\" I bought the video and downloaded it along with many other films (including the original C.A.). There is something wrong with the license of this video. I have tried to download and view this video on three machines and the license cannot be accessed. Every other film I bought works fine. I followed Amazon's technical support  suggestions on getting the problem fixed, but it's not my systems it's the license and Amazon refuses to acknowledge it. Also, there is no refund on any of these products.    Buy the DVD but DO NOT buy this on video on demand. Lucy Liu is the best but Amazon stole my money on this one.

0385341008|5.0|Juliet is a thirty-something writer in post-WWII England, contemplating a subject for her next book. She receives a letter from a Dawsey Adams in Guernsey, one of the Channel islands, who owns a book that was formerly hers. Thus begins the correspondence between Juliet and the members of the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society. The club was formed as a ruse for being out after curfew during the German occupation of the island. (Potato peel pie--mashed potatoes sweetened with beets in a potato peel crust--was invented when there was little to eat there.) The book consists entirely of letters written by the various characters to one another, which make it easy to read in small bites, but you won't want to. The war stories from Guernsey are alternately tragic and hilarious. Coupled with Juliet's other correspondence--with her gay publisher, with her handsome but smarmy suitor, and with her friends--these letters make for a lively tale. The Guernsey residents, with a few villainous exceptions, are caring and nurturing but not without a sense of humor and a zest for life. They have weathered the worst for five years and come out with their sanity intact. Juliet eventually visits the island and then finds it increasingly difficult to leave as she finds herself drawn to both a motherless child and a man. This is the type of book that you savor, and I want to reread it already.
B000WQWPKA|5.0|I remember the hype before this movie came out .. the infamous Superbowl ad where everyone was left wondering, \\"What in the world was that?!\\" ... Granted no movie can ever match that kind of generated hype - but it came awfully close.  This was one of the first big \\"disaster\\" type movies, with the famous scene of the white house being destroyed.      The blu-ray quality is superb, and the sound is great, along with the extra features.  A definite must have for both a fan of the movie, or anyone that hasn't seen it.   This movie HAS to be experienced on Blu-Ray in a home theater environment.
1416562605|3.0|It read well little more than half, potraying corruption, poverty and servitude. It ends in hurry and cinematic fashion.
044024367X|1.0|It is very appropriate that in this, the 12th Jack Reacher novel, our hero travels between two fictional Colorado towns, Hope and Despair, since that is the journey that Lee Child takes his readers on. We start out hopeful as Reacher finds himself travelling from the town of Hope to the town of Despair, simply wanting to stop at a restaurant for a cup of coffee on his way. It becomes apparent very quickly that the residents of Despair don't want him there as he is ignored in the restaurant and four local tough guys arrive to evict him from the premises. Of course Reacher helps them to understand the error of their ways and, after dispatching them, finds himself arrested, convicted of vagrancy and, the next morning, escorted out of Despair and back into the neighboring town of Hope. Of course we know that Reacher doesn't discourage that easily and will soon be returning to Despair. Oh, man, this is going to be good!    Except it's not. What we get, in fact, is the beginning of four convoluted plots intertwining with each other, and not in a good way. Worse still, about halfway into the book it turns into a polemic for the author's left wing political views. He accomplishes this by having Jack Reacher, an Army MP veteran, saying that AWOL deserters in Iraq have more courage that the soldiers fighting there and that the Army regards wounded soldiers as garbage. Amazing. It is as if Lee Child got bored writing this book and turned it over to Maureen Dowd of the New York Times or some crazed blogger from the Huffington Post.    Worse still is Lee Child's continuing defamation of evangelical Christians. In past novels it has been a passing comment such as Reacher's refusal to fly Alaska Airlines since they print Bible verses on meal trays. However in this book it is a full frontal assault on fundamentalist Christians. They are portrayed as crazed people plotting mass destruction to provoke Armageddon and the end times. In addition, Lee Child has complete falsehoods aboutthe source of Bible translations coming out of the mouth of an Anglican pastor. This is maddeningly ignorant and narrow minded stereotying masquerading as entertainment.    But, you may say, if I'm not a Christian or a supporter of the war in Iraq, isn't it possible for me to enjoy this adventure novel? Not very likely. Not only are the plot lines muddled but they are not completely resolved in any meaningful way that would explain the bizarre behavior of the citizens of Despair or bring any of the storylines together.     My disappointment with this book is precisely because of how much I have enjoyed previous Reacher novels. They represent some of the best action/mystery writing around. For that reason, I will purchase, without waiting for the reviews, the next Jack Reacher novel. However, if Lee Child continues to use his novels as a platform for his political views, I will say goodbye to Jack Reacher forever.

B000002KLP|5.0|I've always admired prince. Maybe it was The music, The image or all of the above But Prince has always been a huge source of fascination for me. Here's a man who had the balls to put on high-heels and at the same time sing about receiving Oral Sex from females. He was Controversy when nobody wanted it, Cool when most people weren't & Dirrty before it had two R's (Thanks Christina A!) From a musical standpoint though most people would be surprised to know what Prince is capable of. If you look on the back of almost any of his albums (Including this Classic) you'll find that they are Produced, Arranged, Composed & Performed by none other than the \\"Maestro\\" himself Prince, That's right basically everything is done by one man! Who in this day and age would take on that responsibility...That's right...No one!<br /><br />Because of this I continually find myself asking what the hell does he need with these Bands (NPG,Revoulution..Etc)<br />surrounding him, I mean he can play all their instruments (probably) better then they can. So what's their purpose...Mental Support?<br /><br />\\"Dirty Mind\\" I must say is one of his top 5 albums (The others being [[ASIN:B000002KMV Controversy]], [[ASIN:B000002N1E The Gold Experience]], [[ASIN:B000002L68 Music from the Motion Picture \\"Purple Rain\\"]] & [[ASIN:B000002KY8 1999]]) and on a good day (When I'm a good mood) boils down to being his best Album (That's right beating out the Some-what overrated \\"[[ASIN:B000002L68 Music from the Motion Picture \\"Purple Rain\\"]]\\" Soundtrack) The only other album that could possibly contend with this one is it's follow-up, The often overlooked Classic \\"[[ASIN:B000002KMV Controversy]]\\". That album is a gem also but this one is just as good. It combines the Sexualness of tracks like \\"Head\\" & his future cut \\"Jack U off\\" with pretty ballads (Minimal in number)such as \\"Gotta broken heart again\\" & \\"When you were Mine\\". This makes for a great combination of Sexual, Political & Sorrowful: all of which would soon encompass his future work.<br /><br />The thing that sets this album apart from it's predecessors & Successors is it's unique blend of Something old and twisting and turning it until it's something Brand New & Exciting. His earlier releases never sounded as fresh and crisp as this. Prince's later work, While they did improve and achieve better production. They also lost that organic sound that made Prince's work stay feet on the ground (Instead of drifting off into space) Prince's organic & minimal Stripped down production style was fading and by \\"1999\\" it would be gone(Beginning a whole new chapter in Prince's recording career)Not that that was a Totally bad thing especially considering that Prince's music style needed a change & he wouldn't have become the huge icon he is today...Still it's a matter of public opinion.<br /><br />1. Dirty Mind- Classic, Classic, Classic!!! this song is the quintessential Classic Prince song. Prince gets behind some synths and talks about his affection with a particular girl and how he gets a Dirty Mind every time he sees her. \\"It's U I really wanna drive/Underneath the stars\\" it's so Dirrty & Filthy...Who could pass this up? 5/5<br /><br />2. When you were mine- I'm currently in a phase where I mostly listen to Ballads (That are good of course) and this one is one of my all time favorites! Minimal production with just Prince and a pipe organ. The vocals are executed very elegantly and tenderly, But the lyrics are genius \\"I love you more/Than I did when You were mine\\" it's a sad song to make you cry & one of the best this album offers. 5/5<br /><br />3. Do it all night- With the album being on smooth Cruise Control it was eventual we would face some turbulence and this is the first shot. \\"Do it all night\\" is a slightly forgettable song about Prince overcoming his shyness to tell a girl he wants to \\"Do it all night\\". Not particularly memorable, not particularly ear offensive either. this song is just alright. 4/5<br /><br />4. Gotta broken heart again- Prince slows down the tempo once again here and delivers a tender ballad of lost love.<br />\\"Gotta broken heart again/cause my only supposed to be friend/stole my old lady away from me/now I'm just as blue as I can be\\". The song is beautiful and offers a glimpse into his sensitive side, But with the benchmark already set so high with \\"When you were Mine\\" this was doomed to be forgettable from the start. 4/5<br /><br />5. Uptown- Uh-Oh! the tempos moving up more and more as the album plays out. This Song is extremely vivid and well written and thus makes my imagination go wild! with lines like \\"She saw me walking down the street/of your fine city/it kinda turned me on when she looked at me & said come here\\" you know just what's happening. The song talks about this imaginary place named Uptown where everyone does what they please in perfect harmony without society \\"Telling em' how it's suppose to be\\". Great concept, Great song! 5/5<br /><br />The next two songs are really where (Imo) the \\"Dirty Mind\\" starts going into an overhaul:<br /><br />6. Head- This song is about just what the title implies & nothing more. Prince gets heavily explicit and talks of a bride to be giving him oral sex only winding up with her ditching the guy she's supposed to marry only to elope with Prince instead. (Guess that must have been some good Head!!) The Song is Dirrty lyrically but seriously this song deserves a listen for \\"musical value\\". The licks are the boss, The sounds are funky and the Lyrics...Just Filthy! 5/5<br /><br />7. Sister- If the previous song was Dirrty this song is just plain tacky! Prince hits a new low and talks about bangin' his sister only to realize \\"Incest is everything it's said to be\\". To make matters worst Prince says he was \\"sixteen & only half a man\\" & and describes his sister (or in this case cuddy-buddy) as being \\"Thirty-two, lovely & loose\\". I don't know about you but this song (Imo) borders on a very thin line between being controversial & just plain sick! What's that? \\"Sisters\\" getting sick again!?!? 3/5<br /><br />8. Partyup- Political Prince makes a sole appearance on \\"Partyup\\". \\"Partyup\\" serves it's purpose of being 1999 pt.1 very well. Prince talks of partying like there's no tomorrow before the world comes to a close (Sound familiar?) it's a funky little number that just misses the 5 star mark. 4/5<br /><br />Basically Prince took some old and a slice of the new and turned out a very exciting piece of work that holds up well almost Thirty years later. Although his future, more successful works (Purple rain, 1999...Etc) would feature more complicated melodies, thought provoking lyrics, and more involvement overall you can tell Prince worked his butt off on this release. All in all Prince proved that: \\"Having a Dirty Mind might sound like fun after all!\\"<br /><br />*If you liked this album I also must insist on recommending the similar but very different \\"[[ASIN:B000002KKN Prince]]\\", \\"[[ASIN:B000002KIG For You]]\\" & finally \\"[[ASIN:B000002L68 Music from the Motion Picture \\"Purple Rain\\"]]\\"*n here and delivers a tender ballad of lost love.  \\"Gotta broken heart again/cause my only supposed to be friend/stole my old lady away from me/now I'm just as blue as I can be\\".

B001FB4W0W|5.0|I pre-ordered this DVD after watching the first season on HBO, and I could barely wait for them to release it! I would agree with other reviewers that the cast is the best part of the series - every actor is top-notch, and every one of them is perfect for the role they are in. Anna Paquin as Sookie is a delight, but really everyone is well worth watching, and I find myself excited to see even the minor characters in each episode. If I had to pick a favorite, I would say that Nelson Ellis as Lafayette is it.     For those of you who have read the Sookie Stackhouse novels, there are definite changes from the books to the series. I am a fan of the books, but I still like what the writers have done in adapting the novels, since it would be boring to just follow Sookie everywhere, and because many other more minor characters are fleshed out, such as Jason, Tara, Hoyt Fortenberry, Andy Bellefleur, Terry Bellefleur, Arlene, etc. What results is clearly based on the books but expanded and developed to make for a delightful, passionate, and action-packed season. Watching the series after having read the books can be difficult, since you know what 'should' happen, but I found that I wasn't ever disappointed by any changes.     I've enjoyed watching the extras, but the commentary is not something I like, since it goes over the dialogue of the episodes.     A note for those who might not be familiar with the content of the series - it has many mature themes, with sex and violence, but I found that it is quite tasteful and meant to convey the key ideas of the series. Just a warning - not for children!
0525457585|5.0|Having loved the movie version for years, and finally discovering that it was based on a book, I decided to purchase and read the source material.  All I can say is, WOW!  As is often the case with movies that come from books, the printed version is infinitely richer, fuller, and more complete.  As much as I love the first film, it only deals with half the book, while the second is a shabby take off of portions of the second half.  So if, like me, you're in love with the story that never ends, do yourself a favor and get this book.

B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|The first in the Jesse Stone series.  I have the series and find the story to be well written.  Tom Selleck does a superb job of bringing this character to the screen.  Selleck adds a strong dimension to Jesse and a real likableness.  The stories maintain your interest and all are well directed and in good locations.  The supporting cast adds to the story in supporting Jesse Stones character.  If you like Tom Selleck, police mystery (not action) you will enjoy these stories.
B000ICLRIE|5.0|I just want to add one comment to this earlier review:  This film, more than most, has convinced me that 'motion pictures' need a new, more meaningful kind of recognition approach than the Academy Awards, which was based on members of an industry rewarding themselves for their recent work.  That approach was geared to a world in which films circulated through theatres, were either seen or not, and then disappeared.  In other words, the motion picture was a disposable commodity.  Now, motion pictures last 'forever.'  We have the opportunity to assess them in terms of overall value over a longer period of time, and we can also assess the value of revised versions, as in the case of Kingdom of Heaven.  Films like Kingdom of Heaven, Out of Africa, and Elizabeth can be rated as current products, not finished products that will not be seen again.  I can guarantee that many recent Oscar winners (not bad as one-time experiences), like Slum Dog Millionaire, No Country for Old Men, and The Hurt Locker, will fall out of the top ratings, and others that were not recognized earlier on will be recognized as perennial favorites.  Also, films should be rated by those who watch them, and by film critics that we respect, but not by those who make them.    I already had the extended DVD version of this film, which is terrific (and good for extras), but the blu-ray version is definitely worth it.  The detail in this sumptuous film (great cinematography, color effect) is amazing.  In addition, the blu-ray version plays straight through without intermission, and no need to change discs.  As many others (consensus) have commented, the storyline in this film was broken up in the original theatrical version, and the extended version is the only one to watch.  The extended version brought out a complete and terrific story in a dramatic historical setting.  All of the actors were more than well-suited for their roles, either as the moral baron, his reluctant warrior son, the great and wise desert conquerer, or the complicated Sybil.  Gladiator was a great film, but this one has many more fascinating and deep characters, with more than one dimension.  Consider Edward Norton as the masked King of the Kingdom of Heaven (\\"Jerusalem\\").  Jeremy Irons and Liam Beeson- incredible performances.  When they finally add an Oscar for \\"fixed\\" films on blu-ray or DVD, this one has to be at the top of the Best Picture list.  You could never have seen the image quality of Blu-ray in a theatrical print, anyway.  As usual for a Ridley Scott film, the soundtrack is a work of art in itself, wholly environmental and involving.
1594488916|4.0|Allison Hoover Bartlett explores the interesting world of books, via lust, obsession, and tenacity.  Strange, but true; rare book collecting and bibliomania drive the plot of her narrative.  John Gilkey and Ken Sanders, thief and self-proclaimed \\"bibliodick\\" respectively,  engage in a war of ethnics over books.<br /><br />Ken Sanders is a rare book dealer with a store in Salt Lake City who becomes entwined with the ABAA (Antiquarian Booksellers Association of America) and eventually becomes its security chair.  In this role he would continually encounter the illegal acquiring of books by John Gilkey.  Sanders, a staunch liberal with a strict moral code of right and wrong, would catch Gilkey and suspect him of many robberies, but he would never gain satisfaction.  Gilkey with his skewed perception of fair and ethical would continually antagonize the rare book community while trying to acquire his ideal life.  The story is fascinating as it delves beyond bibliophile and into obsession, collecting, and the power of books.<br /><br />The plot easily unfolds with interesting characters through its easy language.  Hoover Bartlett is good writer with a clear objective.  Her language is illuminating and informative; giving the reader imagery to revel in and interesting thoughts to ponder.<br /><br />This book is for just about anyone interested in rare books, collecting, human interest stories, or books/writers in general.  An interesting, easy to read book that just about anyone will enjoy.  Recommended.
B000YIGNKE|3.0|Eight years ago Frederick Wentworth fell in love with Anne Elliot. They were engaged, but Anne let herself be persuaded into breaking it off because Frederick had no fortune. Now he's back and their situations are reversed. Anne's family is in debt, and Frederick has made in the Navy. She's still in love with him, but he no longer wants anything to do with her.<br /><br />\\"Persuasion\\" is my favorite Austen novel of the four I have read so I was very interested in seeing what this adaptation would hold. Overall, I was very pleased. I really liked watching Anne and Frederick struggle with their feelings for each other. Anne was in so much pain because of the knowledge that Frederick would never be hers. I sort of enjoyed watching this because even though it was a bit painful I've always thought that Anne should have felt very, very sad. She did, after all, basically abandon Frederick even though she knew he loved her so deeply.<br /><br />The minor characters really made the movie for me. Anne's entire family is so self-centered. I enjoyed watching Mary and all her \\"illnesses.\\" I have a few friends that act like that, always full of self pity. Watching Anne deal with her family really let her good nature shine through.<br /><br />Frederick is my favorite of the Austen men.  He's quite affable to everyone.  It was fun to see his personality come to life on-screen.  I enjoyed this adaptation of Persuasion very much. Anne and Frederick's story is one that I will always remember
0307588335|5.0|The book grabs your attention from the beginning (Larry's not-so-common career track to Wall Street), holds it all through the body(excellent explanations of the credit crisis that laymen can understand) and keeps you glued to the end (the ultimate failure of Lehman).  It is sprinkled with tongue-in-cheek British humor (thanks Patrick Robinson) and a refreshing, honest style from the author.  It's the perfect length for a summer read, not too user-heavy on the brain, and an absolute page-turner that I had a hard time putting down.  I like the fact that Larry interviewed 150 former Lehman employees for this story. I hope it quiets the \\"he wasn't really an insider\\" rebuttal that the Wall Street competition or business academians will throw at the book.  It's a super read - fun, interesting and silky smooth.  Bravo Larry!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0028RXXFC|5.0|While many aspects of HBO's `Rome' deserve praise, it is a story driven by 2 compelling characters: Lucious Vorenos and Titus Pullo.  If you have yet to set-off on this 2-Season journey, those names will mean nothing.  Those who have watched are likely nodding in agreement.<br /><br />Vorenus and Pullo are fictional characters whose names were taken from the logs of Julius Caesar.  Through what may be the finest example of `literary licence', this staff of writers plant these soldiers in the middle of Caesar's fall.  Arguably, the most fascinating period in the history of the planet.<br /><br />History novices fear not, the fictional journey of Vorenus and Pullo plays-out like a Tolken novel.  Viewers will be more concerned with the lives of these 2 friends than any of Rome's true-to-life nobility.<br /><br />While I could write pages of praise for this series, it is exceptional character development and riveting acting (Kevin McKidd, Ray Stevenson) which left me aching for more.  There are rumors of a future film.<br /><br />I can only imagine how fantastic the scenery and colors of Rome will appear on Blu-ray.<br /><br />(The title of this review will make sense later)

B0009XNUK0|5.0|This review can be summarized as this is a MUST BUY album for any Micheal Jackson fan. I loved every single track on both CD's. It was a very great price. I do recommend this CD very HIGHLY.
0307588335|5.0|What a great read.. Was up all night, couldn't put it down!<br /><br />I know over a dozen people at Lehman Brothers and the one thing, above all, I know about this book is Larry McDonald had Ultimate Inside Access.  He spoke to members of the executive committee and risk committee.  You will NEVER find better inside access because the fallen lawyered up Generals at Lehman will never write a book. Are you kidding me?  I heard from someone that knows McDonald was dialed in to the highest levels.  Every financial book at the book stores is written by either an academic or a journalist.  A Colossal Failure of Common Sense was written by someone who was there, on the inside!  That is what makes it such a great read.  I felt like I was there too!
B00243FQFA|5.0|This show provided everything I was looking for --- even down to the annoyance of Dr. McKay.  The ending was superb -- leaving just enough unexplained to perhaps continue the story in movies, which I would look forward to with relish.  Great expectations were met and exceeded --- well done!!!
B00004RF8J|5.0|this was a great deal on this dvd so I ended up buying 2 copies,one for myself and one for my brother. They arrived on time and looked just as if I'd gone to best buy and bought them.

B001QTXM5Y|4.0|Once you see the footage previously cut from the theatrical release, you'll never understand why any of it was cut. Hollywood's allergy to long movies is complete nonsense. Do not buy the theatrical release--it is missing too much good stuff.    However, the bonus disc is crap, plain and simple. The featurettes are, for the most part, too short and overlapping. The longer featurettes brow-beat the viewer with what an amazing, revolutionary comic book The Watchmen is, and never venture far beyond that singular idea. The film is better than the comic, but the film is never explored in any meaningful way.    If there were a way to buy the Director's cut sans the worthless bonus material, that would be the way to go.
1905654294|1.0|This book was terrible.  It made me wake up to how awful the entire series is.
B001FB55H6|5.0|There are lots of reviews here, so I just want to add my 5-star vote. This is an exceptionally well-done blu-ray. On my 50\\" panasonic plasma G10, the picture quality is phenonenal. One of the rare AAA video transfers.<br /><br />I love the movie too, for what it is. To be fair, anytime you have this kind of hardcore storytelling, it doesn't always play for casual audiences. This movie will not work for everybody. A lot of people can not ever be \\"converted.\\" That's just the nature of the hardcore experience. I want to thank Hollywood for giving Zack the money to make this film for the hardcore elite. That was honorable.
B001V9LRV0|1.0|I want to know if this \\"new\\" version has subtitles. Quiero saber si esta \\"nueva\\" versión tiene subtítulos?
B0027HOBM2|4.0|BLU-RAY vs HDTV vs DVD vs TV<br /><br />The picture quality on the blu-ray is the best version of the show. But it's not life-altering. It's very film-grainy. If that's the intent, that's fine, it looks cheap, maybe \\"artistic,\\" and its not distracting, but the texture is obvious in almost every shot. I watch on a 50\\" plasma, and it's nice, but the blu-ray isn't a huge leap over the dvd, not to me. And the third disc had two episodes where the disc froze. This is the first blu-ray that has ever froze on me. Maybe it's a fluke. But it happened.<br /><br />THE STORYTELLING<br /><br />I remember the first three episodes of season 1 of Mad Men. It was glorious. The main character, Don, was a genuine force. A fantastic protagonist. I loved him, unconditionally, untill the end of the season when the writers started giving him flashbacks. Trying to use shortcuts to explain him, to turn him from a larger-than-life force, into an average screwed-up guy. Now, I still like Don, and I still like the show, and maybe I stand alone here, but they did the flashback thing again at the end of season 2. I don't regret spending my free time watching this show, but it's starting to get that episodic-tv-bad-soap-opera-effect. The plot twists are starting to add up, bleeding the character out. Next year, when season 3 hits blu-ray, I'll netflix it, to give it another chance... But I find myself becoming a bit indifferent to this show. I still reccomend people try it, because it's good, and maybe I'm too picky. Lot's of people love this show, and can embrace the particular qualities that have turned me cool. This may sound like a \\"downer\\" review, but we're talking about a show with a downer tone and a downer plot, so it's kind of symmetric.
B002C62YNQ|5.0|I thank you to the merchant who had delivered this boat shoes from Timberland with good packaging, condition and in proper delivery time as stated previously in the delivery info to Jakarta, Indonesia.     When I look for the shoes I have to look at:  1. The model --> I like boat (3 or 2 eyes) and oxford model for daily office use.  2. The color --> I like dark color (black or dark chocolate/brown).  3. The size --> I wear 44 EU/10.5  with wide 3E (mostly for Asian/Indonesian will fit 2 or 3 E)  4. If there is a money in my pocket, I start looking the price, then --> Shipping cost is one of my biggest concern, because it will increase very much amount compared to the item's price itself.    Btw, I wish the merchant can maintain good work by sending the right stuff and competitive price!!  I wish Timberland still make the \\"boat shoes type\\" in their production line, cause this is one of customer's favorite and elegant/timeless model!    I wish, between me and amazon.com (and their all good merchants) can construct inter-trust building for the good online dealing, cause this is not face to face transaction.    Thank you,  Anggoro  Indonesia
0307454541|5.0|This first part of the celebrated Millenium trilogy is the best fiction I've read for a long time. I appreciate the way it starts at a comparatively slow pace, almost dispassionately so as it sets the background, introduces and fills out the characters, then gradually focussing in on the elements of the plot as the pace increases. In contrast with many recent novels the action scenes are understated, but the impact is not diminished - yes, there is some quite heavy stuff going down. The characters might be exaggerated in the book, but there really are people like that.<br /><br />This is a story that progressively pulls you in. It is multi-layered, the issues are serious, and the characters are so strongly drawn it becomes easy to identify with them, or against them. I couldn't have stopped reading on to save my life and I can hardly wait to start part 2.<br /><br />A last comment. Just after I bought the book, but before I started reading, I was in conversation with a group of people I happened to meet. One of them was Swedish lady, and she knew well the novel in its original language. What she said was, \\"Yes, that how Sweden has become.\\"
B00288KNL8|3.0|My husband and I rented the dual sided version of the film a couple days ago as well as bought two pairs of the dual color 3D glasses.    The film was absolutely beautiful designed and animated. It was also delightfully balanced between trippy and creepy. I'd definitely say that if parents have young children, they should preview the film prior to showing it and use their personal judgment. The narrative has the same threads of menace that haunts original Brother's Grimm tales. The film at times can be rather disturbing. My husband and I humorously traded off with the line, \\"That is messed up!\\" several times through out the film. My only critique with the film is that the resolution falls too swiftly and maybe too neatly into place.    The reason my review is three stars is that I fail to see the reason behind packaging the DVD with a 3D version of the film. Even on a HD plasma with unimpaired vision, the dual colored glasses just did not work for me at all. I knew going in that the home television would lose the incredible effect of what dual projection in a theater could create, so I didn't have high expectations. I was merely curious if the industry had gotten better at implementing it over time.     I went in to watching the 3D version expecting to at least get a sense of scene depth similar to an old school View-Master. Unfortunately, I didn't even get that. None of the 3D effects worked for me. Even with a darkened room, my eyes would water while they constantly fought to refocus and make sense of the dual colors. I had to stop watching after about twenty minutes in, because my eyes were just exhausted. The 3D versions also dulls the color scheme. This really doesn't do the original film justice at all. It was rather shocking to see the vivid color difference switching from 3D to the 2D version.    In Conclusion: Skip the 3D gimmick and enjoy the 2D version.
0679457313|3.0|In unusual writing style moving from the end of the story to the middle to the beginning to the end throughout the book, finally ending in the middle, Arundhati Roy's The God of Small Things tells a story of a well-off Indian family, most of it from the perspective of one or the other of twin children, one a boy and the other a girl. It's a dysfunctional family, of course, and just about everyone in it is more or less nuts.    Except I'm looking at it from the perspective of an American, not an Indian, so what may seem nuts to me may be a cultural difference. But Roy does seem to criticize Indian culture, herself, when she shows us how a culture with a history of touchables and untouchables affects lives and personalities.    The style as I speak of it sounds confusing and mixed up, but the book is not difficult to read at all. As a matter of fact, its back-and-forth movement leads to more suspense as Roy gives more and more hints about the middle and the end.    The God of Small Things received many great reviews. But I wouldn't rate it a five out of five because I have a big problem with it.    From the very beginning, Roy points out a difficulty with one of the characters and comes back to it again and again. Yet she never answers the question she presents to the reader. Most readers will be surprised when they get to the end of the book and may think they have a defective copy that ended in the middle because the character's life and readers' questions are unresolved.    The book also annoyed me because Roy used so much pointless capitalization. At first I thought it did have a point: from a child's perspective, some words are a lot bigger and more important; they're proper nouns. But she did this so much, so often, even when we were seeing the story from an adult's perspective, that all those caps lost their intended meaning, whatever it was.    This book is OK but not as good as most reviews I read.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|Unfortunately, I did not have the option to confess when her Confessions Tour made a stop in Chicago, but Madge didn't let me down when she released the Confessions Tour on both CD & DVD. The only let down I have is that the CD does not contain all of the songs that were performed on the DVD. Other than that, the tour itself is very refreshing! Here's the setlist for the Tour:  ACT 1: The Horse Ride (I dubbed the acts)  1. Future Lovers/I Feel Love - Madge mashes up Future Lovers with Donna Summer's I Feel Love. Very smart move indeed!!  2. Get Together - one of my favorite songs from the Confessions on A Dancefloor CD!   3. Like A Virgin - The LCD displays Madonna's broken bones from a horse riding accident on her birthday. Madonna sings while riding a mechanical S&M carousel.   4. Jump - the set is like a jungle gym! Madonna's dancers are reinacting the video (literally jumping everywhere hence the song title).  ACT 2: Confessions  5. Confessions - a video interlude with a couple of dancers confessing about how they overcame their struggles  6. Live To Tell - many people saw this performance as controversial (personally, I didn't see why). Madonna sings on a glass cross wearing a crown of thorns like Jesus. Above her a screen displays the number of deaths occured from AIDS in Africa.   7. Forbidden Love   8. Isaac  9. Sorry - Madge and her dancers reinact the fight/danceoff scene in the video. After the performance Madge gives the finger!   10. Like It Or Not  11. Sorry (Remix) - this act closes with a video interlude of a remixed version of Sorry. The video displays famine, acts of cruelty, and Madge giving the finger while two of her dancers are krumping!   ACT 3: Glam Rock  12. I Love New York - A cool retro performance while Madonna rocks on the guitar & sings \\"Just go to Texas & you can suck George Bush's ****!\\"   13. Ray Of Light - pretty neat performance with Madonna's dancers   14. Let It Will Be (Paper Dolls Mix) - By far one of my favorite performances.Two words: High Energy!!    15. Drowned World/Substitute for Love - before she sings, Madge gives the audience her \\"diva speech.\\" What's surprising is that she actually didn't know that they were filming the London show. Nice performance with her singer Isaac.  16. Paradise (Not For Me) - an acoustic performance with Madonna playing the acoustic guitar with Isaac. A video displays rain and cherry blossoms during the song.  ACT 4: Disco  17. The Duke Mixes the Hits - a brief video interlude of excerpts including the songs Borderline, Erotica, Dress You Up, Holiday, & Disco Inferno  18. Music Inferno - a mash-up of Disco Inferno & Music! Madonna's dancers are on rollerskates skating down the runway doing special tricks! Madonna and two of her dancers are dressed a la John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever!   19. Erotica (a.k.a. You Thrill Me) - Basically, it's an extremely toned down version of Erotica. Madge actually sings lines from her unreleased Erotica demo titled You Thrill Me. The song is nicely remixed while Madonna and her dancers perform amazing choreography.   20. La Isla Bonita - a high energy remixed version that still maintains the orginial elements of the song.   21. Lucky Star - a mash-up of Lucky Star to the music of Hung Up! Madonna and her backup singers strut their stuff on stage!   ACT 5: Encore  22. Hung Up - the finale of the show! Madonna ineracts with the audience and tells them to sing \\"Time goes by so slowly.\\" As the video curtain comes down, Madonna sings \\"I'm tired of waiting on you!\\" as the show ends with the LCD displaying \\"Have You Confessed?\\"  Now that I ranted on about the DVD setlist, here's the CD's:  1. Future Lovers/I Feel Love  2. Like A Virgin  3. Jump  4. Confessions (interlude)  5. Isaac  6. Sorry  7. Sorry (Remix)  8. I Love New York  9. Let It Will Be  10. Music Inferno  11. Erotica  12. Lucky Star  13. Hung Up  Overall opinion: One of Madge's best concerts to date! I wish the CD had the entire setlist on the DVD, but it's still a nice CD to workout to! I highly recommend buying this combo if you're a fan of Madge or a fan of concerts in general! It's time to confess!!
1416562605|4.0|This book gives me insight into modern Indian society.  The progression of the character from a boy in the \\"darkness\\" to the person he is now is believable.  However, I did not give this 5 stars because I did not get caught up in this book.  It lacks compelling elements...  I enjoyed it but I could easily put it down to do other things.  A good read.

0375842209|5.0|I read this book as a preview for my 10 year old daughter.  I wanted to make sure it was worth recommending to her.  I found it engrossing and had trouble putting it down.  It's so heart breaking and compelling.  I sympathized with so many of the characters.  There's goodness even in the darkest times. The characters are so real you want to hug them.  The harsh sounding foster-mother with the heart of gold.  I highly recommend this book.  Sad but hopeful...life can be harsh...but there are many wonderful people in the world.
B000A2RRF4|3.0|Microphone/Background not Good.  He still sings well but the audio taping of the concert was below par.  Still I was glad I saw it.  He truly is a fantastic performer.  If not for his showmanship and voice, I would have given a 1 for the DVD taping of the concert.

B000X5KSWM|3.0|POSSIBLE ERRORS    Song #1: Ite, Misa Est - only 27 seconds long (is it supposed to be?)  Song #4: Seeking for the Reign - only 59 seconds long (is it supposed to be?)  Song #6: Escape of the Doll - only 33 seconds long (is it supposed to be?)  Song #13: Sunset - only 36 seconds long (is it supposed to be?)    DEFINITE ERROR    Song #18: Calling Grace - errors on rip and won't play after the first three seconds. It skips there in the dvd/cd player until it switches to the next song, and windows media player doesn't even try to play it after the first three seconds, and quits the rip to say \\"error\\" where \\"pending\\" and \\"ripped\\" are located. I paid for all the songs on the cd, and thus I'd like to be able to enjoy ALL the songs. The best solution would be a free mp3 download for those songs that errored.
B002A9OJ0Q|4.0|Along with UK's Pet Shop Boys, Norway's a-Ha were one of my favourite eighties bands with their swirling synth Pop sound. They return to basics on \\"Foot of the mountain\\", their 9th studio album, which sees a return to the lush electronics of their eighties albums \\"Hunting high and low\\" and \\"Scoundrel days\\".<br /><br />Though more sublime as a whole, songs like opening cut \\"The bandstand\\" jab and pulse in all the right places. Casio-like \\"Riding the quest\\" has a boppy beat that reminds me a wee bit of their huge hit \\"Take on me\\", while my favourite is the incredibly beautiful stomping \\"What there is\\" with Morten Harket's melancholic tenor really thrilling.<br /><br />Lead-off single \\"Foot of the mountain\\" is pulsing Rock/Pop, while \\"Real meaning\\" is an ominous sounding ballad with bubbling synths and soothing vocals. The epic \\"Shadowside\\" is a truly awesome ballad with majestic strings, on par with songs like \\"Stay on these roads\\" or even \\"Hunting high and low\\".<br /><br />Each of the ten songs is really good; \\"Nothing is keeping you here\\" is dreamy Pop/Rock (reminds me of Keane), \\"Mother nature goes to Heaven\\" is an apocalyptic ode to mother earth with swirling foreboding synths, \\"Sunny mystery\\" is dreamy and melancholic, while closing is the experimental ballad \\"Start the simulator\\" (with a bridge with Beatles/ELO-style harmonies and lyrics that use technical jargon to make a love song).<br /><br />It is great to see a-Ha finding space on the charts alongside obvious followers La Roux, Keane, Little Boots et all, the album debuted in the UK at #5, their first top 10 album there since 1988. It did take me a while to conclude, but it's definitely one of their best albums!
0307454541|5.0|Loved this book. It seems to me that every \\"mystery\\" or \\"thriller\\" I've read recently has been the same: After some plot setting and character development of variable quality, the good guy shoots everyone in sight until whoever might have \\"dunnit\\" is dispatched and the world weary hero sighs as he lives to fight another day. Larson's work is nothing like that! The plot is intricate, tricky, surprising and fun. The mystery is exactly that and not at all easy to figure out. The view into Swedish life is enlightening. The characters are original, and Lisbeth Salander is the best in years. The resolution is interesting and satisfying. Although the book is long, the writing is economical. Larson is really good. Buy this. Like others, I was sorry to see this end and am eager for the next one.
B001TKK39S|2.0|I must defer to the previous critic for a  presymably informed  critique of the history of Bernstein conducting Haydn on lp/ cd. Instead I will say only that if you are looking for Bernstein, you need go no further.  He is to be found in every measure.  Thatcan be good indeed.  If you are looking for Haydn,I'm afraid you must go elsewhere.  Haydn never needed Bernstein to reveal his genius,  He just needed  a band to play what he wrote without an ego-driven conductor whipping up the forces.  Nicechange of pace, but not the real deal.    ADDENDUM AFTER A YEAR OR SO:  I've had much more experience with this set sincce the above review was first written.  And while my views haven't changed much, I am far more enthusiatic about Bernstein's account than earlier.  And offered for about $35.00 (for 12 CDs) on the Amazon Marketplace, this set become a steal.  Buy it quickly.
B001DCQIAU|5.0|These are recordings mostly from the 70s. The Bruckner cycle is surely one of the best ever, as is the Tchaikovky, so just for that alone the price is good. But there is more: a superb Mendelssohn cycle, a superb Schumann set, and good cycles of Beethoven, Mozart, and Haydn.     The sound is good late analogue. The orchestra is terrific.
0385341008|5.0|Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows' [[ASIN:0385341008 The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society (Random House Reader's Circle)]] is a novel in letters between writer Juliet Ashton, her friends Sidney and Sophia, and her new friends from the Guernsey Channel Islands.<br /><br />Ashton is in the midst of a book tour for a collection of her WWII articles under the pseudonym Izzy Bickerstaff. However, she is floundering on the topic for her next book, which is opportune for Ashton who begins to write articles for the Times about the practical, moral, and philosophical value of reading when she receives an unexpected letter of request from Dawsey Adams of Guernsey.<br /><br />She begins getting letters from the remaining residents of Guernsey and their exploits as part of a literary society during the German occupation. These initial letters help with her series of articles and spur her muse into action.<br /><br />\\"Perhaps there is some secret sort of homing instinct in books that brings them to their perfect readers.\\" (Page 10)<br /><br />Like the above quote, this novel is one of those books that will hone in on the perfect reader. The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is chock full of bookish quotes and must have been written with the love of books in mind. Beyond the WWII details, the rationing, the tip-toeing around German officers, and the loss of good friends shipped off to concentration camps, this is a novel about a writer who blooms in the countryside among new friends and new scenery.<br /><br />Readers will easily keep track of the numerous characters in this novel because each letter has an introduction line of who the letter is from and to whom it is addressed. Barrows and Shaffer have crafted quirky individuals with lively personalities from Dawsey and his quiet persuasive qualities to Isola and her outgoing nature.

B0024RID60|3.0|I love this album but this particular copy sounds terrible. It is so heavy on the treble that it is not enjoyable. It is an Argentinian import. Could that be the cause for the poor quality? I have never had any problems with imports before but am wary now. Oh, and the cd smelled awful. Not real happy with this provider(Tango Tienda).
B0014VPFTA|4.0|If you liked his other albums, then you'll most likely like this one as well. Music's still great, lyrics are just as meaningful, and his voice is just as entrancing. It also includes a few hit tracks from the live recording of the John Mayer Trio - Try album. All in all, if you're a John Mayer fan, it is a necessity for you to purchase this album. Don't worry - you'll love it.
B0011FXLCC|5.0|Goldfrapp have done an album with many good music for relax!!! It's little different from their other last works but however the result is excellent!!! My favourite song is \\"Happiness\\"!!!  I suggest you to try to listen it!!!

0345409671|4.0|I picked up this book on reccommendation.  I'd never read Anne Rice's books before and didn't consider myself in the vampire/ sci fi genre.  In fact, I hardly read at all.      Though this book was very \\"heavy\\", I struggled through it because by page 150 or so, Rice was talking about her views on \\"God\\" and \\"Satan\\" and whatnot.  It became very interesting- still heavy- but atleast interesting.    Some parts were dry- sometimes there was about 20 pages of one person's dialogue- but that person was telling a story within a story, so it was not too hard to follow.    I give her 4 stars- if not only for her imagination.  I didn't really picture heaven/ hell/ god/ lucifer in those ways... and I like to see many different points of view.
1401322336|3.0|This is basically a good cookbook, and is very easy to use. However, there are tons, tons, tons of seafood recipes, and only like 5 chicken recipes! I realize that chicken can be boring, but it would be nice to know how to dress it up a bit, as this would be a key ingredient that a \\"novice cook\\" would have on-hand.
B000JQ1NCY|5.0|A strange format, but what a treasure!  My edition dates from 1961, and the data and historic information is as accurate as one would wish.  Mr. Green certainly knew his stuff.<br /><br />As an example, I recall much debate a very few years ago about the relative fuselage lengths of the Hawker Hurricane Mk.I and the Mk.2  -  to a reader of this volume the surprise revelation that they were different would come as no surprise.  (All that fuss over a few inches, but ...)<br /><br />As a potted history on the development of fighter aircraft in Great Britain and Italy during WW2, this volume has no peer. Thoroughly recommended!
1843532727|1.0|I could start by listing the inaccuracies, of this horrendously misleading book, in regard to the town where I live - Yokohama, and mention that they claim Yokohama (baseball) stadium was the venue of the 2002 (soccer) world cup. It would be a fair barometer of the slapdash, and thoughtless way this book is written. But I have an even bigger beef.    This week I took a short break in Nikko, in the mountains above Tokyo. My decision to take the (very) Rough Guide with me could have cost me my life. Following the instructions, in visiting Lake Chuzenji, for a nice stroll, I got off the bus \\"one stop early to walk up the hill for 1.5 km and enjoy the views\\".     The \\"1.5 km walk\\" was a perilous five and a half hour scramble, hike and crawl, of several miles, over no longer existent mountain paths, washed away, in the most part. Many paths that did still exist gave way under me, leaving me holding onto tree roots, for dear life, over drops of several hundred feet. At one point, I wrote a goodbye message, and two or three times, I considered calling mountain rescue. Thank god it didn't rain, or I don't think I'd have survived. I started my \\"1.5 km walk\\" just after 9am, and finished just before 3pm, with a pulled right calf, sprained left ankle, lucky to be alive. At no point in those five hours or so did I see another human being. Only a \\"rough, rough guide\\" book owner would have been foolish enough to be on that pathless and perilous mountain.    The publishers of this deceptive and dangerous book have to be taken to task. No matter that they say Nikko's Gusto restaurant serves beer (not true) or that The Shrine of Tosho Gu means \\"sunlight\\" (again, not true), the misleading information about lake Chuzenji could result in some poor unsuspecting day tripper dying, on the slopes of a rugged and dangerous mountain. In fact, several stories have been in the news, recently, about people trapped, or perishing, in the wilderness - seriously, rescuers should check the backpacksof these poor souls, to see if they were carry a \\"rough guide\\".     If you value your safety, DO NOT buy this horrible book! And stay on the bus, ALL the way to Lake Chuzenji!
B000FBFMFW|2.0|I am a little puzzled by all the rave reviews for this 2nd volume in the trilogy and after really enjoying the first book find myself siding with the few who have expressed disappointmentment, frustration and even irritation with this one.    I agree it takes an AWFULLY long time to go nowhere.  I also agree that the characterizations were weak and inconsistent. Both Molly and Burridge change their attitudes towards Fitz without any apparent reasoning.  One minute they aren't talking to him, the next he is the center of their world again.  Verity presents similar issues - often within the same conversation - and Fitz's attitude to the king is cavalier to say the least.  After 300 pages, everyone knows the King is being drugged and possibily poisoned and no-one does a thing about it. Not only that, but Fitz just abandons him for weeks at a time on a regular basis whenever it suits him.  Wallace goes from being in total control over who sees the King to being unable to prevent housemaids and the Cook taking over the room when it suits the plot.  If the way that Fitz treats both Cub/Nighteyes and The Fool is anything to go by, then I am glad he is no friend of mine!  They get ignored for long periods and only resurrected when it suits some minor plot twist, it seems.      I have seen various comments on the \\"stupidity\\" of the characters and am forced to agree.  Frankly, I thought Fitz was a bit dense in the first book, but I let him off because he was young.  Unfortunately he doesn't get any smarter - either about his actions or his feelings - and a bunch of other people join him.  I just can't buy the whole \\"don't disobey the king\\" thing either, because apparently Fitz can both disobey AND ignore the king whenever he feels like it.  Its NOT OK to disobey the King to bring to someone's attention the fact that Regal is apparently trying to kill him (and Kettricken, and Fitz and in general is a murderous, traitorous cad) but it IS OK to disobey the King when you feel like sleeping with Molly.    I haven't seen any comments on one of my chief irritations...  the tortured language, which I assume was to make an attempt at some kind of medieval feel.  It got to the point where I would reconstruct the sentence in my head because it bothered me so much and at that point I decided \\"too many books, too little time\\" and gave up.    Bottom line...  I gave up on it after 300 pages.  Unfortunately, like a lot of other reviewers, I already bought the 3rd one. I purchased both the 2nd & 3rd for my Kindle immediately on finishing the first because I had enjoyed it so much.  As this seems to be a fairly common situation I guess Ms Hobbs has no reason to be concerned about the rapid deterioration in plot, style and quality after the first book.  Oh well.
B000007ODY|5.0|These Brahms Symphonies are absolutely wonderful.  The sound quality is excellent, and the orchestra sound is stunning.  My only objection to these recordings is that Karajan leaves out the repeats of the expositions.  For recordings that include the repeats, try the fantastic set [[ASIN:B00005TNML Brahms: Symphonies Nos. 1-4]] by Eschenbach.  I highly recommend either (or both) sets!
B00003003R|5.0|A great live double-CD.  When I listen to this I'm transported back to 1990 in the Citrus Bowl in Orlando seeing this great band at its peak.<br /><br />The live version of \\"You're Crazy\\" is just as I remember it - not as fast as it was on \\"Appetite\\" and not as slow as it was on \\"Lies.\\"  A fantastic, bluesy, somewhere in between.<br /><br />\\"You Could Be Mine\\" is another highlight as is, of course, \\"Paradise City.\\"<br /><br />If you don't like this recording, you don't like GNR.

B0027G783W|5.0|While the description describes \\"Wait For Me\\" as a radical departure from recent albums, I think this work blends a lot of Play with Hotel and extends into new territory.  It certainly is a departure from Last Night, which did move Moby's work back to night club music as advertised.  Not that I did not also enjoy that album as well.  But this one is more my style.  It gets better with every listen.<br /><br />However, I really want to make the point here to not be put off by the description of this album and how differently it was created by Moby.  It is still uniquely Moby's sound and will not dissappoint.  Enjoy.
B0010VD7EO|5.0|I really love this CD. All the songs are catchy, upbeat, and a teeny tiny little bit trippy. I find myself randomly getting songs stuck in my head in the middle of the day. It is everything I expected and wanted. I can listen to this over and over again without getting tired of the songs. I love it.
B000EGCITG|5.0|Great CD, brand new.  Only wish there were more songs on it so I could sing in the car longer!!!
0545128285|4.0|The stories are well constructed in themselves, but the vast majority of this very short book is dedicated to an analysis of each of the fairy tales in a phony cheesy way.  I'd recommend going into a book store and reading these stories if you really feel like you have to.  Skipping the analysis portions you probably could read the whole book in 25-30 minutes.
B00004XONN|5.0|Radiohead<br />Kid A; 2000<br />EMI/Capitol Records<br /><br />My Rating: 10/10<br /><br />KID A is the most controversial album in Radiohead's catalog. After the tremendous commercial and critical success of OK COMPUTER, the band might have easily crafted a cybertronic Brit-Rock re-tread. Instead, they chose to completely turn their songwriting and production process inside out, retreating into the studio for over a year and completely re-learning the art of rock and roll. Lots of people found OK COMPUTER difficult compared to the melodic Brit-rock of THE BENDS, but with this one, the band completely says goodbye to the past and announces to the world, \\"We are not resting on our laurels.\\" From the opening cascade of electric piano on track 1, KID A sounds numinous, cold, and chronic, perpetually avoiding the pop-music hook but all the while re-inventing it. The album cover features a digitally rendered mountainous landscape, which suggests that the band intended to make a grand and foreboding album. Well, all I know is that this album is a tough climb at first, but once you've struggled to the top, it all starts to make sense. An incredible and unique sonic journey.<br />TRACKS:<br /><br />1. Everything In Its Right Place (5/5)<br />2. Kid A (5/5)<br />3. The National Anthem (5/5)<br />4. How to Disappear Completely (5/5)<br />5. Treefingers (5/5)<br />6. Optimistic (4/5)<br />7.

0143038583|5.0|I can't believe how many five-star reviews this book has.  It's clearly written by a guy who eschews technological advancements and never spent any serious time on a farm.  I sure hope he wrote his manuscript by hand with a pencil, and didn't avail himself of any technological advancements that make his chosen trade so much easier now.    Also troubling is this push for \\"local\\" food. That's great if you live in California, but what about if you live in North Dakota?  I'm sure those people are happy to eat fresh fruits and vegetables that are trucked in.  In Illinois, its pretty tough to get fresh veggies in the winter.     Technology has allowed fewer people to farm while yielding more food, which means people like the author can choose to do something else with his life, like write.  This book may make you feel good if you already live in a nice place where you can easily get fresh, local food, but for everyone else, the great-unwashed masses of those living in flyover country, this is pure elitist silliness.    (For some reason, I hit 1-star, and Amazon gave this 5-stars! This is not a five star book)
B002DKGWSO|5.0|These days, Hollywood has found itself in the middle of a remake frenzy, plucking up various films and franchises eager to tinker and tool with them for a new generation. By far, horror movies have been at the heart of this storm, with already Halloween and Friday the 13th recieving the treatment and Nightmare on Elm Street following close behind. Now we all know that, usual, remakes usually pale in comparision to the original, but with this new version of The Last House on the Left, that rule does not apply, providing with a film that is both realistic, cerebral, emotional, and definintly a worthy companion to its original.<br /><br />The plot is essentially almost the same as the original. A family is vacationing up in the woods and one night the daughter and her friend go out for the day, only to be brutally attacked and raped by a group of individuals, who afterward wind up at the girls house, where the parents take this as a chance for sweet revenge.<br /><br />I wouldn't define this film as a 'horror' movie, which while the original was, this one plays out more like a revenge-thriller film, which is natural considering it was written by the guy who did another Craven picture, the also exceptional thriller 'Red Eye'. And just like that film, the tension is palpable. When you see the tormentors first corner the girls, you can feel your heart pump. As one of them converses with the mother, who at that point has figured them out, you can literally jump at and scream at her to either get out of their or just fight the guy off. It is a very tightly wound film that rarely ever falters in its attempt at giving you edge-of-your-seat thrills.<br /><br />But LHOTL isen't just about the thrills, there is also a great deal of emotion and some fine acting. When that absolutly brutal killing/rape scene happens, you literally feel your heart just sink and your heart clench to watch these innocent girls be subjected to that. And then not even thirty minutes later when the parents discover her daughter, it is so powerful. This of course would not be possible without the actors, who really do give it their all, especially Tony Goldwyn and Monica Potter as the two parents, both of whom bring so much to their roles.<br /><br />This remake really does rise above and is really one of the more finer horror movies to come along. It is definitly one all horror fanatics need to see and one that everyone should view for a good, heart pounding ride.r, it is so powerful. This of course would not be possible without the actors, who really do give it their all, especially Tony Goldwyn and Monica Potter as the two parents, both of whom bring so much to their roles.

0316096199|5.0|I've known of Alice Sebold for a few years now, but I never actually read a book of hers until now, when I read \\"Lucky,\\" her memoir on her brutal rape and the subsequent prosecution of her attacker.    The rape itself lasts for eleven pages, and the remaining two hundred pages detail the difficulties that she experiences throughout the course of her recovery, from unfulfilling relationships to discovering that the policeman who originally documented her testimony was in disbelief for quite some time. The true power of this memoir comes not from Sebold's impeccable memory, though that certainly contributes to the hard reality of her life, but from her ability to recover from the assault and her resolve to convict her attacker despite the seeming impossibilities of it all. Her own roommate is raped while Sebold is gone, apparently in retaliation for her attacker's conviction, and yet, throughout the book, her dry sense of humor and courage shine brightly through every sentence that she writes.    Truthfully, I have never read a firsthand account of any sexual assault on a woman before this book, and having now read this, I can't imagine how any man could ever do this to a woman, but Sebold is unapologetic about the details -- and for good reason. The harsh reality of her experience is immensely powerful.

B001U0HBPG|4.0|Brad Pitt plays Benjamin Button, a man born old who ages backwards as the years pass, so that when he dies, he's an infant. Cate Blanchett is his love interest but there didn't seem to be much chemistry between the two. I also didn't like her character - she seemed too self-absorbed. I guess I thought this would be along the lines of Forest Gump, showing historical events that coincided with Button's life, and it does this only in a minor way. Pitt does a good job with the role and his narrative adds dimension. Tilda Swinton is fabulous and carries this movie. The ending is, of course, a sad one, so beware.
0962477060|1.0|This book is basically a con. It makes observations of arbitrary facts regarding the fretboard, then imagines that these illustrate some generalized \\"concepts\\" without ever explaining what those concepts are - essentially because there are none.    For example, the infamous \\"CAGED\\" system (which stands for the C, A, G, E, and D \\"chord forms\\"): Play an open C chord. Now play the barred form of the open A chord on the third fret - OMG, it's ALSO a C chord! Now move up to the 5th fret and play the barred form of the open G chord - OMG, it's ALSO a C chord! Is there a CONCEPT here??? After expounding on this, he blithely proclaims that this explains the reasoning for the guitar's tuning - when in fact, it explains nothing. And also implies that an equivalent set of observations would be impossible using any alternate tuning - which is obviously untrue - you could devise such a system using ANY tuning.    (And, BTW, does any guitarist actually USE the barred form of an open G chord?)    After making my way through the first half of the book, I began on the second half. When he erroneously proclaimed that, just like for augmented triads, any note in a diminished TRIAD can be used to identify the chord (ie, Cdim = Ebdim = Gdim), I gave up in disgust. (FYI, it's true for fully diminished 7th chords, but NOT for diminised TRIADS.)    I have played guitar for 40 years and taken a 1 year course in music theory at a junior college.
0385341008|5.0|The protagonists' struggle during the second world war was interesting; however my attention to the story was aggravated by the forced writing style and the tangible feeling of the author's strain to create.
006097625X|5.0|Scott McCloud's Understanding Comics is an extremely useful and fun resource for anyone who is interested in the history and mechanics of the comics medium - whether you're an artist or writer considering working in the form, a new fan looking to better understand the technical mastery of your favorite authors and illustrators, a teacher or librarian seeking to incorporate comics into the classroom or library, or a hardcore collector and armchair critic who simply enjoys reading someone else's enthusiastic opinions of your favorite subjects.  It might even be enlightening for people interested in or working in other story-,time-, or sequence-based artforms such as cinema, theatre, or animation.  This book is appropriately written in comic book form and is wildly entertaining, but it's not exactly \\"light\\" reading - McCloud takes full advantage of the combination of words and pictures communicate what neither could express on its own (including lots of samples of comic art from different genres and countries, plus charts and models that help clarify the sometimes esoteric concepts McCloud has chosen to discuss).    Some long-time comics readers may find certain segments of the book repetitive, but readers less familiar with the standard lexicon and genre cliches of the format will likely need this reiteration (which isn't at all excessive) to keep from getting lost in the sea of new information provided them in this book.  There's also a lot of art-theorizing going on, so if one finds that type of thing inherently pretentious you may want to subtract a star or two... however, if you're at all interested in the subject, you should find this book interesting anyway.  McCloud's writing is always lucid, tightly-constructed, and pictorially illustrated, so any adult or teenager can easily understand and learn from this book.    For those who have read this book and want to explore more deeply what goes into producing a comic book or manga, the third book in this series - Making Comics - is highly recommended.  Be warned though!  Even though it's still in comic form, it's much more intensive and serious (like a text book), but if you're interested in making comics, essential.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|This is a must have for Charlaine Harris fans. Action, drama, romance, comedy. Sookie and Bill are amazing. This series is NC-17. More graphic than the book, but its a wonderful addition for any vampire lover.
B000QUUD60|1.0|Elvis fans waited a long time to get this on DVD.  The great original VHS extended version is subjugated to secondary status here: no widescreen, no stereo, no picture or sound remastering at all. The original theatrical version, on the other disc is only slightly better in sound but the picture is also dreadful and not even up to the original VHS standard. Elvis fans deserve a lot better!
B0027EPA7A|5.0|I love this CD! It is an awesome, power packed CD with some great surprises. I literally LOVE every song. There is some profanity and sexual content so it is not for the small listener. I have been rockin' out to it for weeks now and still cannot stop listening! This CD features, Boom Boom Pow!, Tonight's the Night, My new favorite songs are # 8 & #12 - Showdown. This is a great group trying to send powerful messages to our youth and bring new music sounds to our ears. This would be a great work-out CD because of the upbeat tempo. It was well worth the purchase.
0307266303|5.0|This is a book whose main theme is the love of running, ultra distance runners, and the Tarahumara runners in particular. It's about how we are born to run, and how shoes mess up the mechanics and get us injured. The book is about a coach looking for the magic edge and a researcher who meets someone who lived in Africa and caught game by running them into exhaustion. And yes, there's even more.    Included is a fantastic account of ultra running legend Ann Trason trying to win her first 100-miler at Leadville, and how she dueled with the Tarahumara Indians as they tried to overtaker her for first place.f you love to run, this book is for you. I hope it has as much influence as The Complete Runner by James Fix published many years ago.
1416550542|5.0|I almost didn't start reading The Forgotten Garden at the beach, thinking it might be better suited for a cozy winter read; however, I decided to go ahead and download it to my Kindle. Winter, summer--this book needs no season. From the initial story of the abandoned little girl on an Australian wharf, the mystery of her origins oscillates between the early 1900s to 2005. Several times, I felt I had solved the mystery, only to be thrown off by an unexpected twist or turn.    I hesitated in reading this book when I found it was written by the author of The House at Riverton, as that book didn't live up to its reviews for me. This book, on the other hand, surpassed my expectations and is heartily recommended. Family sagas in the time of the early 1900s are among my favorite reads, and it was nice to find one with a little mystery. Even the fairy tales included were exquisite and added much to the story.
B001TH28EY|4.0|These dirt cheap box sets continue to be released at an alarming rate and provide incredible bargains but are not necessarily essential purchases.<br /><br />This set contains recordings that were all part of the Phillips Complete Mozart Edition (which was about the price of a small car I seem to remember) and they have appeared in several guises since. The backbone of the set is Davis' wonderful recordings of the mature operas which have stood the test of time excedingly well. The set is worth purchasing for these operas alone and will complement any recordings you already own.  The list of tremendous singers from the 70's and 80's gives the set another bonus of being a fascinating record of Mozart singing during this period (things are very different now are they not?).<br /><br />In that sense you can't go wrong but you need to consider that the early operas, while perhaps interesting as a demonstration of his developmentt as a dramatic composer, are not music you will be turning to frequently for enjoyment. Add this the problem that the set will not contain a printed libretto or essays to help you follow these immature works so they will probably sit in their cardborad sleeves for most of their life.<br /><br />If that doesn't bother you you certainly won't regret gaining so many fine recordings at such a reasonable price.
B001PJRAUS|4.0|Author Jane Austen invented the Romance as we know it. Her Pride & Prejudice ([[ASIN:B00005MP58 Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition  (A&E, 1996)]])  hits all the grace notes-an admirable hero with a fixable flaw, charming protagonist slightly clueless about relationships, a heroic hidden gesture by the hero on the behalf of the protagonist, red herring suitors-all of which conspire to keep our lovers apart until the marriage proposal on the last page!  P&P is so archetypal that not even Austen herself could replicate it.  Imitators (the sincerest form of flattery) have also scored major successes ranging from d. 1855 Elizabeth Gaskill's North & South [[ASIN:B000AYEL6U North & South]] to d. 1996 Helen Fielding's Bridget Jones' Diary [[ASIN:B0002W4SWC Bridget Jones's Diary (Collector's Edition)]] and now, Lost in Austen!<br /><br />This charming four-part ITV mini-series has been streamlined into a three hour film starring Jemima Rooper as Amanda Price and Elliot Cowan as the broodingly handsome Fitzwilliam Darcy and a delightful turn by Alex Kingston as Mrs. Bennett.  In keeping with the new millennium's revisionist takes on everything from Cinderella to Robin Hood to Sherlock Holmes, writer Guy Andrews has created an interesting \\"what if\\" screenplay.  What if a modern day woman named Amanda went thru a door in her bathroom and ended up in Regency England living with the Bennett family? What if Jane married badly?  What if Wickham wasn't a villain?  What if Mrs. Bennett had honest grievances? What if Elizabeth wanted a different life?<br /><br />And gentle readers, I give it four stars instead of five because: there are no natural breaks in the lengthy one disc story, the script is very ironic and exhibits prochronisms such as antibiotics and lip gloss; and worst of all, we aren't privy to a major plot point because of a copyright issue.
B0028K3192|1.0|I LOVE Urban Hang Suite.  So when I heard BlackSummer's Night, I wondered what happened to the awesome band and great lyrics. I am sad to say, this CD left a bad taste in my mouth.  Pretty Wings is about the only song I can get with. The rest of the songs seemed like he just threw words together and the background music was flat.  The music did not make me feel the soulfulness he is known for.  Too bad after such a long wait, the material was not up to his usual par.

0385340575|5.0|In this latest suspense novel by prolific author Child, our homeless-by-choice hero, Jack Reacher, is in New York City when he thinks he comes across a suicide bomber on the subway early one morning.  After the woman kills herself in front of him, Reacher decides to find out why.    Along the way he gets mixed up with the FBI, the Secret Service, of course the NYPD and a group of fanatical terrorists led by two women.  One is young and attractive; the other is older and seemingly harmless.

B000OLGCI4|1.0|I purchased the Platinum Edition. This was one of the worst DVDs I have ever seen made. It had numerous problems in every one of my 6 different dvd players and computers throughout the house. When it did work, in EVERY one it would alternate about once a second between great picture quality and a pixelated grid-like pattern. It made me seriously get a headache. The very mechanics of the DVD seem flawed. I am not going to pin this on the seller and get my money back from them, but I WILL be contacting Disney and seeing if I can get a refund through them. I am going to purchase the limited edition to see if it is better. I LOVE this movie.

I gave it only 3*s because it is a great collection but does not look great on HDTV.  I originally bought this years ago for my granddaughter.  Have now bought it again for myself.  Have been following Michael since the beginning and was so looking forward to his successful return.  Michael Jackson was truly a giant in the music industry and The King of Pop is a title he has earned.

The album starts off with one of the greatest guitar riffs of all time and just keeps coming! There are songs about having fun with your girl, getting down and dirty, life on the road, being rejected, and sneaking into your girlfriend's room at midnight. The whole album is fantastic and is a MUST HAVE for any true rock n roll fan. It's full of those awesome riffs and clever lyrics and will have you tapping your feet, banging your head, air drumming, air guitar playing, ect. Just buy this album, you'll enjoy it.

B000SCHBGQ|4.0|I was very surprised how much I like this book.  It was well written, kept the reader engaged and flowed very smoothly.  I liked it enough to go out and now purchase the next in the series.  Thanks for a good book Mr. Scott.
B000J103PC|4.0|I loved the book and, although the film strays from that by quite a bit to make it simpler to understand, it is nevertheless, still very good.  Unfortunately these story changes make Meryl Streep's character much more pleasant than in the book and this detracts from the impact of the film.    I can help feeling as well that, good as Anne Hathaway was, Emily Blunt would have been far more convincing in the lead part.    All the main actors are excellent and even a jeans and t-shirt male like me who normally despises 'fashion', was caught up with the characters and their hopes and fears.
0765350386|5.0|Mistborn is part Epic Fantasy and part Superhero Origin Story. Taking place in a unique world, Mistborn delivers action, adventure, and drama.     Plot:   An omnipotent lord rules the land with brutality and terror. Armed soldiers take joy in beating a helpless population into submission. Magic wielding Inquisitors strike fear into their hearts through torture and death. Wealthy aristocratic houses attempt to outmaneuver each other politically and economically. The Skaa, a once proud race, have been conquered, enslaved, and worked to death in slums, plantations, and mines. But hope lies in the mists as rebels plan a revolution.     World:   Brandon Sanderson does an excellent job creating and building an exciting new Fantasy World complete with its own magic system based on consuming metals. In the day, ash falls from blood red skies. At night, the land is engulfed in darkness and mist. Mistwraiths haunt the lands at night, and the Inquisitors roam the city streets in the day. Those who are Mistborne use a magic system called Allomancy and consuming types of metal gives them powers. Pewter enhances physical abilities, Tin enhances perception, Steel pushes metals with tremendous force... Imagine a coin going right through someone's head. This book is worth reading based on the unique universe and magic system alone. The book also features a useful glossary at the end that explains the types of mages and magic.     Characters:   The main character is a street urchin named Vin. She's likeable, clever, and tough. For the most part, the characters are well written. There are some that could use more screen time and the dialogue could have been a bit better at times. But overall, they're good.     Action:   This book contains some very unique action scenes that may be described as a cross between The Matrix and The X-Men set in a fantasy universe. There are some fairly long breaks in the action, but when there is action, it's great.     Balls:   This book has Balls; the expensive, fancy dress, snooty, dancing kind. This is where the political aristocratic house warfare takes place. These chapters could be annoying for angsty fantasy fans that want pure action. These scenes slow the pacing of the book just a bit. But if you're mature enough to enjoy a glass of wine, you'll like these scenes. To the angsty action fans (like me), they're not so bad and trust me; you'll really want to get to the end of this book!     Overall:   This is a refreshingly original fantasy adventure with action, subterfuge, and magic. I'd give it a 4.5 outta 5!     If you like fantasy books that have world building, originality, action, and BALLS pick this one up! You'll enjoy it!     If you want traditional fantasy with elves, dragons, castles, knights on a quest, or you aren't a fan of balls, then you can avoid this one.   (But you'd still probably enjoy it, if you gave it a shot.)
B000WC39ZY|3.0|Oh my.  Where do I begin?  If I had been Martin Scorsese's assistant during pre-production of \\"New York, New York\\", I might have said something like \\"Marty, you know I love your movies.  I suspect you walk on water in your spare time, and can film just about any film genre known to humanity, but you gotta pass on this screenplay, because you can't make a silk purse from a sow's ear.\\"     There's a lot to like and a lot not to like in \\"New York, New York\\", but the unlikeable parts boil down to: bad screenplay.      The basic premise of the film is simple.  Jimmy (Robert DeNiro), a saxophone player just out of the military in 1945 meets and falls in love with Francine (Liza Minnelli), a small-time singer with a touring big band.  Francine becomes much more famous than Jimmy, things don't work out between Francine and Jimmy.  So far, so good. More about what's good and what's bad about the movie.    What's good:  The music is great.  Big band and jazz from the 1940s, excellent musicianship.  The singing by Liza Minnelli is also superb.  A musical medley taking up the last half-hour of the film is also sensational.  Set design is perfect for re-creating the mood of some of the lavish musicals from the 1940s and 1950s.     What's bad:  The biggest problem with the film is that Jimmy's character is completely unlikeable.  He spends the first part of the film at a VJ day (WW II end of war victory) celebration party where he's asking women for a date.  Jimmy focuses on Francine and unrelentingly bothers her for a full fifteen minutes of screen time asking her out, trying out every line he can think of.  Essentially, Jimmy comes across as a crazed stalker who will not take no for an answer.  DeNiro's performance is really creepy, but I'm not sure if he intended it to be.  He appears to be channeling the Travis Bickle character from Taxi Driver.  The Bickle character is believable because we know he's a psychopath, but we also know he wants to \\"clean up the city\\" from all thebad elements.  The Jimmy character comes across as just a manipulative, self-centered egomaniac who only thinks of himself.      Eventually, Jimmy and Francine marry, but that doesn't mean Jimmy becomes a better person.  A few thoughts came to my mind when I watched their relationship develop:  Jimmy is a chauvinist pig, arrogant, controlling, and despicable.  Francine allows herself to be treated like a doormat by Jimmy.  She's emotionally abused constantly, yet maintains a strange acceptance of her mistreatment, wearing a bemused, detached expression like she's the Buddha who has been reincarnated as a dancing girl.  I wanted to warn Francine, \\"Stand up for yourself, you don't have to take this from him.  Read \\"Women Who Love Too Much\\", can't you see that you have a toxic relationship with this man?\\" (Oh, where's Oprah or Dr. Phil when you need them?)    DeNiro's performance in New York, New York is similar to his previous film with Scorsese, Taxi Driver.  What works for a mentally unstable loner in Taxi Driver simply does not translate to a married saxophone player in a respected band.  I for one, did not accept that the Jimmy character should have been given a single second of respect.  Minnelli's performance, as previously noted, is a little strange; extremely calm and quiet, and almost under-acted.  It's like she was afraid to let the Francine character ever let her emotions show.  I suspect she was told to play the part like a woman with battered wife syndrome - very shut down emotionally.      I believe that the main reason this film did not do well is because American audiences were not willing to embrace the two main characters of the film; the man is emotionally abusive, and the woman is meekly accepting of her abuse.  The story isn't even really a tragedy, it's a pathetic reminder that some people should never meet and fall in love.  I suspect also that American audiences craved a stronger female lead who wouldn't take any guff from anybody - hence thegreat success of two films with very strong female characters made shortly after New York, New York; namely, Karen Allen in Raiders of the Lost Ark, and Sigourney Weaver in Alien.      Although Scorsese went on to make the brilliant Raging Bull, again with DeNiro as an abusive man, at least in that film, his character's relationship with his wife Vicky is easier to accept because Vicky is one tough broad who can stand up for herself, who gives as good as she gets, dishing it right back out.  The Minnelli character is just a sad, pathetic character.  One of Scorsese's weakest efforts, recommend you skip this film.
1594202249|5.0|I always used to think of \\"The Crying of Lot 49\\" as the obvious entry point to the work of my favorite author. It may have had some dense prose, but at least it was short.<br />A new portal has been opened.<br />\\"Inherent Vice\\" is both short and easy to read, but it's still recognizably the work of Thomas Pynchon even if the pink flaps of the dustjacket are visually jarring as you read the remarkably unconvoluted sentences and short paragraphs. Despite the surprisingly atypical cover (\\"Mason & Dixon\\" and \\"Against the Day\\" appear so large and beige and sober on my bookshelves), pot-smoking private eye Doc Sportello would have felt at home wandering through any other book in the canon. I'm hoping that some new readers will pick up this quick marijuana-fueled trip through 1970 Los Angeles (a place where Pynchon seems very comfortable) and move on to the harder stuff, especially \\"Gravity's Rainbow,\\" which may now seem much less daunting than its reputation. (I can't help thinking about James Joyce.  How much less intimidating would his comic masterpiece \\"Ulysses\\" have seemed to many readers today if Joyce had ended his career with a simple thriller set in Dublin rather than with \\"Finnegans Wake\\"?)
B001DHXT6G|1.0|Don't read this if you are a Star Trek fan! (It may offend your sense of intelligence)<br /><br />In 1964 Gene Roddenberry created a proposed pilot for a science fiction TV series called `The Cage', starring Jeffery Hunter, it was rejected.<br /><br />In 1965 there was a reprieve, and a second pilot called `Where No Man Has Gone Before' was made starring William Shatner, it was accepted.<br /><br />\\"Space: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations; to boldly go where no man has gone before\\".<br /><br />From 1966 to 1969 Star Trek the TV series was aired, and then cancelled after three seasons due to poor ratings in its 10pm time slot on Friday nights, but through re-runs and syndication to achieved cult status.<br /><br />In 2006 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Star Trek, the powers that be had done the unthinkable, they redid the original series...and how did they fare? Well, I won't bore you too much, but in short, under Mike Okuda, CBS (under CBS Digital) began restoring and updating the original series. All live-action footage was scanned in high definition from its first generation 35 mm film elements, (which included the original camera negatives) while visual effects shots have been digitally reproduced.<br /><br />Notable changes include new space shots with a CGI Enterprise, and other new models (for example, a Gorn ship is shown in Arena, which you could hardly see anyway), redone matte background shots, and other minor touches such as tidying up viewscreens (which they did not do a proper job especially the wall surrounding the Bridge viewscreen-read below for more details on this). A small number of scenes have also been recomposed, as well as adding new ones and in some cases new actors have been placed into the background of some shots (for example in A Taste of Armageddon). Not only that but every planet that the Enterprise visited was also redone, we can see this as the Enterprise orbits the planet, this in itself was a nice touch and necessary to give the original series a definitive new look.<br /><br />In addition, the opening theme music of Star Trek has been re-recorded in digital stereo. Perhaps that's why in the first season, Kirk's voice-over is hardly heard. You would need a stereo-phonic sound system to hear it clearly perhaps? In any case in season two and three, Kirk's voice-over is as clear as day.<br /><br />I believe (arguably) that the golden age of science fiction TV series was in the 1960s, 1970s and to some extent the 1980s, this was the period where imagination for such shows was at its zenith and when it comes to science fiction television series, you can't go pass Star Trek as being an icon of the genre and one of the key corner stones in science fiction influences. Star Trek itself the original series is not only the Bible for other Star Trek sequels (movies) and TV series (Star Trek: Animated, Star Trek: TNG, Voyager, Deep Space Nine and Enterprise), it is the Holy Grail that cannot be altered or changed, and if done would be sacrilege to the hard core fans of the series, any slight change would come under intense scrutiny if not done exactly right...so?<br /><br />I have viewed all three remastered seasons and herewith are my comments on notable criticisms I have observed including scenes that have not been remastered by CBS Digital...well, the ones I noticed anyway.<br /><br />\\"CBS Digital: The Remastered Series. These are the stuff-ups of `Star Trek: The Original Series'. Its two-year mission: to touch-up old scenes that they didn't and add new CGI scenes, to seek out defective negatives and series film with eyes closed for remastering; to boldly go where no computer technology which has not been effectively used has gone before\\".<br /><br />Does the above sound familiar?<br /><br />First Season Remastered Series released on November 20, 2007.<br /><br />1]The Corbomite Manoeuvre - Balok's ship the Fesarius has been redone here, but it is too detailed in extreme close up when compared to the Enterprise when both are in the same spot; it would have been better if Balok's ship had smooth round spheres (like in the original) with a very soft glow against the hard detailed Enterprise.<br /><br />2] Balance of Terror - The Romulan `Bird of Prey' was digitally redone here, but again the ship lost its blue tinge, which I believe should have remained, what were CBS Digital thinking?<br /><br />3] The Galileo Seven - We see the CGI shuttle leave the launching bay of the Enterprise, it wobbles back and forth; you think CBS Digital would make the Galileo lift smoothly out into space, bad work there.<br /><br />4] Arena - The Gorn in this episode was given eyelids. Question: Do Gorns really have eyelids? Looking at the whole episode it would have been better if the Gorn had no eyelids as in the original; I think CBS Digital should have left this alone.<br /><br />Best personal visual effects in Season One:<br /><br />1] In the episode `A Taste of Armageddon' as Kirk and party beam down to the planet Eminiar VII, we see the city in the background redone with a moving figures and a monorail no less, very well done indeed.<br /><br />Personal Note: I may have not noticed too much as far as defects/dirt and the like in this first season, as I was enjoying watching the episodes. Either CBS Digital did their job (surprise-surprise) or I wasn't looking for anything special, in any case seasons two and three made up for this.<br /><br />Second Season Remastered Series released on August 5, 2008.<br /><br />1] The Changeling - In one scene with Kirk and Spock we can actually see the black thin string that holds up Nomad.<br /><br />2] Mirror, Mirror - When Kirk talks to the leader Tharn on the Bridge's viewscreen, in the mirror universe, we see a small black dot (dirt or defect from the original negative), which should have been removed by CBS Digital, sloppy work there.<br /><br />3] The Doomsday Machine - When Decker leaves in the shuttle through the launching bay, the shuttle could've had a smoother ride out into space. CBS Digital must have rushed this one.<br /><br />4] Catspaw - In one of the final scenes showing Sylvia and Korob's true alien forms, we can still see on the left alien (puppet) the remains of the black string used to move the puppet, CBS Digital must have tried to clean this up, but have only partially succeeded, perhaps they couldn't do much here because the black string was also in front of the puppet at times and could not be digitally removed, so I will forgive them here.<br /><br />5] Journey to Babel - When Kirk is fighting Thelev, we see his neck not covered in blue, I know this is in the original, and it may be nit-picking but if the technology is available couldn't CBS Digital clean it up?, if not, I will let it pass...for now.<br /><br />6] Friday's Child -  Kirk and Spock are behind a rock waiting for a rock slide to occur, we see in the sky's background above their heads, going across the scene horizontally a very thin black line, and a vertical dark mark near Kirk's head on the right side as we view the scene. I can't believe CBS Digital missed that.<br /><br />There is also a scene where Scotty is looking at the Bridge's viewscreen searching for the destroyed freighter, the scene cuts to the Bridge's viewsrceen and we see bits of black dots and the like (an uncleaned negative) around the Bridge viewscreen. CBS Digital didn't even bother cleaning up this scene, this is just pure unprofessionalism at its worst!<br /><br />7] The Deadly Years - When the Enterprise is being attacked by the Romulans, their ships have no blue tinge again. Remember, the Romulan `Bird of Prey' is blue coloured, so why again did CBS Digital ignore this important distinction?<br /><br />8] Obsession - When Kirk uses the intercom in McCoy's sick bay, we see in close-up a couple of small black dots that CBS Digital did not clean to remove them around the intercom scene.<br /><br />9] The Trouble with Tribbles - Kirk and Spock are in the Briefing Room, when Kirk gets a call from Uhura to talk to Admiral Fitzpatrick, as Kirk turns on the intercom we see for a couple of seconds just above to the right of the intercom a small thin dark line, that CBS Digital missed.<br /><br />Also when we see a close-up of Admiral Fitzpatrick on the intercom, in the scene, there is a small black dot at the bottom left shoulder of the Admiral as we view this scene. CBS Digital again missed this one.<br /><br />10] The Immunity Syndrome - Kirk looks at the Bridge's viewscreen for the first time seeing a dark black blob; around the Bridge's viewscreen at the top and the right side, we see little black specks.<br /><br />In another same scene as above, with a closer look at the dark black blob, again an unclean negative film shot missed by CBS Digital.<br /><br />And again in another scene with the Bridge's viewscreen when it is showing black (inside the black blob), a couple of small black dots at the top and bottom of the Bridge viewscreen<br /><br />One more time; in a Bridge viewscreen scene showing the cell creature, at the top are small dark dots.<br /><br />Finally; in one of the last scenes with the Bridge viewscreen, showing space/stars, at the bottom of the Bridge viewscreen, just a couple of small black dots again.<br /><br />11] Return to Tomorrow - In the opening scene on the Bridge at Spock's station on close-up, the grey sensor device has a small black dot showing on the front face.<br /><br />After the opening credit sequence, we see a panned view of the Bridge, at the top corner of the scene there is a black dot missed by CBS Digital.<br /><br />12] Patterns of Force - In the opening scene on the Bridge, the picture of John Gill in the background has some black dots on it that has not been cleaned up, and again in close-up, the four black dots are visible.<br /><br />Also again a scene on the Bridge at Spock's station on close-up, the grey sensor device has a small black dot showing on the front face.<br /><br />While Kirk and Spock are watching the giant TV viewsrceen in the town square, on close-up, there are a couple of black dots on the right wall.<br /><br />In a scene watching John Gill's speech, in close-up of the TV viewscreen, we see a black dot at the bottom left side and at the top right side on the wall<br /><br />In the final scene, with the Bridge viewscreen shot, just at the top, a black dot can be seen.<br /><br />13] By Any Other Name - The Bridge viewscreen scene showing in close-up of `The Barrier', just at the top left corner is a very small black dot.<br /><br />14] Breads and Circuses - In the opening scene on the Bridge viewscreen close-up of the planet, we see a small black dot at the top of the viewscreen shot.<br /><br />When Kirk and company just enter the pro-council's chambers, there appears for ½ a second, two white dots where the blue vase is at the bottom right of the scene. (You have to be quick to see it, or you miss it, CBS Digital certainly did)<br /><br />15] Assignment: Earth - Kirk and Spock are in the Briefing Room while Chekov can be seen on the intercom on the left side of the scene, just below the intercom on the table, you can see a small black dot.<br /><br />When Gary Seven visits the McKinley Rocket Base the scenes of the still shots of the rocket to be launched have a few black dots on them scattered about the picture, this also includes other still shots later in the episode. Why CBS Digital didn't clean these up is beyond me.<br /><br />The televised shot of the rocket being monitored at Launch Control, has a small black dot on it, as well as in a later shot/scene, a black dot can be seen on the left side in close-up.<br /><br />When Scotty is searching for Gary Seven, we see in close-up of the viewscreen, a picture of the rocket on the launch pad, and again two small dark dots on the right side of the screen.<br /><br />The televised shot of the rocket being monitored at Launch Control now in flight, in a close-up of the television screen, there are a couple of dots on the left side of this shot.<br /><br />Best personal visual effects in Season Two:<br /><br />1] In the episode `Amok Time' there are a couple of scenes added that give an extension of the exterior of the planet Vulcan. I like it.<br /><br />2] In the episode `The Doomsday Machine' the scenes showing the wreck of the USS Constellation are great.<br /><br />3] In the episode `The Trouble with Tribbles' the scenes with the CGI Space Station K7 looks real cool, well done and great work to CBS Digital.<br /><br />4] In the episode `The Immunity Syndrome' I like the effect showing the scenes where the CGI Enterprise is lit up within the zone of darkness, a rare treat viewing a different perspective of the ship.<br /><br />5] In the episode `By Any Other Name' in the opening scene, we have an excellent panoramic shot of the planet's surroundings as Kirk and company bean down to its surface.<br /><br />Third Season Remastered Series released on November 18, 2008.<br /><br />1] The Enterprise Incident - Again we see the Romulan `Bird of Prey' without its distinctive blue hull tinge.<br /><br />When Kirk is speaking to Commander Tal in the Briefing Room via the intercom, a close up shot of the commander on the intercom we see on the top left of the scene a small white jagged line.<br /><br />2] And the Children Shall Lead - Kirk and Spock are watching a video recording on the Bridge at Spock's station of Professor Starnes, when Tommy comes onto the Bridge and causes interference of the recording. As we see the scene of Kirk and Spock watching this interference, there is a very small black dot on the top blue rim (border) of the monitor/viewer.<br /><br />As the children on the Bridge watch a recording of themselves playing on the monitor/viewer, we see a very small black dot in close-up shot (on the dome section) as we watch the recording of the children playing; and again in the same scene a few moments later a small black dot on the upper right and lower left of the monitor/viewer.<br /><br />3] Spectre of the Gun - Twice in the opening Bridge scene, as we observe the Bridge's viewscreen, there are various black dots scattered around the right and bottom of the scene.<br /><br />Twice again in the opening scenes in another close-up shot of the Bridge viewscreen, when we see the Melkot communication buoy, there is a black dot at the bottom mid left and some black markings at the near upper right of these shots.<br /><br />And twice again in the opening scenes on the Bridge viewscreen, showing the Melkot communication buoy, a couple of very small black dots are showing.<br /><br />All in all there are at least six scenes here in the opening teaser with the Melkot communication buoy that need touch-ups.<br /><br />In the final Bridge scenes with the Melkot communication buoy, before the Melkotian appears, we see some black dots scattered around the Bridge viewscreen.<br /><br />4] Day of the Dove - As the scene opens and continuing with Chekov leaving the turbo-lift and moving through the corridor to find Klingons to kill; there are a few very small black dots and markings about the scene. (You have to have this scene in slow motion to see the defects, frame by frame).<br /><br />I have also noticed that this episode is grainy in various scenes, if this is supposed to be re-digitally done, why is this episode not crisp and clear?<br /><br />Also I have noticed the occasional white/black dot throughout this episode, especially sometimes where there is a scene with the alien entity, example: the final engineering scenes at the end of the episode.<br /><br />5] For the World is Hollow and I have Touched the Sky - While Kirk and Spock are beaming down in the room where Natira is with McCoy, who is lying unconscious after the oracle's implant attack. We see as the two men are beaming in, just to the left on the red pale floor, there is a faint grey spot, doing the same, appearing with the effect.<br /><br />6] The Tholian Web - On the Bridge as Sulu tells Scott the `Defiant' is disappearing, we have a shot of the ship on the Bridge viewscreen, at the bottom left of this scene we see a couple of black dots, which appears again in another same scene.<br /><br />On the Bridge viewscreen showing for the first and second time the Tholian ship, we see on the top left area, a very small black dot and then again later, before the Tholian ship is fired upon.<br /><br />On the first and second Bridge viewscreen scene showing the Tholian commander, we have a very small black dot at the bottom middle of this shot.<br /><br />In another scene with the Tholian commander, a couple of very small black dots, one at the top and bottom of the Bridge viewscreen.<br /><br />While Spock and McCoy watch Kirk's message on the intercom, on a close-up shot of Kirk, just to the right of the intercom on its rim, there is a black smudge; this happens again later in a scene when Spock is talking to Scott about the next interphase.<br /><br />In one of the final scenes, on the Bridge viewscreen showing Kirk, there is a small black dot at the top right of this shot.<br /><br />7] Wink of an Eye - In the opening teaser as McCoy watches Compton disappear, we see for ½ a second very small black dots accompanying this effect.<br /><br />When Deela and Kirk first meet on the Bridge, they have a scene near the turbo-lift; the red alert light that is flashing has a small white dot near it.<br /><br />When Spock looks at his station's viewer at Compton's disappearance, there are a few black dots scattered around the close-up scene of the viewer.<br /><br />Again when Spock is watching his viewer of the Scalosian message speeding up, there is again very small black dots in a close-up scene of the viewer, this continues again as Spock watches his viewer.<br /><br />8] The Empath - In the opening teaser, Kirk, Spock and McCoy are watching a recording of the scientists via the intercom viewer, thus there is a black dot at the upper right of the close-up scene and also we have the same dark smudge, I reported on previous episodes. Looks like the same intercom shot/still was used for close-ups.<br /><br />Also as we watch the intercom viewer, while we notice Ozaba covering his ears, because of the weird sound, you can see a vertical thin dark line above him before he disappears.<br /><br />9] Whom Gods Destroy - As Spock/Garth stuns the Tellarite in the corridor to help him and Kirk escape, there is a white dot on the red/orange door to the left as Spock/Garth fires his phaser.<br /><br />10] Let That Be Your Last Battlefield - When Kirk is informed by Chekov of an alien ship being detected; we see the Bridge viewscreen close-up with various black dots around the Bridge viewscreen, this happens five times within the whole Bridge scene.<br /><br />As Kirk talks Lokai on the Bridge after his fight with Bele on close-up of Lokai just to the left near the red alert light on the wall for ½ a second there is a white dot.<br /><br />On the Bridge viewscreen on the first close-up of the planet Cheron again there are various black dots around this shot; this happens again in a later scene.<br /><br />A Bridge scene close-up shot of Lokai and Bele standing beside each other, there is a black dot showing on Lokai's chest. (How CBS Digital could have missed a so obvious dirt mark is beyond me)<br /><br />Again in another close-up shot of the planet Cheron on the Bridge viewscreen, we see various small black dots around this scene.<br /><br />11] The Mark of Gideon - In the opening teaser as Spock beams down Kirk, as the beaming takes place, just to the left of the shot parallel to Kirk's waist, is a black dot and a thin black hair-line mark.<br /><br />As Kirk is on the Bridge alone, he looks at the Bridge viewscreen,and sees the planet Gideon, in this shot like so many others there are various black dots accompanying this scene, which happens twice.<br /><br />As Spock talks to Hodin via the Bridge viewscreen, in close-up there are a couple of black dots scattered around this scene, which happens five times.<br /><br />In a Bridge viewscreen close-up shot, as Krodak dematerialises, again there are black dots scattered around this shot.<br /><br />In the next Bridge viewscreen close-up of Hodin, there are black dots scattered around this scene which happens twice.<br /><br />Bridge scene with Kirk and Odona in close-up, when they are facing each other, there is a white dot in the middle top of this shot for ½ a second.<br /><br />The second and third scene close-up of the Bridge viewscreen showing many green faces, there are scattered black dots around these shots.<br /><br />As Spock talks to Admiral Fitzgerald on the Bridge viewscreen, we see quite a few black dots scattered around this shot, this scene happens at least nine times while Spock is talking to the Admiral and is one of the worst unclean series of scenes I've seen that has not been fixed up.<br /><br />As Kirk, Spock and Odona beam up to the Enterprise, you can just see some black markings on Kirk's face.<br /><br />As Odona talks to Kirk in the sick bay, there is a close-up shot of her and just to the left-you have to be quick, a small light blue mark can be seen on the wall for ½ a second in the background<br /><br />12] The Lights of Zetar - In a Bridge viewscreen scene in close-up of the aft view of the space entity following the Enterprise, below this scene we see a couple of small black dots; also in the next same scene situation, there is a small black dot on the left and top of this shot.<br /><br />And again in the following same scene, a couple of black dots in the lower left corner of this shot, this happens about four times.<br /><br />Semi-Bridge viewscreen scene showing the alien entity with Sulu's back to us, as he reports on the alien, for ½ a second near the top of the scene there is a white dot.<br /><br />Looks like we have our favourite intercom shot with the black smudge on the right grey border/rim, as we see Mira floating in the de-COM pressure chamber, this happens three times.<br /><br />13] Requiem for Methuselah - When Kirk, Spock and McCoy beam down on Mr. Flint's planet, they are attacked by M4, a close-up of M4, there is a small black dot on the top right of this scene.<br /><br />When Kirk looks at the miniature Enterprise, the scene in close-up as Kirk's face is on the Bridge viewscreen, thus in the Bridge scene there are various black dots around this shot which happens three times.<br /><br />14] The Savage Curtain - In the opening teaser, in close-up of the Bridge viewscreen when Lincoln first appears, there are a few scattered black dots at the top of this scene.<br /><br />Best personal visual effects in Season Three:<br /><br />1] In the episode `Requiem for Methuselah' we have a shot of Mr. Flint's unique residence with the two moons in the background; brilliant architecture!<br /><br />2] In the episode `The Way to Eden' when Kirk, Spock, McCoy and Chekov beam down to the planet Eden, a short panoramic scene of Eden is shown; a beautiful shot indeed.<br /><br />3] In the episode `The Cloud Minders' brief shots in close-up of the city of Stratos are well done.<br /><br />From the above as you can see there are a lot of scenes/shots (Bridge viewscreen shots/scenes especially) that need to be cleaned/touched up (a lot of dirty black dots/marks from the negatives) to make this a remastered series whole, so why didn't CBS Digital do so? (No, I don't want to hear that they couldn't and that they didn't have the technology to fix it, could it be they weren't paid enough?) You got me, perhaps we should ask them, then again perhaps they are too embarrassed to admit they stuffed it up, So any mistakes it's unbelievable, I can't understand whythey didn't do a proper job-can you? Why are there so many scenes/frames not touched up and/or fixed? We do have the technology to repair/patch up these age old defects-so why wasn't it done?<br /><br />Also especially in season two/three including the opening credit sequence and in other shots I noticed when there is a close-up of the CGI Enterprise orbiting a planet its movement across the scene has a slight stop-start effect, doubtless a CGI glitch-which shouldn't be-am I right? Or it may be my DVD operating system? Now that I notice, it's so distracting, annoying and such a nuisance. No smooth glide across the screen-how come?<br /><br />Another thing I noticed which I don't like is when we see the aft view through the Bridge's viewscreen, (especially in the first season and occasionally in the second/third season) when the Enterprise moves away from a planet for example, we see the ship's two nacelles, I find this distracting, and really not essential as we can see clearly the Enterprise moving away from the planet and or object (for example the planet getting smaller, the fans and the viewers are not that dum-are they?).<br /><br />A Major Remastered Blunder:<br /><br />Well I don't believe it, but the remastered series has a major flaw/blunder, it's so obvious, I don't know how CBS Digital could have missed it, it is so unforgivable I am ashamed even to mention it; and it is in all the episodes, in all the three seasons. The pain of it all, but having redone the Star Trek episodes as a whole, one part has been neglected, which should have been remastered also, why it wasn't is a mystery.<br /><br />The blunder-the end episode credit sequence, with the credits not withstanding, it is the background stills that have NOT been replaced with remastered stills, and this is even more evident with shots of the Un-CGI Enterprise. If one is going to redo and do justice to a cult sci-fi show, you need to do it all the way from the beginning to the end and not just redo two thirds of the episode. It is annoying to watch a remastered episode and to have it ruined by an un-remastered end credit sequence. CBS Digital have done justice to the beginning of the show, but have done nothing at its end-WHY? Perhaps CBS Digital didn't because they thought that no one would bother with watching the end credits, and so they could neglect that part of the episode and no one would notice-well I certainly did, and it's bad.<br /><br />This neglect of the end credit sequence is totally unprofessional if you ask me, watching the extras on the DVD's CBS Digital came across with pride in redoing the show and its episodes, am I missing something? I would even accept remastered close-to-different still shots, just to make a distinction between the original and remastered series-that would work-but CBS Digital obviously didn't have the brains to even think about that.<br /><br />Another thing that should have been added to this DVD set are booklets on the episodes, the title, a still shot, a description of the story, the guest stars and what was done to the remastered episode; this in itself would be a great addition to the DVDs instead of having those plastic inserts on the cheap. That's one thing missing with DVD movies and TV series as a whole, no decent booklet with your purchase.<br /><br />A final word:<br /><br />Hey don't get me wrong, I like Star Trek, it's one of my favourite shows, I like watching the episodes, with Kirk and company and their adventures in space, its great fun; I think its science fiction at its best, so no complaints there. Now I would like to give the remastered series five stars-but I can't, with the mistakes mentioned including the end credit sequence and un-remastered background stills in all three seasons, and even scenes which in my mind have not been digitally perfected, it is impossible to do so until these errors are corrected. This is definitely not a remastered series to be proud of, CBS Digital did not go frameby frame to eliminate errors and correct the original negatives that showed them to improve the series quality. So why didn't they?<br /><br />If you want to purchase the remastered series to start your Star Trek collection to see what has been added and or fixed (if anything), please do so with my blessing, (but be warned) and or if you are a sci-fi buff like me, or a Star Trek fan/collector, it would be wise to get the un-remastered series as well, which is exactly what I have done-yes I know the un-remastered series will have all the mistakes/dirt/uncleaned negatives, but that's ok because I know all that, but this remastered series should have remedied all of this-right? Instead it is such a mess, I could almost cry, the Holy Grail that is Star Trek has been desecrated and one of its followers/believers is not happy.<br /><br />Mike and his visual effects team have done a great job, but it is not excellent, there are still flaws and CBS Digital missed a lot, the ones I mentioned are just what I spotted in the series-maybe there's more that I missed? If this is supposed to a remastered series, then the job isn't finished yet, Mike and the boys have shown great talent, but they also have shown great unprofessional talent and laziness to cut corners and be paid for their sloppy services and expertise, so get back to the so-called drawing board and fix the mistakes. If you are going to do the job, do it properly, or don't do it at all.<br /><br />Remember this review is not what CBS Digital has done right to improve the series, it is to show what CBS Digital has not done right to make it better.<br /><br />Special thanks to Wikipedia for additional information and research for this review.<br /><br />Live Long...and Prosper. (Well for some of us anyway)in later, before the Tholian ship is fired upon.    On the first and second Bridge viewscreen scene showing the Tholian commander, we have a very small black dot at the bottom middle of this shot.    In another scene with the Tholian commander, a couple of very small black dots, one at the top and bottom of the Bridge viewscreen.    While Spock and McCoy watch Kirk's message on the intercom, on a close-up shot of Kirk, just to the right of the intercom on its rim, there is a black smudge; this happens again later in a scene when Spock is talking to Scott about the next interphase.    In one of the final scenes, on the Bridge viewscreen showing Kirk, there is a small black dot at the top right of this shot.    7] Wink of an Eye - In the opening teaser as McCoy watches Compton disappear, we see for ½ a second very small black dots accompanying this effect.    When Deela and Kirk first meet on the Bridge, they have a scene near the turbo-lift; the red alert light that is flashing has a small white dot near it.    When Spock looks at his station's viewer at Compton's disappearance, there are a few black dots scattered around the close-up scene of the viewer.    Again when Spock is watching his viewer of the Scalosian message speeding up, there is again very small black dots in a close-up scene of the viewer, this continues again as Spock watches his viewer.    8] The Empath - In the opening teaser, Kirk, Spock and McCoy are watching a recording of the scientists via the intercom viewer, thus there is a black dot at the upper right of the close-up scene and also we have the same dark smudge, I reported on previous episodes. Looks like the same intercom shot/still was used for close-ups.     Also as we watch the intercom viewer, while we notice Ozaba covering his ears, because of the weird sound, you can see a vertical thin dark line above him before he disappears.    9] Whom Gods Destroy - As Spock/Garth stuns the Tellarite in the corridor to help him and Kirk escape, there is a white dot on the red/orange door to the left as Spock/Garth fires his phaser.    10] Let That Be Your Last Battlefield - When Kirk is informed by Chekov of an alien ship being detected; we see the Bridge viewscreen close-up with various black dots around the Bridge viewscreen, this happens five times within the whole Bridge scene.    As Kirk talks Lokai on the Bridge after his fight with Bele on close-up of Lokai just to the left near the red alert light on the wall for ½ a second there is a white dot.    On the Bridge viewscreen on the first close-up of the planet Cheron again there are various black dots around this shot; this happens again in a later scene.    A Bridge scene close-up shot of Lokai and Bele standing beside each other, there is a black dot showing on Lokai's chest. (How CBS Digital could have missed a so obvious dirt mark is beyond me)    Again in another close-up shot of the planet Cheron on the Bridge viewscreen, we see various small black dots around this scene.    11] The Mark of Gideon - In the opening teaser as Spock beams down Kirk, as the beaming takes place, just to the left of the shot parallel to Kirk's waist, is a black dot and a thin black hair-line mark.    As Kirk is on the Bridge alone, he looks at the Bridge viewscreen, and sees the planet Gideon, in this shot like so many others there are various black dots accompanying this scene, which happens twice.    As Spock talks to Hodin via the Bridge viewscreen, in close-up there are a couple of black dots scattered around this scene, which happens five times.    In a Bridge viewscreen close-up shot, as Krodak dematerialises, again there are black dots scattered around this shot.    In the next Bridge viewscreen close-up of Hodin, there are black dots scattered around this scene which happens twice.    Bridge scene with Kirk and Odona in close-up, when they are facing each other, there is a white dot in the middle top of this shot for ½ a second.    The second and third sceneclose-up of the Bridge viewscreen showing many green faces, there are scattered black dots around these shots.    As Spock talks to Admiral Fitzgerald on the Bridge viewscreen, we see quite a few black dots scattered around this shot, this scene happens at least nine times while Spock is talking to the Admiral and is one of the worst unclean series of scenes I've seen that has not been fixed up.    As Kirk, Spock and Odona beam up to the Enterprise, you can just see some black markings on Kirk's face.    As Odona talks to Kirk in the sick bay, there is a close-up shot of her and just to the left-you have to be quick, a small light blue mark can be seen on the wall for ½ a second in the background    12] The Lights of Zetar - In a Bridge viewscreen scene in close-up of the aft view of the space entity following the Enterprise, below this scene we see a couple of small black dots; also in the next same scene situation, there is a small black dot on the left and top of this shot.    And again in the following same scene, a couple of black dots in the lower left corner of this shot, this happens about four times.    Semi-Bridge viewscreen scene showing the alien entity with Sulu's back to us, as he reports on the alien, for ½ a second near the top of the scene there is a white dot.    Looks like we have our favourite intercom shot with the black smudge on the right grey border/rim, as we see Mira floating in the de-COM pressure chamber, this happens three times.      13] Requiem for Methuselah - When Kirk, Spock and McCoy beam down on Mr. Flint's planet, they are attacked by M4, a close-up of M4, there is a small black dot on the top right of this scene.    When Kirk looks at the miniature Enterprise, the scene in close-up as Kirk's face is on the Bridge viewscreen, thus in the Bridge scene there are various black dots around this shot which happens three times.    14] The Savage Curtain - In the opening teaser, in close-up of the Bridge viewscreen when Lincoln firstappears, there are a few scattered black dots at the top of this scene.     Best personal visual effects in Season Three:     1] In the episode `Requiem for Methuselah' we have a shot of Mr. Flint's unique residence with the two moons in the background; brilliant architecture!     2] In the episode `The Way to Eden' when Kirk, Spock, McCoy and Chekov beam down to the planet Eden, a short panoramic scene of Eden is shown; a beautiful shot indeed.    3] In the episode `The Cloud Minders' brief shots in close-up of the city of Stratos are well done.    From the above as you can see there are a lot of scenes/shots (Bridge viewscreen shots/scenes especially) that need to be cleaned/touched up (a lot of dirty black dots/marks from the negatives) to make this a remastered series whole, so why didn't CBS Digital do so? (No, I don't want to hear that they couldn't and that they didn't have the technology to fix it, could it be they weren't paid enough?) You got me, perhaps we should ask them, then again perhaps they are too embarrassed to admit they stuffed it up, So any mistakes it's unbelievable, I can't understand why they didn't do a proper job-can you? Why are there so many scenes/frames not touched up and/or fixed? We do have the technology to repair/patch up these age old defects-so why wasn't it done?     Also especially in season two/three including the opening credit sequence and in other shots I noticed when there is a close-up of the CGI Enterprise orbiting a planet its movement across the scene has a slight stop-start effect, doubtless a CGI glitch-which shouldn't be-am I right? Or it may be my DVD operating system? Now that I notice, it's so distracting, annoying and such a nuisance. No smooth glide across the screen-how come?    Another thing I noticed which I don't like is when we see the aft view through the Bridge's viewscreen, (especially in the first season and occasionally in the second/third season) when the Enterprise moves away from a planet for example, we see the ship's two nacelles, I find this distracting, and really not essential as we can see clearly the Enterprise moving away from the planet and or object (for example the planet getting smaller, the fans and the viewers are not that dum-are they?).    A Major Remastered Blunder:    Well I don't believe it, but the remastered series has a major flaw/blunder, it's so obvious, I don't know how CBS Digital could have missed it, it is so unforgivable I am ashamed even to mention it; and it is in all the episodes, in all the three seasons. The pain of it all, but having redone the Star Trek episodes as a whole, one part has been neglected, which should have been remastered also, why it wasn't is a mystery.     The blunder-the end episode credit sequence, with the credits not withstanding, it is the background stills that have NOT been replaced with remastered stills, and this is even more evident with shots of the Un-CGI Enterprise. If one is going to redo and do justice to a cult sci-fi show, you need to do it all the way from the beginning to the end and not just redo two thirds of the episode. It is annoying to watch a remastered episode and to have it ruined by an un-remastered end credit sequence. CBS Digital have done justice to the beginning of the show, but have done nothing at its end-WHY? Perhaps CBS Digital didn't because they thought that no one would bother with watching the end credits, and so they could neglect that part of the episode and no one would notice-well I certainly did, and it's bad.    This neglect of the end credit sequence is totally unprofessional if you ask me, watching the extras on the DVD's CBS Digital came across with pride in redoing the show and its episodes, am I missing something? I would even accept remastered close-to-different still shots, just to make a distinction between the original and remastered series-that would work-but CBS Digital obviously didn't have the brains to even think about that.    Another thing thatshould have been added to this DVD set are booklets on the episodes, the title, a still shot, a description of the story, the guest stars and what was done to the remastered episode; this in itself would be a great addition to the DVDs instead of having those plastic inserts on the cheap. That's one thing missing with DVD movies and TV series as a whole, no decent booklet with your purchase.    A final word:    Hey don't get me wrong, I like Star Trek, it's one of my favourite shows, I like watching the episodes, with Kirk and company and their adventures in space, its great fun; I think its science fiction at its best, so no complaints there.

Instead it is such a mess, I could almost cry, the Holy Grail that is Star Trek has been desecrated and one of its followers/believers is not happy.     Mike and his visual effects team have done a great job, but it is not excellent, there are still flaws and CBSDigital missed a lot, the ones I mentioned are just what I spotted in the series-maybe there's more that I missed?

B001NLKT60|3.0|I tried the free sample and the book sounded interesting.  It was clear, however, that it would benefit by reading the previous book.  So, I downloaded that and read and enjoyed it.<br /><br />Then, bought the kindle version of this one.  It's not as good, but a decent read anyway.  My problem is when I got in the car this morning I was looking forward to continuing the book by having it read to me.  Unfortunately I discovered that text-to-speech isn't activated for this book.<br /><br />VERY irritating.  This is not a good trend for Kindle books and one that I would think Amazon would not want to encourage.  I for one would have thought twice about buying both of these books if I'd known that (I assume) the publisher insisted on deactivating the text-to-speech function.<br /><br />But I didn't know that until I'd already purchased and downloaded the book.<br /><br />Amazon should let customers know when text-to-speech won't work on a given book.  First, as a duty to their customers.  Second, so that perhaps weaker sales of those books will prompt publishers to stop this silly practice.  NOBODY would ever decline to buy an audio book because of the Kindle's text-to-speech function.  Kindle owners are READERS.  They buy books to read, not to listen to.  The text-to-speech is a convenience and an addition to the READING experience.
0765360969|5.0|Mistborn is part Epic Fantasy and part Superhero Origin Story.  Taking place in a unique world, Mistborn delivers action, adventure, and drama.     Plot:  An omnipotent lord rules the land with brutality and terror.  Armed soldiers take joy in beating a helpless population into submission.  Magic wielding Inquisitors strike fear into their hearts through torture and death.  Wealthy aristocratic houses attempt to outmaneuver each other politically and economically.  The Skaa, a once proud race, have been conquered, enslaved, and worked to death in slums, plantations, and mines.  But hope lies in the mists as rebels plan a revolution.      World:  Brandon Sanderson does an excellent job creating and building an exciting new Fantasy World complete with its own magic system based on consuming metals.  In the day, ash falls from blood red skies.  At night, the land is engulfed in darkness and mist.  Mistwraiths haunt the lands at night, and the Inquisitors roam the city streets in the day.  Those who are Mistborne use a magic system called Allomancy and consuming types of metal gives them powers.  Pewter enhances physical abilities, Tin enhances perception, Steel pushes metals with tremendous force...  Imagine a coin going right through someone's head.  This book is worth reading based on the unique universe and magic system alone.  The book also features a useful glossary at the end that explains the types of mages and magic.    Characters:  The main character is a street urchin named Vin.  She's likeable, clever, and tough.  For the most part, the characters are well written.  There are some that could use more screen time and the dialogue could have been a bit better at times.  But overall, they're good.      Action:  This book contains some very unique action scenes that may be described as a cross between The Matrix and The X-Men set in a fantasy universe.  There are some fairly long breaks in the action, but when there is action, it's great.    Balls:  This book has Balls; the expensive, fancy dress, snooty, dancing kind.  This is where the political aristocratic house warfare takes place.  These chapters could be annoying for angsty fantasy fans that want pure action.  These scenes slow the pacing of the book just a bit.  But if you're mature enough to enjoy a glass of wine, you'll like these scenes.  To the angsty action fans (like me), they're not so bad and trust me; you'll really want to get to the end of this book!    Overall:  This is a refreshingly original fantasy adventure with action, subterfuge, and magic.  I'd give it a 4.5 outta 5!    If you like fantasy books that have world building, originality, action, and BALLS pick this one up!  You'll enjoy it!    If you want traditional fantasy with elves, dragons, castles, knights on a quest, or you aren't a fan of balls, then you can avoid this one.    (But you'd still probably enjoy it, if you gave it a shot.)
0307266303|5.0|An amazing story. Once I started this book I couldn't put it down. This book has it all from inspirational stories about super athletes to the detailed science behind the evolution of running. Every runner should read this book, it will make you a better runner.
0307460444|5.0|I bought this book awhile back - and loved the pictures and creative ideas. I never made anything from it for several months.  Once I finally decided to start my cupcake blog - I decided to bake my way through Martha's Cupcake cookbook - won't you join me? [...]    I started with the chocolate chip cupcake and found that it baked up really nicely.  But the taste is nothing special - and that's OK as sometimes we just want ordinary cupcakes to add some fun into an ordinary day.  The chocolate frosting is another story - I love this frosting!  It tastes like a chocolate truffle and I can see that it will be a very versatile frosting.     I also made the chocolate chip frosting that Martha features with this cupcake on her webpage.  I personally didn't care for it as it is too similar to the cupcake itself.  The base frosting (vanilla butter cream) is very good - I just didn't like the texture of the added chocolate chips.     Have you made this cupcake?  (page 22 in the book) - please comment on  [...]
B00133KFGW|5.0|After renting this film I just had to own it...it's pure magic and I've watched it over and over numerous times now.  I don't care that the story is quite like a fairytale...in many ways it is near believable.  I'm sure my lifelong love of music is a factor in the enchantment I sense about the story, and it's nice to see Jonathan Rhys Meyers with his clothes on for a change....
0385340575|4.0|I listened to all the Reacher books from the first one. Some were better than others.<br />Reacher was a good character and I liked Gone Tomorrow pretty well but I think Reacher needs to die.<br />Die in a sad and respectful way. He's just too much of a loner to always pull a bunch of old influential friends in high places to help him slay the bad guys or give him inside information. The amount of years that he's been drifting and living on the streets have to take a toll on his body. So it's unlikely that as old as he is and hard living that he could perform the feats he does.<br /> Reacher's looking like a pan handler and washing up to a respectable hot lay is more than I can wrap my mind around. Sure some old guys that keep in shape, eat well, and at least do some range practice might pull off some of the things Reacher does but it wouldn't be easy.<br />  So although most the Reacher books are pretty fun to listen too, Reacher is just getting to old and needs to die. In some spectacular way. I felt the same way in the last few books and I think unlike the other reviewer said, I think Reacher is older than in his 40's. I'm sorry that Lee Child didn't have him aging at a shorter pace from the beginning. He was to the best of my memory already near or in his early 30's in the first books. He needs to quit lusting after young women he's bordering on being a pervert with the age differences.<br />  I gave 4 stars because Dick Hill is an awesome narrator who has a wonderful voice. Dick Hill gives a lot of body and shape to the character. Also because the book moves at a good steady pace and has a lot of variety and action. Because of Dick Hills great narrating I can forget how old Reacher is. I doubt I'll listen to the next book that comes out unless it's killing him off. I hope Lee Child will start another different series to enjoy.
0452289963|1.0|I have never been so disappointed over a book!  Oprah is sick!  Pure rubbish!
0061780308|5.0|This was a great book!  Unusual, in that the narrator is a dog.  The author has wonderful insights into dogs and people; this was so well-written.  It has a good story-line, but it's made all the more interesting & enjoyable from the dog's perspective.  I highly recommend this book.
B0026RHR6K|4.0|I had only seen a few episodes before i bought the complete series, but now i wish that i had bought the series separately. This is because the packaging is very poor, and is already beginning to fall apart. Also, there is no guide to what episode is on which disc. The box set looks nice, but it is worth the extra bucks to buy the seasons separately.
0307387178|5.0|I thought Krakauer's writing was very good. A great read. As for McCandless, I spent the entire book unable to get a handle on his way of thinking. We can't expect to be uplifted every time we pick up a novel and we can't expect to understand every message. If nothing else,the book shows a human being on the run...away from a life that had boundaries...away from relationships. Most of us are running toward a relationship. I'm torn between reading fiction and non fiction novels. We know were McCandless is headed, but what we don't know is why he took such a path? We know the ending...there is no sequel. An author who writes fiction will leave you wondering what happened to the hero...after the final pages are turned. As for Krakauer, he had no choice. We, as readers, are left with a sadness. Krakauer did his job...and maybe, if nothing else, McCandless did his as well.
B001PA0FFO|1.0|Man, Miramax can get a ham sandwich nominated for an academy award. This movie is awful. Philip Seymour Hoffman basically sleep walks through this movie. I love the comments from the people who love this movie. They feel the need to attack anyone who gives it less than 4 stars by saying it was a smart movie, and we (the haters) just need to go back to dumb action movies. How pretentious.   In order to enjoy a character driven movie you must emotionally invest in at least one of the characters.  Since we never find out if the priest is a pedophile then how can we care about him.  The head nun is an absolute witch that we can not help hating. But what if she is correct? We never find out.  The boy's mother basically says that since her son is gay (he's 12) then it is ok for him to be molested by a priest because the alternative was beatings from his father. Um, I would rather take the beatings thank you. So you hate the mother too.  The boy's teacher is just so ineffectual and useless, and we never see enough of the boy to make our own judgment about him. My understanding is that in the original play you never see the boy or any of the children. I guess the writers did  not do a good enough job of adding in those missing characters.  So that is all the characters. Tell me if you feel like investing 2 hours in any of them.  Ah Miramax you got me again.   Time for a ham sandwich.
141694737X|4.0|My 14 month old son loves looking at this book and having me read it to him. We haven't had it more than a month, so I can't speak to the sturdiness of the flaps (evidently an issue for some), but they are not paper thin. They are of decent stock. I think, though, that like with anything that gets used regularly, you're going to see some wear and tear over time.    I agree with others who say they wish the names of the animals were printed on their respective pages. Seems like an obvious thing to do. The other thing that kind of bothers me with the book is that it starts off rhyming with the elephant and giraffe (not a perfect rhyme with the giraffe but good enough), perhaps not intentionally, and then it reverts into regular text . I don't think every book for babies/young toddlers needs to rhyme, but it seems like the narrative would be even more entertaining if it consistently rhymed.
0307266303|5.0|Born To Run is the most entertaining book about running I've ever read.  This book motivates me to get into shape and stay that way.  I love the way Christopher McDougall writes.  He writes so descriptively about running up and down hills and over rocks in the Copper Canyons of Mexico. I could picture myself running beside him.  McDougall changes from an often injured runner into a well conditioned athlete.  His dedication to improve himself is one of most interesting things about the book.  The Tarahumara are fascinating people.  They survive on drinking corn beer and eating corn gruel and vegetables. Despite their diet, they are amazing athletes who can run like the wind. Running is a competitive sport, but it is an activity that brings people together in this book, and I love that.<br /><br />McDougall spends a lot of time talking about things like the physiology of what makes human beings good runners.  He also talks about the myth of wearing new shoes.  These are interesting subjects and a fascinating book about running.
B000002LGQ|5.0|Ah, this album reminds me of high school. It also reminded me of the fact that Madonna and Sean Penn were once married. This album is so good, and it has some juicy little insights into their tumultuous marriage. A must have.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I am someone who normally hates musicals and is not very fond of love stories, so to my surprise I loved this movie. Anyone that likes the Beatles and was around during the 60's will love this movie. This is a movie you can watch over and over again.
1416914285|4.0|Geeze, a lot of bad blood for this book down there. I personally like to keep an open mind, enjoy things for what they are and not be too critical(especially with a teen fic book), after all we're all human, we are all different,and I'm sure when you're through with this review you'll realize none of us are perfect.   I have to admit at first I found it to be a little slow at start, that first chapter seemed to droan on. Or maybe I just wasn't that interested but suddenly I found myself emersed in this book, not wanting to EVER put it down. It was almost painful when I did have to pull myself away.   Admitably, it is a bit frustraiting (not much is explained right out you just have to find out as Clary does)but it pulls you in. It overflows with sarcastic humor and romantic tension.  I'm a fan, and I would recommend at least trying it out.
1423332865|4.0|Loving Frank by Nancy Horan is a work of fiction. The author is a former journalist, who resides in Oak Park, Illinois, which is home to the largest collection of Frank Lloyd Wright architecture. This ambitious debut novel is the result of seven years of research.<br /><br />In the early 1900's Frank Lloyd Wright and Mamah Borthwick Cheny began a clandestine love affair. The two met when Mamah and her husband Edwin, commissioned Wright to design a new home for the two of them.<br /><br />Mamah, who could be described as an intellectual feminist, followed her heart, and left her husband and children to be with Wright, the man she loved. Mamah's unmarried sister moved in to care for her sister's two children.<br /><br />Wright, married and the father of six children himself, had a wife who refused to give him a divorce.<br /><br />Their scandalous relationship, something which would seem almost commonplace by today's standards, shocked Chicago.<br /><br />A fascinating historical account of these individuals, and their relationship that ended in disaster. The beautiful details of architectural designs will leave an imprint in your mind. The ending left me speechless. ( I had not read any details about this book beforehand). The audio book was great, but this is another one of those books that I might have preferred reading the printed edition a bit more. This book left me curious to know exactly what was fact and what was fiction. I plan to read a bit more to satisfy my curiosity. RECOMMENDED
B00005J6SZ|5.0|This is probably my favorite Madonna album. It is a classic. It is everything great about Madonna, the 80's and pop music rolled into one great album.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Excellent!  A captivating film that keeps you glued to your seat.  After viewing a segment on TV, I quickly purchased my own copy and am glad I did.  You won't be disappointed.
B000V6I7WG|5.0|Oldboy is in my opinion one of the greatest thrillers ever made in any country, and is a must have for any collection.
B001NESPHC|5.0|Love this cd...my first from this artist.  She has a unique quality--jazzy yet smooth.  Her voice tells a story with each song.
B00005J6T0|5.0|And after recently hearing 'Holiday' (that song is not on this album) on the radio decided that I needed to purchase all my old Madonna that I owned in either record or cassette tape form in cd form. So glad I did. I forgot how totally awesome this album was. The whole album! If you love Madonna or just love 80's pop you should purcase True Blue.
B001FB55H6|5.0|Quite simply, this is one of the greatest films i have ever seen. Rorsache was acted with a tremendous performance and the comedian had a great love/hate feeling going on.<br /><br />The action scenes were filmed beautifully and the soundtrack was perhaps the greatest part of the movie. Every song fit its scene to the T.<br /><br />The Watchmen kept me enthralled from the 1st minute to the 180th. It is easily one of my favorite films of all time. The only things i could fault were the gratuitious sex scene and Dr Manhattans third leg being shown a little too much for my liking...<br /><br />A must see film in every sense of the word.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|If you only buy one Michael Jackson CD to remember him by, make it this one, it has all his hits, even from his time in the Jackson 5
B0002YCVXI|5.0|Fell in love with the music of Morricone when I saw Cinema Paradiso and The Mission.  After checking him out, realized he was the man behind a lot of my other favorite movie music.  YoYoMa provides inspiring versions of the compositions.  Not only is he a gifted musician but working hand in hand with the composer provides beautiful interpretations of the music.
B0000025RI|5.0|I absolutely love this record and I think the folks who are giving this album a crappy one star is obviously envious or just didn't flat out like Michael Jackson.  The Man and The Music is two different things, do not drag them together.  Anyhow, every song on this album is top notch, you can't dispute with that.  From Wanna Be Startin' Something to Beat it to Baby Be Mine, every one is pure gold.    Buy and I promise you you will not feel rueful not all.  Every time I listen to this record it conveys a gleeful feeling and it will never be outdated.  Uncongruous to most crappy pop songs today it will last for eternity.    Michael Jackson is truly the King of Pop, Justin Timberlake, Chris Brown, Usher, etc. are only the posers.
0091922348|4.0|This cookbook is amazing with fresh ideas for healthy (mostly) and delicious food.  My only issue (not a complaint) is that some of the ingredients may be difficult to track down for American cooks.  I live in Chicago and still do not have access to all of the ingredients listed in the book.  Everything I have made has been delicious- the recipes are straightforward and the pictures are lovely.
6304401132|4.0|This is a very low priced item, so I an't really complain. The VHS cassette is watchable (a little bit wavy at the top). But overall it is ok. The movie is very good.
B00005QGAV|5.0|I absolutely adore and love this album.  The songs just never gets old.    My favourite song is ultimately Dangerous, i just fell in LOVE with the lyrics.  How it flow and theverses he spoke were truly mesmerizing.
0060191325|1.0|I was very interested in reading at least a few of reviews on this book when I saw something on the National Geography about people predicting of what is to be in the future or tomorrow. How does this relate to my research? I do not know. Before reading on the reviews, I already knew that I would not agree to the book and finding myself agreeing to the writers. Both men and women cannot be from two different planets. Why, they both live on the same planet called Earth. As far as from my understanding about the book, stereotyping or judging the other opposite sex, is completely out of hand. As a woman, I am not going to expect to read my partners behavior because Gray says so, and get a complete understanding from it. It is all about communicating! And this is where most couples in marriages fail due to the lack of communication. If there is no communication between a couple and decides to split, they do not have God in their lives. They may think they are happy. In the long run, they are not. If a rich man thinks he has everything to make himself happy without a woman...think again!    I was in a boy friend/girl friend relationship before my friend and I decided to be good friends. I have asked my friend this before. I wondered why he did not talk to me while we walked side-by-side after going to church. Sure I got offended. I started thinking of all the possibilities, even though none of it fit his attitude. When I asked him about it, he told me he did not feel like talking, that's all. It is nice to enjoy silence sometimes when you are with your partner. I have my experiences as a couple with my best friend. We are both in the same planet because we communicated, we understood each other. In order to achieve that was to be open-minded. If you feel that your partner is offending you, you have to let them know. You cannot expect for them to read your heart through your eyes or your actions. You can keep slamming doors or the drawer cabinet door, but it still does not say that I am angry with you. If you two are made for each other, your thinking capacity is mostly, almost 100% similar. The rest of it, you two will have to work it out. It means to communicate. What is the point of being married if you two cannot communicate?    The author must have had his experiences and research in order to write a book, such as this. To tell you all readers the truth, there is only one reason why we are made. If you are without God's love and understanding, you do not know why you are here. And I would not recommend this book to anyone to read just for someone to predict the kind of woman I am. I already know who I am, and whatever the author mentions in the book may all not be true about me. Believe me, I have male friends who wants to understand women. When they come asking me, I tell them, \\"you are asking the wrong person.\\" A friend of mine emailed me some statements about how women are and men are. Ridiculous! Out of the 10 statements about women were not even true about me, except one or two that was easy to to communicate with my partner. If my \\"No\\" meant \\"Yes,\\" then I need to be honest and make the \\"Yes\\" mean \\"Yes, I want you to stay with me.\\" I have had my experiences, too, but all those are completely different than what I am today. Everything I am today is through God's grace. Yes, I used to enjoy club dancing with tube tops. Yes, I used to enjoy showing off my legs. Yes, I used to judge people constantly. Yes, I wanted to be a Psychologist. Yes, I used to lure men by showing off my naval. Is that all me today? I don't think so! I was not perfect in my life until I knew God. If I look at a man next door today and smile at him, it does not mean I like him in such a way or I want him. It is called being nice to your neighbors. It is a sin when you look at someone with lust.    Aah, forget it! If my reader does not understand my view, it's okay. If my reader do understand, it is even better. I cannot expect for everyone to understand,when we all understand differently because of free will.
B000AY74OQ|5.0|I am very satisfied with this purchase. The VHS cassette is of very good quality.
B000002MUQ|4.0|I can't understand why this CD is out of print.  It is the last Hagar one (before the Gary Cherone debacle) and it is pretty good.  It is one of their more mature efforts, but has plenty of hard rocking tunes (\\"Amsterdam\\") to appeal to a more seasoned fan base.  I absolutely love \\"Baluchitherium\\" and would chose it over \\"Eruption\\" any day of the week when it comes to Van Halen instrumentals.  Overall, \\"Balance\\" is a strong effort from the Hagar era of Van Halen.  It is comforting to know that they went out on a high note.
B000B8IA2G|5.0|I haven't had time yet to watch it, but know I will not be disappointed, I loved the series, in fact it's on TV now and I watch it always. They had a great group. When I get my bills taken care of, I plan on asking for all the series. But not right know.  Thanks for putting this series on for us who love these programs so we can see them when ever we want, instead of waiting until our TV stations decide to run them.  Thanks Verna
B001993Y2C|3.0|This is a GREAT series - perhaps my alltime favorite TV series - and it is nice to have it all in one place.  There are two problems however.  First, the grainy look to the series makes differences between the DVDs (which I also own) and these new Blurays fairly small.  It is really only on the outdoor shots, or on a really big screen that the Blurays distinguish themselves (delete one star). Second, and more significantly, the packaging is terrible (delete another star).  Not sure who thought it was a good idea to include a telescoping box that doesn't fit on most shelves: IT'S NOT!  Further, and this strains credibility, nowhere in the set is there any indication of which episodes are on which discs - beyond deliniating the different seasons. Without disc contents, finding a particular episode with current bluray player load speeds is tedious.  Sure, you can print out your own 'cue cards', but on a $200 set the ommission is significant.
0141182504|5.0|Alexander Pope's translation (c. 1720) of the Iliad.  Now there's a preposterously highblown translation that many would think needed to be redone for the modern age.<br /><br />But Stuart Gilbert's masterful translation of \\"L'etranger\\" from 1946 is for me perfect and, heck, still easily available.  There was nothing that needed to be reworked about that:  pace Laredo and Ward, it's still fresh and relevant.<br /><br />Further, Gilbert's rendering has the kind of spare grace that conveys the flavor of the original much better than Joseph Laredo's, arguably conveying, by means of its overall icy tone, Mersault's remote demeanor much more convincingly.  The final phrase, \\"greet me with howls of execration\\" is much more chillingly rendered there than here, in Laredo's pedestrian and forgettable \\"greet me with cries of hatred.\\"
0061689246|3.0|I loved The Graveyard Book so I was a little surprised at this one. Not that it's not good writing, it is! But the sex scenes were graphic and took me by surprise. It's listed as a 'teen' novel but when I donated my copy to the library (I buy and then donate- no more shelf space!) they put it in the adult section. My nine year old kept trying to pick it up and read it and I'm glad I read it first! Without the sex, it woud have been a perfectly good novel for kids, but Gaiman rasied the bar with those two paragraphs. :O
B00127RAJY|5.0|I used this DVD the first time today so I can't speak to results but I really like it.  The moves are basic which I like, because I have used workouts that just make me feel silly.  I really like doing the circuits.  I felt sore after doing the level one workout, but I didn't feel like I was going to die after 20 minutes which, to me, is the perfect work level.  Overall I am very satisfied!
0061122416|4.0|As I read the young shepherd search for his Personal Legend I found myself deeply moved by the story. It is hard not to get caught up in this simple story with personal emotion. This is a creative work of art about finding and fulfilling your dreams. I'll definitely be recommending it to friends.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Honestly, this is the best work out video I have ever purchased!  All the levels are under 30 minutes, which make it easy to do when you don't have a lot of time.  Don't let the fact that it is under 30 minutes fool you though, Jillian will kick you butt.....seriously!!!  Buy this dvd now!
B0001XAPX8|1.0|Coleman Silk (Anthony Hopkins) is a highly respected college dean and professor.  After one innocent remark is misinterpreted as a racist comment, he is forced to quit his job in disgrace.  Coleman begins a strange affair with an aimless woman (Nicole Kidman) half his age, who has had a tragic past and isn't ready to return his love.<br /><br />For me, this strange little movie was doomed from the start, when the big finish is shown right away.  The rest of the story is shown in choppy, anti-climactic flashbacks (often out of order) which didn't allow for any build-up in tension or sympathy for the main character, Coleman.  As a young man from New Jersey, he's played by Wentworth Miller who is quite charismatic and likeable, but looked and sounded nothing like the Welsh-accented adult Coleman (who sometimes appeared to channel a leering Hannibal Lector).  Hopkins is so horribly miscast in this role that it's impossible to buy the racially-charged plot.  Kidman was also completely wrong for this movie; her innate grace and elegance couldn't be hidden by a messy hairdo and I never bought her as an illiterate custodian.  Her graphic love scenes with Hopkins were more creepy than romantic.<br /><br />There is so much personal tragedy among the main characters  - including Gary Sinise who plays a troubled writer and Ed Harris as a crazed Vietnam vet - and yet the movie misfires completely and I felt no connection with them or the whole premise of injustice.  Afterward, I was left shaking my head at this surprising mess of a movie and just amazed that so much talent couldn't save it.
B0029358GM|5.0|This cd is very good. Being a Wilco fan, hard to be very  critical of their work. Another good one to invest in.
015206396X|5.0|I bought this book after reading and falling in love with The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, with all of the critics saying I would love it. Well, I did. It was a compelling story and the romance is great! I am an English teacher, and I have read many many books. This one is among my top 10. It took me away to another world and I COULDN'T put it down. I read it in two days. If you love romance, adventure, and fantasy, then this is the perfect book for you. Read it, you will not be disappointed! I was hoping for a sequel, but I as I understand it, the prequel, Fire, is coming out in October.
0123694965|5.0|This is definately a book to buy if you are at all interested in game design.  The lenses are cool... its always exciting seeing the next one.  They will all help you in designing games.  It takes points from all aspects of life and brings it into designing games.
B000SX6LHU|4.0|It's a rare song. They play it less often then they play Creep. The album is too short for a  live album. Considering that they usually play for over 2 hours. At the time of this review the album is $5.00 on the mp3 store. Very good deal.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite cds. It's such beautiful music I can just listen to it driving in the car and it will make me cry if I let it...very moving and sad for the most part.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|A wonderful series albiet occasionally a little \\"roudy\\".   Developes a realistic world or if you will a future conspiratorial universe that has great scenes and even better characters.   The cast and director really hit the mark with this one, and I would sure like to see more by way of Movies and even another series.
B000KDFCI2|5.0|Not only is this an excellent story, but the reader, Michael Beck, does an amazing job of bringing this sleepy southern town to life.  It is well worth the price as Beck takes you deep into the world Grisham creates.  Listen and become part of the south in the 70's!  You will be amazed as you join the cast of real-world residents of Clanton, Mississippi.  But watch out for Danny Padgitt... or maybe not!
0887306667|4.0|I picked up this book at the recommendation of a friend of mine. He told me that it was absolutely mandatory that I read this book immediately because I am in the process of starting a business. The \\"Laws\\" outlined in The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing, by Al Ries & Jack Trout, are interesting and have a few gems, but the book is definitely outdated. Originally published in 1993, Ries and Trout identify many fledgling companies and predict their ultimate downfall. For instance:    \\"Microsoft is the leader in personal computer operating systems, but it trails the leaders in each of the following major categories: spreadsheets (Lotus is the leader), word processing (WordPerfect is the leader), and business graphics (Harvard Graphics from SPC Software Publishing is the leader).    [...]    There are ominous signs of softness in Microsoft's strategy. The Economist reported in early 1992, \\"Mr. Gates is putting together a range of products, based on a common core of technology, that will compete across virtually the whole of the software industry: from big computers to small ones, and from operating systems in the information engine-room to graphics programs that draw every picture for executives. Nobody in the software industry has yet managed a venture of that complexity - though IBM has tried and failed.\\"    When you try to be all things to all people, you inevitably wind up in trouble. \\"I'd rather be strong somewhere, \\"said one manager, \\"than weak everywhere.\\"    Clearly, Microsoft is now the leader not only in spreadsheets (Microsoft Excel) and word processing (Microsoft Word), but also nearly all facets of the user interface of personal and business computers. Additionally, Microsoft is a significant player in servers, mobile smart phones, search engines, among many others. Google didn't even exist at the time 22 Laws was written, but brand extension has worked remarkably well for Larry Page and Sergey Brin.  (One could argue that Microsoft and Google created theirown categories.  If that is the case, I believe the \\"line extension\\" argument would still be  voided.)    This example identifies a core weakness in the book: it was written before the rise of the internet age. Prior to the internet really taking off, marketing was a completely different animal. It cost a lot of money to market any product. It cost a lot of money to develop and launch a product (take a look at Inc Magazine's feature \\"The Day My Industry Died\\" to see a few examples of how the cost of business has plummeted since the early days of the internet). Lastly, it took a lot of money and time to grow a company. It was difficult to have the explosive growth that was experienced on a large scale late last century and early this decade.
B00005QGAT|5.0|Amazing!!! This cd exemplifies Michael Jackson's unique singing abilities and his exceptional talent as an entertainer.  He is a true \\"Legend\\".
B001FB4VZS|5.0|Hey I just want to say ever since I started watching Smallville season 1 I couldn't stop watching it and after I finished a season I owned I had to buy the others because the seasons always left you hanging with a big climax happening and so it's no doubt that season 8 continues that legacy and even though I was gone when tv viewing of the season was going I had to have it on the video on demand here and it's been a couple months since I finished the season on video on demand and I am waiting like everyone else for season 9 to come out hopefully this fall on tv because this season was phenomenal and I hate waiting for season 9 but as all die hard smallville fans out there we have to wait for the season to come and so I leave you with this. Keep the faith and hold on because the new season will be here before you know it.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|In by opinion this is the best show ever.  The only thing better about season 4 is season 5.  I am anxiously awaiting its release so I can watch it again.

0553582453|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  It was my favorite so far out of both the Farseer Trilogy and the Tawny Man Trilogy (I'm currently reading the 3rd book of the series).    It is just as interesting as the Farseer Trilogy, if not more.  Once again I'm staying up all night and eagerly waiting to get home to pick up the book again.      I think the Tawny Man is a kinder story than the Farseer.  Yes, none of the books are easy, but there is more love and family surrounding Fitz.  He has more friends to lean on and accomplishments to behold.  The author gives him a little more happy endings and even fixes some of the damage inflicted in his youth.    Robin Hobb is undoubtedly my luckiest discovery of the last 5 years.
B000SSPL0I|5.0|I bought this set in a sale. The power of the singing is truly awesome.     Don't bother looking elsewhere until you have heard this gem of a recording. Mario Del Monaco is a powerhouse of a tenor and Tebaldi gives total satisfaction.    The early stereo is very good too!
1584282584|5.0|I was very skeptic on well I would like a book about non-studio flash Photography.  I have read a lot of Joe McNally books and he certainly has mastered the off and on camera flash!  I wasn't quite sure what to expect of this book....    IT ROCKS!  I got it today and I am done with it already.  I couldn't put it down.  Thank goodness I had the time to read it.  Here is what I love about it.....Neil shows you the shot would be typically be shot.  Then, he tweaks the lighting with a flash.....shows you the difference, then makes another change and shows the different yet again.  The examples in this book are AMAZING!  The author knows how to teach and he does it extremely well.    Trust me when I tell you to buy this book and memorize it.  It's actually going in my camera bag as a reference manual now that I marked it all up.    This might be my favorite photography book to date!  Buy it.....you'll love it!
B0009XNUK0|5.0|It has all the songs I love and that MJ made super hits, I would recommend to anyone who loves MJ hits, I have almost worn my out !
B002CAWNEM|4.0|Many of the reviewers here have focused upon the performance of Beyonce Knowles in this updated version of \\"Fatal Attraction.\\"  For my money, her performance certainly shows that she can certainly do more than just sing and dance.  Was she believable?  Yes.  Was her performance in any way embarrassing?  Not in the least.  Should Meryl Streep start to worry about the competition?  No, but then again the role that Beyonce was required to play was one that could have been played effectively by any number of young performers in today's entertainment universe, with the possible exception of Mariah Carey.  Hopefully having her name on the marquee will draw in viewers who otherwise might have missed this exciting psychological thriller.    Fans of \\"The Wire\\" and \\"The Office\\" are already familiar with the talents of Idris Elba.  The twist in this film that makes it different from \\"Fatal Attraction\\" is that Elba's husband character is entirely innocent of any extra-marital activity, unlike Michael Douglas in \\"Fatal Attraction.\\"  Even though the Douglas character did not deserve the troubles that he faced in that earlier film, you always knew that he was responsible for them due to his choice to be unfaithful to his wife.       In this film, to his credit Idris Elba, rejects the advances of the persistent Ali Larter's character on numerous occasions.  Sure, he could have told his wife about the initial advances of the obsessed temp and perhaps saved himself some of the strains to his marriage but such would have done nothing to affect the behavior of the obsessed woman who was not going to give up her quest.  Elba's husband was simply in an impossible situation.  Telling his wife, co-workers, and even the police was not going to get him out of the box that he found himself in.      I found Ali Larter's performance to be even more frightening than Glenn Close's in \\"Fatal Attraction\\" since unlike Close, she exhibited no outward visible manifestations of a mental illness.  A casual observer in the office might have noticed her interest and attraction to the Elba character, but who would have suspected the sort of obsessive behavior that she was capable of once she was outside of the office environment?    Although the film's ultimate conclusion was fairly predictable, it was exciting and satisfying.  If you enjoy films like \\"Fatal Attraction,\\" \\"The Hand That Rocks the Cradle,\\" \\"Basic Instinct\\" and \\"Disclosure,\\" watching this one would be a great way to spend an evening.
B0029XZODY|5.0|First, @ SunWolf - Dexter's girlfriend Rita has been played by the same actress from the beginning (Julie Benz). No swap a-la Becky in Rosanne.    Now to the show... Dexter is an incredible series. The fact that Showtime can put a harder edge on it than network TV could makes a huge difference. The freedom to up the violence, gore, nudity and sex has paid big dividends. HBO and Showtime have quickly become the mecca for anyone looking for quality shows. I believe Dexter leads an exclusive pack that also includes Weeds and True Blood close behind. I hope Dexter makes a long, Soprano-type run. I would love to see this series make it to 8 or 10 years.
B000GFLE86|4.0|This is a very enjoyable CD.  Although Madeleine Peyroux will remind you of Billie Holiday or Norah Jones, she has a sound that is uniquely her own.  I would recommend this to any music lover.
0765356139|4.0|The Final Empire has fragmented into numerous squabbling bandit kingdoms and rebel states. Elend Venture has taken control of the former capital, Luthadel, aided by Vin, a powerful Mistborn, and the other leaders of the rebellion. But Elend's idealistic dreams of a democratic government are sorely tested when two other rulers lay claim to the city and arrive to besiege it.    Meanwhile, the Terris Keeper, Sazed, is worried by reports of the return of a deadly form of the mists that appear at night, and begins an investigation into the prophecies that led to the Lord Ruler gaining power, searching for clues as to the location of the Well of Ascension, the only power in the world that might save it from destruction...    Picking up where The Final Empire left off, The Well of Ascension sees a marked change in pace in the development of the Mistborn series. The first book was a bit of a caper story mixed in with a traditional 'rebelling against the evil ruler' narrative with a great magic system on top. Book 2 now sees the former rebels coping themselves with the pressures of governance. Elend, a rather thin character in the first book, becomes a lot more interesting in this volume as his former idealism clashes with an increasingly cynical outlook brought about by events. There's also a lessening of focus on Vin. Whilst still the central character, Elend and Sazed come much more to the fore in this novel as well. There's also a new Mistborn character, Zane, who enters the story and provides an effective sparring partner for Vin. Sanderson's worldbuilding also comes on a lot in this book, with a logical development of his metal-based magic system.    On the minus side, the change in narrative style means a slackening of the pace. There's a lot of talk and intrigue in this book, although it isn't entirely convincing and leads to a static pace as the various factions are engaged in a stand-off for most of the story, no one side able to move without being defeated by theothers. This makes for a slightly less engaging story than the first book.    However, in the last 200 pages or so Sanderson suddenly turns everything up to 11. All hell breaks loose and as well as featuring major battles there are a series of stunning revelations about the prophecies that our characters have been following so far. The prophecy is a particularly annoying staple of epic fantasy literature but Sanderson's treatment of it at the end of this book is fascinating, making for a great twist ending.    The Well of Ascension (****) takes a while to get going, but decent character development keeps things ticking over until the action and revelation-packed finale. The novel is available now in the USA and will be published on 10 December 2009 by Gollancz in the UK.

B001MS7IBS|1.0|Why not portuguese subtitles in Blu-Ray if it's available in DVD?  In fact, Brazil and USA are in the same Blu-Ray region, which does not occur with the DVD, ergo, it's possible for a brazilian to buy a Blu-Ray in USA, but if a DVD is bought, probably it won´t work.  If portuguese subtitles where included, sales to brazilian customers would florish.    Regarding the series itself, definitely it's THE Best Sci-Fi series since X-Files.    Thanks!
B000BB1MHS|5.0|This is a really good movie to watch over and over again. Johnny Depp is superb and the entire movie was done so creatively.

B00004TH7Z|5.0|If you were old enough to remember when Paul DiAnno sang on Maiden, Bruce was the perfect choice to replace it in the sake of givin' it more projection and an epic measure to the band, then came Blaze 2 steps back for them, but then again, Bruce makes the greatest come back in metal history!! If you want to get swept away by awesome musicianship, great vocals and energy, look no further this CD will revive your love for Maiden, there's no better way to express the quality of this CD, you'll get great sound, a great album cover, a great album theme, I suggest you to get this CD after you get Number of the Beast and Powerslave, is one of the greatest CD ever put together for the come back of one of the greatest vocalist in heavy metal hystory. Highly recommended!!
0307588335|5.0|McDonald really does an astonishing job with this ultimate inside access point of view.  Not only from his perspective, but also the 150 people that McDonald met with, anywhere from the executive committee to the risk committee, who were all at the front lines of this life changing event.  This is what makes it real and exciting.  I'm sure alot of readers can relate to the Ivory Tower (upper management) seperating themselves from reality.  He does a great job making this an easy read for anyone not in the financial sector.  He also give great detail to get a sense of what the trading environment is really like.  It's a great book for anyone to read.

They may be tight for a day or 2, but once they are quickly stretched to fit-they are great!!  The elastic ties make for a perfect fit. The soles are verry grippy on rocks, too-for hiking.  Great Design-folks!
0307236722|5.0|Martha Stewart's Baking Handbook is a wonderful book.  It is full of answers to questions I've always had, like why baking powder instead of baking soda, why a wooden or plastic spoon and not metal...     As usual though, there are some recipes that just don't work.  I am a very epxerienced cook, professional baker, and food lover.  Every book of Martha's that I own (at least 7) has at least a few recipes that just cannot possibly be right. I attempt them several times, following instrudtions to the letter, share them with an experienced friend or two, and they get the same results as I do.  I still love the book, but I'm always prepared for the recipe to not come out correctly.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have never purchased a workout DVD in my life because I prefer the gym atmosphere. However, when I heard how good this one is at toning your body I decided to try it. My sister and I did this video on LEVEL ONE last night and are still finding it difficult to walk/climb stairs. We are even finding it hard to go DOWN stairs. This video seriously kicks your butt and I LOVE it. I was sweating so much afterward that I had felt like I'd been at the gym for 5 hours. My sister said she's never even felt like this after four hours of soccer conditioning. If you want toned FAST...BUY THIS.
0545128285|4.0|If you're like me, you finished reading Deathly Hallows with a feeling of sadness that Harry's story had ended.  The Tales of Beedle the Bard was a great glimpse back into that world. I love the concept that the stories are translated by Hermione with commentary by Dumbledore. I continue to be amazed at how thoroughly Rowling has created another world and culture.   While it's not as good as the original Harry Potter novels anyone who has loved the books will enjoy entering that world once again.

0060837551|4.0|This sweeping saga, told from so many different perspectives, continues to fascinated, intrigue, and captivate after 30+ years. The parallel problems of the successive generations, with their central theme of forbidden love, add layer upon layer of pain to the dysfunctional Cleary family.<br /><br />Despite the endless trials of Meggie, the story's central character, it is Father Ralph that we truly feel for. Meggie is not a likable enough character to really sympathize with, which I feel is the book's main drawback. But overall, this epic novel is wonderfully engaging.<br /><br />Sarah Bruce Kelly<br />Author of THE RED PRIEST'S ANNINA

0452287022|5.0|This on-the-edge, \\"almost a love story\\", is exquisite to me. The intensity of Griet's feelings, despite her apparent calm, is apparent on every page and vividly brought to life for the reader. Just like the painting itself which, so still and calm on the surface, speaks volumes through the ardent eyes and questioning mouth of the \\"girl with the pearl earring,\\" Griet's inner life is revealed to us through the magic of Chevalier's words.<br /><br />That Chevalier could spin such a gripping tale from a single painting is a testimony to the inherent power of art. As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words--in this case, many thousands!<br /><br />Sarah Bruce Kelly<br />Author of THE RED PRIEST'S ANNINA

I have alway loved Loreena  McKennitt's music and if you are a fan, this one is an absolute must to own and I would say a collectors piece.    Absolutely stunning. I have now just purchased a copy for myself as well and my cousin for her birthday.    I am sure you will not be disappointed with any aspect of this wonderful performance and journey.    Enjoy :)
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have worked out at home for some time now- approximately 14 years and still going. That said, I have a nice collection of vhs and dvd or various workouts from various trainers. Jillian Michaels has always been one of my favorites; but this one tops the list! My sister had gotten engaged two years ago. Next thing I knew, as a bridesmaid of course, it was *gulp* two months to the day of the wedding! WHATS A GIRL TO DO!?!? So I purchased this and let me tell you I have not STOPPED doing this workout even though the wedding is far done and over with. Yes there are 'only' three workouts, but for those of you who complain about the lack of variety, well be creative and step it up a notch by adding more weights or doubling up on a workout.<br /><br />The moves at first seemed so simple and basic. BUT I HAVE NEVER WOKEN UP SO SORE IN YEARS. I am a runner and have done high impact kickboxing for sometime and never in my life have I felt so good (or looked so good!). I see definition everywhere--no tanning bed required to 'enhance' the effect! ha ha. Seriously, listen to what she has to say, its just 20 minutes per workout. By the time you get to level 3 (and yes this one does make ya sweat), you will soooo wish you had that water break you thought you did not need.<br /><br />BEST WORKOUT I HAVE EVER PURCHASED PERIOD.

I won't give too many details of the actual book because I don't like it myself when I read a review and they disclose all the details.

159448385X|5.0|This was a good, interesting book, but my 5 rating has more to do with the impact the book had on me than the writing style, etc.  This book centered around 2 women in Afghanistan, before and then after the Taliban took control.  There is a dramatic difference in their lives after the Taliban.  I never realized how really nasty the Taliban were to their own people.  It is also disturbing how they use \\"religion\\" as their excuse for their behavior. This truly makes you appreciate living in a free country.  It also emphasized to me the importance of equal rights for women.  Because when there is any inequality, the balance can quickly shift and women (or anyone) can loose rights they thought they had. It also demonstates that these rights are not a concept but real and the impact of losing them can have on your life.  I have recommended this book to many people.  I truly don't understand why one group of people think they're better than another group and how they get power to oppress anyone that doesn't agree with them, but history has proven it happens.  This book shows the personal effect when tyrants obtain power.  We all need to be aware of how easily our rights and freedom could be lost.
030745536X|4.0|It a good book. However, I liked better the first novel \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" El Juego del Angel pretty much follows the same style even the same characters, but it has a lot more of mystic and fantasy.

Chris Daughtry's vocal's sound even better on this sophmore album more so than the first. This is a little harder rock and going towards the Metal side which is more Daughtry's style than Pop Rock. This is the kind of music they should be doing.      My Favorites Are:     1. No Surprise     2. You Don't Belong     3. September     4. Tennessee Line     5. Ghost Of Me     6.

B001FB55H6|1.0|This movie was by far the worst movie I have ever seen in the theaters.  It is not my cup of tea as it is unlike the other superhero movies that were produced.  There is no plot nor direction and way too much dialogue where sometimes the dialogue was excruciating slow. At times, I did not understand what was going on and I was paying attention.  Also, Dr.  Manhattan has to be one of the worst superheros imagined.  He had all the power to do basically anything he wanted and he ends up killing one of the main characters for no reason.     Can't comment on the Blu-ray because I do not plan on buying this bad movie; I'm sure the video quality and sound are excellent as well as the special features.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|If you loved Firefly, watch this. If you're sarcastic and dark, watch this. If you like singing, watch this. If you have no sense of anything good in the world, don't watch this. This is an incredible piece of quirkiness, starring Nathan Filion...need I say more? Great, absolutely laugh-out-loud, dark, funny, unexpected, musical...I only write reviews for things I love...DR. HORRIBLE, LIVE FOREVER!    Joss Whedon, by the way, is a master. Watch the Firefly miniseries, you'll see what I mean. Quirky, sarcastic, dark, hilarious...his work has it all. Truly unique.
B00000AOUD|4.0|I admit it was creative and considerate for them to make the album cover look like the front page of a newspaper.  They probably figured that's what would draw readers' attention to the themes that the album is centered on.  Just imagining the Society For Literary Advancement disqualifying the boy for reading a controversial poem, because it is considered unwholesome towards life, his God and country signals to readers what this might be about.  The lyrics are extremely difficult to comprehend with countless metaphors and imagery, but I'm still trying my best.  Other than that, the composition is brilliant.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|Yet again, BBC delivers. This was a fantastic adaptation, fresh and spirited. Though Wentworth's hair is mildly unbelievable, I thought it was a beautiful, moving, fresh adaptations of perhaps Jane Austen's most mature work. Highly recommended, ignore others who say it was disappointing, I loved it, and I haven't been able to watch the one with Amanda Root since (even though that one is also excellent). Beautifully filmed and beautifully acted.

0307454541|4.0|\\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" is part traditional detective story and part high-tech hacker suspense.  Mikael Blomkvist, an investigative reporter who plays the part of the traditional middle-aged detective type,  and Lisbeth Salander, a young, antisocial hacker girl who follows in the mold of the latest literary trend towards eccentric detectives, team up to try to solve a traditional murder case and to foil a rich financial gangster at the same time.  I found the murder portion of this book extremely well written and suspenseful.  On the other hand, the financial \\"investigations\\" seemed to lack a lot of suspense that the murder sequence did due to how easily Lisbeth handles them.  It was obvious to me that Larsson spent much of his life reading murder mysteries, and he seemed to take many of the best elements from them in the murder portion on the book, and it was a shame that the financial investigation section of the book felt rushed and unsatisfying, staining an otherwise excellent book.  I didn't find Salander to be a particularly compelling character, and became more and more annoyed as she became more of a prodigy throughout the book.  By the end of it, one is convinced that she could probably take over the entire world if she wanted to.  Blomkvist was a much more likable and believable character, although Larsson seems to spend a great deal of time showing how sexually open and liberated he is by involving him with multiple sexual partners.  Nevertheless, despite these qualms, Larsson has an excellent way with words and at certain points in the story it is very hard to put down the book as the suspense builds.  By putting a deep theme in his book involving men and women and violence, Larsson goes a step above most crime writers out there today.  Overall, \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" was a fulfilling but not perfect read that will entertain even the most discriminating readers out there.

B000002I25|5.0|Before The Doors released their debut album in 1967, rock and roll at that time was starting to sound more and more the same and just \\"typical\\" or run-of-the-mill.

B000P0J09W|5.0|This is an awesome classic! It has been a few years since I've seen it. I saw it on tv today, and decided to refresh my memory. A group of friends called the Goonies face foreclosure on their families' homes. When Mouth, Chunk, and Data visit Mikey and Brandon Walsh on their last day together, and begin to rummage through the attic, and find a treasure map. The group set out to find the treasure and meet a lot of misadventures along the way. I highly recommend that you hang out with THE GOONIES!!!

B0026NWBY2|5.0|Sometimes it seems that George Harrison was a bit of the forgotten Beatle, though of course many fans of the Beatles, or of George, know how much he contributed as a writer and performer.    I am more than a casual fan of the Beatles and George, but far from a \\"die-hard\\" fan like some of my friends are.    I found this record to be a wonderful presentation of the man and his music, including some must have songs such as \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" (one of my favorite Beatle songs with is hauntingly beautiful melody) and \\"My Sweet Lord\\"    The songs all sound great in the remasters, and though some tracks my friends wanted to hear are missing from some of his records, it does not detract from the set as a whole. One of the stand out tracks is \\"When We Was Fab\\" as he looks at his Beatle Days and the thougtful \\"All Things Must Pass\\".  Fortunely with this record, we know George is still around.

B000002UJQ|2.0|Within the album Ok Computer there are two songs titled Airbag and The Tourist.  It is obvious that Radiohead is attempting to spread a message of what their songs are about.  The artwork inside the CD case itself is a meticulous portrayal of their songs, with the two aforementioned songs being the most intricately expressed by the artwork.  In Airbag there seems to be a strong connection between an idea of incarnation and the self-proclaimed Evangelical Christians' concept of being born again -- although this belief of being born again is shared by most, if not all, of those who confess a belief in Christianity; however, the interpretations of how to obtain this are disputed.  In The Tourist, the resounding theme is to \\"slow down.\\"   Pictures of planes, subways, and a picture of Seattle with planes and helicopters hovering over it are expressive of a world that is ever moving and never resting.  These songs, coupled with the artwork, attempt to promote the message of Radiohead by stirring emotions and abstraction.   Airbag repeats the phrase \\"I am born again\\" three times.  It of course brings to mind, at least to anyone raised in or knowledgeable of American culture, the close association of these four words with Christianity.  However, when people who claim to be Christians use this phrase, they typically mean that they have accepted Jesus as their lord and salvation from a second death, but Radiohead is not embracing this idea literally expressed by the words because the song states that he has come back as the matter between the stars (interstellar), a strong force with a knife (jackknifed juggernaut), a neon sign, and finally an entity inside a fast German car.  The Christian principal overtone is confirmed in the artwork of the CD.  There is a statue, perhaps a representation of Jesus, with his hand held out towards a circular object (most likely a representation of some planet) and a young couple dressed up with a baby in their arms looking upward at the statue.  Below the statue's neck is a drawing of an airport path with \\"take off\\" references.  The airport drawing ties into the rest of the CD that is expressive of our modern times.  It is difficult to determine if Radiohead is mocking these Christian principles, or that they believe these principles have psychological value (e.g. there is a picture of a man looking outside a plane with fire and the brief quotation above) -- perhaps it is to be left to the listener and viewer of the song and artwork.  Regardless of the interpretation one may take from this song, it is clear that Radiohead expected one to be thinking of the modern world as viewed through Christian principles.   The Tourist is all about life going too fast.  Radiohead seems to reiterate this by the pictures in the CD.  The pictures immediately following the song are of a subway system and people running and waiting for it, a plane, and a city that has helicopters landed and one flying above the city.  There are the words \\"by a fast-track career that ...modern world\\" which indicates that society has become so engrossed in work, that it has forgotten to slow down, reflect on things that are important, and take time out to enjoy life.  The song ends with \\"idiot, slow down, slow down.\\"  Surely, this is a warning for people in the industrial world to look at what they are missing as they hurry about their business.  The idea that \\"life is precious\\" may perhaps be losing its profoundness with many.  It does often seem as though we are just rats running through a maze, as the cliché goes, and that society is only concerned in getting a job done, making money, getting another job done and repeating this endless circle.  The Tourist expresses what many are guilty of -- society gets angry when it is overcharged, but little to no tinge of anger is felt as a host of legal and moral injustices are committed.  A view point from this artwork and song is that this fast track, career oriented world has lost its focus and is no longer enjoying life and pursuing to make it better, because we are simply too busy rushing to work, making money, and then repeating the cycle.  It seems to be the warning of Radiohead that we are all just tourists, and that our days are few -- should we spend them running a \\"rat race?\\"      Work Cited  Radiohead.  \\"Ok Computer.\\"  Perf.

B000BJ7BCK|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. Previous reviewers have described the movie, so I want get into that.  What I like the most about the movie besides its obvious spoofing of other superhero movies is the music.  Not only did they have great 80's music in this movie, but they used it in such a way that it actually helped tell the story.  My favorite scene in the movie is the \\"party\\" scene at Will's house when Gwen tells Layla that Will doesn't need to be friends with her anymore.  Playing \\"Voices Carry\\" in the background was the perfect touch.
B000002LVB|4.0|Although the group would go on for another 2 years at least enough to release an album named \\"Squeeze\\", and a rock group from England to use that name for their band. Reed finally had enough of being in a group as he wanted to sow his wild oats. This would be the first of 3 albums on the Atlantic label. It's definitely the best of them too. The album came together after being kicked out of Verve. The group was all set to release the material that would eventually end up on \\"V.U.\\", and \\"Another Veiw\\", but then Reed came up with this album. \\"Who Loves The Sun?\\" is without a doubt a weird love song, or at least it has the sound of one, but it's really a break-up song, and then there's \\"Sweet Jane\\" my first introduction to Lou Reed, and the Velvet Underground. I've heard the live version of this, and it's even better than this, but this is still no slouch. Reed was disgusted however as this was carelessly mixed and edited. Then there's \\"Rock and Roll\\" which is alright!!! \\"Cool It Down\\" is another nice little slice, and the first side ends with \\"New Age\\" this is another song that Reed was upset with being mixed recklessly. I have to agree with Reed here as the live version of this song is better. Side 2 kicks off with \\"Head Held High\\" a nice little rocker, \\"Lonesome Cowboy Bill\\" is a bit hokey I mean a New York group writing about cowboys it's unheard of, but not as off base as you think as some of the first cowboys came from New York State. \\"I've Found A Reason\\" is a rather weak song here, and it doesn't get any better with \\"Train Round The Bend\\", but makes up for it with the song \\"Oh Sweet Nuthin\\". This is a slow number that shows the group was starting to break up, and after a month long stay at Max's Kansas City they would.

It is easy to be faithful when there is no temptation in sight. I would also have liked to have seen him develop a little more unselfishness towards Evie and others in general. Sebastian's jealousy of Evie was really another form of selfishness. But all in all it was pretty good, worth reading.
B000002G7E|3.0|This is containing alot of venom within it's sound. The title track starts everything off with it's grunge sounding piano and guitar. I guess Lou was bitter with the break up between him and Nico because this is downright psychotic compared to the first album. It continues with the next song called \\"The Gift\\" which is a story of a guy who mails himself to his girlfriend with unexpected results, and this is done over a droning guitar probably inspired Black Sabbath to create their guitar sound. Then the next two songs were forgetable except for the title of one, and that was \\"Lady Godiva's Operation\\". Then it picks up again with aggravated assault on the ears, and the brain with \\"I Heard Her Call My Name\\". About 3 minutes of distortion, feedback, and murdering of the drums. Finally the noise assault ends with the 17 minute opus \\"Sister Ray\\" the worst song on this album. Well this is a way to let off steam when you break up with a girl I guess. However, the group would go through alot after this album as Verve would drop them as an attempt to clean up the label with only squeaky clean groups, and their next album would go in the can, and what would result was the self-titled pop album( the last one for Verve). John Cale would leave after this album, and the introduction of the Yule brothers. This is an all right album, but it's noisy...too noisy for me.

B002GY9F9K|1.0|To truly review this show it has to be looked at from two angles.  The first is that of someone who has read and enjoyed the books.  Which I have.  In fact I read Wizards First Rule when it first came out ages ago.  I loved it, couldn't put it down (seriously I was up till 3 am finishing it).  So going into the show with a love of the books (at least the early books) and looking forward to them being made into a TV show I was hugely disappointed.  That disappointement blossomed into shere overwhelming disgust.      In no way shape or form does it follow the books, indeed it only has a few generic world similarities.  The rest of it is so far off that there is no scent of the books left in it.  The lead actor plays an absolutely terrible Richard, at least compared to the strong dynamic individual in the books.  The others aren't nearly so changed however its hard to accept them when the hero is so badly protrayed.      I can think of no one I know who likes the books and also likes the TV show.    That being said for someone who has no knowledge of the books the show is quite engaging.  It would have been a spectacular TV show if it wasn't based on a literary work.  The settings are always quite dramatic and often beautiful, the stories are unique and engaging, and it appeals to lovers of the sword/sorcery genra filling a genra void that has been lurking for quite some time.      If you have the capability of looking past the fact that the show is supposed to follow a book or have never read the books, there is a good chance you will find yourself enjoying the show and anxiously awaiting the next installment.  However if you are a big fan of the books do yourself a favor and just steer clear or its likely your head will explode when you see how badly it has been butchered.

Not only that but also some dreaded Death-like Dementors who seek him and want his soul, but can Harry find out if Sirius Black is really the heir to Voldermort or it might be someone else.<br /><br />Brilliant and thrilling installment of the ever popular cinematic fantasy adventure franchise based on the beloved books by J.K. Rowlings. Mexican director Alfonso Cauron steps in place of Chris Columbus while Columbus is producer for this is the most complex and artsy of the franchise that also reunites stars Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy, Maggie Smith as Professor Macgarnagle, Alan Rickman as Professor Snape, Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, Julie Walters as Mrs. Weasley, John Cleese as Nearly-headless Nick and introduces new characters like Emma Thompson as Professor Trealaway. The film replaces Richard Harris who played Dumbledore in the first two movies with Michael Gambon as Dumbledore for i think he brilliantly plays the character more so then poor Harris whom was good.

B001NLKT60|4.0|While you don't necessarily \\"have\\" to read the first book \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\", like others...I would highly recommend it.  I found this book (the second in a trilogy) to be superior to the first in readability.  Maybe because I was already used to the odd names that were used because the story is set in Sweden.  Yes, I realize that the names are only odd for me, since I'm American, but that's all I have to go on.<br /><br />I read the book on my Kindle.  I don't know if that plays a role, but the editing of this book left a bit to be desired.  Words misspelled, spaces missing in sentences, etc.  However, it was only mildly distracting.  I thoroughly enjoyed the story and am looking forward to the third, and final, book in the series.  It's a shame that Mr. Larsson passed away shortly after delivering the manuscripts for these three stories....I would have liked to have read more from him.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|Settlers of Catan is educational.    It teaches ecconomics and strategy in much the same way Monopoloy does. In both games the object is to win by aquisition of resources. It teaches supply and demand, how to confound your apponant, and how to advance your territory. In both games \\"the one with the most toys wins.\\"    It is colorful and graphicly interesting, and does not favor gender. We learned about it from an other couple. They invited us over for a couples night and brought out this game. He told us that he enjoyed playing it, but his wife always won.    I would recomend this to teenagers and adults, because it requires some focuse and strategizing. It is a good teaching tool.
0756405890|2.0|This is one of those books that you dive into eagerly and immediately get swept away, only to be pulled up short 100 pages in when you realise with a jolt that it has actually taken a whole lot of potential and run straight into the ground leaving you feeling cheated. The Name of the Wind is chock full of potential, but most of this is contained in the brief present-day interludes in which the protagonist reminisces about his life. Which is, quite frankly, incredibly yawn inducing and filled with every fantasy cliche and Mary Sue in the good old 'How to write your own completely unoriginal Fantasy Novel' handbook that so many authors rely on these days. The cultural mythology is definitely intriguing and the Chandrian back story had my attention but the writing is mediocre and the development of the characters is pretty amateur.      But the most glaring problem is Kvothe himself. He's INCREDIBLY infuriating. Everybody fawns over him and yet he's utterly, blandly, complacently arrogant. He's the ultimate 1 dimensional Gary Stu. He has no personality, his faults are glossed over, and throughout the book, he DOES NOTHING and there is no personal development. Seriously, it's almost as bad as Twilight, as if Rothfuss forgot that a plot is necessary. And while that may come in the second book, I personally don't want to have to wade through 600 pages of Kvothe attending university and experiencing your average teen angst and personal issues to get to it. Aren't epic fantasies supposed to have excitement, adventure and suspense, and grab your attention with a steadily evolving plot? Not just an arrogant toerag attending a university, squabbling with the school bully and getting all emo lusting after the usual unnattainable-and-ridiculously-gorgeous girl. I'd still read the second book for the contemporary story arc and more about Bast in particular, but I'll be borrowing it, not buying it. I'd venture to say it's Twilight all over again, but that's maybe a little strong.
0375703764|1.0|I read 4-5 books a week.  I love to read.  I've only ever quit reading one book...ever.  And to tell you just how worthless this 700-page door stop is, I struggled to finish this book over a 3-week period.  I rarely comment on Amazon.com, but after (finally) finishing it, I just feel the need to vent.  Because there isn't enough space to describe how worthless this book is, I'm going to concentrate on the few good things I can think of.<br /><br />First off, the only thing I'm grateful for in this experience is that I found someone gullible enough to take it off my hands - for the price of a cup of coffee at a local cafe.  I think I would have paid HER just to get rid of it...either that, or I'd save it for firestarting material.<br /><br />The second-best thing about this book are the pages containing only 1-5 words.  You can really cover some ground and you actually forget for a minute or two that you're wasting so much time with this literary drivel.<br /><br />Third, thank goodness I didn't pay full price for this book.  Not even close.<br /><br />Finally, there was one scene (Truant) that made me chuckle...and the only reason I did is that it was unexpectedly sexually vulgar and completely random, even in a book that defied order & interest.<br /><br />Anyhow, read this book at your own risk.  Faced with a re-read or watching paint dry, I'd be frantically looking for my keys so I could drive to my local hardware store & fill the bed of my truck with some 15 cans of emerald green Olympic interior satin diversion...

0446402389|3.0|Note that this review contains plot spoilers.<br /><br />I consider myself a bit of a Gulag geek, which is why I was shaking my head in disbelief during much of this book. Suspected criminals kept under surveillance to obtain evidence (instead of, in reality, outright arrest on often trumped-up charges based on minimal or nonexistent cause); persons being executed by the police on the spot (instead of being taken in for questioning, interrogated, sentenced on trumped-up or nonexistent charges, THEN executed - many Gulag prisoners believed Stalin wasn't aware of the situation in the Gulags, if they'd had executions as portrayed in the book, it'd have been harder to keep their SOPs secret); persons under suspicion visited by the police (instead of arrested outright); suspects taking a quick trip to the Lubyanka before heading home (versus more likely months spent waiting for interrogation and sentencing, then on to the Gulag); truth serum being used to extract confessions (instead of physical beatings or sleep deprivation); demotion and relocation of disgraced MGB agent with a spouse (instead of arrest, interrogation, sentencing, imprisonment of one and then the other, sent to separate locations never to see each other again); a meth addict that throws away drugs; a dedicated MGB officer suddenly gaining a conscience; and, in a time of paralyzing fear and uncertainty, persons en masse willingly sticking their (and, by association, their family members') necks out to assist perfect strangers (versus saving their skins with silence) - all these instances from Child 44 go against anything I've ever read about the Gulag. Although Smith lists several books for further reading on the subject, it seems unlikely that he had an expert read it for historical accuracy, from which I believe it would have benefited.<br /><br />Child 44, which takes place primarily during a five-month period in Russia in 1953, is about a dedicated, thirty-year-old Soviet Security Force agent named Leo Stepanovich Demidov who errs when tasked with picking up a person of interest suspected of engaging in counterrevolutionary crimes due to his contact with foreigners. Instead, MGB officer Demidov puts him under surveillance. The vet escapes unnoticed, and Demidov and his fellow agents (including his second-in-command nemesis, Vasili) are forced to track him down. Vasili, angered by Leo's success, which foils his attempt to take control, makes it his mission to destroy him. Leo, demoted to a lower rank and sent to the boondocks, becomes obsessed with a couple of seemingly related murder cases that he believes are being brushed under the rug by authorities. Lots of twists and turns follow as Leo and a companion try to track down a serial killer that stalks and kills young victims along the railroad tracks. Author Tom Rob Smith does a great job of revealing just the right amount of information along the way to keep readers guessing.<br /><br />Although Russian State Security Force/suspect/prisoner interactions as the author portrays them bear little resemblance to reality, Child 44 is still a thoroughly entertaining thriller, though I ding it down to three stars for its historical anomalies. For a better idea of the real deal though, try: Man is Wolf to Man by Janusz Bardach, 11 Years in Soviet Prison Camps by Elinor Lipper, Alexander Dolgun's Story, and Gulag by Anne Applebaum.Demidov who errs when tasked with picking up a person of interest suspected of engaging in counterrevolutionary crimes due to his contact with foreigners.

B001KVZ6F2|5.0|I remember Clint Eastwood from tv on RAWHIDE at the start of his career.  I remember him in a musical western PAINT YOUR WAGON in 1969.  I remember him in all of those westerns plus his first foray as DIRTY HARRY.  I remember his getting fired from the studio he worked for as a tv star, not for bad behavior but for lack of talent.  I was one of those same stupid people back then that thought this guy was just coasting on his good looks and as soon as those were gone his career would be kaput.<br /><br />Well his good looks are gone but he has so much talent that he is bigger than ever as both a director and actor.  Having seen the Oscar winner, Sean Penn in MILK, recently, I really think it should have gone to Eastwood instead.  Not that Penn doesn't do his usual first class job.  No, it is that Eastwood inhabits every nuance of a truly original fictional character which I tend to appreciate a lot more than biography.  Further, Eastwood hits America right where all the people in it live emotionally and economically in this moment of time whereas MILK looked back to a brief shining moment in gay rights history in San Francisco.<br /><br />Eastwood is Walt Kowalski, a 78 year old recent widower and Korean Korean War veteran.  He is a retired auto worker in Detroit who still lives in his old neighborhood much to his family's consternation.  His proudest possession is his completely restored 1972 Gran Torino automobile.  The attempted theft of this auto by the Asian youth who lives next door sets off a richly nuanced relationship between the two, which slowly ripens into a friendship.  They each have their separate problems too.  Walt is hitting the end of the road medically as he coughs up blood and discovers his serious prognosis.  The youth and his family are being terrorized by an Asian gang to which his cousin belongs.  They want him to join them and when he won't, they ratchet up the violence towards the entire family.  We know how Dirty Harry would solve the problems in this movie.  Walt is not Dirty Harry.  He lives in the real world and has to find real world solutions to the problems before him.<br /><br />Eastwood is just wonderful as this character.  The movie itself is a fine piece of writing which Eastwood himself superbly directs.  Such a fuss was made about his CHANGELING (which he directed with Jolie in the lead), which came out in the same year.  Now that I've seen both, this is the better movie. The Walt character is just everything you've got to love long range about America and what we are so close to losing.  It's true.  They don't make them like Walt anymore.<br /><br />Eastwood himself closes the movie by singing in his Walt voice a song about his Gran Torino over the closing credits.

I have been enjoying seeing the people of Colorado Springs again and following the wonderful love story between Sully and Michaela!  I enjoyed the series when it aired on television in the early 90's along with my family.  Now I am enjoying watching the series again as if I had never seen the stories!  If you loved it before - you're going to LOVE it now!  This has been the summer of Sully and Michaela again for me!  What great stories!  ALSO - this complete tv series also INCLUDES the made for TV MOVIES done about 10 years after the series finished!

It is written from two view points, that of the two main characters Alex and Brittany. I found myself only wanting Alex's parts, it really felt like more his story. I loved being inside his head and watching him fall in love. Very nicely done, very relevant, characters were believable. Warning: very mature content, strong language, sex, violence.

055358894X|5.0|This book was recommended to me as a good \\"steampunk\\" novel, which it really isn't. But I'm glad for the recommendation anyway because this book was a fantastic read. From the beginning, it is an anxious page-turner; I don't want to admit how many late nights this book brought upon me (I'm a slow reader to begin with).<br /><br />On the surface, this book is about Locke Lamora and his Gentlemen [...]. Their profession is thievery. They rob the rich by developing complex schemes that should result in the victim's willful giving up of their own money. The schemes are well developed and entertaining to read as the Gentlemen [...] perform their tricks from beginning to end (like Ocean's Eleven).<br /><br />Aside from the entertaining and frankly funny schemes described in the book, my favorite parts were the lavish descriptions the author writes about the setting. I'm a huge fan of well-developed settings and characterizations, and this book had both of those. I could picture this world clearly in my head with its fantastical Elderglass and the like.

0385343248|5.0|I started reading this new edition of James Clavell's \\"Shogun; A Novel of Japan\\" just a few days ago, bought from yet another book store being liquidated.  What a GREAT SUMMER READ!  First published in 1975, Clavell's long-form (1152 pages) historical (Northern Europe's earliest contact with, and role, in the final battle whose victory transformed feudal Japan into the centralized and deliberately isolated command and control society of the hereditary Shogun in Tokyo) novel (epic in intent, form and accomplishment).    This new edition is inexpensive at $7.99 face price.  It's from Dell Publishing being reprinted in series as \\"James Clavell's world-famous Asian Saga ('Shogun', 'Tai-Pan', 'Gai-Jin', 'King Rat', 'Noble House', and 'Whilrwind')\\".  The typeface is pretty small; put on your reading glasses.  But for the price it's printed on pretty good paper, and doesn't stink like so many pulp editions.    If the others in Clavell's Asian Saga are as good as \\"Shogun\\", then it's good I'm retired with enough free time to devote to them.  I'll stay all summer under a fan with lemonade and \\"Shogun,\\" and abandon time and care.    As deeply satisfying as \\"War and Peace\\"!  And as long!  Longer, counting sequels--oh, goodie goodie!

B000UCEJEQ|5.0|I loved Eurythmics back in the day, especially for Annie Lennox' incomparable vocals, but lost contact later in the 80s, drifting more into other interests. Recently I decided to re-investigate Annie Lennox' solo work after seeing some youtube videos, especially her wonderful performance of \\"Into The West\\" at the Oscars, and \\"Many Rivers to Cross\\" from an AI benefit. I found some good and some great songs, and then found this recent album, \\"Songs of Mass Destruction\\". Being the artist's age, I kind of wondered where she could possibly be musically at age 52, especially when so many musical artists' work seems to fade with their years.    What a stunner! Simply brilliant. Annie Lennox does things vocally here I have never heard her do, and I couldn't imagine her voice to have become even better with age as it certainly has. More depth, more control, more subtlety, and more power (if you can believe it), and more creativity. And the songwriting is just breathtaking, entering new melodic places for this artist, and raising the blues/soul dimension I have always loved about her work to new heights. For me, this album as a whole is the best of her solo offerings (and transcends a good bit of Eurythmics' work as well).    I'm a very particular listener, and accustomed to picking and choosing just a few songs on any album, by anyone. Since getting used to ripping my CD tracks to my ipod, I never have to listen to album tracks I don't care for. But there's not a thing on this album I have left off, it's that good. For me it's difficult to choose a favorite between Big Sky, Coloured Bedspread, Through the Glass Darkly, Ghosts in My Machine, Smithereens....well you get the drift.     I've never written an album review, but I had to express my appreciation for this truly superb album by an artist who has apparently found that special alchemy to turn age and experience into beauty, and found her creative powers deepened, strengthened, and sharpened in the process. Quite a rarething.    Edit: after 2 months more listening, this album just gets better and better, and is still my favorite...But I am also discovering the brilliance of both Diva and Bare, Annie's two other solo songwriting albums. The best way to listen is to mix tracks from all her solo albums, there is so much there to hear, which benefits from attentive listening and repetition. This is not background music, but soul-absorbing, timeless songwriting and exquisite performances.
1594488916|4.0|Allison Hoover Bartlett's book, \\"The Man Who Loved Books Too Much\\" is a different crime expose'.  It isn't a page-turner, but it is very well researched and written.  I found it to be an enjoyable easy read that I recommend...And, I have no interest in collecting.<br /><br />If, like me, you think of art theft as being exclusive to painted works you will be enlightened to the world of those who feel the written word is, perhaps, more interesting, valuable...And ripe for the taking!  The sky is the limit as to the value of rare books and, unlike paintings, they are immenently more accessible for collecting and otherwise.<br /><br />John Charles Gilkey is a book theif who for years goes about his craft under the radar.  His methods are alarmly simple yet effective.  Suffering from a personality defect he feels absolutely no remorse.  He is just getting what society has deprived him of so he's really not so much a thief as he is a one-man \\"literary Robin Hood\\".  Possessing, perhaps, above average intelligence he still has little, if any, work-ethic.  That lack of hard work shows in both his everyday life and the fact that he uses the same tactics over and over in a relatively small geographic area.  I kept thinking what damage he could have reeked if he was more workman-like in his scam - taking it to varied locales.  His narcisism coupled with his OCD simply fails him though and, in the end, it's his undoing.  He did, however, accumulate a collection whose value is likely never to be fully known.  Furthermore, he may have continued unabated if he did not become another person's obsession to stop.  That person, Ken Sanders, the one-time head of the rather loosely based Antiquarian Book Sellers Society made it his personal mission to bring Gilkey to justice.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book, gaining insight into a world I knew nothing of.  I found Gilkey, Sanders, and Bartlett interesting people within this community of book lovers.  If you have a few free nights it is an entertaining book that I believe almost anyone, once started, will finish with relish.I believe almost anyone, once started, will finish with relish.
B001O2HLGY|5.0|For me, \\"Red\\" is the definitive King Crimson album, and one of the best rock albums of this or any other era. It is even better in this remastered format. Given the imaginative quality and sonic range of \\"Red\\", there can be few albums which could benefit more from Japanese mastering wizardry. It may seem odd to spend £20 or so ($33) to replace a CD that you already own but, compared with my early CD version, the remastering is thoroughly worth the extra.     As for the album itself, well, the title - and the back-cover picture of a dial with the needle well into the red - denote danger, and the album is characterised by a dark, edgy feel. These qualities are even more pronounced on the remastered version.     By this time, KC had been slimmed-down to guitarist Robert Fripp who also played mellotron, John Wetton (later of Asia, and a superb solo artist) on bass and vocals, and Bill Bruford on percussion. All three individual performances are superlative throughout. Fripp's guitar and mellotron work is excellent, Wetton's vocals perfectly complement the instrumentals, and Bruford's performance thoroughout the album verges on the miraculous.     Also making significant contributions were David Cross (violin), Mell Collins (soprano sax), Ian MacDonald (alto sax), Robin Miller (oboe) and Marc Charig (cornet).     The album kicks off with the title track (6.16), a superb instrumental which sets the dark, edgy and classy tone of the album as a whole. \\"Fallen Angel\\" (5.58) finds vocalist Wetton in fine form, accompanied by some superb drumming from Bruford.     \\"One More Red Nightmare\\" (7.07) again sees the band in fine form. It starts off with a percussion-driven session which segues into an edgy vocal from Wetton. KC then move into an excellently performed instrumental section (listen out for the sax solos here).     \\"Providence\\" (8.06) is a remarkably original track, and it can take several listens to appreciate fully the artistry and complexity that the band weave intothis performance.     And then comes King Crimson's tour-de-force - \\"Starless\\" (12.18), an epic which, for me, is the finest track that the band ever produced.     The track begins in lyrical mood, in which Wetton's excellent vocals are wonderfully complemented by a sax solo of marvellous tone and feel. After about four minutes, the track shifts into a second movement, an ascending, edgy instrumental section in which all of the instrumentals are on the top line (listen out for Bruford here). About nine minutes into the track, we get an explosive section in which amazing sax playing takes the lead. Finally, we're back into the lyrical theme, leading to the kind of crescendo of which King Crimson were the masters.     So there you have it - a wonderful, dark, magisterial rock album. Forty minutes tend to pass very quickly with this album.....especially in the remastered format.
B000006TRV|5.0|My favorite line in the whole album. So the Wall, many consider it Pink Floyd's magnum opus but just as many consider it their worst album. I'll admit that for two years I was one of the ones that believed the Wall to be a bad album. My brother praised it but I did not get it.     Two years after first hearing it I am shocked by how good it is. I think I just needed to mature musically in order to understand it. The second half is pretty much perfect while the first is a little slow. Can't recommend this album enough, do yourself a favor and hear it now.
031606792X|5.0|Very good transation and very good price for the book \\"Breaking Dawm\\".  I will continue to check Amazon.com first for my book needs  This book finishes my four books in the series. The fourth being the best.  I enjoyed the books and the story line so much that I wanted to possess the books for my library.
B000WGWQG8|4.0|We had been to Quincy Mass. and took a tour of John Adams first house and the newer and bigger one in what was called Pleasantville at that time, now it is all called Quincy.  I wish I had seen the miniseries before the tour, some things would have been explained better.  We also toured Boston histoical landmarks and John Adams was greatly involved in the American Revolution. I enjoyed the miniseries very much, it explained histoical facts that we did not read in our history books.  My daughter is a fifth grade teacher and she plans to use the miniseries in her history lessons.  I would recommend the John Adams Miniseries to any history lover who would appriciate the whole story. David McCullough wrote this great book and Tom Hanks made it into a great miniseries
0767811070|5.0|I never saw this when it first came out.  But when I got it on DVD and watched it it was great.  I can already see where the makers of GTA San Andreas got their ideas from when making the game.  The only question, I would like to know if that mall parking lot where Ice Cube and his two homies kill the three guys who killed his brother Ricky is the same place where the first back to the future movie was filmed at the part where Doc brown gets shot by some terrorists in a van and Marty goes back in time to 1955, because everytime I see that part they both look like they take place in the same area.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|If you’ve never been a fan of British comedy, this movie is excellent to ease you in. This is nothing like the Monty Python or the Are You Being Served? humor with which you may be familiar. Shaun of the Dead is American humor with a British accent. It is also a love story that happens to involve zombies.<br /><br />Shaun (Simon Pegg) is riddled with guilt after his girlfriend, Liz (Kate Ashfield) finally has enough of his juvenile ways and dumps him. Shaun’s friend and roommate Ed (Nick Frost) tries to console him at the local pub (the Winchester) where they spend all of their free time. Simultaneously, a zombie invasion is occurring. Shaun vows to win Liz back, but her two friends Dianne (Lucy Davis) and David (Dylan Moran) are trying to keep her away from Shaun with good intentions.<br /><br />Shaun works a retail job, lives a lazy bachelor’s life and thinks an idea of a good time is going to the Winchester every night. It is understandable why Dianne and David would want better for Liz. Soon the gang realizes that their town that has been taken over by zombies, and Shaun understands that he needs to grow up and prioritize. If he needs to save the stepfather he despises, so be it. If he needs to kill his landlord who will soon turn into a zombie, so be it. He never liked him much anyway.<br /><br />This film can be violent at times, but the humor certainly outweighs the gore. At one point, Ed and Shaun, having no weapons, resort to attacking oncoming zombies with their record collection. They can’t just pick anything to throw, though – even in crisis one must decide if the Batman soundtrack is worthy of saving. In another scene, Shaun and Ed are leaving the Winchester while quite inebriated, singing a song with, unbeknownst to them, tonal accompaniment from the walking undead! The comedy in this film is certainly memorable. The squeamish may just want to cover their eyes at the nasty parts.<br /><br />Shaun of the Dead was directed by Edgar Wright, the mastermind behind the British sitcom Spaced from which Simon Pegg and Nick Frost also originated along with Jessica Hynes, who makes a funny cameo in the film as the yin to Shaun’s yang. She is leading a team of friends in the fight against the zombies who happen to look and dress similarly to the party that Shaun is leading.<br /><br />If you are easily bothered by horror films, you may be put off when thinking about picking up this movie. But rest assured, the zombies aren’t all that scary and the brief shots of gore are few and far between so that you can turn away when necessary but still enjoy the movie. One of my closest friends has a phobia of zombies, and she was able to watch this film with little problem. (Although, she hasn’t let us live down turning the lights off while we watched.)<br /><br />If you’d like to see any of Simon Pegg’s or Nick Frost’s work, or if you want to enjoy a less dry brand of British humor, then this is a great place to start. If you have ever been fortunate enough to catch some episodes of Spaced, Shaun of the Dead follows a similar pattern. Edgar Wright is a superb director, and his style is a joy to watch unfold.behind the British sitcom Spaced from which Simon Pegg and Nick Frost also originated along with Jessica Hynes, who makes a funny cameo in the film as the yin to Shaun’s yang.

B0028K3192|5.0|I love the strength that exists within the brevity of this album. He always leaves me wanting more with each release and this album is no different - I just wish I hadn't had to wait so long for this one! Oh well, genius takes time I guess.<br /><br />In short, if you love music, you'll love Maxwell - and this album. Pretty Wings and Love You are my current favorites. The sounds of this band and the production are nothing short of deeply groovy.
B00192IV0O|3.0|I enjoy about 4 of the songs on this CD.  I am a litte dissappointed that the Boom Boom Pow song has a few curse words in it.
0312360266|4.0|This book started off a bit slow and i wasnt sure i would like it, but then about 1/2 way through it got really good and by the end i was definitely wanting the 2nd one. I just started the 2nd one a couple of days ago.
B000002LND|5.0|Impressive on her albums, untouchable on her singles, so you make an album out of her singles and what do you get?  The greatest pop record any human being will ever create.  The third quarter is a little lacking; the first half is unparalleled spiritual, sonic, physical ecstasy.  She gets feminist (\\"Express Yourself\\"), she gets political (\\"Papa Don't Preach\\"), she gets lyrical (\\"Material Girl\\"), we get excited, uplifted, cleansed, to live.  My favorite twist of her tongue (wording that asks for trouble, considering the artist in question): \\"Romeo and Juliet/They never felt this way, I bet.\\"
0452286751|5.0|I had always heard of Ayn Rand and I had seen her large major works at the book store, and I had even done a little research on her to see what all the hooplah was about her philosophy of objectivism. So I really didn't know what to think when I began this book. Would it read like a super-long essay with a thin plot spread over the top? Would it be a \\"preachy\\" novel? or would it just be boring? I was prepared for almost anything except what I got which was a nicely developed story with wonderfully complex characters.<br /><br />On the surface, this is a story about architecture and the men and women of that industry in early 20th century New York. But really it's about a handful of characters who represent certain archetypes that Ms Rand uses to codify her objectivism philosophy. Howard Roark is the perfect man in her philosphy, unwilling to compromise one iota for his art even if it means near starvation as an architect. He is indifferent to the opinions of others and therefore \\"the one who is as man should be.\\" Peter Keating is \\"the man who couldn't be successful but doesn't know it.\\" Unlike Roark, he patterns his art after others, rationalizing that if he does the same thing then he will also be successful. Ultimately he is passed by because he just doesn't understand the neccessity of originality. Ellsworth Toohey knows he will never be successful in the same vein and so becomes successful at destroying others. He is the \\"man who couldn't be and knows it.\\" And then Gail Wynand is the \\"one that could have been.\\" Rising from poverty to be a powerful media mogul, he chooses to try to control others rather than create for himself. I'll leave it to others to debate the relative merits of Ms Rand's philosophy but for me, the characters and how they interact are prime; a great novel is a great novel because of the writing, the setting, the characters, the style, the plot, etc. And this is a great novel.<br /><br />Is it perfect? No, I don't think so, even if one ignores the underlying phiosophy and only looks at it from a novel writing perspective. There are long passages where one character spews forth their point of view, detailing their particular philosophy on the nature of what makes for a good society, or a good relationship, or even on the very nature of good and evil, etc. Some people say this is \\"stilted\\" dialogue and I concur. It just wasn't realistic.<br /><br />The novel is broken down into four parts, one for each of the main characters. That section tends to have more of the story presented from that person's point of view but the overall plot is consistent and chronological. The plot itself is masterful and includes elements of revenge, intrigue, power plays, romance, and courtroom drama. The pacing is spot on, driving the plot towards its powerful conclusion. I highly recommend this novel, whether reading for sheer pleasure or for a launching platform for philosophical discussions.phiosophy and only looks at it from a novel writing perspective.

B00005JGAB|5.0|The Ramones are historically misrepresented as the first punk band--see the New York Dolls--but their debut is accurately acclaimed as one of the greatest rock 'n' roll records ever cut, from the drumbeat lightning-strike drive of \\"Blitzkrieg Bop\\" (little sex, some macho, lotta dysfunction) onward.  It's a gloriously maladjusted crusade through the backstreets of the Bronx, where mothers \\"beat on the brat with a baseball bat,\\" kids sniff glue out of desperate boredom, and their bully older brothers are riveted by \\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.\\"  The Ramones were those kids.  Now they're pop music legends, since, even if they didn't invent it, they did bring punk to the mainstream (eventually; their debut only hit number 11 on the \\"Billboard\\" charts).  They're also in on Cold War absurdity (\\"Havana Affair\\"--what do you think of that, Mr. Zimmerman?).  The best title award goes to \\"Today Your Love, Tomorrow the World,\\" one of my favorites off the album, despite the fact that it's about Naziism.
B0000067L2|4.0|So anyway, I was 15 in 1967 when this record came out, and in many ways that was just the right age.  Musically speaking, I was wide open to anything new--so the album's somewhat psychedelic feel worked just fine for me.  But I was hearing enough and reading enough to know that skill mattered. And roots mattered too. The fact that Cream was NOT a garage band meant something (although I later decided that garage bands certainly had their place in the grand scheme of things as well).  It would take a while before I'd even to get a chance to explore Clapton, Bruce and Baker's back catalogue, but the very fact that they were known to be top drawer was a draw for me.      It was even a little exciting to read interviews with the band at the time of the album's release in which they stated that they'd already moved WAAAY beyond that point musically.  As it later turned out, they were probably talking about jamming--which as it turned out, really wasn't my bowl of tea, but the very notion of constant dynamic artistic growth and development tickled my brain.  Still one of the things I liked most about DISRAELI GEARS (as well as WHEELS OF FIRE's studio tracks)  was how the virtuosic instrumentals actually served the songs, and not vice versa.  Of course, it almost went without saying that \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\" or \\"Tales of Brave Ulysses\\" would be expanded upon considerably in concert.  But what's nifty about the studio tracks is how well the intricate guitar work and powerhouse drumming is interwoven into actual songs.     Aside from the obvious novelty numbers sung by Ginger Baker (this was still the era of \\"Give The Drummer Something Cute to Do\\"), DISRAELI GEARS is about 50% atypical Cream.  I mean, if \\"Ulysses,\\" \\"Sunshine\\" and \\"Brew\\" were all destined to become Cream standards, songs like \\"World of Pain,\\" \\"Dance the Night Away,\\" \\"We're Going Wrong\\" and even \\"SWLABR\\" were just off the wall enough to count as \\"near novelty\\" numbers themselves.  These tunes displayed an experimentalism that went beyond mere virtuosity.  It wasn't all heavy and didn't have to be, which was a lesson I often wished their followers had taken more to heart.    A song like \\"Tales of Brave Ulysses\\" could even be a little on the literate side, without showing too much strain for it.   Even the segues were interesting.  \\"World of Pain\\" post-adolescent gloom effectively counters \\"Sunshine's\\" exuberence.    It was actually quite telling that the band saw fit to close out the original Side 1 AND Side 2 of the record with those Ginger Baker novelty tunes.  It was a sly way of saying, \\"Don't take all this virtuoso stuff SO seriously.  There's more to us than that.\\"  There was.  And it's still there for the enjoyment and edification of everyone's inner 15 year old.
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|It has been a while since a book moved me to tears, but Let The Great World Spin managed to do it several times. Part of its appeal is the wonderful language used and how it changes as the focus shifts from character to character throughout the novel. But, the more relevant appeal is how it seamlessly connects a time 30+ years ago with our world in 2001 and then today. This is a novel of New York, a novel of connections, and a meditation on who we are and how our actions spin forward in time.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|Mama Mia is probably one of the best movies you will see for a long time coming. The acting and singing were superb, except for Pierce Brosnan. Sorry Pierce, but singing is not your forte! But who cares - he's still great to look at! And please watch this movie through the credits. To see the Elvis impersonations at the end...LOL. This movie made me smile...laugh...belly laugh until I was crying. I rarely buy a movie, but this one I had to have it. If you love Abba, Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, etc. get this movie and watch it. Watch it often. You'll be glad you did.
B001FB55HG|2.0|Sam Worthington's portrayal of Marcus Wright is what really carries this movie and makes it worth watching until the end. Unfortunately, whomever created the trailers decided to spoil what would have been the most emotional storyline in a movie that has no other emotional pull.  And, thus by spoiling the movie's most interesting plot point, they robbed me of anything that would make me care for the characters.  As for the portrayal of John Connor, I'm a Christian Bale fan, but his performance doesn't tell us why people so revere John Connor. He's in slight Batman mode all the way throughout and we only believe the people revere him as some Jesus Christ-figure (J.C., get it?) because the Terminator tells us so.  This movie should have been about Marcus Wright, and John Connor only should have been seen in near-mystical ways, in the shadows, in blurs and such.  If the movie had focused on Marcus Wright, put him forth as the main character, the movie could have been onto great things.  Besides Worthington, the other good thing the movie has going for it are some great action set pieces.   This is worth watching for Worthington and the action scenes (especially the one on the highway), and hardcore Terminator fans should watch it, but it's not a necessary chapter, adding little to what we already know about the overarching storyline. It's really too bad because there was the potential to be something more, but it falls flat.  I hate to say it, but even the Star Wars prequels, as bad, mediocre and uneven as those were overall, they did a better of filling in the holes of a storyline most of us know very well.  Terminator: Salvation isn't anywhere nearly as bad as Transformers Revenge of the Fallen, but it's not a must-see, as it doesn't push the Terminator/John Connor story forward.
0307474275|5.0|This one was good, and for someone not familiar with the \\"revelations\\" inside it, I'm sure it would be tremendously gripping, as well. The controversy that surrounds the book is fairly amusing to me, though, because for some reason, people can't seem to grasp the definition of the word \\"fiction.\\"  I'm pretty familiar with the Grail tales, though, so that part wasn't new to me.  Personally, I find it odd that the folks who are screaming the loudest can't seem to grasp the concept that one myth is as good as another and ultimately, anything that cannot be proven must remain in the fictional realm.  Whatever.  Langdon is a good character, a kind of modern-day Indiana Jones, and I think this would have made a much better movie than it did and perhaps the choice of Tom Hanks for the starring role was a factor in that. The story was a good one and unfolded in a mesmerizing fashion, which seems to be Dan Brown's stock in trade. But, IMO, this one wasn't quite the page turner that Angels and Demons was, at least for me. And, somehow, (saying this in a way that won't ruin it for folks who haven't read it yet!) I wasn't completely satisfied when the \\"bad guy\\" was finally revealed. And, I have to admit, at the very end, I thought, \\"You slut!\\" about Langdon. LOL
B00284BMBM|5.0|This tops Daughtry's first album! He says himself that they had ample time to work on \\"Leave This Town\\" which wasn't the case with \\"Daughtry\\", pressured by the powers that be to release it quickly. Although Daughtry has had a number of top singles from their first album I believe \\"Leave This Town\\" will produce even more. The first single release, \\"No Surprise\\" is a great, catchy tune! Other songs on this album will follow quickly on the airwaves and will easily make the top 20. Buy it!!!
0545123267|4.0|At the edge of the woods in Mercy Falls, Grace lives alone. Oh, her parents are there but nigh unto incapable. Wrapped up in themselves and their careers, they are aggravatingly oblivious, managing to check in with their seventeen-year-old daughter in the unlikely event it occurs to them. And since she's never known any different, and they are her parents, the eminently practical Grace made her peace with it a long time ago. She doesn't weep over lost chances. She just makes dinner, does her homework, and quietly obsesses about the wolves in the woods. Yeah, Grace has one thing that consumes her. One messy, inexplicable fact in her otherwise staid existence. When she was a child she was mauled by wolves and left for dead. Somehow she survived and, ever since, a solitary wolf watches her from the shadows. Every winter, like clockwork, he skirts the edges of her home like a silent guardian, only to disappear again when summer arrives and temperatures rise. His presence is the one constant in her life. Until someone else is mauled by wolves. Until a boy named Sam turns up on her back porch. A boy with strangely familiar yellow eyes. And the world begins to change.<br /><br />I picked the right book to take with me. As soon as I found out Maggie Stiefvater was writing a new series to do with werewolves, I began counting down the days. [[ASIN:0738713708 Lament: The Faerie Queen's Deception]] was on my Best of 2008 list, and I was relying on the mysteriously titled SHIVER to tide me over until the release of the sequel [[ASIN:0738714844 Ballad: A Gathering of Faerie]]. And honestly the first thought I had after finishing was that it was perfectly titled because Grace and Sam's story sends shivers down your spine repeatedly. The second thought was how the characters surprised me--in a good way. I don't know exactly what I was expecting. Probably something along the lines of Dee and Luke in [[ASIN:0738713708 Lament: The Faerie Queen's Deception]], all urgent and angsty and dangerous as hell. But Grace and Sam are an entirely different breed. She is cool and methodical and even and I warmed up to her as I got to know her better. He is warm and thoughtful and artistic and I liked him right from the start. On the paranormal scale, this one falls much heavier on the realistic end of the spectrum. There's even a scientific (sort of) explanation for the werewolves' condition, with the result that the emphasis remains on the characters themselves. They and their storyline are so tied to the seasons, to the minutest fall in temperature, that I discovered I was responding to them in the same way. I loved how contained they both were. Maggie Stiefvater has managed to craft an intensely involving, desperate love story without the cliche teen stupidity a la Romeo & Juliet. Quite the feat. The descriptions are lovely, the young protagonists sympathetic, and there's a scene in a candy shop that will leave you absolutely salivating. I dare you to read that one just once.s as hell.

B000RW3YYA|5.0|After following the StarGate SG-1 seasons (all 10 of them, and the extra movies), I just had to dug into the spin-off series StarGate Atlantis. This is the third season, and a good question is: \\"Has the StarGate Atlantis series picked up the pace, drama and spectacularities just as theSG-1 series did?\\" Oh, yes - it sure has. There are some recurring themes, but also plenty of episodes with big surprises. But when it comes down to it - this is StarGate! And from my perspective, everything StarGate is great!
0316113506|5.0|Enjoyed this book because it was well written and understandable. It shows how aerobic exercise can have such a huge impact on your personality, on how you think and respond. This should be required reading for anyone dealing with children. It should be read and reread and notes taken. Do yourself and favor and read this book!

0618918248|1.0|I wonder who Dawkins imagines he will persuade with this book. It is full of fluff; it is breezy and glib; what little reasoning there is facile; and it meanders at times almost as badly as an essay by Montaigne. Those already in the atheist camp or those setup nearby at the agnostic site do not need persuading, and they (we) cannot, in my opinion, use this book very honestly to persuade others. Dawkins is far from a philosopher (he lacks nuance) and he's far from understanding the viewpoint of the religious believer. He seems to imagine that if he mocks religion enough and repeatedly points out how all the really smart people are not religious, that this will somehow work to his advantage in arguing his case. How so? I had expected this book to be vivid with rational argument, devastating and precise. But it's not. It's just a rambling, long-winded, tiresome polemic.     As a scientist, Dawkins is, of course, fully alert to the misuse and misjudgment of science, and when he stands on scientific ground against religious arguments and complaints, he is authoritative and aware of the details he omits in his account. In a popularization such as this, he can more or less coast along (I'm switching metaphors), skimming over the depth, pointing out what is more easily understood, showing the creationist, for example, how his argument fails, simply by a few casual references to scientific principles or fact. He doesn't have to go deep, but we know he can if he chooses. We know he could overwhelm us with detail and complex reasoning. So we give him a pass when he doesn't, and if we don't know any better, we assume the rest of the book has the same implicit intellectual competence and depth beneath its slick, glinting surface.     But any such hidden depth would leave its trace in what we see on the surface, within the configuration of what is shown, what is put in and what is left out; and that trace isn't there. Parts of this book are laughably shallow. He can't even discuss his own theory of memes without sounding inane. The book is as intellectually frivolous as a creationist tract against science. It is in fact, a correlative antithetical text, albeit in bloated form. There is so much philosophical naivete and dimwitted assertion and fallacious argumentation in it, the book could pass at times as the work of a misguided fanatic.    It's as if Dawkins hasn't given his case much thought; as if the surface breeze and the chatty meandering was where he found the most pleasure, not in the composition of a robust, tough-minded, analytical, meticulous, careful work of lasting value. If nobody knew who Dawkins was, if he had no reputation as a scientist or successful author, this book would go nowhere. It would have either died in the publisher's office or died on the bookshelves. At bottom, this book is an appeal to authority: that of Dawkins himself. How else to explain all the sloppy thinking that passes for argument in this book?    What is especially missing from Dawkins' polemic is any recognition that the notion of *explanation* underlies this debate, and that until this notion is clarified and defended, the very ambition and objective of science is not going to be understood by outsiders. Dawkins thinks it self-evident that religious explanations are not really explanations; but, of course, the religious think otherwise, and he never offers any enlightenment to them on why they are wrong. (See my final remarks, section C, for more on explanation as Dawkins see it.)    I agree with him that reason, hard thinking, and science in all its varieties of subject matter have led, and are leading still, to real explanations, and that positing God or pointing to religion and the experience of the religious is not  going to answer the type of questions that critical thinkers are asking. Religious questions have to end in theology, and theology at its foundation is always working with suppositions which the received data of the religion hasgiven without explanation. So for religion, explanation ends at revelation.    On the other hand, Scholasticism, for example, wasn't gibberish. It arose from hard thinking, proceeding from nonreligious beliefs, seemingly incontrovertible at the time, placed in forced, logical combination with unquestioned, \\"revealed givens\\", all ranked together as foundational truths (axioms, almost), and from those accepted fundamentals attempting to develop a reasoned, logically coherent and complete structure expressing the meaningful implications inherent within the vast synthesis of those various undisputed beliefs.     The infamous query of angels on the head of a pin wasn't nonsense, given the assumptions of both nonmaterial, spiritual beings and a nonspiritual, material world. How much space do such beings take up when interacting with the material world, as it was given by revelation they could? Any work of theology, modern or otherwise, is doing the same. The difference is in what is assumed as given (both the revealed and the nonreligious beliefs) and relevant to the fully elaborated theology. This is similar to what you see in the differences among geometries. If you start with different givens, you end up with different systems. The degree of shared assumptions influences the degree of similarity among the systems.     There are nonreligious beliefs which comprise the very core from which we understand the world: to deny them is to deny understanding itself. (The notion of explanation arises here.) Prior to the rise of science, \\"revealed givens\\" and nonreligious beliefs seemed compatible and allowed theological structures with little internal strain. (Since \\"revealed givens\\" can also begin as religious explanations, to call them \\"revealed\\" is misleading. But once accepted, they are held as if revealed and are unquestioned.) As modern science increases its influence on common, nonreligious belief, modern theologies struggle to combine religious \\"revealed givens\\" with these seemingly incontrovertible nonreligious beliefs arising from science. The forced, logical combination of the \\"given truths\\" of these two increasingly disparate belief collections threatens credulity of the proposed synthesis. Theology is threatened. Science, not seeking to combine the two, is not.    Dawkins claims to be making a case for atheism and against the truth-claims of religions. The final chapters take what could be called a reductio ad absurdum approach and focus on what Dawkins sees (these are not his words) as the moral perversity of religion; although, typically, he doesn't spell it out that clearly. Some future author, no doubt, will offer an immense compendium of such evidence. The moral atrocites could speak for themselves. What Dawkins doesn't fully understand (he almost does, but the organization of the book would be different if he fully did) is that, from the viewpoint of the religionist, he is using the moral system of \\"secular humanism\\" to argue against the morality of religion, and secular humanism pulls no weight with the religionist.     The religionist doesn't see humanism as legitimate: it is seen as a moral appendage to godless reason, its principles and regulations applied without  credible secular justification. This is why religionists see atheism as morally dangerous. Religionists see morality as transcendentally justified by their god's existence, and imprinted upon humanity by that god; and they see the humanist's claim to moral sensibilities, not as proof that morality has no need of religion, but as unmistakable evidence of their god's existence and of that god-given conscience imprinted in all of us, yet corrupted in all of us by sin. Without the guidance of religion and a religious attitude, that corruption is unchecked. It is only the presence of the religionist, in constant battle against the godless of the world, that keeps humanity from collapsing into moral chaos and ruin. If atheism wins, humanity is lost.     Dawkinsnever argues persuasively for humanism. His bile, clothed in the guise of moral outrage, against religious parents involving their own children in the practice of their religion borders on a disturbing authoritarianism. His bigotry against religionists is staggering. And he wonders why they see him as an enemy. This book is only going to push religionists deeper into their convictions that atheists are cold-blooded, arrogant, overbearing, presumptuous, rude, autocratic louts. This book is seriously flawed as a so-called demonstration of a reasoned stance against religion. Dawkins, of course, thinks he stands manifestly on the highest of high moral ground. He is as maliciously conceited as a religious tyrant. His pomposity astounds.     For all his talk of science, Dawkins never tries to make a case for reason as the final authority against all comers. He doesn't mention the dilemma that if you begin by denying the final authority of reason, as religionists do, no authoritative, reasoned case can be made for it; and if you begin by presuming the final authority of reason and use reason as the final authority to prove its authority, you have argued in a circle. (Of course arguing in a circle is only unacceptable if you want to be reasonable.) He doesn't appear to understand the extreme difficulty involved in making a case against religion that a religionist will see as germane. Dawkins' book will be seen by religionists as a pretentious atheistic assault that completely mischaracterizes religion and is wholly beside the point in its moral complaints. As for the authority of reason: they distrust it. False reasoning, masquerading as true, is too often used in attempts to beguile the religionist away from religion. The masquerade is not always easy to spot, so it's best to distrust arguments that appear to support the atheist's cause. Reason is seen as a treacherous authority, its power misused in the service of deceit. The only authority that never deceives is God.The tension that the science of evolution causes within the religionist arises from their difference in understanding the origin of humankind. It is not the changes within a species that provoke the religionist against evolution. It is the idea that species are not fixed, and that humankind as a species arose out of an entirely non-human kind. For the religionist, humankind came into being complete; it did not ascend through gradual, nor punctuated, biological changes from non-humanity to humanity. Because evolution differs here, the religionist spurns the rest. Dawkins does not speak to this concern. His discussions on evolution are of evolutionary affects within species. A religionist may be able to accept the idea of changes within a species and yet not accept the idea that species themselves come into being through change. How could Dawkins not understand this?    While reading the book, it often occurred to me that Dawkins wrote this using the wrong genre as a model. He wrote it as if it were popular science, but that's not really what the subject demands, given his purpose. In the genre of popular science, an author reports on what is believed by scientific authorities (perhaps including himself) as a result of scientific investigations and informed debate; it is not a genre in which an author needs to present a sustained argument to justify his position on some topic. When writing popular science, Dawkins can get away with relaxed, glossy, meandering prose, because in popular science, the real proofs lie outside the book, in the scientific journals and the evidence in the lab. The problem Dawkins ran into with this book is that he doesn't seem to realize the subject demands an entirely different genre, and thus a far different approach to the conclusions it claims to present. In this book he should be *making his case*, not waving his hands, casting moral aspersions, going off on political tangents, and cracking jokes.     ::: Final Remarks :::    ::: A :::The book is divisible into two parts:    Chps 1-4 against theism  Chps 5-10 against religion    ::: B :::    Dawkins' knockdown punch to dismiss creationists is straightforward and doesn't rely on science, it relies on the notion of probability. It can be stated succinctly:    [1] The improbability of God's existence is a greater improbability than any improbability the existence of God might explain. (pp. 146, 172)    This is not a new idea. Here's another version, with the same thrust, but less scientific sounding:     [2] Using God to explain a mystery is to explain a mystery by a greater mystery.    That doesn't have exactly the same meaning, because by implication it refers to explanation and understanding rather than probability. But the complaint behind [1] is that an explanation provides understanding, and that God's existence is postulated as an explanation for the existence of something that already has a probability of existing that is more probable than the existence of God whose existence is postulated to supply the explanation. Postulating God's existence can't function as an explanation because the explanation's sole purpose is to provide an understanding of how something, the existence of which seems improbable, can in fact exist. But God's existence seems even more improbable. We haven't gained understanding. We have only swapped difficulties and increased the complexity of our problem.    In postulating God's existence as an explanation, the improbability of the thing existing becomes now at least equal to the improbability of God's existence and perhaps even greater: because now the situation is that before we acquire an explanation of the existence of the thing that God's existence was postulated to explain, we also need to explain God's existence, which has a greater improbability, and we also need to take into account whatever level of improbability there is of the existence of God resulting in the existence of the thing which seems to us soimprobably existing.    Here is another version:    [3] The unintelligibility of God is a greater unintelligibility than any unintelligibility the existence of God might explain.    This looks to be similar in meaning to [2] but the mystery to be explained in [2] I interpreted as existence. But it could be interpreted in relation to intelligibility, in which case it refers to degrees of intelligibility.     Statement [3] is not about explaining existence but about comprehending a thing, having explanations that provide an understanding of it. Here the focus is on the difficulty of understanding God in the way we might understand weather, or genetics, or our next door neighbor. This statement claims that God's existence can't assist us in understanding such things because, since God is fundamentally less intelligible than anything else we might want to understand, we can't acquire an understanding of God that, given his existence, would allow us to acquire an understanding of anything else. The concern is not with understanding why or how something exists, given God's existence, but with using God's existence and our understanding of God to understand something that is less difficult to understand than it is to understand God. Aside from this, how would understanding God help us understand weather, or genetics, or our next door neighbor?    This leads to:    [4] Understanding God is not a means to understanding anything else.    [5] Science has no need of God.    Backtracking, we have similar to [3], which spoke of intelligibility, the statement:    [3'] The complexity of God is a greater complexity than any complexity the existence of God might explain. (p. 183-4)    Just as in the case of the other versions, Dawkins doesn't elaborate, he simply asserts. It's not clear how he means complexity to be understood. I'll leave the analysis to others.    ::: C :::    During a discussion on why there is religion at all, Dawkins gives a weak nod on page 196 to the concept of explanation, using the terms 'proximate' and 'ultimate'. He never refers this back to the difference between religious explanations and scientific explanations, and this justifies my complaint in my fifth paragraph. He also doesn't mention that the meanings he refers to for these terms 'ultimate' and 'proximate' coincide with Aristotle's *efficient cause* and *final cause*. As the Oxford Companion to Philosophy (p. 262) describes the difference: \\"[T]he efficient cause is what produces a thing; and the final cause is the purpose for which something is produced.\\" Surprisingly, Dawkin's refers to the Oxford Companion earlier on page 135 of his book and quotes from its article on the problem of evil from its page 255, a mere seven pages away from the article on explanation, to which he never refers.    What Dawkins is concerned with is the final cause, which he calls an ultimate explanation, of religion. He states [i] a principle, [ii] an assertion, and [iii] a theory-statement:    [i] \\"Universal features of a species demand a Darwinian explanation.\\" (p. 194)    [ii] \\"Religion is a large phenomenon and it needs a large theory to explain it.\\" (p. 196)    [iii] \\"The general theory of religion as an accidental by-product -- a misfiring of something useful -- is the one I wish to advocate.\\" (p. 218)    If every Darwinian explanation is at bottom simply that the thing to be explained contributed to survival under natural selection, then one could wonder if that is any more enlightening or useful an \\"explanation\\" than that this thing exists to show the glory of God. In other words: how explanatory are teleological explanations?    Strangely, Dawkins doesn't believe that the human need to have explanations, to seek understanding, the very human need which drives science itself, is that \\"something useful\\" which misfires to produce religion. (p. 196) Consider Kant's remarks on metaphysics in his first Critique. For how Dawkins uses the concept of explanation in his theory of the purpose of religion, see his chapter five. See also several articles in the Oxford Companion to Philosophy, such as those on causality, final causes, teleological explanation, explanation, philosophical problems of biology, biological naturalism, evolution, emergent properties, supervenience, and religious experience.    In 1781, Immanuel Kant wrote:    \\"Human reason has the peculiar fate in one species of its cognitions that it is burdened with questions which it cannot dismiss, since they are given to it as problems by the nature of reason itself, but which it also cannot answer, since they transcend every capacity of human reason.    \\"Reason falls into this perplexity through no fault of its own. It begins from principles whose use is unavoidable in the course of experience and at the same time sufficiently warranted by it. With these principles it rises (as its  nature also requires) ever higher, to more remote conditions. But since it becomes aware in this way that its business must always remain incomplete because the questions never cease, reason sees itself necessitated to take refuge in principles that overstep all possible use in experience, and yet seem so unsuspicious that even ordinary common sense agrees with them. But it thereby falls into obscurity and contradictions, from which it can indeed surmise that it must somewhere be proceeding on the ground of hidden errors; but it cannot discover them, for the principles on which it is proceeding, since they surpass the bounds of all experience, no longer recognize any touchstone of experience. The battlefield of these endless controversies is called metaphysics.\\"     From \\"Critique of Pure Reason\\" [1781/1787], Preface to first edition: first and second paragraphs; translation by Paul Guyer and Allen W. Wood; Cambridge, 1998.
B001W63DX2|4.0|Very well packaged product and a must for true Maiden fans. The documentary disc was entertaining, informative, and very well produced; the band's senses of humor were allowed to breathe throughout, and it is refreshingly apparent these guys don't seem to take themselves too too seriously.<br /><br />My only criticism is the sound quality of some of the tunes on the concert disc #2. I have a decent surround system, and in Dolby surround, what sounded like piped-in, tinny artificial crowd noise was pretty prevalent throughout some of the earlier songs. Let's face it, crowd noise does push the meter at the beginning / end of songs and at the very beginning of the show itself, but what producer or sound engineer thought it was a good idea to have this apparently added post production? Crowd shots show an enraptured audience for sure, but not one where legions of fans are contributing to the white noise din. The NFL has done this for years with their marquis big whoop events, but a concert should be about the music, no? We all know crowds get loud, I just prefer not to have the tweeters in the back of my room give me a non-band related headache due to an overzealous hand at the mixing board.
B000002UBU|5.0|If you have any kind of record (I'm dating myself) collection, you've go to have this album.  It is a CLASSIC. Right up there with Meatloaf's \\"Bat Out of Hell\\".    Don McLean was underappreciated.  Young people listen to it.  Appreciate it.  This is what music should be.
1569242739|5.0|One word- DELICIOUS!!! I'm not a vegan. I eat dairy and meat but organic only. I originally bought this so I could make a dessert for my vegan mom and my entire family ate these up. They were delicious- I have since made about 6 different varieties.  My kids love them without any yucky ingredients. You won't be dissapointed no matter who you are.
B00260HH3K|3.0|Fate.   You control your fate.  Destiny.  You are the maker of your own destiny.  No one determines your future but you.   You must have faith and believe in who you are.   And finally, to be whole you must embrace both sides of your nature.     Simple principles, but key in this fantasy driven tale of courage and fate. I watched \\"Dragonball Evolution\\" with my sons (10 and 8) who love the cartoon. We were entertained and all enjoyed this easy to understand story of young love and destiny. There are fight scenes and lots of other action. Definitely family friendly and worth renting.
0743270754|5.0|This is one of the best accounts of the events leading up to and during the Civil War that you will find.  Though more has been written about Abraham Lincoln than perhaps any other president, the author manages to cover new ground by examining this extraordinary person through his relationships with his political rivals/allies (yes, several people are both). The detail is exhaustive, and yet the text is very readable.  It was one of those books that makes history come alive.
B00005JKMQ|4.0|Liked it very much. The movie instigate me to do additional research about Ali's life and people around him, in special,  Malcon X. I have being suggesting it for many friends.
B001YV506S|5.0|Terrific movie, exceptional in BluRay. It is the story of a remarkable horse,. but also of a great cast of characters. Stories within stories. A very good \\"watch,\\" and many times over.
B0001FR3IQ|4.0|Gothika (2003) was an interesting film that I rate at three to four stars.  I remember first hearing about this movie when it was being advertised on billboards in Manhattan. These made a visual impression on me causing me to make a mental note to see this film. By the time I followed up the film must have left theaters making me think it was not well received. I subsequently saw the DVD and thought it was an interesting film making several well taken points along its fanciful way concerning the advantage that can be taken of the loss of credibility of mental patients as witnesses to a true crime.<br /><br />The tale was a ghost story, but never entirely clear about what was real and what was imagined since we watched it through the eyes of a person believed to be criminally insane. Visually, I felt it had good atmosphere, was well filmed, nicely acted out, and rapidly paced leaving no time for looking back. The sets for the mental institution were also visually very effective, convincing and frightening. There were enough blinking lights filmed to throw many people into a seizure (and give me a headache) which also added to the viewers feeling of being on edge and disoriented.  I think this was a good horror story and you may look at the reviews of others if you want to know what the story was about in any detail.  By the way, the color and lighting was monochromatic blue for most scenes in the asylum, just like the billboard and DVD jacket.
B002KECK1G|5.0|This movie is absolutely a must own for anyone who loves Government Conspiracy films.  It is also a great purchase for anyone who is supposed to read the book but would rather not spend the time to do that...      George Orwells's masterpiece published in 1949 is the classic dystopian novel.  One seemingly insignificant man, Winston Smith, a civil servant assigned the task of perpetuating the regime's propaganda by falsifying records and political literature. Smith grows disillusioned with his meagre existence and so begins a rebellion against the system that leads to his arrest and torture.    There seem to be several versions of this film available on DVD...Probably because it is available in the Public Domain.  Alot of the negative reviews have to do with the video quality...I have seen this film on the Internet in the Public Domain and this video quality is much better.
B000002UZ1|5.0|A great purchase.  This is really some wonderful music and a definate must for any collection.

0307269981|5.0|This is the sequel to the book 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo'. Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist join up again to solve the riddle of sinister happenings. It is a thriller that is full of murder and mayhem, and is sure to get your heart pumping and your fingers turning to the next page!<br /><br />This time the elusive and private Salander is in trouble; Swedish papers run a story about her, and point a finger of suspicion at her when evidence shows she was at the scene of three killings - even finger print evidence seems to implicate her.<br /><br />Salander has changed since the Dragon Tatoo; she is perhaps a little more demure and doesn't play on her goth appearance as much as before, understanding that the tattoos have less meaning to her as she has grown. Her relationship with Blomkvist is not good; while there is an obvious attraction, she avoids him due to his philandering ways.<br /><br />As she keeps out of the reach of the police, donning disguises and not staying in one place long, she begins to investigate the crimes she is accused of.  Slowly, through the book, the estranged couple begin to form a relationship again.<br /><br />This is where Larsson's skills shine through - his combination of great storytelling and his ability to deal with complex characters and relationships enhance what could have been just another crime novel. The intricacies of the characters keep you interested and at times almost make the story an afterthought.<br /><br />Like the `Dragon Tatoo'  the book does have a seedy and yet real life feel - at times it is graphic in nature, but again this is relevant and well done. The writing is excellent, and this novel really does a good job of building the characters and relationships that were surfacing in the Dragon Tattoo.<br /><br />Well worth a read..
B00006FDCJ|5.0|In my opinion this is the greates western ever made tied with For a Few Dollars More. Clint Eastwood's unforgettable performance as the notorious and dangerous outlaw William \\"Bill\\" Munny.I absolutley loved this film. it shows how sometimes we hurt someone or do something so mean and cold it just can't be forgiven so we remain UNFORGIVEN for the rest of our days. as did Eastwood. Nominee for 9 acedmy awards winner of 4 clints masterpiece is a sure classic.

I can't really pick a favorite song, I love them all..I was not sorry that I purchased this cd and I don't think you will be either.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|just because the DVD case says a new american crime classic from the legendary Martin Scorsese doesn't mean it is. so every one saying it's not a classic your wrong and right. because the several things that make a movie classic is age like the film a Fistful of Dollars (Clint Eastwood) it's old. but not just age makes a classic. Power hous performances. a good story line and the way the storyline unfolds. not to mention time. and the departed clocks in at a whopping 2 hrs 31 mins. The usual time for a Scorsese picture. this film may not be a classic now but pretty soon in maybe 10 or 15 years it will. Also see Scorsese's no film Shutter Island coming in theatres Oct. 2nd. ( Leonardo De caprio, Ben Kingsley, Mark Ruffalo.)

B000286RKW|4.0|The reason i gave this film 4 out of 5 stars was not do to the way it was realeased you know flip it over for second half of movie. it was because i found it a little hard to follow. I'm only 13 and i was when i saw it. I realized it's just a crime drama about Henry Hill's life. But i just didn't care for it as much as Scorsese's other films like The Departed or Casino both of those films i give 5 stars. thats all i have to say
044024367X|4.0|Sticking to his \\"Do NOT mess with me\\" philosophy, Jack Reacher encounters not one or a few people who mess with him, but an entire town in \\"Nothing To Lose.\\" Although it's somewhat slower paced than the other books in the series, there's enough action and intrigue that I started reading it on Tuesday and finished it on Wednesday afternoon.    Please don't be put off by the negative reviews, as I was at first. It's still a good book to read.
B0001ZX0OW|5.0|For CE this was like Mozart writing Eine Kleine Nacht Musik (A little night music.) It was another quick piece of work he whipped up up one day for the hell of it.in filmaking this film was truly a triumph. But in the ficton of Boston it was a tragedy of misunderstanding wrong timing and impatience. The performances were fonominal. Every time the credits role I love the score. But also every time the credits role I wish Sean could of been a bit sooner so Jimmy wouldn't of killed Dave. that part makes me sad always. But I love CE's movies. He almost never dissapoints. except for Bronco Billy Any which way but loose and every which way but loose. those movies I never cared for. That is all i have to say
B0025X4P56|5.0|I appear to be in the minority, but I believe this is the best eels record yet.  The songwriting is artful approach to capturing genuine, intense emotion, with sensibility that is personal and universal all the same.  Oh, and the melodies and hooks are there too.  This is one the best records of 2009.
B001ACY8D2|4.0|It seams to me that there is a bit of a controversy with this album. As this album is a departure from the modus operandi of the band's past work, ie, completely made in Iceland, more esoteric melodies instead of pop-ier work, and no english lyrics, some have called it a commecialization. I, however feel that it is not such, but an evolution. Med Sud I Eyrum Vid Spilum Endalaust is an album full of joy. Not pop music \\"dance-and-ignore-reality\\" joy, but a deeply intellectual & heartfelt joy that can only be expessed by those that believe in hope. It is at the opposite end of the musical universe from albums like Sunn O)))'s Black1, but it is how it should be. If we look only at the light, we will not be able to stand when the darkness comes, and if we only look into the void, we will forget that the light exists. This album is a great beacon of musical light, so I say to old and new fans of Sigur Ros alike, come, for a sonic feast awaits! Turn off the lights, get comfortable on your bed, and let the waves of sound crash over you like a calm, refreshing sea.

0393327655|5.0|Sam Harris, in this book, does a great job in criticizing religious faith. With his great insights in eastern and western philosophy and neuroscience, Sam does a superb job in conveying to the readers how to live life intellectually as well as morally fulfilled without actually believing in any supernatural God or falling prey to any superstitions or absurdities. The resources he cited at the end of this book are excellent stuff to read as well. Please read this book! Besides, I also highly recommend reading Letter to a Christian Nation by the same author.

The book is much richer than the BBC movie of the same name, as many nuances were left out of the televised version of the story.[[ASIN:1932859683 Verge]]
B0009XNUK0|4.0|This is (Heartbreak) Hotel, Lovely One, Working Day and Night, Scream are the GREATEST but not only omissions from this collection.  It's hard for me to understand why these songs were excluded and \\"Dangerous\\" was included, but that being said, if you wanted MOST of the ESSENTIAL songs of Michael Jackson's glorious career, this is the best collection that has been put together.  Almost the entire THRILLER and BAD albums are on this CD.  I just wish all of the hits that occupied the charts could have been included.
B00127RAJY|1.0|I have to agree with other reviewers.  This DVD is not worth buying, nor is her idea of fitness safe!!!    Your muscles NEED 48 hours inbetween training sessions to recover.  If you work out daily with the same strength training moves, you have a really high chance of injuring yourself.  Your muscles wont recover, will become fatigued.  Thats called overtraining.  Something any trainer worth anything will warn you against.  You arent building any muscle this way either.  If you know anything about getting in shape, you need to build muscle to burn fat efficiently.  You cannot build muscle without rest! Plain and simple!!    Not only that, all her 'cardio' sections are high-impact.  Which means they are jarring and hard on your joints, this is healthy for no one!  Especially those who are carrying around a few extra pounds.      Aside from that, I found the video annoying after just watching it twice.  She should have included a how to section at the beginning so you could learn the exercises before you started.  This way you have to listen to her tell you how to do them EVERY single time you watch the video.
0441017177|3.0|Is it too brutal to say that about half way through \\"House of Suns\\" I realised that I didn't really care whether I finished the book or not?<br /><br />Brutal perhaps, but this it's from the guy who imbibed the Glitter Band, narcissistic archaeologist Dan Sylveste and the wonderfully conflicted Triumvir Ilya Volvoya with depth and verve and painted from a palette light years wide in \\"Revelation Space\\" and its associated novels. So I guess I was expecting a whole lot more than a flimsy plot line that was extended way past its 'best before'.<br /><br />Throw in the clumsy alternating chapters of first person narrative and some very contrived - and shallow - motivations with paper-thin characterisations and it adds up to a disappointing read.<br /><br />And I don't think it's disappointing just compared to his other work. On its own merits, \\"House of Suns\\" is just kind of silly. And - ouch, I'm saying it - ultimately boring!!<br /><br />So the verdict...<br /><br />If you're new to sci-fi or perhaps a younger reader it's an OK book.<br /><br />But if you've breathed in deeply of \\"Absolution Gap\\", \\"Redemption Ark\\", \\"Chasm City\\" and the like, then this is probably going to disappoint.
B001GM28HO|5.0|Amazing electrifying album... Every track hits and emotion wether it be to move your feet, or chill out, with the mellower vibe.     So go on take a leaf out of my book and have a listen, bet you are intrigued now...?    We all need a bit of magical music fantasy in our lives! Lady Ga Ga has this down to a fine art.
B000053GTF|5.0|I purchased this DVD as a gift and the receiver is very happy with it. It contains songs from earlier in her career to current. Celine fans will like this one. My fan sure did!
1573300403|5.0|I loved this DVD, I watch this a lot.  It contains videos that I've never seen before like \\"Liberian Girl\\" and \\"Blood on the Dance Floor\\" as well as footage from the 1995 MTV Music Awards, where he performed with Slash and footage from the Motown Awards, I believe, where he moonwalked his way into history performing \\"Billie Jean\\".  His dancing is amazing, especially love the full version of \\"Smooth Criminal\\".<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this!!
B000H1RFKA|4.0|'80s wunderkind Shane Black updates the buddy-action movie with great performances and unexpected twists. One of the better performances of late from Val Kilmer (also see Spartan) and features a very funny Robert Downey at his best. Val Kilmer does a riff on \\"talking money\\" that makes me laugh just thinking about it. See this movie, on Blu if possible.
1439157383|3.0|This was a decent read, but I was a little disappointed by the ending, even though I believe I understand the author's point.  (Ultimately, from a spiritual or divine position, we really have no control over life and/or death for that matter.)  I still thought what happened to the heroine occurred rather abruptly and everything was ironed out way too quickly in the end.  I understand the movie changed the ending (haven't seen it yet); I hope it's an improvement over the book.  I like Ms. Picoult style, although I think I'll wait a while before picking up another one of her novels.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|Its been working great since I took it out of the box. It does what its supposed to do, has a nice bass boost feature, pretty lights, good battery life, and really solid build. The clip is made of metal and is very strong. The only thing about the product that I don't like is the volume rocker. The '-' side is really close to one of the plugs, so when somethings in there its a little hard to press. Its just a small complaint, not a reason to not buy it.
B000VBIEXS|1.0|In general I have been enjoying the Shout! remasters a lot, but in this, arguably ELP's masterpiece, somebody really messed things up with the remastering.    I have been comparing the sound of the songs with the versions from 1993's Return of the Manticore (from Victory Music) and things are strange indeed:   to my ears, in the new Shout! versions the sound in general is slightly more clear, but (big, BIG BUT) in Karn Evil 9:  1st Impression the sound is a disaster - completely muddy  (however, as soon as 2nd Impression begins, the sound quality  is fine once again).     And in Jerusalem,  even though the sound quality is fine, there is a sudden 3 or 4 decibel increase at the 1:32 mark, as previous reviewers have pointed out.  The album presentation and essay are excellent,  but its a shame that the contents of the little shiny round thing inside somehow escaped quality control.  I would recommend staying away from this one until a corrected version is released.
0525951113|2.0|I thought this book was going to be really good.  It catches your attention in the beginning and keeps you in suspense up until the middle of the book.  By then things start getting confusing and kind of unbelievable. The author builds up the suspense and you're expecting a grand finale but are left with alot of unaswered questions.  Some of the characters are missing with no explanation as to what happended to them or where they went.  It's like the author didn't know how to finish the book so he just ended it.  I have to say I was disappointed. The sequel Freedom is suposed to be out by 2010 and I can only hope that it will answer all the unaswered questions left by this book.
B001VB8UAE|5.0|By far, the greatest entertainer of our time.  There is no one today that can match her artistry and magical performances.  Although not sure how it has been possible, Barbra is a perfect example of how things sometimes do get even better with time.
0316017922|4.0|I was recently suggested 'Outliers' by a friend during an extremely busy (~100hr/wk) school quarter. I picked up a copy, and anticipated reading it after the quarter was through. However one night before bed I picked it up just for a peek, and quickly became enchanted by it. Three nights of staying up until after 2am reading this darn book, I had somehow finished it!    What you will find from this book is a sequence of captivating personal stories and objective truths. The irony of this book is that it tells you nothing that you don't already know, but the impact of its morals could not be stronger.      Oh- and you will love the ending!       -Justin
B002CAWNDS|3.0|I knew Idris Elba was doomed when he was on the elevator from the start.  He should've listened to that little voice that said take the stairs.  It didn't help that he rubbed her shoulder in the lunch room though. This Movie was like a watered down Fatal Attraction and Swimfan even holds its own but this movie left alot to be desired.  It must've sucked to be Idris Elba because he was raped by Ali Larter (Lisa) while on drugs while the other guys cheated on their women.  Man thats just sick!  Ali Larter is just the infatuated bully who makes Idris wish he picked the swing instead of the slide to hang at because she shows up everywhere she is not expected to be even in his car with revealing clothes. The final fight scene with Beyonce and Ali was epic!
0811729117|5.0|The first had account of the Eastern Front is detailed and complete from the perspective of the author.  Details of the operations with the infrantry troops explain many of the tactics and out comes from the engagements.  The one area the book is lacking detail with concerns the engagements with Allied forces in the Ruhr pocket.  The author is severly injured, recovers and then gains a combat assignment with :Hunting Tigers\\" on the Western Front.  I would have enjoyed to read more on the \\"Hunting Tiger\\" and it real capabilities as the author fully detailed with his Tiger tank on the Eastern Front.  Overall, a great book to read!
1881273156|5.0|We all know men and women do not speak the same language let alone reveal feelings the same. I now know why my marriage has gone astray. Not speaking the right Love Language can really hinder the growth and happiness of a marriage. I recommend this book for any relationship and especially for new marriages. I always said I needed a manual for marriage and this is about as close as I have seen.
0143038583|5.0|This book was recommended to me, - I was interested in some other things at the time - I kept hearing references to it on NPR, it was a top-10 choice by the NY Times Book Review, so I eventually gave in and read it.  Now I am on the bandwagon and I recommend The Omnivore's Dilemma to everyone!  It is insightful, well-researched, interesting and entertaining - and packed full of information that I didn't know about the foods in my world.  I never knew so much about corn!  And the feedlot business!  Honestly, I think most people are like me and don't like to think too much about where our food comes from before it arrives in the pretty package in the store.<br /><br />I liked that Pollan isn't a preachy, hard-hitting ideologue, but presents the facts and our choices as dilemmas.  The food industry makes our choices easy, both in fast food and in stores:  \\"cheapness and ignorance are mutually reinforcing.\\"  There are better but harder choices we can make.  And just looking for the word \\"organic\\" doesn't do it - Pollan makes a distinction that your average mom who buys at Whole Foods or The Fresh Market doesn't make:  that industrial organic food is more industrial than organic, more philosophy than science.<br /><br />This is an important book that will forever be with me now, and I am better for having read it.  Two of my favorite quotes:<br /><br />\\"While the surgeon general is raising alarms over the epidemic of obesity, the president is signing farm bills designed to keep the river of cheap corn flowing, guaranteeing that the cheapest calories in the supermarket will continue to be the unhealthiest. \\"<br /><br />\\"So that's us: processed corn, walking.\\"
B00004W55E|2.0|Like most of Rachelle Ferrell's output, \\"Individuality (Can I Be Me?) is designed to elicit \\"oohs\\" and \\"ahs\\" about how \\"awesome\\" her chops are.  This is a CD that repeatedly sacrifices feeling for artifice:  It is full of meandering, self-penned lyrics, drifting  melodies and vocal gymnastics that lead to nowhere.  Though geared toward the smooth \\"cool jazz\\" format populated by the likes of George Duke and groups like The Brand New Heavies, \\"Individuality\\" is a rambling snoozer that does nothing but emphasize the artist's eccentricities and quirks. What's maddening is Rachelle Ferrell's complacency! She has one of the most magnificent instruments to be found anywhere in pop and soul music (her multi-octave range can easily handle everything from bluesy gospel to quiet-fire pop-jazz to operatic pop-R&B--all at the same time),  yet she continues to squander her talent on second-rate material and meaningless showboating.   Judging from the album's cover photos, it almost seems as if Ferrell is perversely trying to downplay or denigrate her looks.  But judging from the mediocrity of \\"Individuality,\\" it seems as if she's trying to do the same thing to her spectacular musical gift.  Why?
0545123267|5.0|This book was the greatest book that I've read in a while. I completely recommend it. It was way better than any of the other teen paranormal/romance books out there. It was tons better than twilight!
B00005QGAT|5.0|An oldie but a goodie.    Listening to this brought back many memories.
0061780308|5.0|We listened to this book on DVD while traveling by car on vacation.  It is a delightful book, although sad in parts.  It just reinforces my belief that we will meet our beloved pets again one day on the other side of the rainbow bridge.
B00005JKGO|5.0|I never get tired of watching this film.  It's like a dream. Makes me dream some more.
B000ZEE3I6|2.0|I didn't care for this movie.  I found it to be slow and boring.  I think the problem was there was too much TALK (or dialogue) and not enough ACTION.  I just didn't feel this movie moved all that much--like a Jason Bourne or Indiana Jones movie.  I have never fallen asleep during a Harry Potter movie, but I did twice during this movie.  Not recommended.
0061537934|5.0|If you love dogs, as I do, and you've ever wondered what your dog is thinking, this book is for you.  I'm not an avid reader but I read this book in two evenings, which is good for me.  It is so filled with humor, emotion and truth that you won't put it down.  I give it five stars, but would give it ten if I could.  So warm, tender and believable...so well written.  I lent it to one person and now I don't know where it is because everyone wants to read it.  Enzo is cool!  Pick it up.  You'll be glad you did.  LK
B000LC55F2|3.0|At 2 hours 10 minutes, this could have ended much sooner and been a tauter film as a result. The ending left me scratching my head just a bit. Most of the movie is a bit jerkily edited, so viewers have to pay attention. Are we in the present? The recent past? The future? It keeps jumping around, somewhat annoyingly. The second half bogs down a bit. I had to pause several times out of boredom, never a good sign for a movie. Was it really like this in the Victorian era? I wasn't entirely convinced. I did do one double take: yes, that's David Bowie as Tesla, the electrician, though what that was all about, I still don't know.
B000OY8NII|5.0|\\"Eureka\\" is a charming and fun show.  It is filled with unique characters that care about each other and about the town.  Even though there is a difference between the genius of the scientists and the logic of the sheriff-everyone in Eureka is part of a family.  Besides the great characters in the show, something always happens in Eureka.  In one of the special features, one of the writing team mentions that each idea for an episode starts with \\"real science\\" and then gets \\"Eurekasized\\".  It goes from something that can be explained by science to something crazy.  All of these factors make \\"Eureka\\" one of the funniest shows to watch.  What makes this show really work is not the \\"funny lines\\" even though the writing is great, it is the characters that are funny.  I look forward to what happens next in Eureka every week.
0684830485|5.0|This beautifully written book is often compelling and occasionally trying. At nearly 500 densely written pages, I found my edition of the book perhaps overly long, but nonetheless admirable. It is the story of an American named Robert Jordan who fights in the mountains outside Madrid during the Spanish Civil War.<br /><br />I read the book at least once when I was young, but that was at least thirty years ago. Upon picking it up again I found I remembered little except that the earth moved, and that something went amiss during the final scene. I perhaps also remembered, at least faintly, an extraordinary tale told by a character named Pilar about the fate of the fascist in a Spanish village.<br /><br />Hemingway makes it abundantly clear that he wants to write a true book. By this, I think he means that he wants to tell us the truth about the people who fought in the Spanish Civil War, and in that goal I believe he succeeds. After reading the book, I feel a little as though I was actually there, a combatant in the war, and that I knew others who fought beside me. This is small \\"t\\" truth, synonymous with words such as realistic, or factual. Hemingway was not trying to tell the Truth about God.<br /><br />Refusing to romanticize the soldiers who fought for the Spanish Republic, he tells us what is good about them, and what is bad. It is possible, though unlikely, that I could write truthfully about the kind of highly educated Americans who I lived with most of my life. But I could never write so vividly, or so convincingly, about the kind of illiterate, or semi-literate, Spanish townspeople who inhabit this book. One understands exactly why the good guys lost this war, and yet somehow one loves these struggling, obscene, dirty people all the more for their faults.<br /><br />There are several obvious accomplishments in this book. One is the amazing character Pilar, a woman in her late forties or early fifties who comes vividly to life as complex, frequently contradictory character who is simultaneously admirable and intolerable. The description of the fascists being slaughtered in a small town by the drunken Pablo is perhaps one of the better passages in all of Hemingway. Another description of a fight on a hill is impossible to put down, and of course no one is ever going to forget the scene when the earth moves, or the beautiful language that adorns nearly every page of this book.<br /><br />After reading this book, I read Of Mice and Men and then picked up Typhoon, two beautifully written books which are perhaps significantly better than For Whom the Bell Tolls. Yet neither Conrad nor Steinbeck writes as beautifully, as lyrically, or as movingly as Hemingway at his best. It is odd, perhaps even ironic, that a man so obsessed with violence and manly courage should have such a lovely, moving prose style. Hemingway inhabited the English language with an ease and skill, that even at this stage in his career, produced prose that rates as one of the glories of the English language. Some of the descriptions of nature in this book are among the finest I've ever read, particularly when Hemingway turned his attention to pine trees!<br /><br />Hemingway's openly admitted love of violence mars this book, as do several long meditative passages about the vagaries of life, or the character of the rebel soldiers who fought with the Robert Jordan. To his credit, Hemingway's main character finally concedes that though violence is compelling, it is nevertheless evil. It is even possible that Hemingway loved not so much manly strength, as the ability to survive without giving in to the fear that can destroy a man's character, and lead him to let down not only himself, but those who work beside him. Fear must have been a torture to Hemingway, sending him into wild fits of depression and chaotic ruminations. He loved, and wrote beautifully about, those times when one feels calm, and brave, and settled. I'm not sure one really needs to face down abull in order to achieve such a state, but I have sympathy for Hemingway's goals, if not his means.<br /><br />A true description about an historical event like the Spanish Civil War is a wonderful gift to bring to a reader, and one to savor and enjoy. And at the heart of the book are two characters, Robert Jordan and Maria, who are tough and admirable. Though I think some of my feminist friends would criticize me for it, I nevertheless found Maria believable, and I think that there are young women in this world who are as innocent, good and true as Maria. If there are really people in this world like Robert Jordan, I've never met them, but I suppose it is unfair to fault Hemingway for creating such an admirable hero.<br /><br />I should confess that I didn't really want to like this book, mostly because I don't always care for the tone adopted by so many of the people who most passionately admire Hemingway when they begin singing the praises of their hero. But though I found the going tedious at times, nevertheless I was won over by this flawed book. Somehow the lives of the poor Spaniards who lived in the hills of Spain and fought the fascists seem more real, and more worthwhile, than the lives that most of us in America live today. We are many times more sophisticated, but perhaps not quite as likable, and I have to admire Hemingway for bringing these people to life so vividly, and in such beautiful prose. It must have been extraordinary to know and work beside people who fought to bravely for such a worthy cause.e sympathy for Hemingway's goals, if not his means.

B00008RH3L|5.0|Millers Crossing remains my favorite mob movie.  You might need to watch it a couple times to pickup some of the names, dialog and plot connections.  That's what makes it a great movie.  It has some detail to it.  It isn't a cheesy Hollywood cookie cutter plot.  The Cohen Bros. at their best.    The dialog is classic.  Get it!
0156027321|5.0|I read this book for a Literature class at my university a couple of years ago, and I still consider it to be one of my favorites. Though, I am one to dissect the book and symbolism within which is why reading it was such a pleasure to me.    This book is an interesting read for anyone, but it is so much more than just a story of a boy being lost at sea. The reader fully experiences his journey by the descriptive details included within the novel.     If you are a symbolic reader like myself, you will appreciate this book and enjoy understanding each of the parts of the boy's life from the two guys with the same name (Kumar) to the meaning of the Bengal tiger.
0316017922|5.0|A friend recommended this book to me when we were discussing the success of the Beatles.  I read through Outliers very quickly and very much enjoyed the book.  The book presents the idea that hard work and smarts are not the only factors in successful people.  Although hard work is a major part of success (e.g. the 10,000 hours rule as described in the book), Outliers also emphasizes the importance of the background and family history of the persons involved.<br /><br />Points of Interest I Enjoyed:<br /> - Correlations between attitude towards authority and plane crashes<br /> - The 10,000 hour rule (pay your dues for 10,000 hours)<br /> - Intelligence alone does not mean success, emotional intelligence counts for a lot<br /> - Race relations in Jamaica<br /> - History behind the founders of the tech revolution<br /> - How summer vacation activities affect student test results<br /> - What and how middle-class and wealthy families teach their children that the poor do not (remember Rich Dad Poor Dad)<br /><br />The book was a quick read, and very interesting.  The author quotes from multiple other works but presents the information in a fascinating way.

B00005QGAT|4.0|Except this \\"special edition\\" of OFF THE WALL was released in 2001, or the 22nd anniversary of its initial release.  Why do I say this has the feeling of a posthumous release?  The \\"bonus material\\" included on the album of course.  The tedium of the interviews with Quincy Jones and Rod Temperton (Zzz...) sound like they were talking about Jackson in the past tense and don't add a lot of insight. The demos were mildly interesting, but don't stand up to repeated listening.      And what's up with the lame album cover -- a shot of Jackson's legs (from the the back/bottom half of the original vinyl album gatefold) -- instead of the nice head shot that graces the original cover?  Methinks Michael himself didn't like the way he looked (only 1 plastic surgery procedure at the time the pic was taken?) and vetoed the original pic for this weak shot.  Whatever.    But what's left is the music: after 30 years -- yes, 30 years -- most of it still sounds timeless, fresh and current.  This was Michael just before the manic success of THRILLER and before life got weird.  Enjoy it for what it still is today, but skip the interviews.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|Although gritty and sometimes repulsive, featuring characters you wouldn't like living next door, the series is intense and gripping way beyond most TV shows. The story line keeps getting more and more tangled, and I know in my heart that it can't possibly end well. Serious good acting, especially by Ron Perlman and Katy Segal. They make their characters real and believable.    Yes, this is a review of the series rather than the DVD.  I am no acoustic engineer; just happy to be able to see it. I am very happy to find that this series will be available on DVD.  The last two episodes were never shown in my area, and I believed that it was not successful.  Now I hear there will be a season two.  Good.
0156027321|5.0|I loved this book.  I think some of the people who have reviewed this novel have misunderstood what the book is really about, as I did the first time I read it.  For me the book was about how people want to know the \\"truth\\" about God and religion, and how they sometimes miss the better story by while searching for the truth.  The beginning is a little slow, but stick with it.  The ending is fantastic.  It reminded me of the book \\"Big Fish\\" which has a similar theme.
1608429008|4.0|I have heard about this book for years and snatched it up when I saw the \\"Network Marketing Edition.\\"  Glad I got it.  It is everything I've heard about and more.  The problem for me is that it is a serious time investment.  There are 20-something \\"lessons\\" in here with assignments for each one.  That can add up.<br /><br />Of course, anything worth doing is worth doing right.  If you have the time, you will get a lot out of this book.  Just a warning to let you know that this isn't something you'll go through in a day or even a weekend.  It is a high-level education in the proper mindset needed to run a business (or have a successful life) and that takes a while.<br /><br />If you are willing to put the time in, you will benefit a lot from this and so will your network marketing business.

B001AQO3WY|5.0|A superior drama with excellent dialogue (subtitles recommended) using the argot of the military grunt supplemented by the slang of the working man - afro american, \\"white\\" and spanish american - to an exquisite Shakespearian degree, complete with references galore to pop culture of the time - not excluding the pudenda of Jay Lo.  A high degree of verisimilitude as a consequence.  Excellent in depth characterization illuminated by substantive acting. The book was good but this is better. My son is an Iraq veteran (grunt) and this series covers all the bases: failed strategy, poor leadership, brilliant leadership, shia/sunni conflict, inappropriate role of the Recon marines where an arab speaking, social working, military skills soldiers are required. religion,the need for repair of infrastructure, chaos in Baghdad, absence of WMD, the contempt felt for USA by the world, abuse of civilians - all covered through the grunts POV, and I guess, the imbedded reporter, who flies off in the end leaving behind the Recon Marines, a highly trained, mainly intelligent group of very fit, skilled and mainly honourable group, watching a video replay of the events depicted in the series - Brad, ICE MAN, Sgt and leader, does not watch, and as the laptop show unfolds they all drift away from watching, with regret, sadness,disgust, who knows? and their so called enemy? children, women, old men, Syrian students. Indeed, the last 30 minutes of this series which includes the almost wordless leaving of the Rolling Stone reporter, is worth comparing with Greek Tragedy where the audience is left with a feeling of pity, awe and sadness particularly if we consider the Marine, as a noble symbol that has transformed the often chaotic lives of ordinary mainly working class boys into \\"noble warriors\\". What a waste of an amazing resource these men are. A brilliant series.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|The ESV Study Bible for the Kindle makes Bible study a joy again. My eyes are not what they used to be when it comes to reading, So the ability to choose the size font I want and to be able to adjust the number of words on a line (features of the Kindle) just add perfectly to the value of the wonderful study Bible. Articles, footnotes, maps and so much more are all right there with a quick move of the Kindle 5-way controller. The ESV Bible translation is highly readable, beautifully done, and has has shown to be one of the very best word-for-word translations out there. I bought the the awesome leather-bound version of the wonderful study Bible also. I would give this item three thumbs up...if I ever grow an extra thumb.
1433502410|5.0|This ESV Bible is the best study Bible I have ever had.  The notes are easy to understand and aid in gleaning more insight and understanding from the Word of God.  I highly recommend it to anyone who is serious about knowing God more and knowing more of His Word.
1439157383|5.0|This book is truly eye-opening, soul-stirring, and most likely controversial on several levels. I think it is well written, entertaining, and moving. It definitely draws you in, and makes you think about what you would do if you were in each of the character's shoes.<br /><br />The ending was amazingly unpredictable and saddening- be prepared to cry and be shocked.
B0012GMW0C|5.0|someone asked \\"Where did THIS Journey go?\\" Well, they went on to become a HUGE commercial success by not doing stuff like this.<br />I can almost guarantee you that if Journey had continued to follow the path on this disc they would not have achieved the same<br />commerical success they did.<br />Hopefully no one takes this the wrong way but all those female fans that embrace songs like Don't Stop Believin' and Faithfully<br />would not have embraced the Journey on this disc with the same enthusiasm, if at all. Sure, there are vocals on this disc but<br />there's also some serious jammin' going on, the kind that musicians embrace and other less adventurous fans may not. This Journey<br />is not everyone's cup of tea. Having said all that this disc is a worthy addition to any rock collection, especially for fans of<br />progrssive rock. The boys cut loose and throw down. Mr. Schon in particular gets to flex his six string chops. Yeah, this isn't<br />your sister's Journey, this is big brother's Journey. Dig it!<br />[...]
B000UBMWG4|5.0|I'll leave the critical details to the other reviewers, and focus instead on the Blu-Ray disc version. I've been a fan of this movie since its initial release, and have been hoping to someday see the level of detail visible in the theatrical version-a level that standard DVD did not deliver.    I just purchased a new HDTV and Blu-Ray player, and this was the first Blu-Ray movie I watched on it.     The level of detail is simply astonishing. I found myself watching scenes over and over again to take in all the detail in the background. Simply amazing.

0307454541|5.0|I read a review of this book before I decided to purchase and read it, and I'm so glad I did. The fact that I haven't read much in Swedish literature and the genre pulled me in, in addition to this book being the first in a trilogy.     This is the best novel I've read this year.  The slow beginning puzzled me as to how this was going to be a mystery novel. The transition from a journalist's fall in the world of magazine publishing and economics into the the mystery and its eventual difficult outcome was so good, and so enhanced by the quirky and misfit character of Lisbeth Salander that I didn't want to leave the story, the area of Sweden, or the characters behind. I thought I had it all solved about halfway through, but I was nowhere near being right about what happened to a missing girl nearly 40 years ago. If you like cold case mysteries that are well-written with fascinating characters and a look into the world of hackers, you'll love this book.    I'm glad that a few pages of the next book were included at the end of this one.  I could have read on forever in this book, because the continuity of the story flowed along so well, and I hated to see it end.  I'm just very sorry that the author's works are being published posthumously. Stieg Larsson didn't get to see his books published and the book world lost a wonderful writer.
B000063Y8F|4.0|I had this garlic press for a year or two and loved it, when one day the hinge broke while I was pressing a few cloves at once. There's a spot where two pieces of metal are welded together and that came apart and the whole thing bent up. I was furious because of the cost of this press, but remembered seeing on the packaging that it had a lifetime warrenty (I made a mental note of that because I couldn't believe my hubby bought me such an expensive press for my b-day and I was convinced that they were all junk. what was he thinking?). I googled the company, sent an email, and was told it would be replaced or repaired for free. I didn't have the original packaging or receipt. I just sent it in an envelope straight to Rosle and paid [...] for shipping. I had a brand new one within a week or two. Their great customer service and hassle free replacement took all my frustration away. Even though it broke, I'd still recommend the product because it works so much better than others I had tried, is easy to clean, and I had no trouble getting a replacement.
B0029358GM|5.0|I had to put in my 2 cents...<br />Been a WILCO fan from near the beginning...enjoying every turn along the way...enjoying their music, both live & on CD [would love to get some vinyl!] and mourning Jay Bennett's recent passing.<br />I just saw them at Coney Island, NY at a minor league baseball stadium...around the corner from Mermaid Avenue [the same one Woody Guthrie lived at & wrote about...also featured in WILCO's repertoire]...fantastic show, which included Leslie Feist and Ed Droste [Grizzly Bears] as guest vocalists, as well as Yo La Tengo [the opening act]...GREAT SHOW.<br />Jeff Tweedy is the core of WILCO, but Nels Cline, in its latest incarnation, has infused the music with a delightful intensity.<br />This CD, as well as \\"Sky Blue Sky,\\" are must haves for any WILCO fan...and, judging by the size of the crowd, and the age group, the band is really developing a following.
B002CAWNEM|5.0|\\"Obsessed\\" was a huge boxoffice hit when it first debut in theatres in April, 2009, however, most critics panned the film. Nevertheless, the movie opened at #1 for the weekend grossing an amazing 29 million dollars. As of June, 2009 the film has made nearly 70 million in ticket sales. Pop star Beyonce Knowles stars as a woman who's family is endanger when her husband encounters a sick and mentally unbalanced female office worker who becomes obsessed with him. The film is similar in theme to \\"Fatal Attraction\\" and \\"The Hand That Rocks The Cradle\\" in which a woman poses a threat to an idealic family. In this instance, however, the ideal family is African-American and the villin is a white woman. Like many films made before it the wife in this instance comes across as being more stronger than the husband, and it is she with whom the audience roots for. Yes, \\"Obsessed\\" is not Oscar material, but it's great fun to watch, especially the famous cat fight scene between the two female leads at the end.<br /> The DVD features interviews with the stars and the producers discussing the making of the film. Screenwriter David Loughrey talks about assembling the cast for \\"Obsessed\\" as well.<br /> The movie is 108 minutes long and is rated PG-13 for sexual material.
B000K1P66W|5.0|While we may have mixed opinions about self-help books, this one is worth reading. It is not airy and idealistic, rather it is written in simple language that reinforces the four principles. These agreements are not necessarily easy to put into practice, but I am confident that the vast majority of people would find that the application of these principles in daily life would lead to a markedly more satisfying living experience. I remind myself of these on a spiritual level daily because I find that they fit in quite well with my beliefs. However, one not need be spiritual or religious to realize the value of the Four Agreements, and those do have deep spiritual/religious convictions will likely see that these concepts support their beliefs.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Despite the amount of shopping I do on Amazon, unless a product is excpetional or crap I dont normally write a review.  This for one is exceptional and worth the time.  I'm a long time user of game pads and have used the Belkin 52 and several others.  This one by far is the best.  The 4 main keys (adws if you will) are indented for easy finget posturing, and the keys are on the large side but still easy to use and get to.  The wrist rest for me is a awesome improvement over the 52 as it allows the hand to lay much flatter and natural, the contour is also far superior to thw saitek which is at the other end of the spectrum and lays near completely flay with no wrist help.  I do have limited uses for the screen as I look at the screen and not my hand but it compliments the lit up keys and allows easy color reference to determine if I have the right keys set up for the right game and character I am playing.  An easy example would be WoW.  I use on keyset/combination of keys for my Death Knight (blue keys), and another for my Shaman (red).  I use green/red for COD4, so on and so forth.  Setting everything up was easy enough, although I didnt bother with the accompanying disk.  I just went straight to the website, and downloaded the freshest drivers.  In this modern day and age I would recommend the same to anyone.    Another thing I found advantgeous over its competitors is the amount of buttons.  While a 52 is fine for FPS type games it just doesnt have the amount of buttons I like to use for MMO's like WoW.  This is where this gamepad really SHINES!  I use the simple keybinds in Bartender UI with the simply key clicks of the G13 for 10 second of less macro's made.  Play a Shaman?  One button lays all totems.  Play a Death Knight?  One button does all 6 attacks of a complete rotation.  Play a Hunter?  Same thing one button full rotation.  This is probably the best invention for WoW since Wow.    The only thing I found to be a extreme negative is sometimes the games will initially load with a glitchy profile, like the keys arent quite right.  I found that ALT+TAB ing out of the game and clicking back into it into the game reloads the profile and all is well.  This is only during the initial game load, and it takes all of 2 seconds to do.  Gaming isnt that life or death and hardly rates knocking off a star for me.    One thing I dont really use in either MMO's or FPS's is the thumb stick.  It isnt that there is anything wrong with it.  I'm just more of a key puncher.    Overall I give it 5 stars because for the games I play and the style I play them it offers the largest bonus to all of them.  It also offers by far the best hand comfort.  Sure its pricey but to me its the best and top of the line gets a top of the line (but still reasonable) price.

1433502410|5.0|I'm more than pleased with this study Bible and appreciate the incredible man-hours that it took to produce such a fantastic study tool.  For a one stop shop for helping you get more clarity from God's Word this one is hard to beat.  It is layed out in a way that makes it easy to just read the Word alone without being 'distracted' by the helps which I think is a good quality.  Sometimes it can be tempting to lean too heavily on commentary rather than just letting the Word speak for itself but I've found this version doesn't tempt me that way, and instead is just a nice supplement to my personal reading regimen.   Thanks to everyone who contributed to this project!
1593080719|5.0|I assumed this book was some tedious classic, and had never felt any pull to read it.  Its immense size and the century of its creation were daunting-- too long, too many words, too long ago.  I took it along however on a trip to England and was enthralled.  I \\"could not put it down\\", i was so drawn into the story and the lovely clear writing.  Mr. Thackeray was a wise man who deeply understood a wide range of personalities in all layers of society.  A tremendous and lasting achievement in fiction. Almost 200 hundred years old, but fresh and modern in its sympathy for the human spirit and unsparing depiction of social conventions.  And very very funny.
0385341008|2.0|I just finished it and thought, \\"So what?\\" Why did I just read this? It was fluffy and boring. (Not to mention it was a little strange that everyone was so overjoyed that Juliet was coming to the island and treated her like royalty and gave her parenting responsibilities after a few weeks.)
0684833395|4.0|An American classic, this book resulted in an addition of a word to the lexicon. Catch-22 is a \\"no-win\\" situation or a \\"double bind.\\" B-52 bombardier John Yossarian is fighting to stay alive during World War II. His humorous and sometimes frighting realizations of war and life set this book apart. The characters in the story are both fascinating and absurd. Heller's story jumps back and forth in time. While it works for this story, it may be frustrating to some.
B000WGWQG8|4.0|What a wonderful series!      Laura Linney gives a magical portrayal of Abigail Adams.  This has to be Ms. Linney's signature performance.  Paul Giamatti is brilliant.  David Morse captures perfectly the stiff and unassuming General Washington.  Steven Dillane gives us a truly idealistic and cerebral Jefferson.    The sets, the costumes, the make-up and the script are all first class, and are all superbly brought together under Tom Hooper's direction.    I enjoyed this whole series immensely and would recommend it to anyone with even a casual interest in our history, or anyone that simply enjoys a great story told well.    Now I will have to read Mr. McCullough's book!
B000A2RRF4|5.0|I ordered this from Amazon and I was not disappointed. This is Michael at his best. I also like the footage of the fans, because it shows the impact he had on them. This is a testament of his great talent. He has all his great songs and the fans add life to the show and reveal how real the depths of their love is for him. If you want to buy a concert video you will never tire of, I suggest this one. It breaks your heart though when you see this immense talent, and now it is gone. Worth the money for a true Michael Jackson fan.
B001PPGAIA|4.0|Despite the flair for the overdramatic moments, an overly earnest approach, and guilty sappiness, Australia is spirited, has charm and has plenty of heart. There is solid chemistry between Kidman and Jackman as a pair of opposites who have to take a herd of cattle through difficult Australian terrain and ultimately become familiar with the Aboriginal oppression.  I guess I have a bit of a biased view since I am a fan of Baz Luhrmann's work. I loved Moulin Rouge and his modern take on Romeo and Juliet, and thought that those films had such a \\"larger than life\\" feel about them. Luhrmann can take a very simple story and build it up to a grandiose scale, and he does that with Australia, with lush scenery, wonderfully crafted landscapes, and classy storytelling and cinematography. Anyone who enjoys Luhrmann will also love his use of music and songs amid the story, and he does so also in this one, employing a kind of Wizard of Oz theme to it. The song \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\\" comes to be associated with the plight of young Aboriginal boy Nullah, and although it may seem a tad over the top to some, it comes to be the \\"song\\" that that Nullah sings to Lady Ashley to keep their spirits up. The director seemed to be paying homage to the big epic films of the past, and there is a nostalgic feel while Australia that made it \\"work\\", at least to me.     If there is one knock against the film, it was its length. At two hours and forty minutes, there are some scenes that just tend to drag on a little too long for effect. For this reason, and while I still liked this film, I would rank it lower than other Luhrmann films. Still, I thought it was a solid rendition of past epics, and overall was a solid production.
B001PJRAUS|1.0|I was ready to go with it, I really was. I am not an Austen purist. I can take it when things are changed for movies, and obviously for this film things would be completely changed. So I went into it ready to just go along for the ride. Try as I might, I just couldn't do it. This was horrible! Terrible! I couldn't believe how many great reviews this got. I got about an hour and fifteen minutes into it, then I just couldn't take it anymore and started fast-forwarding so that I could see what happened without actually having to watch the thing anymore (I have to admit that I was curious as to where they were going to go with it). From what I saw it didn't get any better. Pride and Prejudice is one of my favorite books, and this in no way resembled any of it. Other than the name, I didn't recognize any of the characters. Mrs. Bennet was downright menacing, but not fun. Darcy was mean. Bingley was just pathetic. The things that these characters ended up doing were totally out of character for them (Jane marry Mr. Collins? She has far too much sense for that). It was as if the writer was focused on what he could make the characters do, rather than looking at what, if a stranger was dropped in their midst and Elizabeth wasn't there, the characters would naturally do. I felt like they just simply tacked the character name onto a character of their own making.    There were a lot of vulgar things in this movie. I am not a prude, but there are some things that I don't think are necessary (like Amanda flashing Lydia and discussing pubic hair). I had the feeling that Amanda was supposed to be the everywoman living out the fantasy of the Jane Austen addict (a chance to meet Mr. Darcy), but I feel really bad for modern women if she is truly representative. She is crass, crude, and, I am sorry to say, rather stupid. She bumbled through most of the movie, making no attempt to fit into the society in which she found herself. If she had truly read Pride and Prejudice as many times as she says she had, she would have known what was acceptable at the time and tried not to act as if she was in her own time.     I just simply couldn't bring myself to like Amanda. Apparently both Bingley and Darcy thought that she was very attractive, but I couldn't figure out why. I understand that Bingley got to see some leg (she was wearing pants) and down her shirt when she courtseyed, but I thought that he should have been better than that. Seeing him oggling her was disappointing. At the time, either one of them should have been embarrassed at the thought of bringing her into polite society. Why would they think of marrying her (Elizabeth and Jane's family was objectionable, but they never were)?     Overall, I was very disappointed in this. Crude and laughable without being funny, I felt that it was horrible. After I found out the ending (which, by the way, I won't reveal, but I don't get how that is supposed to be a happy ending for the viewer) I had to get out the original book to redeem the characters. At least I didn't buy this movie; I got if from the library.

B001FB4VZS|5.0|Always hated SMALLVILLE since it first aired on the WB (Now known as the CW) They wasted 7 years on the whole freak of the week, kryptonite stone of the year, Lana and high school crap (YAWN!), now we are finally getting to the good stuff and the clueless viewers expect 90210 or save by the bell... *SIGH!*    Things in season 8 and 9 are begining to be much more centralized into who Clark will eventually become, the universe is much more rich with the effects and action of the show picking up some serious ground. Has anyone seen the promo for season 9!? Smallville has finally grown a pair.    The only thing I craved for was to see more of the Justice League in this season... and when the H-E-double hockey sticks is Bruce and Diana showing up!?    But all and all I want.... More Clark, Lois and big bads testing Clark's abilities!! (Along with solid good stories of course.) Anyone who is basicly male, a Clark AND Superman fan and holds a ratings box... jump on board for buying this DVD set and tuning in for season 9!        TIVO and WATCH SEASON 9 ON FRIDAYS!

1596912863|5.0|Clean, funny (laugh out loud funny), sweet, romantic, simple and re-readable.  All these things have put this Shannon Hale book at the top of my \\"favorite books\\" list.  She says writing is a real challenge for her but you'd never guess when you fall into this lovely little number.  A fabulous pool-side read.  It takes little to get into and even less to stay into it.  My only complaint is that it ends too soon.
1881273377|5.0|The Five Love Languages by Gary Chapman truly helped my husband and I understand one another in our method/s of communication. Although we communicate love differently, we now know how to express love in a way that the other will understand.    Gary Chapman explains the love languages in depth, along with an introduction to the topic of love and a conclusion explaining how to identify the love language of your child/ren. The five love languages include: Words of Affirmation, Physical Touch, Quality Time, Receiving Gifts, and Acts of Service.     Chapman does an excellent job including real-life experiences from couples he has counseled. I would highly recommend this book to anyone seeking to improve their marriage.
B000BW7QWW|3.0|You can't really review \\"Serenity\\" without spending a wee bit of time talking about [[ASIN:B0000AQS0F Firefly - The Complete Series]].  \\"Firefly\\" was, in short, an amazing cancelled TV series.  It was a cross between Westerns and Scifi, what I've heard called numerous times \\"Han Solo in the Old West\\".  You had this cast of characters that was downright superb.  Mal was the captain, bitter from losing a war in Serenity Valley and secretly having feelings for Inara, the on-ship Companion who often uses her esteemed status to get the crew out of capers.  Zoe is his second-in-command, a fairly emotionless woman who doesn't hesitate following orders.  Wash, Zoe's husband, is the pilot, goofy, wise-cracking, and adoring his wife.  Jayne thinks about himself and isn't terribly brilliant.  Kaylee is the sweet mechanic who wants to be ravaged in bed by the attractive doctor, Simon, who in turned left a life of plenty to rescue his sister, River, from being experimented on.  Lastly, we have Shepherd Book, a man of God who is somehow living with these criminals and not abiding in his monastery.<br />Unfortunately, the producers didn't see the magic of \\"Firefly\\" and canceled the series.  However, Joss Whedon, the man behind this brainchild, was given the chance to catapult his dream onto the big screen--a big deal for a full-fledged series, much, much bigger for a series canceled before finishing its first season.<br />The story of \\"Serenity\\" is basically tying the loose ends from the TV series.  Simon took River away from a lab where they were turning her into a psychic assassin.  But now, the Parliament has sent a man known only as the Operative after her, to bring her back.  Because River knows secrets...secrets that are about to get the crew of Serenity in very serious trouble.<br />The first time I watched it, I watched \\"Serenity\\" without seeing the TV series first, and, while I still enjoyed it, it was terribly confusing.  You spend the better part of half the movie trying to catch up.  Then, I purchased \\"Firefly\\", watched the entire series, and fell in love.  THEN I rewatched \\"Serenity\\", and found that it makes much more sense.<br />To see the entire cast back is a joy.  And to finally learn what happened to River, what she knew, was great.  But I have quite a few reservations about the movie as a whole.<br />The characters feel...off.  Mal is so grouchy.  Where is his wry humor, glinted at in the beginning with the words \\"This is the captain. We have a little problem with our entry sequence, so we may experience some slight turbulence and then - explode\\"?  So much of the time, Mal is a brutal, stiff, angry man...nothing like the man we met in \\"Firefly\\".  He readily brings along River on a job, when in \\"Firefly\\" he would never have done that, not after the strange things she did.  And his fights with Simon, how he treated Simon and River...it almost seemed as if none of \\"Firefly\\" had happened.  Simon and River weren't crew to him in \\"Serenity\\"; something that vastly contradicts what he says and does in \\"Firefly\\".<br />Another sad aspect is Inara.  Besides obviously not being in much of the movie, when she is there, she is delegated action girl and given a gun.  Yes, the stakes are high, but the stakes were high in many of their previous jobs, and never once did she don action girl clothes and tout a gun.  She was in the back, helping Simon nurse the wounded or acting as backup or some other such function (as in the \\"Heart of Gold\\" episode).  I just felt it violated her crucial role on the team.<br />While the story is absolutely superb, interesting, on the edge of your seat, it disintegrates into a plain 'ol action flick in the last hour.  Lots of Star Wars-y space battles, fist fights, shoot-outs...yes, \\"Firefly\\" had its fair share of shootouts, but nothing on the scale of \\"Serenity\\".  I almost felt that they were included, to \\"show off\\" the film, to draw as many into the seats, wow them, and get them to come back for more.<br />There were a few other aspects I didn't like...but to detail them would probably be huge spoilers.  Let's just say, not everyone makes it out in the end.  And seeing that...makes me very sad indeed (although I understand not everyone can survive).<br />So, there we have it.  The gasping breath of \\"Firefly\\", the movie \\"Serenity\\".  I wish it blew my socks off.  Alas, it did not.  Don't get me wrong; I don't hate it.  It's okay to watch, particularly if you have seen \\"Firefly\\".  Personally, I just hate seeing the characters I've grown to love in \\"Firefly\\" change so drastically.  Many people apparently didn't have a problem with it.  Maybe I'm just weird.  Regardless, I very sadly give a 3 stars.  Bring back Firefly...the way it should be!<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S. Light*didn't like...but to detail them would probably be huge spoilers.

0307269981|5.0|This was probably the most enjoyable thriller I've read in ages.  The first book was really amazing but his second is off the charts.  I hope a great film director gets a hold of the American movie rights and does this series justice.  I'm going to try to get the Swedish production when it hits DVD and watch it anyway (hopefully with subtitles! - I'm obsessed with Lisbeth).  I blew through the book in two days because I couldn't put it down.  Thanks to Larsson, I'm now exploring all kinds of great Scandanavian mystery writers (Nesser, Fossum, etc.).  But this guy is, by far, the best.

0156027321|2.0|Before anyone sends me nasty comments, I will preface by saying I do not dislike this book because I \\"missed the point.\\" The author makes it patently impossible to miss his point by laboriously repeating it over and over for hundreds of pages. I applaud Martel for attempting something bigger than the usual drivel that is published and delving into symbol and allegory, but his attempt seemed heavy-handed to me. From the beginning author's note with its red-herring promise of a story to \\"make you believe in God\\" to its warm-fuzzy insistence that all religion is story and all story is metaphor to its flights of absurdist fantasy I felt I was being manipulated by a fake story to get me to some kind of \\"point.\\" And, lo and behold, when I got to the end, I found I was right. Apparently, many people find this book not just good but great; however, I am firmly in the minority that felt this was more a clunky attempt at sleight-of-hand than a gripping novel.

B00260HH3K|3.0|This movie barely makes it into the martial arts category for me.  The martial arts is way over the top and not really focused on.  This is strange because the movie is all about a \\"martial arts\\" battle at the end.  In fact, the final fight scene was anticlimactic and disappointing.<br /><br />The good news for this movie is that my kids loved it.  Both of them are girls and take martial arts themselves and they thought the movie was a lot of fun.  In the DVD extra features there is a training segment where they teach you how to do stuff from the movie and my girls got up and participated.  The whole feature was corny and over the top, but my girls ate it up.<br /><br />Overall it wasn't horrible, but it wasn't good either.  It is kind of fun and Jamie Chung is fun to look at.  Kids from the 5-12 range will probably get a kick out of it.  The martial arts content was sub part, but the movie is based off of an anime that is based off of a manga.  I give it 3 exploding fists.

B001TIQT98|4.0|This is the best sound these recordings have received ever.  Nonetheless, the lack of depth, air, and a bias for bright, treble sound rob Mahler's orchestra of much color and amplitude, not Bernstein's fault, certainly, but an underlining of a certain pervasive brashness these early recordings could perhaps have done without, or at least to a lesser extent.  Funny, I like them better now than I did then.<br /><br />Of special interest in this set is a series of interviews with retired players who played under Mahler. A treasure.<br /><br />If you are a Bernstein fan, of course these performances belong in your collection. He staked a claim with Mahler as with no other composer, and he remained loyal to it throughout his career.  He was not quite the \\"pioneer\\" that some made him out to be, but he got Columbia to record all of the symphonies, and that in itself is worthy of respect and honor.<br /><br />In general, I don't find \\"complete symphonies\\" of anybody with the same conductor satisfying overviews (exceptions that break the rule, Beethoven: Karajan's from the 1960s, Harnoncourt's, and Furtwangler's compilations which include the wartime Eroica from Berlin and the Pastorale from his return to the BPO concert). Conductors as a rule are better at some than at others. Specifically with Mahler, I need to admit that I don't like all the symphonies equally, nor do I find any one conductor doing them equally as well, so overall, I suggest don't get this box but look for individual items. Let's take one symphony at a time:<br /><br />First: not one of my favourites, I think it's very loud. Bernstein brings out the klezmer aspects which are cute, but perhaps more subdued highlighting would be enough. It's the \\"Titan,\\" not the \\"Jewish\\" symphony. The performance I enjoy, given that I'm not a fan of the work, is Ormandy with the Philadelphia Orch which includes the Blumine movement (excised by Mahler after the premiere), and shows the later Philadelphia sound at its best. Some critics hate inclusion of the Blumine.<br /><br />Second: The earlier movements of the symphony are insufferable, as well as parts of the last.... just when you hope Mahler is through with gaucheries, along comes another embarrasing little march. Notwithstanding shortcomings, by the time the chorus comes in, it becomes sublime. No one can top Klemperer/Wilhelm Pitz, serious music making at its best. Abbado from Lucerne a close second. Rattle from Birmingham a refreshing third. Bernstein's conception is cogent, emotional and successful in the main.  His chorus lacks finesse and awe (is it an amateur group?) so it detracts from some of the most beautiful pages in the score.  Jennie Tourel seems to be shouting; Lee Venora is efficient.<br /><br />Third: Have not heard fabled Horenstein, so regrettably, not part of this survey. Otherwise, Abbado from Vienna (Norman), slower, Abbado from Berlin (Larsson),a bit sprightlier, Essa Pekka Salonen from LA (Larsson), great clarity and passion. This is one of my favourite Mahler symphonies. Bernstein I think is better on DG. The recorded sound, even as cleaned up here, requires amplitude that the later recording achieves but Columbia didn't.<br /><br />Fourth: Reiner with the CSO and Lisa della Casa, to my knowledge his only Mahler symphony, and a great one it is, lyrical and powerful. This symphony has lovely moments, even if the end is a bit saccharine/silly, nonetheless, it is quite fine. Bernstein on DG is fine, but having a boy soprano (Alan Bergius, whom he also used in live concert with the VPO in New York) just doesn't work and is distracting. The NYPh with Reri Grist (previously a minor player in the original West Side Story and later a Met Sophie) is enjoyable.<br /><br />Fifth: Another of my favourites and hors de concours go to Karajan. He totally commands the structure of the entire piece and brings it all to bear in the climactic conclusion. ..... a stunning, moving job. Barbarolli is more leisurely but persuasive in a somewhat muted way. Bernstein brings his sense of drama to this sprawling work, very effective in individual parts but does not convey a feeling that one has travelled a musical journey from the first note to the last. The later recording is preferable to the NY Philhamonic.<br /><br />Sixth: For a budget price incredible buy, there's George Szell with the Cleveland in a live performance who keeps you at the edge of your seat. It's Tragic going on Hysterical, but a thrill to hear. Karajan excels as do Bernstein (both recordings) Solti, and Boulez.<br /><br />Seventh: I've yet to fully make this symphony work for me. Nonetheless, Abbado with the BPO does as much for it as I have been able to grasp, closely followed by Boulez. Bernstein makes much drama out of the music which to my ears, just makes it sound even more hollow, to paraphrase WS much sound and fury, signifying nothing. To summarize my feelings about this symphony, it sounds like a second rate, ingenious composer trying to write a symphony that will sound as if by Mahler. I've changed my mind about specific pieces of music in the course of my life, but every time I've heard this symphony, even with renowned conductors and orchestras, it reinforces past disdain.<br /><br />Eighth: Solti and the CSO recorded in Vienna. No one comes close. The Veni Creator movement noisy and musically messy as always and as with everybody. Once we get to Goethe it is sublime. The new Boulez on DG is superb even though I hear the live performance that preceded it was even better.  Bernstein's has drama but lacks sweep, I think that may be said of the earlier and later performances.<br /><br />Ninth: Karajan's live performance with the BPO is powerful verging on sublime. An entirely different approach, with double underlining whenever he can, Bernstein's ONE performance with the BPO is the best ninth he ever recorded. Extraordinarily moving overall, except some accents to which one reacts: Lenny no, it's just a bit too much, nonetheless a great performance. His with the Concertgebouw is also fine. Both are better than the earlier NY performance. The Walter/VPO is a must for historical reasons and it is a good performance, even if orchestral discipline is spotty.<br /><br />Tenth: Rattle seems to have staked a claim on this reconstructed work and does quite efficient work with it. However, I am very fond of the Ormandy version (the first ever made of the Cooke fleshing out). He conducts it as a feast for Phildelphia Sound..... and succeeds splendidly. It's a joy to hear and endures repeated hearings. Lenny would never conduct the reconstructed version but left two very fine accounts of the first movement adagio.<br /><br />Das Lied von der Erde: With a deep historical bow to Kirsten Thorborg, Kathleen Ferrier, Patzak, Walter and the VPO, in more modern sound we have three superlative recordings, each with Christa Ludwig, who probably understands this music better than any other solo around, and for the longest time had the richness, intelligence, heft, evennes, and tessitura to do it full justice: Klemperer with Wunderlich, Karajan with Kollo, and, on DVD with Bernstein and also Kollo and the Israel Ph. from the Vienna Kontzerthaus. The DVD is particularly moving. The set being reviewed here includes the audio portion of the dvd. It is a great performance with Christa at her most eloquent and moving. Nan Merriman with Eugen Jochum, and Maureen Forrester with Reiner are also fine options.<br /><br />Thus, don't settle on one conductor....... there was Mahler before, during and after Bernstein. My reluctance to endorse Bernstein wholeheartedly, though I find much to appreciate there, is that the hyper-emotionalism more often than not is episodic, thereby taking from the musical structure of the pieces as a whole, and these are pieces whose structures are rather diffuse to start with (except the fifth) and, ironically, thereby diminishing their emotional impact. I guess it all becomes too much about Lenny and not about the piece. But this new incarnation of those early New York recordings has made me appreciate his early efforts more and with greater affection.better than the earlier NY performance.

0689853491|5.0|I've been reading this book since my son was nearly a year old, and one of his first words was \\"again?\\" as he would hand it to me after I'd read it the first time. He loves the sing-song sway of the words, and I use hand motions of \\"over, under, and through\\" every time to show him what those words mean. When we get to the bear, he now points to his nose, ears, and eyes. He loves this book, and it's fun - even if you read it twice in a row. (His attention generally wanders the second time through, so we'll skip straight to the cave and bear.)
0679722610|5.0|The narrator is the kind of carefully observant man who notices the woman with a \\"big ripe mouth\\" hasn't rouged her lips evenly. A distinct staccato poetry infuses Hammett's writing. His description of a prizefight: \\"Smoke. Stink. Heat. Noise\\" (74). Beautiful ugly. I've known burly guys like Continental Op, the stocky Ernest Borgnine thrown in, and they talked like this, down to their memories of Butte, Montana, and her infamous soiled-doves of the 1950s.<br /><br />Hammett's is a landscape of dark imagination, the hard industrial West. The recent film noir fantasy homage \\"Dark City\\" imparts Butte's rough glamour. In Poisonville, Hammett used Montana's Butte, Walkerville, Anaconda, and the extinct Meaderville. Written in 1929, the pages are awash in booze, though the Prohibition (1920-1933) was still official.<br /><br />A perfect moment, \\"I...went up to my room for a shot of Scotch. I would have rather been cold sober, but I wasn't. If the night held more work for me I didn't want to go to it with alcohol dying in me.\\" Again, poetry.<br /><br />Having lived in Butte for years, I heard many stories of bootleggers and Butte's wild past, and knew folks whose illegal stills sometimes blew-up their cellars. Like the narrator, Dashiell Hammett worked in Butte for a detective agency, and the realism of his experiences shines through. \\"Red Harvest\\" swims in outlaw Scotch, twisted humor, and delicious authenticity. Many try to imitate, few can capture this man's style.

B001D52XO2|5.0|This was a wonderful set of Nina Simone music.  It brought pleasant memories of the sixties and seventies.  If you like music from the civil rights era this is the music for you.  All Nina Simone fans should get this set.  The DVD that came along with the music is good also but much to short.
0307266303|5.0|This was one of the more enthralling books I have read in the past several years.  I took this book along on vacation to read during \\"dead\\" times but wound up reading it instead of pursuing other activities.    As many other reviewers have noted, this book covers running from many aspects, including the alluded to \\"Born to Run\\" tribe of the Tarahumara.  McDougall covers the psyche of the Tarahumara, as well as the terrain they inhabit.  His thesis on the evolution of running man was unusually interesting.    After a two year lapse from a 25 year running career, this book has inspired me to lace up the shoes once again and hit the outdoors, strictly for the FUN of it.  No more do I worry about negative splits, repeat hills and my next race.  Now I focus on the birds and the breeze.    My ONLY issue with this book was the skipping between the various sub-topics.  You would get deeply engrossed in a subject thread and then he would hop back to another story line.  It did keep it interesting and tied the whole book together though.
B001A78JPU|5.0|And as a woman this book struck an emotional cord. I ravenously paged through Dr. Hosseini's Kite Runner because although it depicted a story of immigration to the United States very similar to my own, the story belonged to a man. Dr. Hosseini's ability to explain with such painful clarity day to day modern life in Afghanistan through a woman's eyes crushed me. I turned each page slowly, empathizing with each humiliation. My parents saved me from that miserable existence and brought me to the safety and freedom of life in sunny California. It just as easily could have been me.
B000002KXV|5.0|As I sit here listening to The Nightfly for the thousandth time through my headphones, I'm hearing stuff I haven't heard before. How can that be?  The production alone is rightfully famous.  Such clarity, so many layers, full of textures and colors; what great musicianship all around.  But it's the range and sensibility of Fagen's lyrics and composition, his singing, and his vocal and instrumental arrangements that place The Nightfly in its own category of greatness.  Like a Steely Dan record with the romance added back in and the cynicism largely deleted, The Nightfly soars musically through various genres without losing its raison d'etre: the creation of an artfully crafted tapestry of jazz, funk and rock 'n roll.  Donald Fagen has referred to himself as a \\"nerd,\\" but I would more accurately describe him as a \\"genius.\\"    Do I have a favorite track?  Nope, the whole thing is my favorite.  Although you could listen to parts of The Nightfly as a history lesson on the pie-in-the-sky idealism of the 1960's, you don't have to understand all the funny references to dig the reggae-influenced \\"IGY\\" and the lazy funk of \\"New Frontier.\\"  Fagen overdubbing those crunchy jazz-based vocal harmonies with himself on \\"Ruby Baby\\" and \\"Maxine\\" transforms both doowop and the romantic ballad into transcendent jewels.  Then there's the driving, funky bass line on \\"Green Flower Street,\\" the complicated and rueful tale of \\"The Nightfly\\" himself, and the funny, fully-realized problem of \\"The Goodbye Look.\\" As a closer, \\"Walk Between Raindrops,\\" with its Hammond organ, vibes, syncopated horns and boogie woogie bass, reminds us again that Fagen loves his jazz and walks between genres with ease. No wonder Mel Torme covered this track, as well as \\"The Goodbye Look.\\"  Yes. That Mel Torme. You heard it here.    Some say the album is too short, which may be objectively true, since it clocks in shy of 39 minutes.  But since I will listen to The Nightfly for the rest of my life and be forever delighted, it's just as long as it needs to be.
B001993Y2C|1.0|What was Universal thinking...    The blu-rays may be alright, but I've never seen something that costs so much money packaged so badly.  You get this big ungainly box that won't fit on most shelves, but I'm thinking \\"hey, I'll just take the individual season boxes out and store the big outsized box.  But then you discover that you get the dvd's in these cheap cardboard boxes that are in loose sleeves... and there's no booklet of any kind with it. I could live without the booklet except THERE'S NO EPISODE LIST.  ANYWHERE!  What if you want to watch a particular episode.  You'll have to remember or guess what disc it's on... for all four seasons.  And there's no list of extras, either.  Are there extras?  Where are they?  Does anyone know?    I think this is the most negative review I've ever written, but I feel like I've been suckered.  This set costs a lot of money, and to get so cheap on the packaging is just condescending.  I've have to think long and hard about ever buying another box set from Universal.

B001ED7C58|5.0|Love it or hate it, the film Twilight is a phenomenon -- and its soundtrack is probably one of the best in recent times. The songs were all perfectly chosen to complement their respective scenes in the film, and there are a few surprises, including star Robert Pattinson's entry, \\"Never Think.\\" (A digital download of the album includes the bonus Pattinson track, \\"Let Me Sign,\\" a bluesy, somber tune which is actually the stronger of the two.)<br /><br />With bands like Muse, Mutemath, Irom & Wine and Paramore, you know you can't go wrong with this soundtrack. One of the best tracks on the album is composer Carter Burwell's original piece, \\"Bella's Lullaby,\\" which is achingly beautiful.<br /><br />Favorites include the aforementioned \\"Bella's Lullaby,\\" and Pattinson's song, \\"Never Think,\\" as well as Muse's hard-hitting \\"Supermassive Black Hole,\\" Mutemath's \\"Spotlight [Twilight Mix],\\" Collective Soul's \\"Tremble for My Beloved,\\" Blue Foundation's \\"Eyes on Fire,\\" and Iron & Wine's, \\"Flightless Bird, American Mouth.\\" Honestly, though, all the songs are winners. This is truly a must-have for music lovers.  We can only hope that New Moon's soundtrack will be as good.
B00007LTIA|4.0|After the success of their \\"Close To The Edge\\" album, Yes had to try and top the ambitions of that masterwork. Jon Anderson found inspiration in the four parts of the Shastic scriptures. Along with Steve Howe, the four movements were composed while on tour.<br />Bassist Chris Squire, keyboardist Rick Wakeman and drummer Alan White put together this massive concept; a double album of 4 20 minute pieces, relating each movement of the scriptures.<br /><br />\\"The Revealing Science of God\\" (Dance of the Dawn) is Yes at their very best; multiple harmonies, tempo changes, Steve's Gibson 345 and Coral electric sitar alternating solos and textures, while toward the end, Chris and Alan lay it out as Rick's solo goes for broke. Along with the aforementioned \\"Close To The Edge\\" and 1977's \\"Awaken\\", this is Yes' finest moment<br /><br />\\"The Remembering\\" (High the Memory) is next and perhaps is the album's only weak point. Steve's electric 12-string opens the piece, along with more three-part harmony. Keyboard layers back up the guitars and vocals, but the rhythm section doesn't appear until almost halfway into the piece.<br />Steve adds lute for a medieval feel. Several starts and stops highlighting Rick's keys before the conclusion.<br /><br />\\"The Ancient\\" (Giants Under The Sun) is a rhythmic tour-de-force with Alan playing all sorts of percussion and Chris on wah-wah bass backing for Steve's soaring steel guitar.<br />The vocal consists primarily of the word 'sun' in many languages. Steve's electric dominates the\\"jam\\" section, which leads into one of Steve's best acoustic pieces, followed by the gorgeous ballad section known as the \\"Leaves of Green\\".<br /><br />\\"Ritual\\" (Nous Sommes du Soleil) features Chris and Alan as the mood is dominated first by an extended bass solo and then a long percussion section leading into the sweet ballad \\"Nous Sommes du Soleil\\" (we are of the sun).<br />The album ends with Steve's electric solo featuring sections of each movement.<br /><br />Early rehearsal takes are included as bonus tracks.<br /><br />Great concept, fairly well executed. 4 stars.eat concept, fairly well executed. 4 stars.

B0000DZ3EN|5.0|This movie is very special to me. I remember watching this movie as a child and my grandfather making me a bowl of ramen soup with rice. I know, that has NOTHING to do with the movie.<br /><br />This is one of those movies that you just grow up with. Wizard of Oz was a favorite but Return to Oz was even more of a favorite. The story is just so much more fun!<br /><br />The mental hospital escape, the rocks with faces, the lunch pail tree's, Tick Tock, Jack, even the wheelers were fun (well now that I'm an adult they are. As a kid they scared the crap out of me)! I loved the parts about Ozma and I wish I knew more about her. Of course back when I first saw this movie, I wasnt aware that Oz were books! I always tried to put together the pieces of Wizard of Oz and Return to Oz and wondered where did Ozma come from!<br /><br />Even as an adult, I enjoy watching this movie. Its sweet in that family type of way and its just fun to watch all the trouble and people Dorothy run in to!
B00136RXGY|5.0|I think that Annie Lennox's solo album diva is her best. I do like No More I love You's, but don't care for the album Medusa. I remember the songs being played constantly all over tv and the radio from the 90's,but obviously didn't know that it was Annie Lennox. After listening to most of the Eurythmics work, I decided to check out Annie Lennox's first solo project. Boy, was I blown away. This album is exactly what rolling stone descirbes it. State of the art pop for it's time. Why took me alittle time to sink my teeth into. I admit, I wasn't too found the track at first, but after viewing the video. I really liked the song. Very strong imagery. Walking on Broken glass is a clssic. I've heard it played on countless movies, tv shows, and a billion times at my job because of the soft rock station. I really like that song, because I had heard it a billion times before, but never knew who it was. It's got a really funny video, and the song is upbeat and catchy. Primitive is a pretty cool track. it's got a nice groove to it. very similiar to something lisa stansfield would do. Little Bird is my favorite track from the album, it's got great  lyrics and a great techno beats to it. Cold was a pretty interesting track and video to. To me this album is very similiar to most of Madonna's albums in the 90's. Especially Bedtime stories,Erotica, and something to remember. So i can see why this album had alot of success. Overall, if you like pop music should buy this. It's one of the best pop albums of the 90s!
B00132D808|5.0|Credit Rock Band for introducing me to this album: between the inclusion of Nine in the Afternoon as part of the Rock Band 2 package and the adaptation of She's a Handsome Woman into a downloadable track, I was intrigued. What sort of modern band was making such disparate music?    I found a copy of the album shortly thereafter and it slowly started winning me over, a few tracks at a time.    I hadn't listened to A Fever You Can't Sweat Out, so I came at Pretty. Odd. fresh, with no prior knowledge of the band.    After it had charmed its way into being one of my favorite albums (not an easy task), I went back and unearthed Fever, and was singularly unimpressed. It was utterly generic, sounding more like a collection of Fallout Boy outtakes than like a fledgling band trying to make its mark on an overcrowded music scene.    When I came to Amazon to review the album, I took a few minutes to look over some of the other user reviews, specifically the ones that gave it one or two stars, because I knew what I would find: obsessed fanboys and -girls who were so enamored by the band's unoriginal \\"style\\" on their previous offering that they would be unwilling to open their ears, their minds, and their hearts to an album that truly takes some musical chances and explores the band's talents in both songwriting and performance.    This is a truly special album, so it's not at all surprising that so many people can't stand it. It doesn't taste like what they're used to.    Shortly after I succumbed to Pretty. Odd., the news came out that Ryan Ross and Jon Walker had left the band, citing \\"musical differences.\\" To listen to Ross discuss Pretty. Odd., it's obvious that this was his vision for where the band should go and that singer Brandon Urie wasn't comfortable with it. Urie has said that he and Spencer Smith will continue the band and expects the third album will return to a sound more like Fever. Ross has started The Young Veins with Walker and will presumably explore the sorts of musical paths he started down with Pretty. Odd.    I'm sure I'm in the minority, here, but I'm following Ross down that path.
1594201927|1.0|I was excited to get this book because the description on the insert sounded very interesting.     Unfortunately the first 60 pages set the tone for the elitist overview that was to follow. My main gripe is to do with his unquestioning support for fractional reserve banking without addressing the obvious moral hazards of Governments giving private banking corporations a monopolistic ability to lend and charge interest on money they have created out of thin air.     He blamed the great depression on the gold standard, and not the expansionary monetary policy of the 20's (artificially low interest rates enabled by Keynesian economics), and would no doubt overlook the same problems we see today. He flew over the first two attempts by the US to create a central bank in two lines, and wholly failed to mention why they failed and what parallels they have to the current Federal Reserve central bank. He hailed Nixon's closing of the gold window without articulating why, or the unfairness of withholding a foreign nation's currency reserves (even poor countries), then diminishing the value of them through inflation.    This chap sings the praises of the theiving bankers. If you're looking for something that will enlighten you as to why there is such eniquity in the world and how the present financial crisis came to be, move along. If you're looking for something that will parrot the status quo and fail to give an objective look at the history of banking, this one's for you.    If you are interested in something that might actually enlighten you on how the current form of banking really evolved, 'The Creature from Jekyll Island'[[ASIN:0912986395 The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve]] by G. Edward Griffin is a great place to start. If you order from Midas Resources, they give you a free silver dollar with every book - worth about $15 in todays money or $1 in 1921 thanks to the corrupt inflationary behaviour of the Federal Reserve.
B002CMLIJ6|3.0|Before this film even came out, I read that they were going to make a darker, more violent and adult version of Wolverine. Hugh Jackman himself even hinted at it. Well, as it turns out, Wolverine is neither of those-nor is it memorable. The plot is somewhat on the silly side, filled with a very boring romance, boring characters and a not-so-interesting backstory on Logan/Wolverine. This movie explains the reason for his turning to Stryker to essentially become 'Wolverine' and the reason is pretty ridiculous. There is just something missing from this film that has plenty of action, but still feels empty. The scene in X-men 2 with Logan getting the adamantium metal insterted is completely redone here, and not in a good way- I thought they botched this up badly. In X-Men 2, Wolverine escaped a bleeding, distraught mess. In Wolverine, it was done rather plainly and not so interesting.    I applaud Hugh Jackman for acting as if he actually WANTS to be in this film, as the rest of the actors sort of just appear and say their lines. Jackman really puts 100% in his role and though his character isn't as described in the comics, he is still very likable. His half-brother, Victor Creed, played by Liev Schreiber, should also be commended. He is clearly having a ball with his role, though his backstory is as bland as Logan's. The rest of the characters are extremely forgettable, and that includes Deadpool and Gambit-the latter has maybe 10 min of pointless screentime. There is a silly battle at the end featuring Deadpool and Wolverine and a boring ending. After the credits, there is a little bit of extra footage as well-again, nothing to get excited about.    Also, the special effects are, at times, noticably bad, especially in regards to Wolverine's claws. It is very random though, but I can't fathom how with all that money going into a film like this, they could disregard something so blatant.     I actually wanted to like this film, but the more I thought about, the more I found fault with it. My husband, who used to read the X-men comics, has stated that the inaccuracies are pretty glaring and appalling. I was just hoping for a good, fun film. Sadly, I guess I'll still have to wait. To be honest, it isn't as bad as the horrific X-Men 3, but it is close...
B000A2RRF4|5.0|This video is a reminder of the magic of Michael Jackson. There will never be another entertainer like him.
B0009S2T0M|4.0|To describe any part of this film would be to ruin it, so I will only say that it is not something that you see every day. This is not your average and straightforward tale of revenge. It is brutal, shocking and so twisted, that it would certainly turn some people off if they knew what they were getting in to.     I suppose what I can say is it revolves around a man, who without warning or explanation, is held prisoner for 12 years and just as suddenly-he is let go. From then he has 5 days to find out why this happened to him. That is all you need to know.     Visually, the film looks very cool. It is bold in color, sometimes grainy and always interesting. I found the subtitles easy to follow, which I was glad of as some films, it just goes by way too quickly. The plot was easy enough to follow, even though you really don't know much of what is going on. Only in those last tense minutes do you get the sense of what you are witnessing.     Though I liked this film very much, looking back, I have to say that the plot is almost too elaborate for the big reveal ending. I can't go into depth here since I don't wish to spoil anything, but after I finished viewing it, I just thought that it just seemed a bit over the top. Also, I have no idea why this is sometimes labeled as a horror film- it is not. It is very adult however, with plently of violence and sexual content. I found this to be more of a drama than anything, especially after the end. People will have varying opinions regarding this film, though if you have an open mind and like a great mystery, you may enjoy Oldboy.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|I was looking through my school's book-order catalog when I saw this book. The cover caught my eye and I had to read the caption. The square inch of alloted description space barely did the book justice, so I searched online for customer reviews. I became hooked on Uglies before I had even read it! I found a nice used copy and also found my favorite book of all time. This book is appropriate for middle school and higher, but older elementary students can still enjoy it. It does not contain incredibly inappropiate material, but younger readers may have trouble grasping complex plots or longer words. In conclusion, get this book. Read it and then read it again, you will love it so much. Then read the other three books!

More of an origins type film, we get to see how characters meet and train, and fly on the ships for the very first time. There is certainly enough action and plot to keep everyone entertained but what I was most impressed with were the characters. Chris Pine plays Kirk, and was actually the blandest of all the characters. That isn't to say he didn't do a good job, but rather he was a bit on the boring side. Zachary Quinto plays Spock, and he was just brilliant, I thought. I've always said that the characters who are the most emotionally withdrawn, are also the most interesting. This is precisely the case here. There are plenty of surprises in regards to this character. He is the reason I love this film so much. The rest of the supporting cast does a great job as well. The only weak link is Eric Bana's Nero. His character is just plain annoying, and unfortunately, he is the villian so he is somewhat important to the film. Fortunately, it actually doesn't detract much from what is already going on.     The film opens with an amazingly dramatic sequence and it ends just as brilliantly. The special effects are pretty flawless as well as the makeup and costumes. There really is no fault in the technical department. Plotwise, it does get a tad confusing in parts, especially when you are dealing with time travel, but it all comes together towards the end. Certainly there is a sequel in the works, and I can only hope it will be as good as the first.
0385340990|4.0|I found this book to be a page turner, I finished it in two days. I thought the overall story was good and it was certainly interesting to learn about the different experiences during the war. I also enjoyed the facts about classic authors that the book mentions. The book is light hearted about a heavy subject, which is the tragedy the war was to so many people. One of my complaints is that the story was rather predictable, by the middle of the book it is clear who Juliet, the main character is going to end up with. The end of the book seems rushed, I think that it should have had a little more development before the end. There are several loose ends of the story that I would like to have seen some closure to. Overall I liked this book and would recommend it, but I don't think it is as  glorious as many would have it made out to be.
0439813786|5.0|I bought this book for my 9 year old daughter.  Her class read it last year in 3rd grade and she never stopped talking about how much she loved it.  She was so excited when we surprised her with it on vacation.  She read the entire book again, and enjoyed it as much or more then the first time.  I would recommend this to any child that loves to read.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|As a Star Trek Fan of many years, I found all subsequent series attempting to carry on the tradition lacking in the magic and chemistry of the original cast.  When the old crew got together and put together a series of films in their old age the wonder returned if but for a short while.  In the void were TV programs, characterizations, and films that although interesting, failed to keep me involved with the series.  In essence, I found that without Spock, Kirk or any of the old crew, my interest waned.<br /><br />When this new Star Trek appeared, I looked at the new young actors that would attempt to replace the characters that I had grown to love so much.  I asked myself, \\"Who besides Leonard Simon Nimoy could play Spock?  What charlatan would dare think they could capture the soul and spirit that made James T Kirk such a memorable character?\\"<br /><br />To say the least, I avoided the film like the plague until it was the only IMAX film playing in Guadalajara that my godchildren wanted to see.  To my delight, I thoroughly enjoyed the film.  Chris Pine (James T Kirk) and Zachary Quinto (Spock) and each of the new young actors mastered their personas so thoroughly that one could not avoid relishing in the banter with which we had became so familiar. The young talent brought to the film a youth and authenticity worthy of the original cast and one that could produce many more films in the years to come.  I only hope that Hollywood does not talk itself out of making at least one more. A few illogical sequences occurring in this film may stumble some of you sticklers who long to adhere to references in linear time especially when attempting to retrace the lives of Spock's Parents in your memories.  Remember however, that time travel and altering the past will theoretically create a ripple effect and change the time continuum to reflect an alternate reality.  This profound concept opens the door to a new future and a universe that must be explored.  These are the voyages of the starship enterprise.  Their mission, to discover strange new worlds and to boldly go where no man has gone before. The magic has returned -JC Angelcraft.enterprise.

B001EAWMGA|4.0|Having read internet buzz surrounding this film for months and frustrated over an extrememly narrow theatrical release I had my expectations a bit high for this film, so when I first gave it a spin I was a bit let down. This is not the holy grail of fantasy sci fi films and it definitely has  it's flaws but upon a second viewing, a few months later and with more reasonable expectations I was pleasantly surprised. This is a decent, very enjoyable movie. Some odd casting as noted by other reviewers re the viking king and, as also noted elsewhere, a wasted Ron Perlman. That being said I did like this movie and wish there were more like this to discover. Pick this up along with The Mutant Chronicls for a great low budget sci fi double feature.
B001V5K3T6|1.0|I fell for it, and to make matters even worst, the book is unreadable: book pages scanned for reading on a TV screen? Unfortunately nowhere in the Amazon description nor in the DVD cover package there is a warning or any info explaining that this is actually a book and not the famous movie, so it is very easy to fall for this scam. Frankly, AMAZON should return our money for allowing these thiefs to deceive us, as the DVD is classified under the movies category. I really trusted Amazon when I spent $10 on this DVD.<br /><br />PS: As of early August, AMAZON is no longer selling this DVD-Book, I guess they took notice of the scam.
B0025VLELQ|4.0|Has it really been 25 years since this movie was released?<br />That was my first thought when I heard this movie was being released on Blu-ray. My second thought was that my ever burgeoning Blu-ray collection would be increasing by at least one more movie in August.<br />I will discuss the plot later in this review but I am suspecting that most customers checking this Blu-ray catalog item out on Amazon are perhaps more interested in the Picture and Audio and the special features.<br />I have never seen the HD-DVD but have read that the HD-DVD transfer was simply horrible and was bracing myself to be disappointed with the quality of the Blu-ray release.<br />While the transfer is a far cry from anything that anyone would cite as reference quality with a lot of the scenes suffering a smoky look at times, the colors are OK with some distinct black and white levels, but on other occasions muted too much. Still it is an improvment over the previous DVD release, though it''s questionable if this should be enough to double-dip.<br />The audio has some nice surround and great bass but again is also somewhat average, so if you are expecting an audio track to rival more recent movies you will likely be disappointed.<br />The highlight of the special features is the audio commentary between director Nick Castle and production designer Ron Cobb. This is evidently an old audio track but the two seem to have an enjoyable time. There is also a Making of featurette called \\"Crossing the Frontier\\" and, as one would expect with a movie touting itself as a 25th Anniversary Edition, a new featurette that includes cast and crew looking back on the movie and their roles as mentors.<br />The movie follows the adventures of Alex Rogan (played by Lance Guest). Living in a trailer park and with a beautiful girlfriend Alex spends his time mastering a video arcade game in between doing odd-jobs for his neighbors. However, after a particularly successful game at the controls, he is visited by a mysterious character. It turns out that the video game is used as a recruiting tool of sorts to locate those who would be great intergalactic fighter pilots.<br />Before Alex knows what has hit him the bewildered teen is whisked off across the galaxy and discovers that what was once just a video game is now all too real.<br />Yes, it's good old 1980s cheese and the early CGI effects are much less impressive now than they were 25 years ago, but for a pure fun movie that does not take itself too seriously you can do much worse :)mysterious character.

0307341569|3.0|Wonderful writing, kept me glued to the page, wanted to find out what happened. The mystery, however, was much more fascinating than the solution to the mystery, which turned the novel into a written version of a bad B-movie.
B0029NY9YO|4.0|Anyone who says this movie is a complete waste of time obviously had the wrong expectations while watching it. Anyone who claims this is a masterpiece needs to acquaint themselves with the REAL masterpieces of cinema, because this is DEFINITELY not a masterpiece.  There is a very good movie buried within all of the overlong and/or unnecessary scenes and overused slow-motion. With some copious editing (maybe 20-30 minutes cut)the movie would be improved dramatically. And this is the theatrical version I'm talking about. The Directors Cut has about 30 MORE minutes of unnecessary drivel added in.  The simple fact is that what works well in a book is completely different than what works in a film, and any director who doesn't understand that, or any fanboy who refuses to accept anything other than a complete recreation of their beloved book, doesn't have any comprehension of what a good FILM is. Thus we get unnecessary or overlong scenes with Hollis Mason and Silk Spectre 1, the pointless inclusion of Ozymandius' genetically engineered cat, and more backstory than the film can handle. The one instance where the filmmakers stray from the book - the altered ending - is actually an improvement. Fanboys won't admit it, but it is.   There are other things wrong with the film, too. The music choices are generally way too obvious or are ill-fitting (the exceptions being Bob Dylan and Philip Glass). There is entirely too much gore and slow-motion. The filmmakers also seem to forget that the superheroes (except for Manhattan)aren't supposed to be superhuman.   Still, it is much more ambitious than 95% of other films. It's extremely refreshing, in this age of films for retarded people (anything by Michael Bay for instance), to watch a big-budget action movie that requires the use of your brain. Much of the film is extremely good. I would DEFINITELY recommend this to anyone who isn't turned off by intelligence in their action films, but it is NOT a masterpiece.
B00159679S|4.0|Previous reviewers have provided detailed and helpful commentaries on the various merits and demerits of this bargain box set, so I'll give only a brief summary of how I see it - in case you haven't time to wade through the longer judgements.<br /><br />For very little money, you get ten great operas in live, stereo sound. Some coughing but very few balance or audibility problems. The main virues of Bohm's \\"Ring\\" are obviously Nilsson in her prime, a tremendous James King as Siegmund and many Bayreuth stalwarts. Bohm's urgent conducting generates Solti-like excitement but misses some tenderness. I was surprised to find Adam's Wotan more adequate than I had feared, although he's no George London or Hans Hotter. The \\"Tristan\\" is often adjudged the best yet: it's still my favourite despite Windgassen's bleatiness of tone. The \\"Dutchman\\" is very fine, ditto the \\"Tannhauser\\" and the \\"Lohengrin\\" again one of the very best on the market. (I have reviewed the latter two separately under their individual titles.) The weaknesses are Levine's agonisingly etiolated tempi in the \\"Parsifal\\", with Hofmann as the eponymous hero much grittier than he was with Karajan, and a \\"Meistersinger\\" let down by an anonymous Eva and a hopelessly ugly-voiced Walter in Jean Cox - but Ridderbusch is good, despite tiring a bit towards the end. The conducting and supporting cast are very satisfactory.<br /><br />So there you are: nearly every performance here provides much pleasure as a document of the great Bayreuth tradition - but you'll need another \\"Parsifal\\" and a \\"Meistersinger\\"; I would suggest Kubelik's in both cases (see my reviews).<br /><br />NB: there is a mistake in the accompanying booklet and product details: all of Boehm's \\"Ring\\" here is from the two, live 1966-67 cycles (see below in the comments section), even though it says \\"Das Rheingold\\" and \\"Siegfried\\" are from 1971; they're not.
1400095204|5.0|This book was so intense and gripping that I literally became sick to my stomach reading it. I couldn't put it down and it's been haunting me for days afterward. Not for the faint of heart but for true lovers of literature. I've read over 60 books this year and this was by far and away the best one.

078693123X|3.0|This book was kind of like eating a dessert--it's tasty, but you feel a little guilty because it's probably bad for you. This book has good action sequences, which are always fun to read, but the rest of it suffers from implausible explanations and poorly constructed relationships.    The entire motivating force behind this story is that Drizzt is different--he has a moral compass unlike the rest of his race. However, the explanation for that unique morality is rather simplistic and naive--he was born with it. Morality is something that differs from culture to culture, person to person. And the reason that morality differs, is because of your environment, and how you were raised. That's just how it is. No one is born 'bad' or 'good.'  Yet this is what we're expected to believe in this book. Maybe that explanation suffices for an adolescent reading this book, but as an adult, it was disappointing.    I also got the feeling that I was reading just a shell outline of a book. Maybe due to the fact that no one ever eats anything, no one ever works at a craft or produces anything, and nothing is ever done except training and killing your fellow drow.  The overall feel is an incomplete world where you don't really see how it could sustain itself. Also, the magic system is very loosely defined.  In order for a magic system to feel real, it should be firmly rooted in the world, with at least semi-defined limits and some sort of explanation for its workings. A very limited explanation is given, and almost no limits are defined. When any explanation _was_ given, it felt almost like a D&D type of explanation just to 'define' the race and let you know what magical powers every member has, and what magical equipment they use. Very cursory and lazy.    Only 2 types of relationships exist: master/slave and higher-ranking/lower-ranking. That's it. The range of emotions displayed are anger, hatred, disgust, jealousy, and contempt. No one has any friends beyond strategic alliances, and no one loves anyone. Even in a dark world filled with evil creatures, it appears as if this race should have long ago died out judging by the pace of their reproduction vs. their killing.    Lastly, the only real redeeming features of this book are the action, and the main character, Drizzt. Luckily, I'm a sucker for good action and a powerful main character. Salvatore writes action scenes well and Drizzt is an interesting character. These 2 factors drive you on through the book, so it's very rarely boring. Overall I gave it 3 stars because you keep reading to see what Drizzt does next, but the book is too lacking in other areas to rank it higher.
0312330537|4.0|The book immediately drew me in!  The characters are beautifully developed and the story unfolds in a unique and clever way.  At times it made me want to close it and run the other way, much like closing my eyes during parts of a movie that are too hard to see!  It's an easy read and very entertaining!

B002CAWNDS|3.0|In the Spring of 2009, the obsessed psychopath film known as \\"OBSESSED\\" made its way to theaters.<br /><br />The film would be directed by Steve Shill (\\"Dexter\\", \\"The Tudors\\" and \\"Law & Order: Criminal Intent\\"), featuring a screenplay by David Loughery (\\"Lakeview Terrace\\" and \\"Money Train\\"), music by composer James Dooley (\\"Pushing Daisies\\") and cinematography by Ken Seng (\\"Quarantine\\" and \\"The Poker House\\").<br /><br />\\"OBSESSED\\" would star Idris Elba (\\"The Human Contract\\", \\"28 Weeks Later\\" and \\"American Gangster\\"), pop singer Beyonce Knowles (\\"Dreamgirls\\", \\"The Pink Panther\\", \\"The Fighting Temptations\\" and \\"Austin Powers in Goldmember), Ali Larter (\\"Heroes\\", \\"Resident Evil: Extinction\\", \\"Final Destination 2' and \\"House on Haunted Hill\\"), Jerry O'Connell (\\"Do Not Disturb\\", \\"Samantha Who?\\" and \\"Crossing Jordan\\") and Christine Lahti (\\"Jack & Bobby\\" and \\"Chicago Hope\\").<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"OBSESSED\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (with an aspect ratio of 2:40:1).  The picture quality is quite solid, with plenty of detail on the characters, Derek's office and home. Director of Photography Ken Seng, does a good job of capturing the two areas of Derek by making sure the colors are different.  Colors for Derek's office are more towards the blues while his home is more Earth tones and natural.  Blacks colors are nice and deep and overall, picture quality is quite vibrant during the outdoor scenes and colors look strikingly beautiful throughout the film.  There is adequate detail seen throughout the film and I found no digital artifact compressions.  Grain was subtle and overall, a beautiful looking film.<br /><br />As for audio quality, \\"OBSESSED\\" is featured in English, French and Portuguese Dolby TrueHD 5.1 (and Spanish 5.1).  The film is primarily a dialogue driven film and mostly everything is center and front channel driven.  Along with the dialogue, you get composer James Dooley's haunting music playing during the intense scenes during the film.  Also, you get quite a bit of contemporary music such as Estelle's \\"American Boy\\" playing nice and clear.<br /><br />As for subtitles, the film is presented in English, English SDH, French, Portuguese and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"OBSESSED\\" comes with a second disc which is the Digital Copy of the film.  The first disc comes with the following special features (all in High Definition):<br /><br />  *<br />  * Playing Together Nicely - (15:37) An interview with director Steve Shill, screenwriter David Loughery and the various talents on the film.  Everyone talks about what they enjoyed about doing this film and working with each other.<br />  * Girl Fight - (11:13) The film had to have a major climax and that is the confrontation between Sharon and Lisa and the \\"Girl Fight\\".  This was a scene that had to be planned quite well and look effective.  So, through this featurette, we get to learn how this major scene was shot.<br />  * Obsessed: Dressed to Kill - (9:30) Interview with John Gary Steel and Ken Seng about the look of the film.  And an interview with Maya Lieberman, the costume designer and why she selected certain clothing for the main talents.<br /><br />I do wish there was a commentary track because I wanted to hear if there were changes from the actual screenplay and the final cut.  Also, with the various scenes of the city, if a lot of it was stock video. It would have been a nice addition to hear from the director, screenwriter or cinematographer.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"OBSESSED\\" was a film that didn't do that well when it came to critic reviews but in the box office, the film debuted at #1 for the weekend of April 2009 and has grossed over $71 million worldwide.<br /><br />The film is essentially a springboard for Beyonce Knowles, the actress.  We have seen her in various comedy and dramatic films but this is the first time we would see her partake in film that required action scenes on her part.  On one hand,Beyonce fans can appreciate her growing acting range.  But on the other hand, part of the problem with \\"OBSESSED\\" is that it will be compared to a classic psychopath film \\"FATAL ATTRACTION\\".<br /><br />Where \\"FATAL ATTRACTION\\" lays groundwork of the stages of how a woman scorned through a one night stand, becomes obsessed and ends up doing the unthinkable.  \\"OBSESSED\\" is a film that is much harder to accept.  We don't know why Lisa is so obsessed over Derek.  Before they started working together, she's already has some attraction to him.  I thought that there would be groundwork of why this woman is sick and obsessed but we never find out.  It's just a woman obsessed with a man and doing whatever it takes to be with him.<br /><br />The other problem is that the film focuses on Derek for the majority of the film.  Derek working with Lisa and having to deal with the situations that arise from Lisa's lies.  But during final half of the film, it seems that Derek becomes less important and a switch is made from being a main character and all of a sudden a supportive role, giving Beyonce the main lead to showcase her acting through action and becomes more of a film about a wife who will not stand for this psychopath to disrupt her family.  Because of this, the pacing of the film suffers and although it does work, it's not as effective.  But despite the plot falling short, for the most part, Idris Elba, Ali Larter and Beyonce Knowles do a fine job.<br /><br />In the end, \\"OBSESSED\\" is a slick film that will unfortunately be compared to \\"FATAL ATTRACTION\\" but it's best to move far from the comparisons and enjoy the film for what it is.OBSESSED\\" is that it will be compared to a classic psychopath film \\"FATAL ATTRACTION\\".

B00267QOEQ|3.0|Back in 1998, comedian Adam Sandler was coming from a string of solid box office hits such as \\"Happy Gilmore\\" and \\"The Wedding Singer\\".<br /><br />Sandler would return with \\"THE WATERBOY\\", a film that proved that despite how crude the humor a film may be, people just want to laugh and have a good time.  And sure enough, the film would rake in over $160 million dollars in the US and signified Adam Sandler as box office draw.<br /><br />The film was directed by Frank Coraci (director of \\"The Wedding Singer\\", \\"Around the World in 80 Days\\" and \\"Click) and a screenplay by Sandler and Tim Herlihy (\\"Bedtime Stories\\", \\"Mr. Deeds\\", \\"Little Nicky\\", \\"Big Daddy\\" and \\"The Wedding Singer\\").  Also, featuring music by Alan Pasqua and cinematography by Steven Bernstein (\\"Corky Romano\\", \\"Scary Movie 2' and \\"Bulletproof\\").<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"THE WATERBOY\\" receives its first 1080p High Definition transfer (1:85:1 aspect ratio) and for a film made eleven years ago, the film looks great on Blu-ray.  With a large part of the film shot outdoors, you can see the bright colors from the various football teams to natural skin tones for the characters.  Day time scenes in particular reveal plenty of the film's fine details across the board. You can also pick up a lot of detail from the grass on the football field, to the griminess of the run down home that Bobby's mother lives in and more.  Vivid contrast gives daytime exteriors and low-lit interiors a really good amount of depth. Blanks are are nice and deep.<br /><br />As for the soundtrack, \\"THE WATERBOY\\" sports a lossless English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack (also French 5.1 and Spanish 2.0 Dolby Digital).  Although primarily a dialogue-driven film that uses the center channel and is heard clearly, there is occasional music that utilizes the front channel speakers.  It's not until you start getting into the football games where the team gets more of an audience and scenes with crowds, where you hear the surrounds being utilized.  The film doesn't have an immersive soundtrack compared to other sports-based films on Blu-ray but the audio is nice and clear and overall, satisfactory for this film.<br /><br />As expected from a Disney release (via Touchstone Home Entertainment) on Blu-ray, the transfer is gorgeous.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />There are no special features included on this Blu-ray release of \\"The Waterboy\\".<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"THE WATERBOY\\" is one of those films that people will either love or hate it.  Since this is one of the earlier Adam Sandler films, he has a nack of playing parts that are just outrageously funny but at the same time, some people may find it too idiotic for their taste.  So, suffice to say, if you are the latter, more than likely this film is not going to appeal to you.<br /><br />But for those who have enjoyed his films, \\"THE WATERBOY\\" is just hilarious and is a Sandler classic!<br /><br />Adam Sandler's \\"Bobby Boucher\\" is a stuttering mama's boy that is definitely going to make you laugh.  Granted, he has a speech impediment but its not his way of talking but the way he was raised, the way he thinks and although innocent, it just comes off as idiotic.<br /><br />The whole film just made me laugh and although people in Southern Louisiana may not like how they were characterized in this film (living in the swamp and eating dead animals, a hillbilly which no one knows what the heck he's saying as the assistant head coach and cheerleaders inebriated, a man who looks like Colonel Sanders as a professor, etc.), I guess if you can take this comedy and not be so serious about it, you can easily be amused.  Especially if you are a sports fan.<br /><br />The Blu-ray release of \\"THE WATERBOY\\" definitely has its positive marks for its HD transfer.  The picture quality and lossless audio are awesome but I was surprised there are no special features.  I would have loved to hear Coraci, Tim Herlihy or Adam Sandler come back anddo an audio commentary or some sort of behind-the-scenes featurette.<br /><br />So, for those who own the previous DVD and are wondering if its worth the double dip, it all comes down to whether or not you want to watch the film in High Definition.<br /><br />Back then and even today, Adam Sandler films will be love or hate for many viewers but the sheer amount of outrageous comedy from this film is what made it so hilarious.  And for a film that came out in 1998, it manages to retain its humor and craziness eleven years later.<br /><br />\\"THE WATERBOY\\" is just hilarious and crazy but overall, an enjoyable film on Blu-ray!D and are wondering if its worth the double dip, it all comes down to whether or not you want to watch the film in High Definition.

B00000634J|4.0|John Lennon is a musical legend, but one doesn't need me to say that. Spanning a career with the Beatles and one of the finest solo careers one can imagine, not to mention one of the finest songwriters to ever grace the earth, John Lennon could truly do it all.     1997's 'Lennon Legend: The Very Best of John Lennon,' released on Parlaphone/EMI, is a great overview of Lennon's solo career. With 20 songs and a total time of 77:30, some of Lennon's best is collected here. The thing is, this actually is somewhat unnecessary now. And unfortunately, it was unnecessary in 1997. Why, you may ask? Read on.     I'll start with the positives of this disc. If you want 20 of John Lennon's best solo songs in one sitting, 'Lennon Legend' is a great option. 'Mother,' 'Jealous Guy,' 'Power to the People,' 'Cold Turkey,' his legendary song about his heroin addiction, and his signature song, 'Imagine' can all be found here. And, the sound quality on this disc is outstanding!     But there are still plenty of negatives. 1989's soundtrack to the documentary based on Lennon's life, 'Imagine' is the best Lennon overview on the market, because it spans some of his material with The Beatles and it also includes several rarities. That's a great disc to own if you want just one disc of Lennon's.    Another soundtrack to another Lennon documentary film, 'The US Vs. John Lennon,' released in 2007, is also a great disc, but it too spans only his solo career, 1969-1980. However, that collection has 21 songs and it too contains rarities, making that a better option for a casual fan.     Overall, there are plenty of better options than 'Lennon Legend' in 2009. For a fan that wants a career spanner, go check out the soundtrack to 'Imagine.' For a fan that wants a compilation spanning Lennon's solo years only, go for 'The US Vs. John Lennon.' Both contain some rarities and the bottom line is, both are better options. But this gets four stars just because it's John Lennon, and everything here is EASILY ten star material.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|I truly believe this is Tim Robbins' best performance...and perhaps the same is true of Morgan Freeman. The film centers on those we encounter in life and assume to be the good versus those who we are predisposed to believe evil. Juxtaposed brilliantly, we clearly find our assumptions have been manipulated and even violated by the institutions we trust. It is a movie of redemption, but not in the manner one would predict at the movie's onset.

1589944607|5.0|I'll be honest - I don't like the show (eek!).     But this cut-throat semi-cooperative game is a blast, and I'll happily tolerate the thin layer of BSG 'fluff' if that's what it takes to have a play.     Everyone plays an officer on television's most emo starship - and like the show, some of the players may actually be Cylons (AND might not even know it).  Against this backdrop of total paranoia, everyone must constantly battle (or secretly aid) disasters - resource shortages, political uprisings and romantic entanglements (not really).    The game takes only a few minutes to learn (at least, the core rules), but can be played over and over again. The mechanic makes sure that everyone is involved - there's no role for passive observers. The tension and the action keep everyone at the edge of their seats - although good strategy goes a long way, the game's unpredictable nature means that everything can change in a heartbeat.
B000SFJWLU|5.0|This album has to be one of the best metal albums to come out for a long time.  The music is hard and mostly fast paced.  The vocals sound unbelievable and carry a range of diversity throughout entire songs.  I listened to them when they were Motograter and Ghost Machine.  Although their previous work was good, this is better.  There isn't much else to say.  No metalhead should deny this album as one of the best progressive metal albums.
0375842209|5.0|The story is told by the narrator \\"Death\\".  He first meets Liesel Meminger when he comes to get her little brother.  He is fascinated by her for some reason and follows her life.  Illiterate, Liesel steals t book \\"A Grave Digger's Manual\\" from the men burying her brother.  This book is used by her foster father to teacher her how to read.  It is one of many books she steals as books become more important to her.  This book is beautifully worded, which is great since the underlying theme seems to be how important words are, and the good or damage they can do. Set during the time of Hitler it describes the plight of so many during that period.  I was touched by how loving and caring her foster father was and angered by how abusive her foster mother was.  I gave this book a rating of 5  out of 5 and will highly recommend it.

0060775858|4.0|This is a pretty good bedtime book because it exudes a very mellow mood. Some of the illustrations are also quite nice and children are drawn to some of the images - the moon, fire, mouse, etc. I personally find the book a bit boring and overrated, but my kids seem to like it fairly well, and as I said, it's a good book in terms of being relaxing before bedtime.
B00000255O|5.0|This is a must have for any jazz collector, as a audiophile I find the original release CK-33812 on Columbia (Sony) CD the best sounding and extremely close to the original vinyl mix. The Columbia Jazz Masters (Remastered) Series would be my next choice.<br /><br />In my opinion Man-Child is the funkiest album of Herbie Hancock's early jazz/funk/fusion era, the grooves start off with the funk fusion guitar  \\"Hang Up Your Hang Ups,\\" and the beat just keeps jamming until the album's end. \\"Sun Touch\\" and \\"Bubbles\\" are slower, but funky cool smooth.<br /><br />Herbie is the star on keyboards, but guitarist Wah Wah Watson's presence is what puts a new shine on this recording. Others among the all-star players of soloists and accompanists include Wayne Shorter on soprano sax, Stevie Wonder on chromatic harmonica, Ernie Watts Sax and Bennie Maupin on woodwinds.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and get the original CK-33812 on Columbia CD before the price goes up. This copy is Out of Print and will be the audiophile collectible I personally believe.  -Audiostar
B0002F6AH0|5.0|If you enjoy reading and watching anything about WWII this is a must buy. Produced in Great Britian this is the definitive WWII documentary. It does have a British slant to it but until America or someone else produces a more detatiled account, this is THE documentary to watch about WWII. Sir Lawrence Olivier is a great narrator and lends the dramatic element to it without going overboard. Great interviews with the famous people of WWII to the common citizens who had to endure all the hardships of war.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|The original songs are really great. I don't care much for the remix versions and don't listen to them.

B001PA0FFO|5.0|This subtle film earned Oscar nominations, yet failed to make much of a splash at the box office. I was intrigued by the premise of a priest suspected of impropriety with an altar boy, but also put off by this subject that's been in headlines for the past decade. My wife and I finally decided to give it a chance, and we were both blown away by the story's layers, themes, and stellar acting on the parts of all involved.<br /><br />\\"Doubt\\" is not a movie to provide easy answers. It sets out to uncover our prejudices and assumptions, our rigid rules, and then upsets them with a powerful story of an accused priest and the accusing Sister of Mercy, the principal of a small school in the Bronx. Between these two opponents, played to perfection by Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Meryl Streep, a kind-hearted nun provides the warmth this film needs. Amy Adams is amazing in this part, bringing depth despite the restraint required in the role. Rounding out the ensemble cast, Viola Davis plays the role of the altar boy's mother with empathy, depth, and heartrending honesty.<br /><br />The film opens with a sermon about doubt and its ability to strengthen. Throughout the film, our own doubts are stirred. We're made uncomfortable. We must think through our initial suspicions, realizing that many of life's situations require us to act even when we are not sure about something. How can a principal ignore the welfare of her own student? On the other hand, how can a well-meaning priest be blackmailed without any apparent evidence? These are only the first of many questions to be answered, and yet \\"Doubt\\" refuses to offer up easy explanations, instead requiring us to ponder these themes and come to our own conclusions.<br /><br />I loved the uncertainties of this film. With incredible acting and sure-handed directing, \\"Doubt\\" proves that not all American films are about car chases and explosions, that not all moviegoers check out their brains as they enter the theater. The villains and heroes are not always who we expect, and even those watching this film might disagree on who filled those stereotypical roles. It's this uncertainty that makes \\"Doubt\\" so powerful.we expect, and even those watching this film might disagree on who filled those stereotypical roles. It's this uncertainty that makes \\"Doubt\\" so powerful.
B00003CXB4|5.0|Who can say that they didn't shed a tear when Mufasa died, i love this movie, it was a wonder buy!!
B001SGEUNI|5.0|I did not know what to expect when I was on my way to see this band in concert, but after I did I made sure my next purchase was of their album. I saw this band live in a small bar in Scottsdale and I have to say it was one of the best shows I have been to in years. Their live performance was just as good as this CD. Lzzy's voice is way more powerful than you would expect to come from such a petite girl, and she definitely knows how to use it. All of the band is great, with the guitar and drums being extremely well played and the bassist keeping subtle but still just as good as the rest of them. While some may think that this band is more pop, I have to say that they do know how to rock, and you can't stop yourself from nodding along to \\"I Get Off\\" or \\"It's Not You.\\"
B00004RF8J|5.0|This was a movie i grew up on, and i was glad to own it again, thanks.
0316168815|5.0|This is a remarkably chilling and disturbing, yet surprisingly comforting story. Such an unusual concept--the heroine, Susie, is already dead and observing everything from heaven, which allows her a virtually omnicient point of view. But instead of the detached feeling we often get from stories told from that perspective, this is very much Susie's personal story. From her unique perspective we are able to see, and feel, the almost endless ramifications of her personal tragedy--how many lives she has touched by the time of her death at age 14 and continues to touch.<br /><br />\\"The Lovely Bones\\" is one of those books that defies categorization as a either a YA or Adult novel. Brilliant, edgy, and freshly conceived, this story's gripping message is both ageless and timeless.<br /><br />Sarah Bruce Kelly<br />Author of THE RED PRIEST'S ANNINA
