B004DLPXAO|3.0|Pros: Bookmarks are easy to make and the interface is nice.<br />Cons: I wish users could sort by author (like a bookstore).<br /><br />Overall I like it well enough because it serves its purpose and provides me a method of reading the e-books purchased from Amazon.  Now if only the prices of e-books would become more reasonable...
B0081L37Z0|2.0|The movie is not anything like the TV series with Depp in case anyone was wondering. TV series aside, the movie is supposed to be comedy with bits of action. Unfortunately, it didn't really start getting funny until the end. There's lots of crude language/jokes that tries to pass off as funny. If you're bored and have nothing else to watch then this is the time waster for you.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|No serious Beatles fan (like me) should be without this set. The sound quality is astonishing and the discerning ear will notice subtle nuances and details that have never been audible before. In regular stereo it is sublime. On a 5.1 or 7.1 sytem the impact is even greater. The result is a presence and realism that brings one almost physically close to the actual studio performances, right down to the acoustics of the room. One gains an even greater appreciation of the musical complexity and the absolutely superb production by George Martin with these perfect remasters. This was given to me as a gift (one that I had asked for, and not too subtly!)and it keeps on giving upon each listening.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is an awesome app-I keep it on my favorites on my kindle fire. Large numbers and easy to use.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I loved these books and could not put them down. The writing was mediocre at best, but the story and characters held me.  No Pulitzer here, but a super fun read.
1468161660|5.0|I'd say this book is a must read. I've already recommended it to several people. The characters and story line grab your attention and keep you turning the page. Definitely a great first novel, can't wait to read the Point of Retreat tomorrow and any more to come!
B005LAII5I|5.0|\\"The Expendables 2\\" is great! This is how the story goes: The Expendables are back and this time it's personal... Barney Ross, Lee Christmas, Yin Yang, Gunnar Jensen, Toll Road and Hale Caesar -- with newest members Billy the Kid and Maggie aboard -- are reunited when Mr. Church enlists the Expendables to take on a seemingly simple job. The task looks like an easy paycheck for Barney and his band of old-school mercenaries. But when things go wrong and one of their own is viciously killed, the Expendables are compelled to seek revenge in hostile territory where the odds are stacked against them. Hell-bent on payback, the crew cuts a swath of destruction through opposing forces, wreaking havoc and shutting down an unexpected threat in the nick of time -- six pounds of weapons-grade plutonium; enough to change the balance of power in the world. But that's nothing compared to the justice they serve against the villainous adversary who savagely murdered their brother. That is done the Expendables way....<br /><br />The cast led by Sylvester Stallone (who also co-wrote the screenplay) (as Barney Ross), Jason Statham (as Lee Christmas), Jet Li (as Yin Yang), Dolph Lundgren (as Gunner Jensen), Chuck Norris (as Booker), Terry Crews (as Hale Caesar), Randy Couture (as Toll Road), Liam Hemsworth (as Billy the Kid), Jean-Claude Van Damme (as Vilain), Bruce Willis (as Church), Arnold Schwarzenegger (as Trench), Nan Yu (as Maggie) & Scott Adkins (as Hector) is great. The directing by Simon West is great. The story by Ken Kaufman, David Agosto & Richard Wenk & the screenplay by Stallone & Wenk is great.<br /><br />The music by Brian Tyler is great. The cinematography by Shelly Johnson is great. The film editing by Todd E. Miller is great. The casting by Marianne Stanicheva is great. The production design by Paul Cross is great. The art direction by Adam A. Makin, Ivailo Nikolov, Ivan Ranghelov & Sonya Savova is great. The costume design by Lizz Wolf is great. The stunts coordinated by Dian Hristov, Noon Orsatti, Chad Stahelski, Stanimir Stamatov & Teodor Tsolov, fights coordinated by Don Thai Theerathada is great. The set dressings by Jaime Fernandez, assistant set decoration by Nikolai Nikolov & set dressings coordinated by Vasilena Boneva is great. The special effects supervised by Alexander Gunn & Ivo Jivkov is great. The visual effects supervised by Danail Hadzhiyski, Ajoy Mani, Stalin Saravanan & Stefan Tchakarov, coordinated by Kiril Georgiev, Vladimir Nikolov, Milena Peneva, Iavor Radev & Plamen Statev is great.<br /><br />This is a fun and entertaining action film that does keep you entertained and is at times, funny as well. This is also a great sequel that is better than its original. Stallone and his crew is solidly great in this one, with a solid villain in Van Damme's Vilain. This is also a great action film that is perfectly positioned in the dog days of the summer season.
B005DOL0R0|4.0|I love that the sleeve is small and not bulky. It fits perfect in my purse so I can bring it places with me. It is not a hard cover so it does not protect the kindle, but it worked out great for travel
0375703764|5.0|This book is completely enthralling...gripping.<br /><br />I'm merely writing this review to give potential readers a chance to understand why [I believe] any negative reviewers are either 1) dead wrong about the fact that this story is not at all horrifying or \\"scary,\\" as they expected, or 2) are reading the book completely wrong.<br /><br />This book is not a book in such a way that you read from the first page to last, where the story begins and ends, and that's simply all there is to it. The book serves as a medium for not only telling multiple, complex stories, but for allowing emotion and feeling to be expressed in countless different ways, what with the formatting and such.<br /><br />I'll admit, and I'll warn you, it's a difficult read. The best way to go about it is to read it straight through, then read it again.<br /><br />There are underlying connections, there are various passages that are in fact coded and provide clues to the questions that to this day still remain unanswered, even by the most thorough cult reader. This book is not just a story. It doesn't take Danielewski ten years to just tell a story. And he's not giving in to straightforward questions about the true meaning(s) of the book itself...only to vaguely imply that the readers need to figure it out for themselves.<br /><br />If you're looking for a book that's \\"horrifying\\" in a Stephen King-esque way, and this one catches your eye, you will be disappointed.<br />This book is indeed horrifying, but only in such a way that once (or \\"if,\\" more like) you are able to begin tapping into all of the different underlying currents hidden within the medium, you will become just as obsessed about finding the answers as the characters in the story are fanatically, and sometimes depressingly, obsessed about finding their own answers that you, the reader, have to delve enough to figure out, as well. Because of that, putting this book down at night will not change the fact that you'll spend countless hours thinking about it.<br /><br />The fact that not knowing what's real and what's not, what's implied and what's deeply and artistically hidden within the pages, is horrifying enough to keep you entrenched for months, if not years.<br /><br />If you're looking for a fun, quick summer read, this is not for you.<br />If you're looking for something that will blow your mind (but only if you allow it to) and can potentially change your life and the way you approach it, this is truly an unrivaled masterpiece.

0345803485|1.0|This is by far, one of the worst written books I have ever had the misfortune to read.  Poorly written; implausible story line; ridiculous characters... total trash romance novel with NOTHING to warrant spending the money on it. I don't usually spend my time writing reviews but, it is deplorable that it was even published.  Personally, I like Solstice Farm... much better written; better sex scenes and great characters - written for adults.

0345525558|4.0|We used this for our book club choice and everyone loved it.  Very readable and entertaining in a different sort of way.  Never knew there was so much meaning attached to different flowers.  I have a whole new respect for creative florists!  The main character is not always easy to take but having a mom who grew up in an orphanage it gave me a greater understanding of what life is like for kids who don't grow up in the \\"Leave it to Beaver\\" house.
B0045D3N3O|3.0|Good, initially impressive film but it is dwarfed by the attached powerful documentary DVD, narrated by James Earl Jones, that is a thousand times more effective than the film, Denzel Washington, and Spike Lee, who is notorious for having a problem with objective observation, as the film proves after watching the documentary on this great American.  I already had this film on DVD and I gladly would have just paid for the documentary instead, it was just that good, if good is an appropriate synonym for a searing historical document.  BTW, this blu-ray book is about $10 at Costco.
1451627297|1.0|I bought the Audible version of this book without listening to the sample narration first. That was my first mistake, because the narration was not done well. Technically, I suppose it was fine, although in some chapters the narrator's voice sounded like he'd had a rough night. The accents were painful and cliche and when the narrator put emotion in his voice he just sounded corny and inauthentic.<br /><br />My second mistake was continuing on after the prologue. An entire prologue of \\"I am not a man who cries\\" should have been a warning to me, but it was recommended by a friend as \\"King's best work ever\\", so I soldiered on. For 30 hours and 44 minutes I soldiered on, with only the briefest moments of being transported into the story, but hours of wondering when it was going to pick up already.<br /><br />This book is really two books: an early-sixties romance set in Texas and a (not well done) thriller about the murder of JFK. If King had stuck to the time-travel romance angle, it would have been OK (and definitely better than The Time Traveler's Wife), not my cup of tea, but OK. If he had written a thriller about the assassination of JFK, and had ramped up the tension and uncertainty, well, I would have liked to read that book.
B00884GR0W|4.0|I was dissapointed that there wasn't Minecraft on the Kindle Fire. Then I found this. this app is great but the Tnt should be working by now and the weapons should be more powerful. if those products are solved than I would give this app 5 stars
B0070NSPCU|5.0|First of all, it is important to acknowledge that the folks who gave this book 3 or 4 stars do have some valid points - the book could have been much better with some grammatical editing and the first chapter was indeed brutal. However, I think the book is still easily worth five stars even in spite of these drawbacks, just because of how fun it was to read. I haven't had a story grip me like this in five years, at least. If you are a grammar nazi, this will merely be a very good or great book; if you're capable of overlooking some homophone errors and comma splices for the sake of a really good story, then you will find this book brilliant.<br /><br />I really hope this author catches on with a publishing house soon. If he can self-publish something this fantastic, I can't wait to see what he can do with a good editor.
B007ZBWJXI|5.0|wow, this really is good. I like every song. EVERY song. the dvd is nice too. interesting interviews, the music videos are cool. first asia album I've bought since the first one, not counting the anthologia...can't wait to see them .

1469984202|5.0|Wool Omnibus is a haunting saga of people living out their entire lives in an underground structure called a silo, with no knowledge of life beyond their cloistered existence. The people live this way as a result of some undefined apocalypse, an event which poisoned the atmosphere so that life outside the silo is impossible.<br /><br />Originally written as a series of short stories revolving around this central theme, the Omnibus Edition brings the first five of them together under one book cover. Combined, the stories span over 500 pages. This isn't a quick read, but Hugh Howey writes well enough that it's neither bothersome nor boring to get through it.<br /><br />His writing style is descriptive enough that scenes come alive in the imagination. From everyday things like the imperfections of welds in a handrail, to extraordinary things like bubbles of air that float up through standing water to collect beneath a metal stair. Tastes and smells and sounds are sometimes real enough to linger after the book cover is closed.<br /><br />His development of the characters is deep, but gradual enough that it doesn't bog down the story line. Backstory on a person is presented slowly. As in real life, the reader gets to know a character over time. By the end of the book, the main characters are fully understood, and Howey does an admirable job of letting a reader make up their own mind as to what is \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" in a person.<br /><br />His highest accomplishment, I think, is his depiction of the stratified organization of life in this confined existence, the clear lines that separate the lower levels from those considered more elite in society. He points out the difficulty in governing these varied peoples, the burden of protecting them from the poisoned atmosphere outside, and manages to do so without sounding preachy and political.<br /><br />I'm not a real Science Fiction fan, but it's easy to see how Wool has become a favorite of those that are. It's the kind of tale that makes a person think... about the direction that our own society is headed, how our own elected officials view themselves as the ruling class with the general unwashed populace as their subjects.<br /><br />Moreover, this is a self-published work that consistently rates as a top seller. As such, it is a ray of hope for any aspiring novelist entering the crazy crowded world of self-publishing, an inspiration to push on to do their best work.<br /><br />Well done, Mr. Howey. Well done.e that makes a person think... about the direction that our own society is headed, how our own elected officials view themselves as the ruling class with the general unwashed populace as their subjects.<br /><br />Moreover, this is a self-published work that consistently rates as a top seller.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|I have come to depend on the reviews for an e-book when deciding where to spend my money. All to often on Amazon it is a gamble. This one paid off! This book was entertaining and riveting. When I finished I honestly felt both satisfied with the conclusion and a craving for the next. The book was well edited, and I detected only a very few minor text errors.<br /><br />I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone. The world described echoes with familiarity but is completely new. The characters all have depth and the plot and story always move along at a fantastic pace. It kept me turning pages long into the night.<br /><br />The value of e-books is incredible. For 3$ I found an amazing author and a story I thoroughly enjoyed!

0307592731|5.0|\\"Wild\\" is an emotional roller coaster of a read. You will laugh, you will cry, and you will ache---both physically and emotionally. There is something so raw and real about this memoir of Cheryl Strayed's life on the PCT (Pacific Crest Trail), and I guarentee you won't be able to put it down. This is a modern day coming of age tale, with many life lessons in between the lines of the pages. If you've ever lost someone or maybe lost yourself, this is the book to read. I believe that books speak to us, and if we read them at the right time, we can discover something about ourselves. \\"Wild\\" did that for me. More important than that even is how beautifully each line is crafted; Cheryl's words flow so freely that the novel is more reminiscent of poetry than a memoir. If you're seeking for something you can't find (like Cheryl so bravely did 18 years ago), or if you just love good writing...this is the book for you.
0812982622|4.0|This novel is a parody of \\"1984\\". Or a commentary on social injustice. Or a stereotype of what we think North Korea is. Or a love story.<br /><br />Halfway through, I didn't understand its purpose. At times brutal, and at other times poignant, the plot and characters mix in surreal harsh austerity and the terrifying reality of human subjugation.<br /><br />Yet at the final page, I simply gave in. It was all these things and more. In so many ways, it's a beautiful novel. Written with such care. Sad, yet joyful. Hopeless and loving. Amazing.
B00338QENI|5.0|An eye-opening and wonderfully written book.  The author provides a great deal of history in regards to cell culturing as well as research ethics which serves as a perfect background to display Henrietta Lack's quite tragic story.  This book should be a part of every student's research or medical ethics class.

B008A1NSTG|4.0|Ok so I rented this movie to watch a feel good movie. Let me start and tell you their are some top actors and actress's in this movie. Lots of them.  The movie is centered around whales which is great because we all love God's creatures. So you will enjoy the movie but there are some LONG drawn out scenes that seem to be put in here just to make the movie longer. Its worth renting for the great parts especially for kids 8-12 but dont forget to keep your phone near for the added length parts of the movie. (the kids wont catch it but you will). Its not a buying type movie but worth renting.

B000YIGNKE|4.0|Several years ago, Anne Elliot (Sally Hawkins) received a proposal of marriage from young naval officer Frederick Wentworth (Rupert Penry-Jones).  With very little to offer Anne in the way of money or property, she was persuaded by her family members and closest confidante, Lady Russell, to turn Frederick down.  Now, eight years later, Frederick has returned a rich man with half of the women in the county falling at his feet - and Anne has lived to bitterly regret her decision.<br /><br />Jane Austen's final-completed novel, PERSUASION, is one of her most mature and pragmatic works.  She cleverly plays with the pre-established pattern of her earlier stories by having the characters already in complete possession of their feelings for one another. In \\"Persuasion\\", the love story has already taken place but failed, and the challenge now is how to bring the lovers back together again.<br /><br />The BBC's 1995 film of \\"Persuasion\\" (starring Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds) is a great favourite for many (although I've never completely warmed to it), but this latest 2007 attempt - originally part of a new season of Jane Austen adaptations for ITV - gives a refreshing new interpretation on the story.  I appreciate the efforts of Simon Burke of trying to give the character of Anne something of a backbone (this is especially evident in the final scene where Anne runs through the streets of Bath after having read Frederick's letter).<br /><br />Sally Hawkins is fast-establishing herself as one of the new \\"go-to\\" leading ladies of British period drama (after \\"Fingersmith\\" and \\"Twenty Thousand Streets Under the Sky\\").  Her Anne is a delightful creature, very sympathetic but also with a great deal of comedy.  I adored the casual scenes between Anne and Wentworth - and Rupert Penry-Jones gives Ciaran Hinds a good run for his money in the handsome and dashing stakes.<br /><br />The performances are strong right down the line - producers went for some very interesting casting choices, including comedienne Julia Davis (\\"Nighty Night\\") and Amanda Hale as Anne's sisters Elizabeth and Mary; Anthony Head (\\"Merlin\\") as Sir Walter Elliot, Alice Krige as Lady Russell; and Stella Gonet (\\"The House of Eliott\\") as Mrs Musgrove., including comedienne Julia Davis (\\"Nighty Night\\") and Amanda Hale as Anne's sisters Elizabeth and Mary; Anthony Head (\\"Merlin\\") as Sir Walter Elliot, Alice Krige as Lady Russell; and Stella Gonet (\\"The House of Eliott\\") as Mrs Musgrove.

0345803485|1.0|I felt duped into reading this book. Surely, the hype meant something? Wrong-- I can now see why it's popular in the same circles as Twilight: it's like reading an nauseatingly long issue of a trashy periodical.<br /><br />Ana is Bella's (Twilight) clone. Mousy, klutzy, with poor self-esteem abounding. Quite an irritating character. Makes women look bad.<br /><br />Christian is also a photo-copied character with no real buzz of his own. Grey is a pretty accurate description.<br /><br />Skip it!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Much hype among my coworkers regarding this book. So I was sucked in. I was 7 chapters in and said to my husband, \\"They FINALLY kissed\\". Slow moving, repetitive, and absent of a plot. The girl is really not very interesting, and it is all about her. Mr. Grey more interesting character with great character building potential. Now maybe that happens in books 2 or 3. But 372 pages... for what?  As someone else put how many ways can you describe the color grey and say \\"down there\\" and \\"oh my\\"?  Bad read, Took forever to get through, I would have deleted but I didn't want to completely throw away $10. I did throw away a lot of my time During a vacation no less...
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I bought this book on Kindle after my sister and adult niece recommended it. I know it's not a book for guys, but I wanted to see what all the fuss is about. I am certainly not a literary snob and have nothing against pulp fiction (I've read tons of it throughout the years, and love much of it). However, I simply could not get into this book. It reads like a bad Harlequin Romance with explicit sex. The story is predictable, and the characters are absurd. The sex scenes are so ridiculous that they are laughable. The author makes countless references to the female protagonist's \\"inner goddess.\\" Oh, please! If you want a good, trashy, mindless novel, read anything by Jackie Collins (at least her books have exciting plots, nice pacing, and she writes sex scenes with a sense of humor); or any classic Harold Robbins potboiler. I know a lot of women love this book, but men should definitely skip it. I won't be reading the two sequels.
B006DRVFRQ|4.0|This is a solid app.  However,  I would like to be able to buy the Pro version in the Amazon store, and this doesn't seem to be possible.

Some of the epople were there from the Walking Dead. it was fantastic.<br /><br />According to amazon I should have my box set between the 31st and the 5th.  here's hoping I get it sooner than later.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I can't believe how popular this book has been, I made myself finish it because I was foolish enough to buy it ! I felt my IQ slip with every page, good thing it wasn't too long. Thank goodness, I didn't purchase all three.
B008645YEE|5.0|Hans Zimmerman never fails to thrill. His take in this final Chris Nolan's Batman is superb and brilliantly composed. The beat and movements in the various tracks totally sync with the action. One reviewer here blasted the album for its excessive recording levels. I don't agree. I played the CD on both solid state and tube amps and the musicality was stunning. In fact I use this album to test drive audio equipment as parts of the album can be quite challenging for integrated amps.<br />All in all, its a well made CD.

Works wonderfully on the Kindle Fire and you can even change the color of the picture of the battery! And... it's free!! It even is a small data size. Do yourself a favor and get this app!

B006RUJST6|5.0|Wasn't sure after reading the 50 Shades Trilogy & Beautiful Disaster that I would find another book to love.  But...SLAMMED was GREAT!!!!  Totally captivating read with great characters & life situations brought into a wonderful story line!!!  It is a MUST read...I can't wait to read the second book!! :)  This would make a GREAT movie!!!
B007STXHTM|1.0|It works ! pictures and clips are simply perfect! I bought it for $49. I don't understand why is so expensive here?! almost double? not the right value
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this book.  I read the Fifty Shades Trilogy...which were really good, but tended to drop the ball sometimes with the story line (w/the exception of the detailed sexual situations of course :) This book however, has a great blend of sexual tension that keeps you captivated w/little twists & turns that keep you wanting to read more!!! Beautiful Disaster would make a great movie!!  I can't wait to read the second book!!  Bring it on.... ;)
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I bought this book because of the high reviews and I was not disappointed. Character development was great and the story kept me hooked. Not normally, a short story/novella reader but slab city books are also good reads. Cannot wait for book number 2 though.
B001NEI96O|5.0|Beautiful, riveting, funny...What an excellent piece of storytelling and an emotional narrative shared by those who experienced it. I was brought to tears several times during this film by the emotions of the people retelling the story. Fantastic, don't miss it!!!

0061122416|4.0|I started this book not knowing what it was about and almost put it down...but then it sucked me in and I couldn't stop reading. This book is pure wisdom. Its a book that I will read again when I need inspiration (and I'm not a self-help kind of person). I admire this author for sharing some wonderful life lessons in a most captivating way.

1451696205|5.0|I'm the type of person who has to read books before I see the movie. I don't know why. It's just who I am. And since the trailer for the movie coming out in September caught my attention, I knew I had to read this book.<br /><br />Let me start off by saying that if not for the movie trailer, I doubt I would have purchased this book on my own. The cover does absolutely nothing to sell it. However, having read the book, I now see how fitting it is. This completely unassuming cover hides a coming-of-age story so simple it's practically brilliant. There are no gimmicks here, no trends, just a pure story of one boy's freshman year seen through the eyes of an immensely sympathetic and instantly likeable main character.<br /><br />It's definitely a quick read--I read it in one sitting--that pulls you along. Charlie's voice is as captivating as it is simplistic. He tells you a story in a way that begs you to listen. At first he's unsure and tenous and you can sense there's a current running just beneath the surface. You know something will come to light later even if you can never get a grasp on what it will be. He grows and comes into his own in a way that--as an adult reading a YA book--made me proud of him. And even though there is sex and drugs and things that may make parents uncomfortable, they are a normal and almost necessary part of growing up and are handled carefully and honestly.<br /><br />I adored this book. I absolutely could not put it down once I started reading and I recommend it to lovers of contemporary young adult fiction.

B008FOB124|5.0|Have been a DCD fan for many years and have my best friend Gregg to thank for turning me onto this great group almost twenty years ago, and have since collected all their music AND had the privilage of seeing them live in Lakewood, OH, USA-(Spiritchaser Tour)-an experience never to be forgotten! (even IF my *date* could not make it last minute and there I was with an empty seat beside me where my friend Gregg *should* have been in his stead) Life goes on as we all evolve! Same can be said about Dead Can Dance's first studio release in 16 years! This is simply a joyful and deep sonic experience and food for the soul. So much so that upon listening to this CD just received today on a pre-order release from Amazon, I immediately ordered my friend Gregg a copy of this CD to return the gift of turning me onto this really awesome group!<br />  I think it's safe to say if you've already been a fan of DCD, you will not be disappointed as it's as if 16 years never really happened; picking-up right from where they left. Music is like the potter's clay in that it can be fashioned into the infinite possibilities the imagination has capacity to conceive; Dead Can Dance have produced yet another masterpiece that reflects the Human Condition's critical point we face currently. This is really great food for the soul! Thank you Lisa and Peter and may we hear more in coming years and please do a massive North American tour?!
B000002P86|4.0|I've read the other reviews of Deuces Wild and agree that this is not a seminal blues album, but all the artists have done an outstanding job of working with BB and expanding on the classics presented here.  I continue to thoroughly enjoy this album.  Nicely configured and produced.

B008ANFRGQ|1.0|I have played this album several times, and it still does nothing for me other than make we want to change the disc. I have been listening to Steve Vai his entire career and completely understand that to really appreciate his music you need to think outside the box, but \\"The Story Of Light\\" is way out there. I have the deluxe CD version (expanded booklet & dvd) which appears that Steve spent more time changing his outfits for the booklet than on the music itself.<br /><br />The title track has great opening guitar work which is then interrupted by some German banter. Lame<br /><br />\\"Velorum\\" has some nice guitar also, but sounds like a song from a childrens album. The synthesizer on this track and pretty much the entire disc is way too overpowering and belongs in 1983.<br /><br />Next we have the WORST \\"John The Revelator\\" ever! Unlistenable<br /><br />As is the last track was SOOOOOOO good, \\"Book Of The Seven Seals\\" is basically a continuation of the last song. Skip<br /><br />Skip to \\"Gravity Storm\\". This is 1 of 2 tracks that I really like on this album....Has an \\"Live in The Ultra World\\" vibe to it.<br /><br />Skip the next two songs to play \\"Weeping China Doll\\", my other favorite on this disc. Very nice guitar work here.<br /><br />I struggle through the last three tracks and pop out the cd.<br /><br />Others appear to really enjoy this CD, while I can't. In the end you will have to listen for yourself. I will always have great respect for every album that Steve Vai releases knowing that his music is conceptual and not mainstream. Any band can release the same album 18 times like AC/DC (not taking anything away from AC/DC...I love them also)and sell records. I thank Steve Vai for being innovative and trying new things, but \\"The Story Of Light\\" just doesn't do it for me.
B008KL2ITW|3.0|Now don't get me wrong, I love, and I mean LOVE, good-girl-meets-bad-boy stories. I do. And when I read the description for the book, I thought: yes, please. And for the most part it was what I had hoped for. It was an addictive and enthralling read. It starts out so promisingly. There was so much potential for this to be more than the average angsty romance. The complexities of Abby and Travis' relationship make for excellent reading and I thought they developed well as characters. Until the bit in Vegas. And that's when I started to get a bit miffed.<br />Because that's when reality plain flew out the window. That kinda stuff doesn't happen in real life. And it annoyed me, having to read it. It wasn't necessary to the story. In any way.<br />My biggest problem was Travis himself. Now I have a bad boy of my own, of sorts. But if any guy displayed the kind of behaviour Travis shows Abby, whether friends or more than that, I'd be rid of him in a minute. That kind of behaviour does not make a hero. I was honestly disturbed and alarmed when reading some of the scenes in this book. It is such a negative, emotionally draining thing to deal with that kind of dysfunctional toxic relationship. The violence and insecurity that are so much a part of Travis was frankly upsetting for me to read. I could never see myself in a happy ever after with someone like that, and for the most part, I don't believe that many women could.<br />So while I thought the book starts well and has the potential to be great, there are many problems with it. That said, it was addictive enough that I read it in two sittings. I would recommend it as a good book but I don't think anyone should take any lessons away from it.<br /><br />Also, I HATED the ending. For obvious reasons.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|The collection is the most complete one that I have been able to find so far and the DVDs come in a sturdy box; a lot of trivia and deleted scenes, this collection is really worth it!

B000AYNFWG|5.0|When I first saw Federico Fellini's 1960 classic, LA DOLCE VITA about 25 years ago, I immediately realized I was being exposed to a great film. Its iconic imagery and the intimacy it elicits despite the scope of its story left a deep impression, making a Fellini admirer out of me for life.<br /><br />LA DOLCE VITA - \\"the sweet life\\"- is a profound, eye filling, episodically structured film that follows jaded journalist Marcello in his quest to discover something of meaningful, lasting value in life. His search leaves him disillusioned when the people and things he admires and respects don't live up to his estimation of them.<br /><br />Marcello Mastroianni, the Italian equivalent of Cary Grant, is brilliant as the complex, idealistic hero. Anita Ekberg is also great in her signature role, as a glamorous movie star whose carefree lifestyle masks a troubled relationship with her abusive actor/boyfriend, played by Lex Barker. Yvonne Furneaux does well as Marcello's possessive, neurotic girlfriend unable to tolerate his aimless existence, and Alain Cuni is quite effective as Marcello's scholarly, introspective friend whose tragic fate marks the turning point in the journalist's own outlook on life.<br /><br />The film's most famous scene is of Anita Ekberg's sensual cavorting in Rome's Trevi Fountain. Other memorable moments are the opening shots of a helicopter transporting a huge statue of Christ high above Rome, Mastroianni and Ekberg ascending a winding staircase to the dome of St. Peter's Cathedral, a large crowd gathering in the rain awaiting an appearance by the Blessed Mother, and the final scene at a beach where a group of hedonists are contemplating a bellied up sea creature.<br /><br />Though tame by today's standards, LA DOLCE VITA was highly controversial when it came out, and even considered pornographic by the Catholic Church. The film was the first one to accurately depict the paparazzi, who were just beginning to emerge in the media, and the theme of tabloid sensationalism is the thread that ties all the vignettes together. This helped make LA DOLCE VITA one of the most relevant, influential films of its time, one that reflected the changing attitudes of European society at the dawn of a new decade. It received the Grand Jury Prize at the 1960 Cannes Film Festival, and has since been regarded as a cinematic landmark and Fellini's masterpiece.<br /><br />LA DOLCE VITA is available in an appropriately grand, 3 Disc Deluxe Collector's Edition that features an immaculately restored, widescreen transfer of the film. There's a smorgasbord of supplemental material that includes an introduction by director Alexander Payne, an insightful commentary by critic Richard Schickel, a collection of Fellini T.V. shorts, interviews with Fellini, Mastroianni and Ekberg, a musical montage of Cinecitta Studio, a documentary on composer Nino Rota, a discussion on LA DOLCE VITA themes, and footage with the film's screenwriter, Tullio Pinelli. A 40 page illustrated booklet, five 5\\"x7\\" photos, and an 11\\"x17\\" poster round out this sumptuous package.<br /><br />Even though life may not always be so sweet, a classic movie like LA DOLCE VITA can sure add some spice to it.<br /><br />My highest recommendation.bloid sensationalism is the thread that ties all the vignettes together.

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Fun addicting game. Doesn't force in app purchases unlike most games these days.. I don't know why it's amazon app store exclusive but it's definitely worth a download
B007MNV5WU|3.0|ok so I paid for the full version when it first came out and have been waiting for updates. on other devices there is the whole version plus the danger zone free and I play the first stage in danger zone then have to pay for the rest? why???
B005LAII5I|3.0|Guys<br /><br />When I watched the EXPENDABLES 2 I found it so over the top you can't help but like it.  The actors toughest roll is to keep their bellies sucked in, their hair neat ( see Arnie's) their voice deep (see Stallone's,) somehow he makes his dry bass, an octave lower.  They play aging jocks, with a bit of joy and a hint of mischief, not quite taking themselves serious.  The movie is written with the help of Stallone, whose memory still recalls  many famous \\"one liners\\" from other testosterone  flicks.<br />Yep, there is a plot, and tons of guys.  This is another chapter of the \\"good guys\\" saving folks from the bad guys.  There are cool stunts, sharp flying, neat devices, guns galore, muscles oiled and bulging, cool dudes so cool they can smoke their cigars on screen and get away with it, did I mention guns.  And, let the record show there is a token girl, played by Yu Nan,.  Not only a token girl, but to hit a couple of more bases on the how-liberal and accepting-of-others these guys are, an there is an Oriental girl, who holds her own against the good ole boys.<br /><br />So it is actually a \\"clean\\" R-rated killer show.  There is no bad language, no sex, no drugs, no bodice revealing costumes on the chick, all the reason for the R rating is the splatter, spill, spots, spigots of blood and gore occurring during the action scenes.<br /><br />The current 2nd sequel leads the door open for other Expendables, and if the audience keeps paying I'm sure our sensitive dudes will comply.  After all, they are all about paying back old scores, both good and bad.  In this movie they repay Church 13 million, so next time they'll up the anti, preform more stunts, and keep us coming back for more.<br /><br />Enjoy<br />anIowachick
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this game on the iphone and even more on the kindle fire! it is so much fun! I love it!
B005LJETYI|5.0|\\"Groundhog Day\\" like stories have been done many times in the past, and often are done poorly. The wonderful thing about this book is that I NEVER once felt like the author was breaking his own rules of how people react to eachother when the main character knows what going to happen over and over again.<br />An amazing war story, and gripping tale of human interactions. And an awesome sci fi story.
B008B1VYP0|1.0|It seeems as though all good artists get pulled down to the \\"regular\\" muck that most of the music industry is swimming in. Maroon 5, after 3 solid albums, have finally jumped in too.<br /><br />I admit there was a change from Songs About Jane to It Won't Be Soon Before Long, however I don't feel like Maroon 5 compromised the character of their core:  great lyrics, great instruments and great signing.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Overexposed is just that, Maroon 5 overexposed to what's \\"hot\\" right now. Adam Levine has such an amazing voice that the group never had to stoop to this level to be recognized for talent, if anything they've voided what I (and others) have seen in them all along.<br /><br />Simply put, anyone could be singing these songs, Rihanna, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga... the songs are mostly shallow and lacking the same soulful emotion and talent that was expressed in previous albums. I thought Maroon 5 would stay on my favorites list, but after this album, that has ended. Hopefully they can try to find their way back, but I highly doubt that's in their (current or future) intentions.

0439023513|1.0|When I decided to read the series, I was very pleasantly surprised at how well put together Hunger Games was. I accepted Catching Fire because it was a book dedicated to Katniss's character growth. I feel like that it ended there.<br />This third book dragged on with things that seem unlike the first two books. I felt that this book was very detached from the first two. This book was not well put together and I felt like Collins did not take time to write it. I felt like she just wrote it 'just because'. There are fanfiction stories more well put together and flows more with the series than this book.<br />You have to read every single word to have the book/chapter make sense. You seem to try to skip through some parts and end up thinking \\"wait...what?\\" from just skipping one sentence.<br />She could have written this book in 2 chapters and then an epilogue to add to the second book and it would have been better!
0312641893|5.0|WOW- is all I can say*** I have been after this book for so long, and once I was able to finally purchase it on Amazon- something came up and I had to cancel my order.... I was so sad- Then one day my best friend had a package sent to me and I opened it only to find a hardcover copy of Cinder by Marissa Meyer sitting in my hands. (of course I did a dance) It took me three days to read this book and Cinder lived up to the standards created in my mind- I loved it. I will Pre-Order the second in the series without hesitation. I can't wait~ This is a fantastic start to a great series- the characters well developed a great plot unfolding (although it was predictable) it still makes for a fantastic retelling of Cinderella* (I mean how much cooler can you get other than a cyborg Cinderella) I recommend this story to everyone- no doubt you will love it. 5 Stars- Favorite of 2012- Thank You~ Sunni for this AWESOME gift :) Reesa***
B002W1HBN4|4.0|All I can say is what more can you expect from one of the greatest females in popular music...voice of an angel RIP...Whitney you will always be if not the best but one of the greatest females in music history...legacy will live on & on....I enjoyed this anniversary edition greatly, my only complaint is that Arista/Sony could have included more rare live clips from Whitney...Merv Griffin show & Soul Train clip could have been replaced with a live concert performance instead...we've seen those over & over, Sony give us fans something that hasn't been shown or released before, we know you have thousand & thousands rare live performances video/audio on Whitney through the 80's, 90's...give us something that we really would love to see and stop releasing the same footage thats been on previous DVD compilation of hers..Give us SOMETHING NEW in those Arista vaults...example My Love Is Your Love Tour documentary/performances or something from her 80's or 90's concert tours...This is the only downside to the DVD included with this release

I recommend purchasing Point of Retreat at the same time because you want to know what happens with the characters.  I know it stated that it was a two book series but i hope Colleen Hoover continues on with this series.  What a great read at such a good price.

B005FISBTO|1.0|This is probably the best season of dexter I've watched besides season 4. The storylines are varied and it felt very fresh. I would recommend anyone that's a fan watch this season. With that being said, don't buy this product.<br /><br />The only problem is that showtime decided to spoil the ending to the season in the unskippable preview at the start of the DVD. How anyone with a brain decided this was a good plan is beyond me. The only logical conclusion is that no one at showtime possesses any brain whatsoever.<br /><br />Here's a note about your fans, Showtime. Not all of them subscribe to your channel. So, putting the finale in the preview of the content I *just* bought along with other shows they may or may not care about and making it unskippable is beyond stupid.<br /><br />I should've read the reviews, since many people seem to have noticed this as well. But, I didn't think I needed to since I was already convinced I was going to buy this product.<br /><br />I won't be buying any more of these products. Six stars for the season, one star for this release of it.<br /><br />I'll find other means to watch this show in the future. You've lost a paying fan.

B004EPZ02A|5.0|Considering the type of movie this is, and the fact it's the third movie in a series, you kind of know what to expect from a movie like this.  There were some odd moments and some explaining moments for the previous two movies...however I liked this one better the part 1 and 2 combined.  I would say out of order of favorites for this series so far it goes part 3, then 2 then 1.  A lot of the same thing, but it is changed around just enough to keep it entertaining to the audience.  I watched this w/ 7 of my friends and every one liked it immensly.
0451228731|5.0|I finished this book in a week. It is full of fast paced action and suspense. Suarez has a difficult job of explaining the technology in use and still keeping the plot moving which he does well. Some of the explanations can seem drawn out if you're familiar with concepts like augmented reality or automonous vehicles. But all in all this is a excellent thriller on par with similar titles.<br /><br />It almost feels like what Tom Clancy has done for military thrillers, Daniel Suarez is going to do with tech based novels.

B008Z9YLV2|5.0|i watch alot of movies and compared to many this story is well put together and executed well with an amazing cast. and i think beyond what others are saying they are missing some points, the ones giving this movie bad reviews or not watching it because oh kids are killing kids, this film and story are much more than that. and in times like we are facing now this film is more Relevant than ever, you need to come in with an open mind and really try to grasp the whole idea that the author who wrote the book is trying to convey, not just the death of children but the unbelievable power and corruption of the people behind it. to learn more of what i am saying or get a better point read below. but there may be spoilers so read at your own risk<br /><br />***** May Contain Spoilers *******<br /><br />What we see here is much more than just kids killing kids, its a deep rooted hatred for people of a lesser class and a way of control. these people went through what i would probably call a modern day civil war. and the only way they thought of controlling this was to set up 12 districts but more than that decide who was worthy to be in which district and then control the chance of another uprising by making them put there children up as an offering and go to a public reaping. then having it as a televised event kinda making me feel like they wanted just throw it in there face that the lower districts were nothing and the game was rigged to begin with. but in this film it has more to do with culture and society then whats above. it shows courage and determination while being faced with almost certain death and against oppression of many including the so called president and government. and people who are reading this i can see our government now more than ever looking and changing things to take control of our rights and take away things from us and our families. so this movie is more Relevant now than ever and what a great time to make such a brilliant film.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I like the feel of the cover -- flexible, but solid -- it seems very unlikely to break.  I also think the clear is cool as you can see the iPhone through it.  I also appreciated the minimal packaging.
B003Y5H5HY|3.0|I started to care about the two leads as a couple in this film and really did not want them to part. Sure, some of these scenes were not very well characterized but the book does not do much better. Too much sex in this without clear exposition of the relationship. To have it end as it did so quickly and with little dialogue as to why was just odd. I know the novels were written somewhat like this but I don't think the film, not sure about the Swedish ones, portrays these characters well enough to end something on such a terse and negative note.<br /><br />You cannot just show two characters loving and making eyes at each other, no matter how demented, and then show the main lead off with his old ex again, eliciting a reaction from the former lady that kind of ruins the end of the picture in this context. We won't see or clear anything up for way too long and it may be too late if the other American versions are even made. I say just give it the old hollywood ending and be done with it if you are going to make it such a sexy romp. I really don't care to wait around for the sequels. I didn't care for the content of the written sequels either. They should have deviated from the book a bit but then of course you would have a mass of angry teens at your door.<br /><br />Anyway, the direction and sound are top notch. Fincher and Reznor have made some great stuff here. I just think the love affairs in this film needed to be treated with more subtlety and explained more. Does Blom even care for Liz? In this film they seem to care about each other a lot. He could have at least situated the whole thing a bit better before going back to banging the Millenium chick. Again, a couple of flaws in the text as well, though it comes off much better there, that I don't care to get into. The ending with the hacking of billion was also kind of laughable. I pretty much ignore the last 10 minutes of this film. I liked it though and had some fun watching it.
B0072GPPNC|3.0|Firstly, I think it might be appropriate to share what \\"War Horse\\" is not.  It is not \\"Saving Private Ryan in World War I\\".  The realism and horror of war shown in Private Ryan, and for that matter Schindler's List, is not evident here.  No, the Great War of this film harkens further back into Spielberg's past, perhaps most closely akin to \\"Empire of the Sun\\".  Like the prison camp of Empire, this WWI is ... I'm not sure of the right word. Sanitized? Idealized?  No man's land is full of mud, but not of rats and body parts, and there's no incessant noise from shelling.  When an artillery shell does hit a trench full of men, bodies are thrown about whole.  Even in the much-talked about scene (minor spoiler!) of the horse trapped in the razor wire, there is very little blood, especially not on the face, and the horse doesn't \\"scream\\" in terror, a sound often mentioned in war memoirs as being the most horrifying sound on a battlefield.<br /><br />It will sound like a criticism to start a review this way, but that was not my intention.  I think Spielberg deliberately toned down the horror of war (and by all accounts, the WWI trenches were more horrifying than the Normandy beaches) because those horrors would not necessarily register with a horse.  Would a horse recognize a disembodied arm?  Would it care about rats crawling in No Man's Land?  Unlikely.  Therefore, this really is the story of the titular War Horse (named, innocently, Joey).  We are meant to watch Joey.  We are meant to see things through Joey's eyes.  In one telling scene (another minor spoiler!) of a cavalry charge, we see large numbers of horses go careening through the enemy lines without their riders, who have been shot off.  Only briefly do we see any dead horses, and then they look like they might be sleeping.  In fact, all parts of the film are almost stereotyped - the cast seem almost to a man (and woman) to overact just a little.  This is clearly a deliberate choice of the director, if only because Emily Watson is unimpeachable in her talents, and she's just as bad (or good!) as the rest.  Now consider the cinematography - Janusz Kaminsky's pastoral settings of rural England and France (behind the lines) are bold over-saturated colours of yellows, browns, and greens.  Presumably this represents the ideal setting for Joey.  In contrast the war scenes, where Joey is forced to pull artillery, surrounded by death and destruction, the palate is completely washed out grey.  There is none of the usual Kaminsky subtlety here, again a deliberate use of colour to emphasize mood more in keeping with a simple horse's point of view than that of an Oscar-winning DP.  Even John Williams's score is often too bold, with brassy, upbeat rythms that are compulsively musical, not what you'd expect for a Great War film.<br /><br />The film is skillfully made.  But is it a \\"good\\" film?  I suspect opinions will vary widely.  At one end, the horse's \\"acting\\" is a truly astonishing achievement.  Even so, for a Spielberg film, for me it falls somewhere behind his true classics (from Jaws through Raiders of the Lost Ark to Saving Private Ryan).  I don't think it ever really pulled me in completely.  This might partly be because of its episodic nature - Joey is the only constant, he moves from owner-to-owner right up to the last 15 minutes of the film.  In that last 15 minutes there are some reappearances of former owners (I will not say which ones!), but it's not enough.  True, the very end (the last 2 minutes, say) are emotionally moving and even uplifting, but with a cloying sentimentality - surely a deliberate choice - that seems manipulative in hindsight.  Again, perhaps like Empire of the Sun, this film hovers at the boundry of adult fare and \\"family\\" fare - not wanting to go too far into realism, but too much for the kids to enjoy.<br /><br />Overall it's a good film, but not one that I would compulsively watch if it came on TV late at night.  Perhaps I'm just too much a productof the \\"cynical era\\" to be able to totally enjoy a thickly troweled sentiment, no matter how skillfully made it is (and \\"thickly troweled\\" is rather cynical of me, isn't it?). In a rating system of 5 stars, I find it falls in the middle of the 3-star and 4-star range.  So why did I go with 3/5?  Because of the Blu-ray extras.  There are very few here.  A roundtable with a few of the actors and producers, a 3-minute short on the extras, and that's it.  I, for one, would love to have seen how the movie was created - especially the scenes of the horses at the front.  Was it a combination of computer graphics and live-action?  If so, it was totally seamless.  If it was all live action, how could you possibly get a horse to do what they did and still have healthy, living horses at the end of the shoot?
B000OVLBGC|5.0|One of the better foreign films I have seen in some time. The acting is beyond most and the direction and script are near perfect. Deserving of all its accolades. The direction is sure handed and mostly crisp. We are allowed into the homes, lives, and culture of the time period and the atmosphere seems plausible to what it may have been like in Germany at the time. This film also builds relationships well and we start to see the insidious and heinous Big Brother platform that is with us even more so today than back in that time period portrayed. I think there are few films this relevant that are just gaining even more steam as we go into the future.

B003Q6D2B4|4.0|Retirement is boring, espcecially for ex Black Ops CIA operatives. Morgan Freeman gives a wonderful performance, as he always does. He is ultimately one of the best actors in the biz. Without spoiling it, I will just say you will enjoy it.
B00002N9ER|2.0|I have mine mounted in my vehicle as well for offroading and it is mounted to the body of the vehicle on the driver side pillar and within 2 weeks one side broke off and I was in the motion of pulling the light out so it was not getting slammed into it or anything.  My father was in the vehicle as I was removing the light to show him and once it broke while I was removing it my dad's first response was, \\"well that's a crappy clip\\".  I am going to purchase it once more and maybe see if the second will last longer and if so I will edit my opinion.

B005GG0MIS|5.0|This book was fun to read. Many of the historical events that were in this book were direcly or indirectly effected by the relationship between current and former presidents.  It was a real eye opener to read how the men at the top and who made history need the support of eachother nore than their wivies.  No one else but another president could truly understand the pressures, the challenges and the rewards of being tha Commander and Chief of this nation.

0805095535|5.0|An eclectic collection of miscellaneous thoughts, Winter Journal is exactly what the title asserts.  Always brutally honest, Auster reflects upon his sixty-three years thus far, paying special attention to the many trials and tribulations his body has withstood throughout its lifetime, the myriad places he has called home, those he has loved over the years, and (though not as explicitly as some would have you believe) his mother.<br /><br />While this all sounds rather pedestrian, I assure you, Auster renders it fascinating.  Of course, it helps to be an Auster fan where this book is concerned.  As a work of nonfiction, it reveals much about the man and offers insight into his fiction.  However, even if this is one's first encounter with Auster, the expert writing and vivid description will titillate.<br /><br />Furthermore, and I can't emphasize it enough, Auster's honesty is astounding.  I'm amazed at what he's willing to divulge about himself, especially because this is a man who doesn't need to take chances anymore.  His name could sell his book alone.  Fortunately, Auster is always the inventor, forever the innovator, and so he invites us into his life and discusses things I wouldn't tell my best friend.  Perhaps this is why he has become so successful over time - he has no fear when it comes to the written word.<br /><br />To read this book is to experience Auster's life itself, and I can offer no author a greater compliment than that.<br /><br />~Scott William Foley, author of Andropia

B008602KQI|3.0|I had huge hunger expectation for this film because of how well it did in theatres and the great reviews it got. After watching it tonight I was not impressed in any way and didn't like the ending. I felt like i could predict the whole thing except for a few minor rewrites. The best thing is that the acting is good and Jennifer Lawrence is stunning! SHe's very pretty.<br />  IF THERE IS ANYTHING I CAN SAY ABOUT THIS FILM IS THAT IT HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE IN 2000 BY THE JAPANESE. IT'S CALLED BATTLE ROYALE. Battle royale is much bloodier, interesting, scary and entertaining. Hunger games in my opinion is just a watered down americanized version of battle royale.<br /><br />  All in all this was just another ordinary mediorcre film. I hope the sequel is better! Don't like my review? Go watch battle royale and i bet you'd agree. Thanks and Godbless<br /><br />~shauns movie review
B000OVLINI|5.0|What more could I possibly add to 877 reviews that will help illuminate your appreciation of this book?<br /><br />I stumbled onto this book by accident, and what a joy! The author writes incredibly well and the story is amazing. I usually get lost when there is a combination of past/present and a lot of characters. Somehow, I managed to stay with the storyline here.<br /><br />How can you not read a book where one of the first paragraphs reads, \\"One of the pitfalls of childhood is that one doesn't have to understand something to feel it. By the time the mind is able to comprehend what happened, the wounds of the heart are already too deep.\\"<br /><br />Simply amazing.<br /><br />Anyhow, this is a great book. Good character development, nice flow, and an incredible story. Enjoy.
B0086700CM|5.0|great game. play it over and ovef again. recommend for people of all ages. great game. looking forward to second vrrsion. better than Brave run.
B002XMGGK6|3.0|i would give this movie a four star rating but for the last ten minutes of the movie which ruined it for me.  it is so sappy, so sentimental and so ridiculous, that i can only imagine some studio hack came up with it at the eleventh hour.  or maybe they used a focus group. but i was having a good time up until then when a father takes revenge against those in the legal system who let a killer walk free. all the people he gets rid of were well worth it and i enjoyed that portion hugely, which fortunately is the bulk of the movie.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|The third and last book was the best book for me.  I have absolutely enjoyed each and every book of this trilogy.  Cant wait to read more books from EL James.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|THE BOURNE LEGACY and Jeremy Renner are brilliant. This film takes getting used to. This film is slow and methodical to the point that the viewer actually begins to lose interest in the details, but on repeated viewings there is more than meets the eye and it all pays off. THE BOURNE LEGACY picks up the pace and brings a lot of pieces together to what I imagined to be an explosive finale of drama and heroics and discovery of who is who in this complex film. But, that never happens. The film ends in a wrap up of events to this film and to elements of the series, but there may be more coming.  This film had a good idea and the filmmakers really pull it off. Basically, this film has a very interesting and almost intellectual narrative flow that it so incredibly conceived to entertain and draw the viewer in. Jeremy Renner gives an interesting and something of a heartfelt performance and adds a lot of back-story to the film and series. My expectations were high and this film surpassed them. THE BOURNE LEGACY is incredible film making.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This started out as my intern reading to me from her Kindle during long car rides between patients' homes, but it was so awesome I had to buy the audio-version for a trip to St. Louis. Great for a roadtrip because, while the stories are in some way connected, they're also refreshingly brief so you can pause to gas up the car, use the rest stop or grab a snack. Fey's stories about summer theater are pull-onto-the-shoulder-until-you-stop-laughing hysterical.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Excellent soothing application!! Use it every night for myself and kids! The app is also available in Google Play &amp; iTunes!!!!
B008FWHGYS|4.0|I watched this movie twice and liked it better the second time.  It had multiple locations, about four different languages and<br />good actors.  I find sub-titles diffficult to read, that's why I watched it twice.<br /><br />There was a lot of modern life spanning Europe and a little of USA and all of it about how we relate or not to one another.<br />I loved Ben Foster and Anthony Hopkins as always.  And I also totally enjoyed the prostitute's sister and the gangster's driver.<br />Their time together was most joyous in the whole film.<br /><br />Good acting by all.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I like this game . I think you should down load this app beacause it is really really really really fun

B000KKPN5C|4.0|This flash has a very fast refresh (it keeps up with my Nikon D5100 continuous shooting mode).  It is bright enough to shoot action at a distance, and rotates up/down to bounce a flash off a ceiling.  Only drawback is that it doesn't left/right rotate, so holding the camera sideways means you have to bounce the light off a wall or aim the flash directly at the subject.<br /><br />All in all, I love it!

0439023521|5.0|Sometime in the, hopefully, very distant future, the United States is divided into 12 districts, with the capitol located high up in the Rocky Mountains, where it is easily defensible from the hoards of disgruntled citizens.  In the capitol district, everything is fine, but elsewhere, it's a sub-sub-standard of hand-to-mouth living.  Each district is responsible for a specific service to the country: providing coal, manufacturing, agriculture, etc.  To keep the citizens entertained, each year the capitol district hosts the Hunger Games.  Participants are selected at random, with one boy and one girl chosen from each district.  We follow the fate of the twelve, focusing on the pair from District 12.  They are very close friends Katniss, daughter of a miner killed in an explosion, and Peeta, son of a baker.  But, according to the rules of the game, only one may survive.  The dozen are placed in a specially developed arena to battle each other to the death, leaving only one survival.  The weapons include bows and arrows, slingshots, spears, rocks, anything that will make for a gory death. That's the fiction part.  The science part entails the various ways the nation has of watching the participants on TV.  Through technology, each of the 12 is continually monitored.  At the end of the day, the pictures of those who have deceased during the day are projected onto the sky so the combatants know how they stand. Further, the game directors can, at will, change the weather conditions to make life even more difficult.  Also, from time to time, support for an individual participant is parachuted to the one in need. That's just the bare-bones description of what goes on here.  There is so much more to this captivating book.  I couldn't stop reading it and will immediately turn to the next book in the series, \\"Catching Fire.\\"
B002VPE1WK|5.0|So far so good I was able to fit my gear 70-200mm ,24-70mm and a 50mm lens in it along with my D7000 and a sb800 flash, with battery chargers. Great fit for the price, Padded on the back and for comfort and the shoulder straps have great padding too.<br />Update 11/28/2012 the bag is still worth every penny I spent on it. I'm growing out of it  so ill need a larger bag soon.  It's great for your camera and a few lenses I'm adding flashes to my kit and will soon need more room. I'll Still give it 5 stars.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|I love this series, I listened to this book on MP3 on the way to Alabama and can't wait to see the HBO series.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|Though I always have an opinion about the books &amp; apps I buy, this is the 1st review I've written... the .99 price tag of this HOG made me snag it, &amp; once I started playing I COULD NOT STOP. Sharp graphics,  cool style... and kind of tough! When I finished the game I had forgotten it was just a buck &amp; knew I had to review it for all those other HOG enthusiasts. It is so much more than just finding little objects, which when reading the description,  kinda turned me off. I'm not a big point and click adventure game, but to me snark (and snark 2) had the perfect combo of hidden objects, story, &amp; mini games. Some scenes were definitely tricky- to the point where I had to do some googling to find the &quot;cheat&quot; websites. Again, I have to say it boggles my mind that this game was a dollar. I have spent $5 on others that were enjoyable,  but nowhere near as fun as both snark games. From what ive been able to read online, there is a snark 3, but not for kindle fire. I am hoping that will change!

030746363X|3.0|I ordered this book about 2 months ago. This is an easy to read and understand book. The author specially states that not all things in the book is for everyone and some things he writes about is just to tell what all he with through before he found what works for him. It surprises me that some of the reviews criticizes some of these things when he specifically states this. Which tells me some of them didn't read as much as they needed to to write a review. As most overweight people do I have read a lot of books and obviously I don't stick to anything since I am still buying books on what to do to loose weight. I am attempting to try some of the suggestions from this book. He suggest to eat protein for breakfast and don't use milk as a start and I am currently working on just that. I like that he encourages you not to make a great number of changes at one time because too many changes can be overwhelming, that is good advice. It's a go/no go for me as usual, but this is a personal problem not the book's problem. You need to take the information in this book and use common sense when applying it to yourself. Some of the things he suggests is just not appropriate for someone older and with physical issues. If it goes against something your Dr has told you not to do, then just don't do it. I was happy to read a book that didn't demand hours of exercise. My body does not tolerate that. He recommends women using a 20 lb kettlebell, but that is too heavy for someone who is 60, overweight, not physical, and with back issues, so I got a 5 lb one to use and will work up to a 20 lb one. That's going good so far. Just use common sense. He gives a lot of information about the \\"why\\" of things if you like to read that kind of stuff, if not, easily skipped. He's not a Dr and states that up front, but he has done a lot of research. He has also tried a lot of things to loose weight and to shape his body and he shares those. Some are good things to try, they might work for you, some are just way out there and should be avoided. He recommends quick fix meals which I like, but he uses a lot of unhealthy processed foods which I try to avoid, so again weed out the things that you personally won't do, while trying to understand the concept behind the recommendation. I focused only on the fat-loss portion of this book, so I can't comment on the incredible sex or becoming superhuman parts.are just way out there and should be avoided.

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|there were two games I really wanted the kindle fire one was metal storm, the other was jetpack joyride. this game is absolutely adsicting and by far one of the best games on the kindle fire. the only complaint I have is that your distance in the top right corner is cut in half makingbit hard to see when you are running but you can always see your score once you have died!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is a lot of fun. several fun games. this is not like most apps where you have to spend money to enjoy it.
B00006690F|4.0|This album is really serious ... Each song has an effect on you. My personal favorites is Say goodbye to Hollywood and till I collapse.<br /><br />I would recommend this album for anyone who wants to hear a more serious side of eminem ...although without me is one of his slim shady type songs ... Enjoy :)
B0069G5Z9K|2.0|maybe it's because I'm playing on android but it's the screen; it's really too small and makes not very much fun. When your finger blocks half the screen, the fun quickly disappears.
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|I purchased this book by mistake - hit the wrong button. I started to read it because I paid for it. I couldn't put it down. I was born and raised in Great Falls and found the references were entirely accurate. It brought back memories and I thoroughly enjoyed the book.

030758836X|5.0|Again, a book that was recommended to me by Amazon that I thought..eh..but then I read it and YEAH!..If you like mystery and suspense and a whole lot of creepy..this is a great novel..I finished it in 2 days and found myself thinking about it for days after..the author does a phenomenal job of sucking you in and really getting into the minds of the characters...one of the best books I've read in a long time!
B0007YMUZW|5.0|I discovered this album during the break-up from what I thought was my soulmate. I need to take a deep breath now just thinking about it. These songs, Meadowlake Street, Magnolia Mountain, etc. are the most beautiful, touching music I've ever heard. They are the definition of the word BITTERSWEET, and they are perfect. One of the best albums I've ever heard, and that's coming from a life-long Beatles and Pink Floyd fan. Perfect. I think Ryan Adams may be a saint.
0062060562|5.0|I really enjoyed this novel. It was interesting from page one and had a lot of twists and turns and a very unexpected ending. It reminded me of older gothic mysteries such as those by Victoria Holt.
145162445X|5.0|This is a wonderful and masterfully written book by one of the world renowned experts in the field of cosmology who has made fundamental contributions to the field. It informs the reader (in a very engaging way) about cutting edge research in fundamental theoretical physics and cosmology. It is very well emphasized in the book that some of the advances have been experimental (like Hubble's discovery about the expansion of the universe and the more recent discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe, the so-called Dark Energy) while some have been theoretical (theories like inflation and multiverse).<br /><br />The author starts with historical milestones in astronomy and cosmology. It is refreshing to see an author explain in popular science books of this kind, how for example large astronomical distances are measured or observations about the geometry of the universe made. The book does a fantastic job in explaining how we know what we do know about our universe, observationally. This is the focus of the first few chapters of the book and they are really easy and fun to read and very informative.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Krauss (who has also written other amazing science books like 'Quantum Man' and 'The Physics of Star Trek') elaborately explains key theoretical concepts. All the ideas presented in the book are standard conventional wisdom in the theoretical physics community and there are NO controversial theoretical things in the book. And that is worth emphasizing. Theoretical ideas are by definition subject to experimental and observational scrutiny. And the author is well aware of that and the reader gets the sense that he is being cautious and honest about this fact in the book.<br /><br />Krauss isn't making the point that it is definitively established that the universe arose out of nothing. Instead, he very carefully and with full caution and attention to all the pitfalls of a theoretical (but not verified by observation) argument is saying that it is now possible in theoretical physics to conceive of mathematically and logically consistent theories that predict a universe very much like the one we live in, but that arose out of 'nothing', meaning no matter (and perhaps even no space) to start with.<br /><br />The very definition of 'nothing' is unambiguously emphasized and explained in the book. Krauss painstakingly and beautifully explains to the reader difficult concepts like quantum field theory and what we mean by 'nothing' in physics. There are several whole chapters devoted to 'Nothing'. It is very clearly explained what physicists mean by the term, why they think (based on observations of quantum phenomenon over the past 100 years) that this definition of 'nothing' ought to be the correct technical definition of the word and how with advances in physics, we have verified some of these ideas against experiments. Basically, 'nothing' is meant to mean complete empty space, that is no matter or light or any forces. However, as explained in the book, quantum mechanics has something deep to say about this empty state. And in fact it says this 'nothing' is actually unstable. And through this unstable 'nothing', theoretically at least, it is possible for a universe to pop onto existence and it is well explained in the book how. And this is the essential point of the book. Through 'Nothing', a universe with very much the characteristics of our universe can arise.<br /><br />The Afterword by Richard Dawkins is very good and recaps in a very broad sense the essence of the book.<br /><br />Overall the book is one of its kind and is very well written, extremely lucid in its explanations of difficult concepts and a refreshing popular science book, where one actually learns a lot of physics.
1451608659|5.0|I remember the magnificent seven like it was yesterday...and wanted to read about Dominique's life. Not only do you get an in depth view of her family life, but of her life at the gym. I really liked this book and read it in a couple of hours...always interesting to know what goes into being an Olympic champion.And with this book what goes on behind closed doors..home and gym are very interesting.
B0084IG7KC|3.0|I purchase all of my DVDs and Blu-rays with UltraViolet so that I can watch videos from my TV or computers when on the road without taking all the discs. When I opened this package to enter the code, it came up invalid. That really irritates me. I am hoping that someone from Amazon can assist me.<br /><br />Update:<br />08/20/2012 - Amazon contacted me regarding my review. They are sending out a new copy with 2-day delivery. Very good work, Amazon!<br /><br />Update: 09/06/2012 - Received new movie with valid code. Watched movie and loved it. Better than I expected from the reviews. I cannot wait until the next one. Love Jennifer Lawrence.
0062124293|3.0|I am a woman just a little bit older than the author and consider myself a feminist too, I was hoping to enjoy this book more. It had such awesome reviews and was recommended for me on Amazon..I found it hard to relate to the author and this book is also full of vulgar language...not the British Bossy Pants as stated on cover..just ok.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Cant complain does what it says. I like being able to have it on the kindle to show the exact life left by mist dropping down the menu.

0307279189|4.0|If you loved to run and your feet hurt, what would you do?<br /><br />Chances are that you would see a podiatrist and follow his instructions.<br /><br />And what would reporter Christopher McDougall or Chuck Norris do, when the feedback of their podiatrists didn't seem appropriate?<br /><br />Go to the friggin' forgotten lands of Mexico, risk their lives in drug traffickers' territory, meet the legendary Tarahumara indian tribes... And come back to tell us the story.<br /><br />(yeah, I'm wrong about Chuck Norris, as everyone knows that Chuck Norris feet would never hurt)<br /><br />The final result is absolutely wonderful and addictive. One of the most pleasant books I've read in the past few months and I strongly recommend you to give up any reading laziness you may potentially have in the moment and give it a go. Reading this book is definitely breezier than completing a marathon in a hot sunny Sunday (well, this is not much help if you're already a long-distance runner).<br /><br />The story has so many freakantastic elements that, in the beginning, it almost felt like I was reading a fiction book - I had bought it a few months before I actually started to read it, so when I picked it up I didn't remember the summary and reviews I had seen back then. The scenario and the way the story develops are simply surreal. The characterization of the each of its participants is also done in a captivating way (they're probably captivating in the real world as well, but the author still has a merit anyway), and you can easily see yourself in the place of some of them. Especially if you have any mild relationship with the running sport, you will be cheering along and feeling the drama. Caballo Blanco, the mythic figure who one day decided that there shouldn't be a best thing in life other than simply run through Mexican Copper Canyons. Barefoot Ted, the easy-going guy who could barely stop talking during the whole book. Scott Jurek, the vegan ultramarathon runner who was the real challenger of the Gods of Running in their own sacred territory. Billy and Jenn, the two cranky youngster heads who are spontaneous at the point of going to a heavy-booze-drinking-fest just days before the great-ultimate-epic-running-battle against the legendary and invincible Tarahumara men. If you get emotionally involved in stories like me, you may even get angry at both of them at some point (\\"Come on, you guys really expect to complete a marathon in such a state?\\"). I remember myself on every time I have a Saturday drinking-fest of my own,  in which case I can barely help my girl to wash the dishes after Sunday lunch (ok, ok, I admit it, maybe this is just a lame excuse).<br /><br />Even though I'm not a marathon warrior such as those people, running shorter 6-9 km distances 3-4 times a week is something that I really love and can't live without. In that sense, one of the great things about this book is how it just simply nails what's really wonderful about running. In some of its best and most emotional excerpts, I found myself smiling and saying \\"YEAH, THAT'S IT!\\", and then almost getting up to run like a child out there. So if you're in need of some help to start or to re-establish a running routine, I assure you that no psychologist or supporting friend will be better than Christopher McDougall (despite the fact that supporting friends can be convincing and fun to have around, the author must have spent hours crafting some well-thought sentences in here). If you're curious to see what's so wonderful about running, but at the same time are too lazy to read the book, do a Google search on 'scott jurek arnulfo quimare' and look very hard at the pictures of the results, trying to absorb all the essence of what Chris is trying to convey (we'll see if a picture can really be worth a thousand words this time). Yeah, it's Scott Ultra-Jurek and tarahumara Arnulfo Quimare having one of the best time of their lives<br /><br />So if you think the book is so wonderful, so awesome, so perfect, why the 4-stars?<br /><br />Well, because for me only God is worthy of 5-stars.<br /><br />Just kidding.<br /><br />Actually the detractor is that, along the narrative, you also get as a special bonus some scientific incursions on various running & health-related issues which, in my opinion, were not on par with the rest of the book. I'm not even biased when I say this, as I actually do not disagree with most of them. I just think that the author was taking sides on very controversial issues without all the necessary fundamentals and warnings. That means bringing insufficient data to the debate and reaching conclusions with potentially flawed and/or incomplete analysis. In some occasions, he also gives recommendations which are more simplistic and incomplete than they should, which increases the risk that the less cautious reader makes decisions that may even hurt his health.<br /><br />Take the whole barefoot vs running shoes debate, for example. I would say that, given that this was a book about the epic battle of America vs the almighty Rar&aacute;muri, the analysis of the benefits of barefoot running were pretty adequate, having the proper length and depth within the book. However, when the author recommends readers to try the new approach, he simply ignores that the transition to barefoot should be slow, REALLY slow! If you're not the kind of person who is willing to take the time to do much further research on the web and books and simply decide to follow the author, chances are high that you'll be injuring yourself BIG TIME! In case you want a first free tip to start out, search for the Harvard website on barefoot running, which has many helpful videos and visual explanations on the subject.<br /><br />I must admit that, initially, I thought that McDougall was being way too biased on this subject. After all, he was praising barefoot and throwing darts at Nike in such an exaggeratedly energetic way. At some point I was totally convinced that this guy had received some really bad service at a Nike Store or at Nike's call center, and was making use of the privilege of being the writer of a book about Tarahumara runners to claim revenge on this evil shoe company. Not that I'm not judging him. I would probably do the same too if the staff at the Nike Store in Rio weren't so nice at me (yeah Vanessa, if you're reading this, beware).<br /><br />However, that initial suspicion abruptly changed due to an unexpected coincidence just after I finished the book... for the first time since I started running, MY GODDAMN KNEE STARTED TO HURT!!!! I'm not a fool, of course this was some weird kind of indigenous spell cast by McDougall, just to make sure that I wouldn't go out there disagreeing with him for free. Due to a  knee inflammation, I spent a few weeks with some pain everytime I put a higher load on my knees. This meant that I got very sensitive to the kind of shoes I was wearing and the kind of foot strike I was doing.<br /><br />And what did I find out? McDougall was right! The most knee-hurting shoes of all are the formal shoes I use for work, followed by my flip-flops. Still, for 1 or 2 weeks, the only kind of footwear that didn't really hurt me was wearing no footwear at all while doing the jazzy forefoot strike of our caveman ancestors. Of course this meant that my next step would be following Barefoot Ted's barefoot steps, and order my own ridiculous-looking Vibrams. They're even more ridiculous in Brazil, because they are not popular at all here yet, and everybody at my neighbourhood keeps staring at my frog-like-feet while I'm doing the grocery. Damn your wizardry, McDougall!<br /><br />Then comes the whole vegan diet thing, advocated by our audacious book hero Scott Jurek. I'm really not going into the whole \\"vegan vs non-vegan\\" debate, which is extensive and not adequate to this review - besides the fact that I'm no MD, just a Brazilian economist who happened to have been a vegan for 8 years and gone back to chicken meat a few years ago. I'll just point that, before praising all the vegan benefits alongside our ultra-hero , the author could at least have posed a few pertinent questions, such as \\"What are the long-term yet-unseen implications of this diet to the health of the person?\\", \\"Could it be that the body of an ultra-runner adapts to this diet in a different way vs the casual athlete?\\" After all, Scott Jurek could be and feel healthy potentially because he's an ultra-athlete, but that doesn't necessarily mean that a non-ultra-runner will feel as healthy with the same diet. As for the long-term issue, from my own experience I can tell how a vegan diet can make you feel awesome and invincible (assuming you're not running against the Tarahumara, of course) in the short-term due to the whole \\"body-cleansing\\" effect. However, the lack of certain substances (folic acid, B-12, among others) in a vegan diet combined with overuse of soy products may potentially impair some aspects your health once you get older to your `60s and `70s (eg. cognition, bone health). But of course we're not going to see this risk materialize in our young Scott Jurek!<br /><br />Anyways, besides my heads-up on those issues, I'll highlight again what I said in the beginning of the review: this is an AWESOME book, whose 300 pages I devoured in just a few days, even though I normally have a 12-hour workday. I just couldn't let go of it! So if you're bothered by the scientific flaws I mentioned above, just skip them and have a good time enjoying the amazing America vs Tarahumara racing story. Go get the book! And go running! Barefoot.

B000EHSVOG|4.0|Now this is one mighty movie that fits into the \\"they don't make them like this anymore\\" category. Here is a disaster film of monumental proportions that would bankrupt several European countries if filmed today. The cost of making this film with modern special effects and a similar all-star cast would be phenomenal.<br />Films buffs have to see this film and watch all the extra features on the making of THE TOWERING INFERNO.<br />Sadly, modern audiences might not fully appreciate THE TOWERING INFERNO and its background story. We've gotten too sophisticated with all the computer generated special effects. Yes, they are incredible, but take a step back into the early 70's when specific effects required a lot of labor and often danger.<br />PRODUCER/DIRECTOR IRWIN ALLEN was famous in the 60's for his sci-fi fantasty TV shows like LOST IN SPACE, THE TIME TUNNEL and LAND OF THE LOST. He took a different career path inthe 1970's with the disaster epic THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE to become the king of disaster films. He followed that huge success with THE TOWERING INFERNO.<br />The world's tallest and news skyscraper is about to celebrate his official opening with a gala party. Many members of high society and the political world will be attending the party on the very top floor. Unfortunately, corners have been cut to save costs and many safety features are compromised. A small fire turns into THE TOWERING INFERNO.<br />Again, you need to watch the special features to truly understand the undertaking it was to film this movie. Fire is unpredictable and yes, stunt actors were actually on fire in several scenes. The bravery of this cast and crew is amazing.<br />Speaking of the cast, another fun part of this film is seeing actors who were in their heyday in the early 1970's along with famous actors like Fred Astaire and Jennifer Jones from the past. The cast list is astounding--Steve McQueen, Paul Newman, Faye Dunaway, William Holden, Robert Wagner and even O.J. Simpson. Who will survive the towering inferno? It's easy to draw comparisons with 9/11 and people trapped in a burning skyscraper. Fortunately, the people in our story have some chance for survival.<br />Back to the special effects, it's still amazing to watch although some effects look cheesy by today's standards. Again, we have to remember that there were limitations on how realistic special effects could be. The crew of THE TOWERING INFERNO did an amazing job.<br />This film is a step back in time. It's not as realistic in many ways as modern films, but considering the resources that were avalaible at the time, THE TOWERING INFERNO is an amazing achievement.

B000S88JTS|3.0|Motorcycle enthusiasts shouldn't miss ON ANY SUNDAY. It is the classic and possibly best motorcyle documentary ever made. I'm not a motocycle fan. I bought the film to see Steve McQueen. McQueen financed this classic film and can be seen in a few scenes racing. He was a highly ranked amateur motorcyle racer in his day and it is fun to watch him participate in races.<br />The film follows several racers on the circuit. There is a lot of racing footage which in many ways is more thrilling that race car films. These men are risking their lives with little protection in the pursuit of a dream of winning. The constant \\"wipe outs\\" are right out of AMERICA'S FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS but these are not stunts. It's amazing to see these guys getting back on their bikes and continuing their grueling races. It's fun to watch. There is not a lot of technical jargon or background--it's just a story about motorcycle racing. The movie ends with a delightful scene of McQueen and two buddies just out for a fun ride. If only life could be that enjoyable,<br />If you are a Steve McQueen fan, be sure to get the two disc version with extras. There is a heartwarming tribute video to Steve McQueen that shows a lot of outtakes and behind the scenes stories of McQueen.

I highly recommend this game!
B005LAII0I|4.0|I watched this film with my nine year old granddaughter. Viewed through her eyes, it was the perfect film. A witchy stepmother Queen, the seven dwarves, beautiful Snow White,, and the prince. For adults it was a mostly listless tale.<br /><br />Julia Roberts and Nathan Land stole the show. Julia, the Queen, was the perfect protagonist, hateful and likable at the same time.<br />Nathan Lane was there for the adults, his humorous riffs had me laughing, and kept me entertained. The Prince, Snow White, and the Queen, never seemed to jell. No charisma from SnowWhite or the Prince. However, the scene with the Prince acting like a puppy was his best. The seven dwarves seemed to genuinely like each other, and they were the hit of the film for my granddaughter. They had the charisma the rest of the film lacked.<br /><br />The music was well done, the art effects terrific! Essentially, this Grimm Fairy Tale was that, grim.<br /><br />Recommended for children. prisrob 08-20-12

While visiting a German friend near Wiesbaden, who writes ads for beer companies, asked me if I had ever watched the series?  That prompted me to purchase Season 1.  I'm hooked!  It brings back the days when I was a young man and I thought smoking cigarettes was soooo cool. The set design is \\"spot on\\" for the early 1960s. Glad to know there are 4 more seasons to view.

0800141326|1.0|If someone asked me \\"What is the worst movie of all time ?\\", I would say this one. Well why ? Welll as a TRUE Godzilla fan theres alot of reasons. Most likely how they took Godzilla and down-graded him to a stupid 60 ft. tuna eating iguana called \\"Zilla\\" or \\"Godzilla USA\\" to the japanese. This Zilla freak only 60 feet tall, he can be killed by missiles, and doesn't evenlook like a standered Godzilla (hopefuly it will be better in Godzilla 2014). And you ask Does this even have to do with the japanese ?\\" ? Well, NO IT DOESNT !!!!!!!! Instead of the japanese testing their new fancy atomic bomb, it's the French who is taking the job (EPIC FAIL) ! And Godzilla, I mean Zilla is attacking NYC ! Which is not Tokyo. Yes, Zilla can breathe fire but not ATOMIC FIRE. And only does ONCE or twice in the WHOLE MOVIE ! And instead just screams really close to something and blows it away which is garbage already ! If you want to get a quaility Godziilla movie, DON'T GET THIS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All of your firends might say its pretty cool. But they are just being idots. In stead on this site type in Gojira/Godzilla, King of the Monsters (2004). Read some 4 or 5 star reviews then BUY IT! Also in the comments type in what this movie should of been called. I think it should of been called \\"Monster\\". If it didn't have Godzilla on it. I would of giving it 3 stars.

I picked it up, not even reading the reviews. This book was all to familiar to E.L. James' \\"Grey\\" books. Not to mention, you have to wait until October to continue reading what will happen next. I probably will get it to see how similar it is to James' book, but who knows.

B007SGM084|5.0|I work as a school nurse for my children's school and attend college to further my career. I had the summer off not only from working but also from school. I was not one to \\"read\\" books unless it was part of my syllabus from school. After all the \\"hoopla\\" about these books, I was definately NOT going to read it. My good friend kept insisting that I read them. After a millionth time of telling her \\"No\\" because it was NOT my type of reading, and after reading a page in the book (which was not even the erotic part), I decided to buy the books. I could NOT put it down! I was up at 6am and read until 2am. I finished all 3 books in 4 days! I kept telling my husband, \\"let me just finish this chapter,\\" but finding out, the chapter left me hanging and soone enough, he fell asleep and I was reading another chapter. I loved the suspense and the fact the chapter left you hanging to the point you HAD to contiue reading. Now, that I read her books, and with no other books to read, I started to become an avid book reader. I became so enthralled into reading that I started reading a book a day! Never did I imagine myself \\"reading\\" just to read!  I'm glad I invested my money in these books, and I can't wait for Ms. James to publish more!
B00475AYJQ|4.0|I loved Name of the Wind. I like the main character, despite the super cheesiness of his theatricality and what feels like overly formal, rigid social interactions that might be the author trying to capture a medieval period feeling, but I usually attribute in fantasy books to authors' extreme nerdiness and lack of social skills.<br /><br />But the world is everything I like in fantasy tales. Cool magic, a young character who is slowly learning about his own abilities, and despite his impressive talents there are plenty of obstacles and challenges of significant difficulty that he must overcome. There's plenty to criticize in these books, but the story flows and is a lot of fun. It's lyrical and poetic, and the creative writing and playful language will keep you entertained through the slow parts of the book if you're into that sort of thing.<br /><br />The book is not quite as exciting as the first book. There's a Romeo & Juliet aspect to the romance in the story that has always been frustrating to observe, and it's difficult to have patience with the main character at times. That said, it continues the first book's themes and if you enjoyed Name of the Wind, this will be a pleasing second installment.
B006TLFPKO|1.0|I have never been so disappointed in a purchase.  The movie was green and by adjusting my TV I got a little color, but at best it looked like Sepia.  I realize now that what I purchased was used and a rental, but maybe you should have reviewed the movie before selling.  $11.44, really?  I have returned it and expect a refund, but it really was a waste of my time and my excitement to see the movie again was depleted.  I really don't think you (Amazon) want customers to know that this piece of work came from you so I will not check the box to label it.  Movie return and I was reimbursed full purchase price.
1469984202|5.0|While this Omnibus feels like a novel, it was originally published as a series of five novellas -- and self-published at that. But don't let that scare you, it's better written, better edited, and far more engaging than 95% of New York published SciFi. In some ways a throwback, in some ways very modern, Wool is a contained (in both the literary and literal way) post apocalyptic tale in the mould of Larry Niven or A Canticle for Leibowitz. Technically this is an ARC story, about an isolated world built to survive a destroyed environment. The people in Wool live in a 148 floor Silo in the ground. To leave is to die.<br /><br />The book is written in first person tight from multiple points of view. Each section has a fairly clear POV character and the narrative voice highlights their perspective. There is no single protagonist. The first novella is basically a short story introducing the world and ending with the usual short story twist. It did very well on Amazon and the author wrote a second (using a minor character from the first as the POV) and then a third which essentially transitions to the larger story's most important character (Jules). It's very much to Howey's credit that this serial construction does not feel artificial. The works holds up both individually as a cohesive and epic novel.<br /><br />Several things lead to the overall excellence: The characters are well developed and mostly likable (the main villain is a little thin, but interesting enough). The world is intriguing  and detailed with an appropriate pacing of reveals. There is a good amount of death and suffering in this novel and it lends a generally tragic air to the whole situation as well as the specific events. There is also a lot of tension despite what might nominally be plotting that doesn't showcase a lot of overt external conflict (in the first 2-3 books). Basically it's just very good.<br /><br />The silo is well thought out. My  only real beef at a technical level (and this doesn't distract from the book at all) is the unlikelyhood that such a contained ecosystem (in all senses of the word) could remain so functional over several centuries. On a practical level earthly eco-systems function because of the ENORMOUS quantity of solar energy constantly added. Wool features a pretty big system powered by a single main fossil-fuel generator. Maybe that's possible, and Howey's navel background lends copious verisimilitude and gritty detail, but I suspect to really make a big spaceship or ARC last a long time you'd need some really serious juice. Large scale hydroponic farming alone would require a hell of a lot of power. But as fiction, it's really well worked out.<br /><br />Additionally, at a realistic level, I'm not a big believer in the predictability of human large scale behavior (aka history), but in the context of Science Fiction like this (taking its queue from Asimov's Foundation), there's no problem. In the real world, despite the endlessly repeating basic patterns of history, no human has ever proven to be a great predictor and controller of the long term specifics.<br /><br />Another minor peeve is that the Kindle version, while well proofread, has a very unusual formatting with a tiny font oversized spacing between paragraphs. I had to jack the Kindle scale feature up several notches to even read the text. There's (currently) really no reason not to use the default font style for MOBI/EPUB body text in a novel.<br /><br />But if you like Science Fiction, post apocalyptic worlds, or just plain old good novels. Read this. Seriously, it's one of the most enjoyable speculative novels I've read in years.

B0048IDRDM|5.0|I remember hearing Leontyne Price for the first time in this recording (originally on RCA/Victor), and thinking that it was the most beautiful soprano sound I had ever heard. (My second nomination in this category also went to RCA/BMG, Montserrat Caballe in Donizetti's LUCREZIA BORGIA.)<br />Her performance goes far beyond beautiful singing. This is a deeply committed interpretation of what was to become her signature role.<br />Jon Vickers is a thrilling Radames, and Rita Gorr goes deeply into the drama of Amneris' jealousy.Robert Merrill and Giorgio Tozzi represent the lower voiced roles admirably.<br />Solti's brass heavy conducting (as noted by other reviewers) is pretty exciting, if not the most subtle go at this work.<br />The sound reconstruction is really vivid.<br />There is a track listing and plot summary, but no texts in this mid-priced re-issue.<br />Because of its musical qualities and dramatic punch, this is the AIDA that I would most recommend to first time listeners.
B00003CXCT|5.0|The 2004 Star Wars Trilogy on DVD - A New Hope (1977), The Empire Strikes Back (1980), and Return Of The Jedi (1983).  A ridiculed set of DVDs, except for the outstanding Bonus Material DVD, which has been universally praised.  However, this set is not ridiculed nearly as much as the 2011 Blu Ray set of the entire six movie saga.  In this 2004 set you get regular non Blu Ray DVDs, but the picture quality is great, in my opinion.  The sound suffers in certain parts, particularly in The Empire Strikes Back, but overall it's great picture quality and good sound quality.  George Lucas made several changes to each movie.  This is controversial and has been ridiculed.  Lucas should release the original unaltered theatrical versions of all six movies some day, sooner rather than later.  Customers are getting impatient.  Lucas should give the people what they want.  I was fortunate enough to see the original Star Wars in the theater when it first came out in May of '77.  Back then the opening crawl did not have \\"Episode IV - A New Hope\\" in it.  Instead, it was just the background story.  The star destroyer that flew overhead that was chasing the rebel ship was so memorable, as was C3PO, R2D2, the stormtroopers, Princess Leia, and of course Darth Vader.<br /><br />I took off half a star due to some of the changes that I didn't care for, such as Greedo firing first in A New Hope, Jabba The Hutt appearing in A New Hope, Ben Kenobi's call to scare away the Tuskin Raiders in A New Hope, and Darth Vader exiting his shuttle in The Empire Strikes Back.  I also didn't care for some of the dialogue changes.  One change that I embrace is Ian McDiarmid's hologram image as Emperor Palpatine in The Empire Strikes Back as well as the change in dialogue.  It matches up better with how the Emperor looked in Return Of The Jedi and closes a hole in the original dialogue from 1980.  I do, however, like the original Emperor in the original 1980 movie as well, played by an uncredited woman and voiced by Clive Revill.<br /><br />The Bonus Material DVD is great.  There are several documentaries, including Empire Of Dreams, The Characters Of Star Wars, The Birth Of The Light Sabre, and The Legacy Of Star Wars.  Even with the three prequels being the weaker of the six movies in the saga, the Star Wars saga is easily the most popular space adventure series of all time.<br /><br />If you're not too picky when it comes to picture and sound quality and can handle some of the changes (mostly minor) that were done to these movies, then I recommend this DVD set if you can still get your hands on it somewhere.oiced by Clive Revill.<br /><br />The Bonus Material DVD is great.

000744785X|4.0|This is the second tome of Storm of Swords (Blood and Gold) from the UK edition. The tomes are sold in one massive volume in the US, which is preferable since Steel and Snow is a bit of an anti-climax when compared to Blood and Gold with the heart rending game-changes all happening in this tome.<br /><br />I don't know about the gold, but you certainly get masses of blood in this one. Although I will try to avoid spoilers as much as possible, a good half a dozen of the characters come to a very \\"sticky end\\", most being murdered rather killed in battle. It very looks like Martin had fun bumping off some of them, if only to introduce some more chaos and further disruption into the war-torn continent of Westeros. Once again, everything is up in the air, with some of the \\"fans\\" howling like direwolves because one of their favourite characters (pick your choice after finishing the book!) has been somewhat brutally removed from the scene. Of course, as we have now become accustomed, all this happens with a suitable amount - meaning a lot - of treachery and deception with most of the murders happening at, or shortly after, weddings.<br /><br />However, this book is not only about marriages, treasons, vengeance and murders. There are also some interesting evolutions in the personalities of some of the main characters who seem to become much more statesmen-like. One is Jaime Lannister, who starts taking his role as Commander of the Seven very seriously, even if it means clashing with other members of his family and making family loyalty come second. Another is Jon, whose feats in defending the Wall will be duly rewarded. A third is perhaps Stannis Barratheon, although his sense of duty is perhaps more doubtful since the expedition that he undertakes and the help he provides also happens to fit his own interests.<br /><br />Even the epilogue is rather gripping with one of the characters that was thought to dead having obviously survived a rather grievous wound and seeking retribution. Expect much more blood-letting in future volumes, as the story gets to include Oldtown, Dorne and the Free Cities, areas of Martin's world that we have not yet discovered...ribution.

0812993292|3.0|This was a nice story about an aging couple finding their way again after many lost years.  Harold walks across England, meets some interesting characters, and deals with some old emotional wounds.  His wife is left at home to contemplate her own life.  The idea and the message are good, but the writing fell flat for me.  It all seemed a little one-dimensional and I didn't end up caring about any of the characters that much.  The descriptions of nature, of Harold's emotions, and the characters Harold encountered were all a little cliched.  Some of the characters are really underdeveloped.  Also, the revelation at the end was pretty obvious from the beginning and I think the author was relying on surprise or shock value to have an effect on the reader, rather than working to build acutal emotion.  This is a nice story, with nice characters, but they don't live on in your imagination after you're done reading.
B00846REIS|1.0|There is absolutely no chance that this book is better than Fifty Shades. While it was probably written better, the story was boring and uncaptivating. I was bored from the start but I kept reading waiting for a punch line - it never came. And the ending did not even remotely inspire me to buy the next book.<br />Some of the descriptions in the sex scenes had me laughing - \\"balls deep\\"?? Really? Does anyone actually say that? It was crude to the point of completely turning me off the sex scenes.

B008CJ0KI8|5.0|Let's be clear here: I'm a little biased. I sometimes joke to my friends that Nostalgia, ULTRA saved my life, but it's at least half true. After the most incredibly destructive breakup of my life I turned to music, and I'd just discovered what Frank had to offer. The fact is that even though he and I may be partial to different genders(heyooo!) there's a universal language to love and loss that transcends any sort of orientation or context, and there's no question that Nostalgia, ULTRA delivered on that front.<br /><br />channel ORANGE does as well, if we're going to cut to the chase. Frank may be talking about a dude, but the record's chalk full of relatable material no matter what. Production values are top notch, unabashedly digital with an analog and retro feel.<br /><br />Track wise, I could go through and list every one. They're all lyrically beautiful (though Monks strays very close to pretentious) and have a great tune. My favorites are Bad Religion, Lost, and Super Rich kids. Andre 3000 and Earl both add some sick freaking verses to the album. Hopefully next time we'll hear Frank spit a bit since he obviously can.<br /><br />Anyway, this album meant a huge amount to me personally. It's not worth relating a life story to give you that sort of context but channel ORANGE is definitely a buy.

B0084IG8TM|1.0|I watched this on pay per view and it sucks.One problem is the books are so detailed , and the film just skims the surface.it barely gets into her relation with Gale and her past, taking over the family after her father dies. It also does not go into detail about her past with Peta and the bread. The books are great and I enjoyed every one. The books also go into a lot depth about her life, and the movie does not.  I have read countless books in my life, and this one i will remember.I liked the Transformers movies much more. The writers got the long history of the war and Megatron and Optimus Prime with out it being the focus of the movie.If only they had managed that with this movie.If you have not read the books ye, do that and forget this movie. I know I will.The odds were not in this movie's favor by a long shot!
B0000017CA|2.0|I purchased this item very recently, directly from Amazon. The CD that showed up ended up being a remastered edition dated 2004 on the back cover, to my annoyance since it was not advertised as such. I'm putting this here to warn other would-be buyers. Amazon really needs to get it together with listing stuff more accurately.<br /><br />I previously owned the original CD from 1994 and it was definitely not this loud. The dynamic range of this CD is a 6 when checked with Tischmeyer's Dynamic Range checker software. That puts this squarely in the real of \\"nuked\\" modern remasters where you don't get to hear the music breath properly and everything just sounds loud all the time. Frankly, I've heard worse mastering jobs in heavy music but this still does a disservice to the band's legacy. I'm sure the kiddies using $10 headphones love the loud and compressed sound but they're not buying CDs anyway and will just download the album without paying for it. If you care about sound quality, track down the original 90s CD pressings of the 2 albums by this great band.

0446572764|5.0|Leo Demidov, the protagonist, is a member of the Soviet MGB and past war hero in post Stalin Russia. He works as a high ranking employee of the State Security force. His primary goal is to serve his country. His job was often unpleasant, arresting and interrogating enemies. At times their own citizens tried to undermine the government. Leo has been involved with many successful arrests. Many times the prisoners, were guilty of anti-Soviet activity. Many times not. The problem is, no one is certain the prisoners sent to Gulags were actually guilty. In Soviet Russia the belief was murder was non-existent. Many were unduly arrested, processed through kangaroo courts and summarily dealt with harshly. Citizens lived in constant fear and would turn on each other, lest they be arrested.<br /><br />Leo finds himself arrested as well due to ridiculous charges against his school teacher wife. Here, the story begins to turn. Leo and his wife struggle against the very system that he once valiantly served.<br /><br />Leo and his wife become very determined with solving a string of children's' murders. The gruesome case becomes a cause they are both willing to die for. In trying to find justice, they become entangled in imitating the very system they were up against. While entrenched in their quest Leo finds his wife never loved him. He now must deal with his personal relationship as well.<br /><br />Child 44 is a page turning novel. It's a mystery, love story, and horror story all in one. Some parts are gruesome, but I found it difficult to put it down.<br /><br />I do wish Mr. Smith would have cut the ending a bit. It becomes a bit sappy and I found it a detraction. However, this is a debut novel and the author has done an excellent job in its creation

B000Z1LOBI|4.0|I remember back in '88 (that's 1988 for you kiddies) -I was 14 and was just starting to get into real metal; the then maturing thrash scene, speed metal and so forth.  I found this album that had a large, evil looking skull on it that covered the Earth, in a view from space. That album, \\"The New Order\\", was my introduction to Testament. I realize now that most were more familiar with \\"The Legacy\\" -but I didn't know about that album right off. I was intrigued by the album cover, bought it and listened. What I heard was a great thrash band with technical/melodic elements and a fairly heavy sound (for 1988 thrash metal, mind you).<br /><br />Fast forward to 2012... I have known about Testament's sordid history and of the little liked/respected \\"Demonic\\" and never paid the album much mind, though I did get the follow up album, \\"The Gathering\\" -which is fantastic. I go on YouTube and listen to some of the songs from this album and, yeah I definitely hear some of what others complained about.  This is not the same Testament who released \\"The Legacy\\" 10 years before this album.  I was intrigued though because I always felt they could be heavier than they were.  This album is a strange mixture of Testament being... well not as Testament as the past.  They brought in elements of death metal (many a fan have complained about this), groovier, heavier riffing and more death growl vox than Chuck Billy's standard snarls.<br /><br />While I'm all for a band changing styles, or more to the point: incorporating different styles to prevent stagnation, I can't understand all the hate/vitriol this album has received.  Yes, it's very different from their past albums with Alex Skolnick, it's more akin to its predecessor \\"Low\\". The 90's was indeed a dark time for thrash; most bands either went AOR (*cough* Metallica/Megadeth), groove metal (Anthrax/Slayer) or simply ceased to exist. I applaud Testament for at least staying METAL {*hack* Metallica}.  Yeah, this album is a huge departure so let's look at it for a sec...<br /><br />For the most part, Peterson and Billy stick with a thrash/death approach -there are sections that some grunge-ish influence comes in. The guitars are heavy, maybe not overly technical but effective and heavy nonetheless.  The bass is not overt but you can feel its presence for sure...  Obviously Gene \\"The Atomic Clock\\" Hoglan's drumming is superb and fitting. Chuck's vox are fitting for this album; very much in the death/thrash vein.  Eric Peterson may not have been the virtuoso Alex Skolnick is BUT he does a great job with all the guitar work on this album (The Burning Times is a great example) -he shows a side to his playing that only starting coming out on \\"Low\\", handling all the guitar work. Being an older Testament fan, I don't find the same fault in this album others may. You know what -have your opinion, that's cool.<br /><br />The bottom line is: IF you have an open mind, this album is not that bad -it IS different (remember this was the 90's) and you'll feel that influence in the music but if you want to hear Testament trying something a bit out of their comfort zone, this is it. Like I said above, maybe this isn't their most popular album but at least it's metal, which is more than I can say for a lot of bands who went thru the 90's.  Get it, you might just like it *GASP*!let's look at it for a sec...<br /><br />For the most part, Peterson and Billy stick with a thrash/death approach -there are sections that some grunge-ish influence comes in.

0143119680|5.0|\\"Conventicle,\\" Miriam answered. \\"I always liked that word--so delightfully ominous.\\"<br /><br />It's been a long time since I've had a book suck me in so wholly. I found myself sitting on the edge of me seat so many times throughout the first part of the trilogy.<br /><br />Diana Bishop is a witch who refuses to let her magic have anything to do with her life. Matthew Clairmont is a vampire who is drawn to her one night after she unintentionally calls a long lost manuscript to her. I loved them fight to stay together as well as fighting those who would take Diana for their own agenda.<br /><br />As with all books there are good and bad points. I'll start with the bad, which in my case, aren't very much: there's a lot of sleeping and eating. However after getting a feel for Diana's character I can see why Matthew feels the need to push her resting. The amount of magic she has clearly makes it difficult for her to rest completely. So, for me that's really the only main negative, and it's so minimal it almost bares no commenting.<br /><br />The whole book was well written, and I really like the concept Harkness created with witches, vampires and daemons. She is good at not overloading the reader with a ton of details right up front. She gives them to you gradually so you can follow along without feeling overwhelmed.<br /><br />I've seen some reviews compare this to Twilight, and I have to disagree with those who say Matthew is like Edward. First off, Edward is brooding because he views himself as a monster whereas Matthew (after his initial anger at turning into one) accepted what he was. Matthew has done things in his past that actually warrants a brooding demeanor, similar to Angel from Buffy. We don't learn all the secrets Matthew has in the first book, in fact, we probably won't even learn all of them through the next 2 books but we might learn about the most significant ones.<br /><br />Now, I'm going to go and throw myself into the next book and see where thingsgo for Diana and Matthew!

As the seasons have progressed we've seen Walt become darker what's amazing is how Bryan Cranston has managed to continue to make Walt both sympathetic and destestable at the same time. It's a difficult trick for any actor to pull of (hence his Emmy awards much deserved for his performances throughout the series)but Cranston wouldn't be able to keep the show afloat by himself; he has terrific support from ALL the members of the cast and there isn't a weak link among them.<br /><br />The second season looks even better than the first--with a pretty strong presentation the New Mexico blue skies positively pop, blacks are pretty strong and detail is exceptionally good.<br /><br />Audio sounds marvelous with an impressive lossless presentation. Dialog is pefectly clear throughout and subtitles in English and French (strangely no Spanish)and SDH English.<br /><br />Special features are scattered over all three discs with the majority on disc three. We get four audio commentaries featuring Cranston, Gunn, RJ Mitte and others as well as members of the creative team (writer-producer-creator Vince Gilligan). We also get deleted scenes. There's also a music video for the song \\"Negro Y Azul\\" which is odd considering that it opens the episode of the same name.<br /><br />We also get the full \\"Better Call Saul\\" commericial, gag reel, \\"Cop Talk with Dean Norris\\" interviewing their police consultants. We also get six webisodes. ONce again we get \\"Vince Gilligan's Photo Gallery\\" as well as some assorted short featurettes.<br /><br />The second season of \\"Breaking Bad\\" builds on the excellent first season with richer, deeper performances and creator Gilligan is able to expand on the storyline introduced during the shorter season one building credible, fascinating characters and putting together a fascinating twisted modern morality play where Walt continually chooses the wrong path.et the full \\"Better Call Saul\\" commericial, gag reel, \\"Cop Talk with Dean Norris\\" interviewing their police consultants.

0061692042|4.0|This is not a book you read for its plot.  You know from the start that narrator Dell Parsons' parents will rob a bank and that later there will be murders. You also know that despite this, Dell will grow up to be a teacher, so somehow, he will get out of the mess his supposed caretakers have put him in.  The book is about the people, borders and life.<br /><br />There are three parts, two where Dell tells the story of his 15th and 16th years and a third where he reconnects with his sister 50 years later.  The first, and strongest part, takes place in Great Falls, MT. Dell, whose real interests run from bees to chess, notices the small things in his parents' quiet, isolated lives. There are changes in how these seemingly mis-matched people relate to each other. There are hushed conversations the snippets of which are hard to put together.  There are cars passing the house and efforts are made to not notice. Dell sees his twin sister as more advanced and independent. While his narration is without passion, you feel for this 15 year old and his twin sister because you know the outcome will be so bad for them.<br /><br />The second part, for which the book is named, is very good, but not as strong as the first. Dell's mother has made plans for her children to be taken to Canada where they can start new lives. Dell's more adventurous sister runs away. Dell is given very little preparation for his new home, and his work partner suggests that child custody services might not have been so bad. You know the murders are coming, and as you get to know more about Charlie and Arthur, you wonder which one will kill or be killed.<br /><br />In the short third and final part, Dell describes his life 50 years hence, but not too much about how he got to this comfortable place. He reconnects with his sister.<br /><br />The first part was totally gripping. It was a quiet family in post-war America. There was distance between family members, but it was still a functioning unit which had love and strong values. As Dell describes them, you can see how the non-descript Neeva, fell for the handsome scheming Bev and like a series of dominoes, their lives fell into place.<br /><br />While this work is not about plot, two main pieces of it may or may not be realistic. From their surveillance the police had to know about the two Parsons minors, but following the arrest, no one came for them. Was/Is this standard procedure? Next, I'm more surprised than Dell (who speculates on why) that Arthur Remlinger let him go.<br /><br />I page turned the first part and there were some very strong parts to the second. I thought the third part was rushed. While Dell remains a dispassionate and bland personality, I don't think Ford had fully developed the 65 year old Berner in his mind.d love and strong values.

B004LROMWU|4.0|This series has a similar feel to me, as the series Jericho did, which is a good thing.  As with Jericho, the show mainly concentrates on the interplay between the people, not enormous CGI battle fests.  When the aliens are shown, they look pretty good and are integral to the storyline, and the CGI isn't overwhelming or ridiculous.  Solid acting, script, and storyline progression.  Definitely worth seeing, especially if you're a sci-fi fan. I look forward to the next season.
B008MEM24S|5.0|sweet game. it rocks. the part where the lasers are in it was very creative. there is a lot of commercials for it. it was not expensive. I heart wheres  my Perry.

B004JN1D2I|4.0|I'm on book 3 and totally hooked -- this series is hard to put down. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that the bundled kindle version treats the 4 books as one, and navigation is a bit difficult. The chapters are titled but not numbered in the text, and numbered but not titled in the list of contents, so it's hard to know where you are. Seems like it should be easy enough for the publisher to correct this. That said, the books are incredible.
B007NZ7LIY|5.0|Awesome game.  Animation and retro style is beautiful.  I played this game about 15 years ago on my parents gateway tower.  It was entertaining then and is entertaining now (even when those stupid slugs with fangs cut my leg).

0547569653|5.0|Fantastic book. Fantastic runner and human being.<br /><br />I've been reading about (and mildly obsessing over) Scott since 2004, scouring the internet for info on his diet and amazing race history, and I was so excited for the release of this book. Scott, you didn't let me down!<br /><br />I've read everything there is to read on ultramarathons and ultraracing--Karnazes, Roll, and the rest. This book is the best of the lot. Scott writes with a humility and self-awareness that the others lack. He explores the vegan diet and lifestyle, the existential side of ultrarunning, and the good/bad/ugly of training and his life.<br /><br />Thank you, Scott Jurek, for reinforcing my vegan lifestyle and inspiring me to get into ultras again!
B008KW43TE|5.0|Ok so, I bought into all of the hype about Frank Ocean and decided to buy the CD without hearing it first.  What a great decision!  This CD is good from beginning to end.  You don't have to skip all over trying to find a \\"good\\" song.  It was well worth the purchase and the music is just good.  Great buy!
0545265355|5.0|The best book ever you cant stop reading. I found my self reading till the sun rose up. Almost read three books straight.
B008602KQI|3.0|I was hoping for more action rather than dopey adolescent value references. Why are any one of these youngsters any better than others? Because it is written that way. So, we are suppose to identify with the \\"better\\" people. Fooey!
0345803507|5.0|This trilogy was incredibly hard to put down; I honestly tried to slow down reading the third book as I knew it was the final one.<br /><br />I don't want to give too much away for anyone who hasn't read any of the books. The first two books really built the relationship and the third one delved into the past with intrigue and mystery that answered what was happening \\"now\\" in the storyline of the characters.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is real page turner, you will be wanting to get the second book immediately after finishing this one!!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I was apprehensive to read this book, but alas, it was a book club choice. I was so pleasantly surprised that I don't know where to start, other than to say that I highly recommend this book! It has a bit of everything!Romance, Intrigue,Mystery, Magic. Read it, you won't be disappointed!
B0036JU6CY|5.0|This was an excellent movie!!!! I loved all of the use of martial arts in this film. I would love to see a part II to this movie. The main character has a mysterious approach to the entire movie that I loved. He made it seem like he could be the 'guy' next door but by the same token could also be just what he was and that was an assassin.... This movie was wonderfully directed.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I see some mixed reviews on here.  I personally thought it was a great series.  It's gritty, it seems fairly realistic, and it definitely doesnt shy away from the blood and gore which also all looks authentic.  To sum it up I would say that The Pacific really portays the horror of war.  Although this story focuses on the campaign from the American perspective, the Japanese are the ones taking the brunt of the horror.  It really show the brutality and savegry of the American Marines, which some people have argued was not portrayed in the best light.  It's not quite a feel-good show to watch but a war program will rarely be so.
B004UXUX4Q|1.0|Apart from the good acting, good direction and tight, fluent script, this is not much of a movie. It is eye-candy, and not in the least compelling. Unremarkable descendents of 19th century white missionaries to Hawaii who are now, after several generations, filthy rich from doing nothing more than capitalizing on vast inherited land holdings, yet have problems like everyone else, does not make for a gripping story. Instead, it is a rather revolting one.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app I always know where my level is. I also love the graphics and everything else it does.
B006DZYM0A|5.0|This breathtaking movie, with the barest of conventional plot, is a great floating set piece that portrays the unintended impact of those casual, thoughtless insensitivities to which we subject others on a daily basis, what the novelist Katherine Anne Porter identified as a central theme in her own work: \\"Illusion, delusion and self-deception. People never know quite what they are, and they don't know how to treat other people. As a child, it struck me how little one person could understand another.\\"
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i could barely put the book down! i actually read it in one day. i encourage everyone and anyone to read it. now i can finally see the movie!

0345803485|1.0|The concept is not very original. Too many similarities to both characters in Twilight. He is a good looking, rich, young guy. She is a clumsy, plain and deeply attracted to him girl. He cannot live without her and is super protective; she doesn't feel like she deserves him. Someone is after her and wants to kill her.  Gosh..... I couldn't get through the first book. I did enjoy Twilight but this felt like a repetition just spicier. The sex scenes are boring after a while. The same thing over and over again. I started skipping pages just to get to something essential. To be honest ,the only thing I really enjoyed were the emails they wrote to each other. Short, fun , to the point. Bought a trilogy but had no desire to continue.
0307887448|1.0|If you can somehow get past the myriad of cliches that makes up the foundation for Ready Player One, or the flat, vapid writing that lists the events in the book like commands in role-player games, or the over-the-shoulder \\"action\\" of second-hand video game watching, you will have over 300 pages of an amateur work of a fan fiction to enjoy forcing yourself through. If I didn't have to read this for college, I wouldn't have finished the book.<br /><br />This book feels like a dumping ground for a Wikipedia page, or a journal in which Cline deposits everything he has found about the 80's into a character that feels a little too much like self-insertion, like Cline needs to prove to someone what he knows about the 80's (even though everything he covers is the most common bands, movies, TV shows, you name it, that everyone has heard of. Van Halen was mentioned, but I didn't see anything about the Pixies or the Sound.)<br /><br />The book is set in 2045, where somehow the entire world (including every rights activist, environmentalist, and everyone else fighting for the world) has receded into the OASIS: the future's World of Warcraft on steroids, in order to escape from the problems humanity has been ignoring for this long anyways, so why stop now? But this future is not the future, per se, but a hybrid between the 80's and 2045, which makes sense considering the context of the book, but Cline seems unable to distinguish and remove slang, lingo and gestures from 2011 as well.<br /><br />The characters are not nearly intriguing enough to catch anyone's attention--even the main character falls short by several notches. It is established quite early on in the book that Wade Watts is a genius by the way he is able to store impossible amounts of 80's information like a flashdrive (insert witty joke about how he's turned into one by being plugged into the internet for so long). The characters of the book all seem to be cut-outs of one another, all witty, snarky, and rude-but-nice with a dash of lack of empathy on the side. And of course Wade has to go through the required withdrawal symptoms after he has been dumped by the only girl in the entire universe he could ever love. In the only real tragedy of the book, the emotion was either so non-existent that it didn't seem human (though they are avatars, technically) or so palpable that it was hardly believable, and multiple times I found myself laughing at very inopportune moments. I would also like to point out how horribly portrayed the Japanese characters of the book were, as I feel I have some responsibility to apologize to the people of Japan for their painfully stereotypical qualities.<br /><br />I was baffled that this book was given as summer reading for my college, and the only reason it didn't lower the opinion of the college itself was because I had to take into account how many people wouldn't read the book, and how many would just barely care enough to read it, so it had to be easy enough for them. While I was reading the book, if I came across a particularly grueling passage where Cline would spend pages upon pages listing information that Wade knew, my family and I would play a game: I would read the passage out loud, and they would try and force each other to listen to the passage the longest. The one part I enjoyed of this book were my mom and my sister writhing on the ground as they tried to get away while I read from the book. Even the prospect of writing this review didn't make finishing the book worth it, and this is the one essay where I wished the prompt had been \\"Did you like this book? Why or why not?\\" As it was, the message of the book is very important, but the writing itself was so horrible that I had trouble even caring that Cline had put so much effort into calling attention to the problems in the world.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!! Prior to watching the movie on the August 18th dvd release date, I had read the book trilogy 3 times through to make sure I had every little detail down. While this movie doesn't follow the book verbatim (let's face it, what movie based off a novel does?), it was very close. I wish they would have spent a bit more time one some things, like the cave scenes with Peeta and Katniss, but I suppose they felt they would have lost their male audience. ;) All in all, I was thrilled with the final result of this movie and am looking forward to the next one!<br /><br />On a side note for Amazon, I was very excited to see that they offered the instant watch on release date if you pre-ordered. I wasn't going to pre-order this movie because I didn't want to wait days for it to arrive. I had planned to just go to Walmart and buy it Saturday morning, but when I saw Amazon offered a release date viewing option, I jumped on the pre-order. Amazon needs to have more offers like this for ALL of it's pre-orders for movies.

B007N85ZXY|5.0|Springsteen went back to folk by paying homage to Pete Seeger's music if not his political agendas.<br />Neil apparently decided to reach farther back, all the way to Stephen Foster and  Percy Montrose/Barker Bradford/H. S. Thompson (\\"My Darlin' Clementine\\") and a desultory batch of others. Actually, these are mostly tunes Young played back in Canada long before he came to the states.<br /><br />Like many of Neil's albums, this one sounds deceptively loose; he works very hard, and works his band members hard to get the sound just so, but he does it so well, it doesn't sound forced; it sound like a bunch of guys got together in the basement. And that's how an album made for fun should sound, loose and fun.<br /><br />Neil and the Horse run through a pretty faithful version of the group The Big Three's \\"The Banjo Song\\" from 1963, which is a pepped up folk-pop version of Stephen Foster's \\"Oh Susanna\\" and give it rock treat in their inimitable garage band style. Actually, the Big Three might have gotten this tune from an earlier folk-pop group--that what the authorized biography says, anyhow.<br /><br />Some listeners can get into it and some can't, just like every other album Neil has put out -- wins some new fans, loses some old ones.<br /><br />But these are terrific takes on these tunes -- just plain fun.

0143119680|5.0|I thought this story was a page-turner!!  Intrigue, just enough of magic/fantasy and love matches.  It really has been a long time since I've read a book this well-done.  The writing is terrific and the story just flows !<br /><br />The only part(s) I found a little cumbersome were about the genetics which I felt was a little overdone (although in my professional life, I am involved in genetics).  Otherwise it was a terrific read and I just ordered the second in the series.  I couldn't wait a day longer !!

034580404X|2.0|I purchased this book as the ratings I read were all so high. The books that I bought were suppose to be used, so I was impressed when they arrived, they looked like they were brand new.<br /><br />I am still on the first book ( not one of those books you can't put down) as I have found it to be repetitive and monotonous. It is a story with a lot of sex and no writing skills in between each encounter. It seems to be written from a 15 year old's fantasies. Not too impressive, like I said it is unrealistic, not much of a story line, and slow moving. Unfortunately I had bought the trilogy after reading all the raves it got. Would not recommend it! So I still have 2 more books to limp through!
0374275637|5.0|This is a book about why people do what they do (and then make up reasons after the fact). Daniel Kahnerman paints a broad canvas, moving between tightly sketched nuances and grand explanations. He delves into some of the more profound questions confronting us, and does it all with the practiced ease of good, if not great writer.<br /><br />The story (and it is a story, as I will return to) begins with his recollecting his close and departed friend Amos Tversky and concludes with two papers that they co-wrote. In between is a feast of behavioural psychology, all premised around the idea that we humans decide things sometimes through intuitive guesses that might be the right answer but to the wrong question (System One thinking- the fast thinking of the title) and at other times through working through the details (System Two thinking, the slow thinking of the title). These complementary problem solving approaches can work harmoniously for our advantage, or (it seems to often) land us in deep water.<br /><br />About three quarters of the way through the book I became conscious of when I was responding primarily with one of the two thinking systems. Sitting in an airplane on a flight between Brisbane Australia and Noumea I was well and truly in the System One space - wine served with lunch further entrenched that mode. Things 'made sense' and didn't need to be laboured over. Then, the next morning over breakfast I found myself in System Two thinking - even taking the time to re-read material that on the previous day seemed to make sense.<br /><br />Which brings me to the comment earlier that this book is really a story. System One thinking, to my mind, works best with narrative, the telling of a story. Stories forgive the lack of tightly argued cases, leaning on the use of metaphor and common sense. Kahneman's weaving of his life experience (eg., as an officer in the Israeli Army, leader of a curriculum development team) and his constant references back to his departed colleague and friend, Amos, are the makings of a story. If you took those elements out then this book would be yet another droll text on nothing very much new. But it is the interplay between the 'science' and the 'narrative' that brings this book to life. If you haven't read it do so - it is a treat. And if you have read it, dip back into a section of two - they're mostly under 20 pages - and consciously re-read them with your 'System One' (fast) and 'System Two' (slow) hats on. If you are anything like me you will realise that while the system two arguments are cogent as you would expect from a writer of this callaber, it is the system one narratives that carry the day.d colleague and friend, Amos, are the makings of a story.

B005LAII0I|4.0|Our family enjoyed this rendition of Snow White (with a twist). I enjoyed seeing Julia Roberts as the Evil Queen. My son enjoyed the \\"vertically challenged\\" characters. If my memory serves me correctly there was only one taking the Lord's name in vain (or religious profanity if you check out kidsinmind.com for your movie reviews) and no other bad language. The prince ends up in his long underwear a couple of times and there are a couple of kisses. We found it to be a fun movie. Younger children might find the wolf/dragon \\"monster\\" scary at the end.

I don't know how Ms. Day had gotten away with using so many of the same things almost verbatim.  Even the book cover is similar.  I am enjoying the book but am also finding it upsetting every time I read a passage that sounds like it has come from the pages of Fifty Shades.

B004JN1D2I|5.0|The first three books are absolutely wonderful.  Great from cover to cover.  Great writing, and one those times where one can lay back and really get into the story, then anxious to read the next one.  Number four was quite a disappointment to me, as would be the 5th if I read it.  However, I recommend these first three for anyone who likes this genre or historical fiction.
B006OCM0G0|1.0|We downloaded this software to our daughter and she loves it. She doesn´t know how to read yet, so she clicks on every button that she founds until she can do what she wants. Last month I realised that she purchased 2 upgrades for this app by clicking on some buttons without know that actually was purchasing. The upgrades were U$ 19.99 and U$ 13.99 (very expensive for an android game !!!). Usually the games are around U$ 3.00. When I complain with Amazon they told me to enable parental controls at Amazon APPSTORE. Doing that, if my daughter will try to click in the wrong button again, the APPSTORE will ask for a password. I think this kind of config should be enable by default !!! But I´m reviewing this software and not APPSTORE... My decision to give only one start is because for me it is unaceptible to download a free software that when you click in a button it charges you these prices. For me it is not fair. Pay attention parents.
B000FCKGPC|2.0|The first three volumes of this series are absolutely great.  Fantastic reads in all of them.  Talked to my son and learned this series is one of his favorite.  However, I find volume four less than acceptable for this writer as I'm sure I will if I read the fifth in the series. I'm finishing number 4 just because I want to finish it, but looking forward to my next book whatever it might be.So, all in all the first three are splendid and definitely worth the time from cover to cover.

B005LAIGN2|5.0|This is a segment of our history that we should all know about.  It is so awful how the black pilots were discriminated against. It is a wonderful dvd that shows how courageous the black pilots were, even in the face of such discrimination. This movie was so well done, that I wanted to learn more about the Tuskegee pilots and went on line to obtain additional historical facts about the \\"Red Tails\\".
0062206281|2.0|I suspect my review will be unpopular here on Amazon, so let me start my review by stating that I have read both The Shadow of the Wind and The Angel's Game multiple times, and love them both.  Perhaps because I enjoyed the previous two novels so much, I found Zafon's effort in The Prisoner of Heaven utterly disappointing.<br /><br />Zafon always stated that he intended the novels commencing with The Shadow of the Wind to be stand-alone works, interconnected by various characters and, most importantly, the Cemetery of Forgotten Books.  Thus, a reader could start with any one of the novels and jump into an intriguing mystery story -- chronology is not important.  Zafon previously stated the following:<br /><br />\\"I never meant to write a sequential saga, or a series of sequels of sorts. The idea is to write stories around this literary universe centered around the cemetery of forgotten books, exploring this gothic, mysterious universe through different characters and storylines. As you say, perhaps it would have been more commercialy advisable to do that, to write a straight sequel and pick up the story where we left it, but it was never my idea to do so and I think it is more interesting to play around with the narrative spaces and lines to pull the reader into a fictional universe that plays by its own rules.\\"<br /><br />Zafon has, apparently, now scrapped this idea.  Where the first two novels are marvelous mysteries in their own right (who is Julian Carax; who is the \\"boss\\"?) -- The Prisoner of Heaven is merely filler, nothing more than an explanation of elements of the first two novels and a set-up for the final novel. The Prisoner of Heaven doesn't contain a riveting mystery, it doesn't develop characters (indeed all of the major characters are persons we've met before), it doesn't add to the mysterious qualities of The Cemetery of Forgotten Books, and (most importantly) it doesn't have a satisfactory conclusion in its own right.  Rather, the novel does two things: (i) it attempts to resolve matters/mysteries from the first two books (matters and mysteries that, in my opinion, didn't need a resolution); and (ii) apparently sets up the next novel.<br /><br />With respect to the first point, the mystery surrounding The Angel's Game (whether the \\"boss\\" existed at all or whether David was indeed insane and had imagined the entire episode) was completely obliterated by this book.  Zafon sums up one of his most intriguing characters (David Martin) in the simplest and most uninteresting manner possible -- he's crazy, end of story.  Just like that, all the mystery is drained from the otherwise superb The Angel's Game.  I guess Zafon wants the reader to just forget about the epilogue to The Angel's Game or pretend the events in the epilogue never occurred, as it is completely contradicted by The Prisoner of Heaven (or, I guess, it can all be unsatisfactorily explained away simply by saying Martin is crazy).<br /><br />Likewise, now Zafon in The Prisoner of Heaven (in my opinion) reinvents both Fermin and Isabella.  Now the chance meeting of a vagabond and a young boy was always meant to happen; now Isabella's death was no accident (although the resolution to this part of the story did not occur in The Prisoner of Heaven -- I thought these books could stand on their own?).  I would have preferred not to know whether the \\"boss\\" existed or was a figment of David's imagination.  I would have preferred to believe that Fermin and Daniel met and became friends by chance, rather than some elaborate vow as a result of a prison escape straight out of the Count of Monte Cristo.  Isn't that part of what made the mysteries of The Shadow of the Wind and The Angel's Game so entertaining?  Now characters have been reformed and mystery obliterated for the sake of simply moving the story along.<br /><br />In summary, The Prisoner of Heaven felt like a very rushed attempt to capitalize on the popularity of the previous two novels.  The idea of independent, though interconnected, mystery stories located in Barcelona and centered around the Cemetery of Forgotten Books has been abandoned, as I have to assume that the fourth novel will resolve the lingering issues brought up in The Prisoner of Heaven(did I mention that the Prisoner of Heaven doesn't really contain a conclusion).<br /><br />Zafon previously stated \\"since each novel was going to be complex and difficult to write, I decided to take one at a time and see how the experiment evolved on its own in an organic way.\\"  The Prisoner of Heaven is not complex (checking in at only 280 or so pages) and did not evolve on its own (no new characters, no independent story, etc.) -- perhaps Zafon should have revisited his own words and crafted a novel that fit the style and pattern of the previous two.

B000002OX7|5.0|Much has been written about this recording coming out of the failed Lifehouse project. Set that history aside and simply take in the stunning suite of songs on this album. Track for track, the original nine songs not only make this the best Who record by a long mile, it makes it in my mind the best pure rock & roll record ever made. Yes, that's quite a statement given rock's long history but what makes this record simply sensational is that each member of the band was at his absolute creative peak. These are Townsend's greatest set of songs, whether he was rocking out at maximum R&B or writing his most soul baring, achingly beautiful songs. Daltry came into his own as a singer here, not just singing loudly but with real feeling and power. Entwistle was a beast here, practically reinventing the bass and Keith Moon was a force of nature. All of this would make it a great rock record, a landmark, but what pushes it to the very pinnacle of hard rock albums is Townsend's radical use of synthesizers. This has been covered at length but it bears repeating that no one had ever used synthesizers in this way before and the interplay between their insistent, almost primal repetitions and Moon having to coordinate his drumming is simply stunning. Tunes like Baba O'Riley, Bargain and Won't Get Fooled Again are powerhouse songs that reinvented rock. Most good rock bands would give their eye teeth to have this record as their greatest hits package, let alone a single record. The Who never rocked harder or laid their soul bare in the same way before or after. From start to finish this record outshines any single record the Stones ever cut. Or any other true rock band for that matter. Greatest hard rock album of all time? You bet.

B003X5UFWW|5.0|I always enjoy a great action movie, especially a well-done martial arts flick. This one has something sorely lacking in many action movies: characters you can care about involved and a compelling story line. Not sure how true-to-life the story is, but I thoroughly enjoyed the story as it was told.<br /><br />Well done!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I barely made it through half the first one.  I've heard it gets better, but I have too many things to do in this short life time to waste any more time on it, hoping that's the case. With the amazingly bad writing demonstrated in the first half, I have no hope for improvement.  The fact that so many women my age are SO into it seriously makes me re-consider the general (low, demented) tastes and standards of my peers too. If it was not on my kindle I would have thrown it away, or used it for toilet paper.  That would go along with its sick kinky theme that apparently all American Women just cant' get enough of!  Question ladies: do your boyfriends and Hubbies know you are reading about this dark sadomasachiistic crap... might spice of your real life so you dont' have to waste any more time on reading this crappy book!  I'ld almost rather be whipped and abused than have to endure any more of 50SOG.  Kudos to brilliant marketing that has made this joke of a series a national phenom.

1936608898|5.0|I have not attended any of their workshops.  I have some health problems and the Paleo way of eating has been healing me.  My mom is having some serious health problems, and I wanted a convincing and easy-to-understand book for her to read.  I know it may seem hard to believe that food can have so much impact on health because its effects are largely ignored by most doctors, but please try it for yourself.  You will never look at food the same way again.<br /><br />This book is a great resource of information.  It is very thorough but easy to read, and it explains complicated concepts with great analogies.  The writing is casual, but I think this is one of the best aspects because it makes the reading quick and enjoyable.<br /><br />I have read several other Paleo books - this one is a winner!

Great first book about dinosaurs. Would totally recommend it.
145162445X|3.0|Update:<br />After reviewing other works by Krauss (and Dawkins), I understand *why* he is attempting to disprove the requirement for a God-like entity. I agree with many of his sentiments, but I disagree with his approach in this book. As a university educated scientist I learned that it is impossible to construct a valid proof for the existence (or non existence) of a God-like entity. It follows that there is no valid proof for the -requirement- of a God-like entity. You cannot prove that God exists, and you cannot prove that God must exist. And since there is no valid proof for the existence (or not) of a God-like entity, your religious beliefs must be based entirely on faith.<br /><br />Therefore as a scientist I must leave God out of my math equations, and I must leave the question of God to the philosophers and theologians. The two fields must exist in isolation.<br /><br />As to *why* Krauss wants to disprove the requirement for a God-like entity? I believe it is simply due to the very real and demonstrable damage that some organized religions cause. Work by Krauss and others to bring this discussion to open public forums is a very good thing, and society can benefit from this discussion. In my work as a scientist I am required to travel all around the globe. I have personally toured contested areas in the middle east, interviewed combatants and affected civilians, and I have seen the fear in their eyes as they tell me what they have seen, and what is to come. There is no doubt that organized religion is the overlying cause. If you can stop this madness Dr. Krauss, then you have my full support.<br /><br />So I will change my review from 1 star to 3 stars. +2 for good intentions, -2 for attempting to present an invalid proof and knowingly using it to promote your otherwise valid social, political, and religious agenda.<br /><br />Promoting bad science has consequences - it leads people to base their beliefs in flawed reasoning. In an interview on the TV showNightline, a young atheist stated that if a God came to her and performed a miracle, then she would believe in that God. I leave the proof to the reader, but recall Clarke's statement that \\"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic\\", and recommend the young atheist keep her faith and avoid the more likely event of abduction by human.<br /><br />Dr. Krauss, I don't understand why you allow yourself to get caught up in an unwinnable debate. You know the counter arguments - it is turtles all the way down. Extract yourself from this flawed approach and lead your millions of faithful followers to effect global change based on facts. Work to gain understanding and acceptance from people with faiths different from yours. This is a hard thing, but you know that anything less is the work of a lazy mind.<br /><br />--- original review ---<br />I'm sure that Krauss is a fine theologian, but the scientific method eludes him. If you are looking for real science, this book is not for you. I highly recommend that you read the preface (in the free preview) before purchasing this book. Attempting to prove or disprove the existence of some external mechanism is just bad science. As a trained scientist, Krauss should know better. It leaves me to wonder if this lack of scientific method pervades his other purported discoveries.

B005LAIH4A|2.0|When Dr. Seuss gets serious, you don't know what you are going to get.  That's because his extremely left-wing views sometimes lead him to the truth, sometimes blind him to the truth, and sometimes just lead him astray.  Thus his story about [[ASIN:0394800893 The Sneetches]] still stands as one of the most effective condemnations of the stupidity of prejudice based upon appearance ever written, and [[ASIN:0394800877 Yertle the Turtle and Other Stories]] contains three brilliantly effective modern fables.  On the other hand Dr. Seuss' own prejudices (he was an extreme pro-abortionist) made him absolutely horrified to learn that pro-lifers were drawing the obvious conclusion from the moral of [[ASIN:0394800788 Horton Hears A Who!]]: \\"A person's a person, no matter how small,\\" by applying it to unborn children, and despite the avalanche of demands to cease and desist with lawsuits to follow, Dr. Seuss went to his grave knowing that despite his best (or worst) intentions, he had written the unofficial but extremely effective motto of the pro-life movement.  Dr. Seuss' worst book by far is [[ASIN:0394865804 The Butter Battle Book]], but in fairness to him, writing it was an act of sheer desperation.  He probably knew he was dying, and in 1984 his beloved Soviet Union (Dr. Seuss was a Communist sympathizer before being a Communist sympathizer was cool.) was also dying at the hands of President Ronald Reagan who unlike most \\"experts\\" of all political persuasions believed the Cold War was winnable.  In the end Dr. Seuss failed, Ronald Reagan succeeded, and a lot of kids were forced to read a truly subpar book because their teachers liked its politics.<br /><br />This brings us to [[ASIN:0394823370 The Lorax]], arguably Dr. Seuss' second worst book, not because the message hammered home with a sledgehammer in it was particularly evil, but rather because it was so unnecessary.  Stripped of its dramatics and anti-business bias, the primary message of The Lorax was don't only chop down and never plant the trees you depend on for your business.  Well, DUH!  American logging companies were starting to figure this out in the NINETEENTH Century!  Certainly by the time The Lorax was written, there wasn't an American logging company that wasn't planting several trees for every tree they cut down.  The secondary message was don't carelessly and thoughtlessly pollute the air and the water, and while it took longer for this message to sink in, by 1971 it really had, and the air and water were rapidly being cleaned up.  I did then and I do now have a problem with a children's story that consciously and deliberately pressures small children to solve a problem that their parents have already solved.  What next?  Telling little kids that \\"unless\\" they care a whole awful lot, enough to do something about it, slavery will never be abolished?<br /><br />Finally, instead of just doing a CG remake of the 1972 version: [[ASIN:B005QDU96Q The Lorax]], the creators of this mess decided they could do a better job than Dr. Seuss; the result is something both left-wing and right-wing can take offence at.  Having junked, even made fun of most of Dr. Seuss' beautiful language, they replace it with a lot of questionable humor (the anti-Redneck humor really got old) and slapstick chase scenes.  They cranked up the the anti-business bias to an earsplitting screech, but at the same time sabotaged their own message in ways reviewers who preferred the original noted: having the Lorax speak for the trees AND for Mazda and iHop and Theatre AMC due to grating product placements, having the Lorax START OUT trying to kill the Once-ler by dumping him over a waterfall, and ridiculing bottled water purchasers.<br /><br />Read the book or watch the original animated version if you must, but give this schizophrenic abomination a pass.hop down and never plant the trees you depend on for your business.

0385340567|1.0|I love the series and have read about 10 of them.  I picked up this one recently and it was totally out of character.  Reacher is an anti-military guy in this; defending a soldier network that is smuggling AWOL military to Canada!  Why?  because the US is unjust doing un-defendable things around the world and it is richteous that these brave traitors are standing up for something.  I was spinning with irritation at this political ranting on Child's part.  I am an Environmental Engineer and cleanup pollution for a living.  One of the plot elements is an evil polluter making people sick.  This was a stupid unrealistic, and frankly ignorant, Hollywood add-in to this story.  I am also a Christian and of coarse the evil guy is a loony Evangelical \\"end times\\" type preacher and rich control freak. (who of course loves our evil military and their forays into other countries)  The whole book had me steaming and wanting to throw it at Lee Child.  I think I am over Reacher for a while.

B000GKPKMW|5.0|Ender's Game is number five on my list of favorite Science Fiction novels.  Number Five.  I usually re-read this a couple of times a year.  Confess I skip over most of the family background stuff on re-reads.<br /><br />Rationally, I can't get with the whole Using Kids To Command Fleets Of Spaceships thing; not that it's morally wrong, just that I can't see any advantage to doing so.  And logically, I don't understand how success in the arena of null-grav, leading an army of boys in The Game would later translate into success in directing fleets of spaceships.  But Orson Scott Card is such a terrific writer that he makes me forget all my objections and get completely lost in his story. It's no sillier than Harry Potter.<br /><br />These kids who are commandeered from their parents at an early age, drafted into Battle School, split into competitive Armies to fight each other in a null-grav game area, are our civilization's only hope for survival against a powerful alien race we can't even communicate with.  And Ender seems to be our best chance to live: the ultimate commander.  But he's too young, too small, and there's little hope to get him trained in time for the spaceship battles soon to come.<br /><br />As I understand it, while writing this, Card felt he was being distracted from the story he really wanted to write about by this story of The Game and the boys and a few girls playing it.<br /><br />If you enjoy Ender's Game, I recommend you try Ender's Shadow by Card (book 5 in the Ender series).  It retells \\"The Game\\" from the POV of another player, an even younger player named Bean.  Yes, I also skip the background non-game stuff in this one during re-reads.  The idea of retelling the same story from another character's point of view has had a powerful influence on my own novels.  @hg47

0545123275|5.0|Yes, I am finally getting around to reading the Mercy Falls series!  I've been waffling on it (werewolves are so not my thing), but I loved Stiefvater's The Scorpio Races so much (seriously - it makes it into my top five books of all time), so I decided to bite the bullet and start this incredibly popular series.  And, I'm happy to report, I was very glad I did!<br /><br />I enjoy Stiefvater's easy writing style.  Some parts are a little eye-roll inducing, such as Grace's incessant need to refer to Sam as \\"My Wolf\\" early on.  And I could have done without Sam's emo lyrics he makes up in his head.  But, Grace and Sam are both extremely likable characters.  Thankfully the angst and flowery description of love are kept to a minimum.  Also, I am happy that they didn't go on and on about werewolf lore and I appreciate that the werewolves are really just...wolves.  Not slobbering crazed beasts.  The story is kept fairly small and mostly centers on Grace and Sam.  Some other stuff happens, but it isn't really an action packed book.  But it is pretty entertaining throughout the entirety and I am excited to go back for more!<br /><br />As a side note, the publisher's blurb is so weird.  Why would you say \\"so close they could be siblings or lovers\\"?  It makes it sound so creepy!  And \\"howling at the lonely moon\\"? What?  I'm beginning to remember why I was reluctant to read this series.  If anything, the book is at least better than that blurb!
0439023513|3.0|I just finished Mockingjay, the last book of the Hunger games.  I feel oddly distraught over the way that Suzanne Collins led me down me path, only to switch out the end and substituting the ending to a completely different novel, leaving a conclusion only in name.  I got answers, but not only were they not the answers that I thought I deserved, not to mention not even vaguely the answers I wanted....but they seemed to be answers that should have been obtained only through a different experience, a different way to get to the end, a different path.  I can respect an author's desire to keep things interesting and their right to rule their creation in the manner that they see fit, but I think, in the end, that she did herself, her world,and her faithful readers a bit of a disservice.  I reserve the right to reevaluate this opinion as I mull this over in the next few days.  Sometimes, emotions can cloud a judgement, and logic may win me over eventually.  We'll see.

Updated which is very necessary as original is quite deragatory to many groups.  This snow white finds out things for herself and solves the problem.  I liked the cast, costumes were fabulous, just a fun enjoyable movie.
B007KZY1YY|1.0|This book is such a waste of money and i will never understand how people could find it interesting. I only read half of it and I COULDN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|I really enjoyed this blues cd, even though Mr. Hugh Laurie is not a blues singer and  has not been singing the blues for years, he does not sound too bad, he could be better , but the cd musicians and singers that were in this album with Mr. Laurie made the  musical arrangements and vocals a very fun experience to listen to and to sing along with. I have listened to this cd a few times and it sounds great. No wonder it was in the top 10 cds sold in the UK music charts for several weeks.  Well done Doctor House, i think Doctor Foreman and Doctor Wilson would be proud of you. LOL
1469984202|5.0|Picture the Agean sea.  Clear, crispy, cool, beautiful.  Instead of sand, there are smooth pebbles. The sun is out and there is a slight breeze.  There is free beer and music playing in the background.  You have one more day to enjoy this particular beach before you are sent back to the billboard-riddled confines of a blisteringly hot American city, where work and a long commute haunt you.  What are you doing?<br /><br />I was cooped up in a small room with a fan, no swimming suit in sight, reading this book so eagerly that I had to cover the next page with my hand so my eyes weren't tempted to skip ahead.<br /><br />It's that good.<br /><br />The characters are so real, I forget that they are a figment of Howey's imagination. The world is so real, I could draw it.  I could make it myself.  Down to every detail.  The people are so real, I know their faults and their traits.  I can even picture their distinctive movements.  This book had my heart racing.<br /><br />I cannot remember the last time I devoured a book such as this one. The pages are bent hastily, the spine is broken, a bit of the side is torn, and there are smudges on most pages.  I took this book with me everywhere, praying for a quick moment where I could unfold the corner of a page, only to fold the next one when something came up.<br /><br />It is amazing!  I can't wait to read his other books.  I can't bring myself to read them on a kindle (sorry, Amazon) like my sister and mother do-- it was so delicious reading it on the pages, gripping the edges of the cover, and pawing at the corners when I'm ready for the next chapter.  I'd recommend buying this book immediately.<br /><br />I can't even tell you any details, paranoid I'd ruin it.  I can only tell you how amazing it is.  I shoved it into my best friend's hands once I'd returned from my vacation, and my mother asked me who would play a character in the movie.  My eyes bulged and I shook my head-- thinking the name of a character already divulgedtoo much information.  So I can only say- just read it.<br /><br />Other books I love, so maybe you can get a feel for my taste in literature:<br /><br />The Forgotten Garden<br />The Historian<br />Hunger Games<br />City of Ember<br />Frankenstein<br />A Certain Slant of Light<br /><br />-Cody Ozcan
B00846REIS|3.0|I liked it but it was very similiar to \\"Fifty Shades\\".  I thought it would be a different story line then Fifty.
B008602KQI|5.0|Being a huge fan of the books I was a bit leery to see this movie in the theatre as the movies usually aren't as good as the books.  While, even in this case, the book was better, it was very true to the scope and feel of the book.  Great movie, great casting, and great acting all around!  November 2013 is too long to wait for Catching Fire!! Q_Q
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The book has a slow start, but the story line is good and very erotic! I definitely want to read the second and third book. :)
B000PMFS2I|5.0|The DVD is perfect, and the movie as campy and raunchy as I ever remembered. It's a classic 90's film that takes me back to a time when I was too young to even comprehend things like this. When this movie came out I was probably watching Sesame Street and Arthur, but now that I'm older I get to take a trip back in time with a different aspect of the glamorous side of the 90's.  Very entertaining ( but terrible acting)

0062206281|5.0|This book draws you in straight away, just like it did to me with The Shadow of the Wind: it's so beautifully written and mysterious. When a stranger enters the bookshop at the beginning of the book, the story begins straight away. Apparently this person knows something about Ferm&iacute;n Romero de Torres, who works at the bookshop but is not present at the time. Ferm&iacute;n has a mysterious past and Daniel follows the stranger across Barcelona to try and find out more about him.<br /><br />Then the story goes a bit flat for a short while but really picks up when Ferm&iacute;n tells Daniel about his past in prison. This is intermixed with the story of Daniel in the \\"now\\", which is 1957. Eventually, the characters from Ferm&iacute;n's past and from the present time come together in a thrilling ending.<br /><br />A note at the beginning of the book says that the books in this series can be read in any order. I'd only read the first book, The Shadow of the Wind, and had not read the second book The Angel's Game, yet. This was not a problem at all. In fact, in The Prisoner of Heaven, not all that much happens in the present time, so that most of the book is about the past, from before the time of The Shadow of the Wind.<br /><br />We learn about the time Ferm&iacute;n spent in prison, we hear about the writer David Mart&iacute;n, who wrote The Angel's Game, a book that I guess is focused on in the Zaf&oacute;n book with the same name. We also find out about Isabella Sempere, Daniel's mother, and how she died.<br /><br />I liked the story in the past best.The present-day (1957) story was a little weaker and didn't seem to serve a lot of purpose. Only at the end the story lines come together, and the past overtakes the present and plays an important role again.<br /><br />The book is full of adventure, suffering, trust and mistrust. Even if the story would not appeal to you at first, try the book for its fantastic writing style.

B0083H6AQA|1.0|Twihards insists that critics are unreasonably harsh on the virtues of Robert Pattinson, but notice that they don't rally enough enthusiasm to actually see any of his non-Twilight flicks such, I suspect this is because they realize that there youthful infatuation does not out way the fact that pictures such as Remember Me are not any good, and possibly they also understand that Pattinson himself is no better than the material. In Bel Ami, he is actually given very good material, based on Guy de Maupassant's 1895 novel, but he is merely only the weakest link in speciously poorly made movie.<br /><br />Pattinson plays Georges Duroy, a literary rogue, a skillfully charming social climber, or as de Maupassant himself subtitled his book, \\"the history of a scoundrel.\\" Here he is transformed by Pattinson into a thoroughly unlikable reprobate, who's unreasonably smug and arrogant, a womanizer and a manipulator, it would be a stretch to call this guy an anti-hero. Pattinson lacks the necessary charisma to pull off such a role, think of Johnny Depp in The Libertine a few years back, he seems ill-at ease here, as if he understands that the material is staggeringly out of his depth.<br /><br />A capable supporting cast comes across mostly badly for one reason or another. Uma Thurman is primed and proper, but has to wobble her way through some horrendous dialogue. Kristen Scott Thomas plays frigid better than any other actress I know, oddly enough, a British actress, she has been a lot more warm and human in some recent French language films. Here she has little to do, but does successfully manage to exert great empathy for her repressive and shrewish character, but she also manages to remain unmoving and their for dull.  Colm Meaney and Philip Glenister, two good actors, play the other men in Pattinson's vehicle, this may explain why they fail to get any dynamic scenes or many scenes for that matter away from the dull lead. Only Christina Ricci adds any spark in a spirited supporting turn, but her role is only one dimensional, she comes across more like someone's pet than as a fully developed human being.<br /><br />The proceedings unfold so monotonously, that at one point Pattinson utters the line \\"this is so boring this endless to and fro.\\" You don't get any more surreal than when movie characters start uttering your own inner thoughts. Everything fails to liven the surroundings, the sex is passionless, the character's motivations either unpleasantly despicable or maidenly vague. No wonder Pattinson is famous for playing a vampire, he is perhaps the most bloodless actor I have seen in ages, these days he's outclassed by Daniel Radcliffe.<br /><br />Adapted by Rachel Bennette and directed by Declan Donnellan and Nick Ormerod, first time directors, who like most virgins know the basic moves, but lack the skills to be fully satisfying. Set in and around Paris at the end of the 19th century, the details look good, though pretentiously photographed by Stefano Falivene, it is filled with what one character calls \\"astonishing depths of emptiness.\\"<br /><br />Pattinson has recently formed a partnership with legendary cult director David Cronenberg, they have a finished film title that I greatly anticipate titled Cosmopolis set for US release in August, after that they have another film in development. Maybe Cronenberg sees something in Pattinson that has been missing up until now on screen, but will fans ever warm to the actor outside of his popular franchise, I don't have the answer, but one thing that is for sure, it wont start with Bel Ami, a beggar's version  of Dangerously Liaisons.<br /><br />Check out my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com
0345803485|1.0|Do you know what is creepy about this book? It's the story of a girl being horrifically abused by a man. 50 Shades of Grey is not literature. What about this plot could possibly be acceptable and mainstream? We just had the whole Sandusky affair. You'd think people would be on high alert against child porn and pedophilia. You'd think people would be up in arms about a book like this hitting our shelves. I just came across a very well-written letter related to 50 Shades. Anyone who is considering buying/reading the book should first read the letter: [...]
B005LAJ212|5.0|The first Season of Revenge was a non-stop rollercoaster ride with so many twists and turns that it was almost unbearable to wait for the next episode to air. Luckily this won't be a problem with the DVD Edition of the complete first season.<br /><br />ABC was very vague in the press release in terms of extras, and also amazon doesn't provide you with any lists, so i wanted to quickly write down the special features that are included here:<br /><br />- Audiocomentary on the Pilot with Mike Kelley and Emily VanCamp<br />- Nolan Ross Exposed (2:45 min) - featurette<br />- Roadmap to Revenge (13:01 min) - featurette<br />- At Home in the Hamptons (7:57 min) - featurette<br />- Haute Hamptons: Femme Fatale Fashion (7:25 min) - featurette<br />- Angus & Julia Stone - \\"For You\\" (2:45 min) - music video<br />- Christina Perry - \\"Distance\\" (4:02 min) - music video<br />- Deleted Scenes (cca 30:00 min)<br />- Gag Reel (2:45)

B001KVZ6HK|1.0|The Avengers is a fun movie, but also pretty dumb. I buy movies if i'm interested in watching them again in the near future - I'm not interested in watching The Avengers again, at-least for a few years because it's a very shallow movie and I feel that I've absorbed everything that it has to offer.<br />In addition to the aforementioned lack of depth in the movie, I have some criticism to offer about various elements in the movie that I think could have been handled better. Please bear in mind that I'm fully aware of the fact that this is a comic-book movie and I don't expect a high level of realism.<br />1. Why are the two human Avengers even in this movie? They seem completely out of place and not at all human. The girl's role is OK as a spy and interrogator, but what about the archer person? Why doesn't someone just shoot him and move on? Are you really telling me that he's so badass that no one can hit him with a freaking handgun? His character does not seem to belong in the role that he performs in this movie. Also, I'm a little tired of ninja-chicks - does every movie have to have one?<br />2. When the Avengers fight each other, they don't actually seem to be capable of hurting each other. Why even bother fighting then? All it seems to cause is just a little inconvenience to each other. One would assume that they'd turn it into a game then - like tennis. I'd love to watch that - two guys in leotards and underwear play-fighting with each other. Sounds awesome doesn't it? Wait a sec - isn't that just professional wrestling?<br />3. WTF is up with the bad guys at the end - were they really supposed to suck that much at invasions? To me, the 'invasion' at the end of the movie looked less like an invasion and more like Loki had opened a portal bang in the middle of an interstate and offered free beer to a bunch of motorcycle aliens to drive through and raise hell! Where was the alien air-superiority? Where were tactical strikes aimed at eliminating resistance? Wherewere the covert strike teams preparing to pave the ground for the invasion? If the 'invasion' was a carefully planned alien military operation, they should just shoot the commanding generals now and get some people who are actually competent.<br />4. What was up with the Independence Day/Phantom Menace tribute at the end of the movie? Couldn't the makers of the movie have come up with something a little more original than having a valiant hero fly to the alien mother-ship and detonate a big bomb that magically turns all the aliens off because of-course, remote controlled minions are the way to invade/blockade a foreign location? So 90s!<br />5. The Avengers are not heroes in this movie. At the end, after having killed masses of alien invaders and after having detonated some kind of big bomb to kill the aliens, our 'heroes' don't even have a single scratch or injury worth mentioning! They're hale and hearty enough to picnic on shawarma at the end! Why did they make such a fuss about the whole thing? It didn't look like a single human being was killed in the whole fight - just masses of big bad aliens who were utterly incompetent anyway! All that the Avengers were is super-beings, even the ones who were supposed to be humans. True bravery is seen when a person performs acts that are dangerous and life-threatening , knowing that it is probably going to result in their demise - not when there is no real threat. No one calls WWF wrestlers 'heros' because they are big and tough. We call firefighters heros because when they go into a burning building to rescue a fellow human being in trouble - they are risking their lives because they want to do that which is right, not that which is most convenient or easy. That is what makes a firefighter a hero. This I feel, is the biggest failing of the movie.<br />6. JDEM? Seriously? Do they know that JDEM is no longer called JDEM (it was renamed in 2010 when the most recent Decadal Survey came out)? If they want to help promote science by making the next big project in Astronomy cool, why not get the name correct and call it WFIRST? We sure wouldn't mind the publicity!

B0081L37Z0|5.0|This movie surpassed all of my expectations. It was clever and witty. The main characters had great chemistry together. One of the funniest movies I've seen in a while. It's rare that I want to watch a movie more than once but I'd definitely watch this one again on a regular basis.  Very good.

0738711500|3.0|I bought the deck about a year or so ago, and at first I didn't make much of a connection to it. I ended up giving it away. However, I was looking for a decent book to use to help a friend who was wanting to learn, and I bought this kit. I gave him the book, but the deck didn't speak to him. So I gave him a spare deck of mine that I didn't care much for and picked this one back up. The second time, once I took the time to get a feel for the cards, I fell in love with it. At first, I thought the art was SO NOT ME, but it really grew on me, especially after a few very direct readings.<br /><br />One thing I would point out is that while the deck is very blunt, even a little sarcastic at times, the book isn't terribly helpful for a beginning reader and helped my friend precisely NONE. A better idea for someone just starting out, IMO, would be a deck like the Radiant Rider-Waite or the Hanson-Roberts with a book like The Tarot Revealed by Paul Fenton-Smith or The New Tarot Handbook by Rachel Pollack.
B007IQX1G4|4.0|I read some of the other reviews which are mostly bad. I know people want a movie that ends on a happy note or makes them feel good. But there's something to be said for enjoying a good story even when the characters are unlikeable. Unlikeable people need their stories told too.<br /><br />Mavis is a depressed writer who makes a trip home when she finds out her ex-boyfriend and his wife just had a baby. I enjoyed watching how far her character would go in her depravity. This is not a love story or a feel-good story but I appreciated it for what it was.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I am not a reader but I couldn't put these books down. Loved them.  What an easy read! These are the perfect books to read on the beach or in the car or even in bed.  You might get a few ideas.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|This movie was clearly aimed directly at easily dramatized tweens and teenagers in the vein of the Harry Potter and Twilight series.  That, after all, has become the quickest and surest avenue to success for today's would-be auteurs.  But I am going to give it a pass on that shady aspect, if for no other reason that I enjoyed it more than the Harry Potter films and I found the Twilight series to be pure rubbish.  So, in spite of the wholly gratuitous plot and script, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, finding it entertaining and, for the most part, well acted and directed.  I confess that as the movie began I kept thinking how ridiculous a concept that a modern society would slaughter it's best and brightest young people for politics and entertainment.  In Ancient Rome, yes, or the Mayans, but not today(sic).  Then I reminded myself how many of today's governments throughout the world (and not excluding our own) do far worse, absent the entertainment part, and the concept didn't seem so far fetched.  I can't imagine this movie winning any serious Oscars (best costumes maybe), and I suppose Jennifer Lawrence may get a nomination, even though she was far more challenged, and up to the task, in \\"Bones.  But, and this is mostly thanks to the inspiring Ms. Lawrence, I do look forward to the sequels.

0738702994|4.0|The art in this deck is absolutely gorgeous. The minors follow a Rider-Waite-Smith inspired structure, but for heaven's sake, read the book--the myths associated with the majors add SUCH a valuable layer of insight! Some of the stories related in the companion book gave me a completely different perspective to consider with the cards, particularly the substitution of the Wild Herdsman as the Horned One rather than the Devil. The watercolor art in the deck is beautifully executed, with an exciting but unthreatening feel. My only complaint is that the cards are a little big for my hands (and my hands aren't really all that small). I see why they were made that way, though, because if they were any smaller, it would mean losing a lot of the detail.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I got to do a lot of stuff like chopping trees and building things and it takes about 5 or 8 minutes to lose all my energy and I love playing the game but I can only play for like 10 minutes and then I have to stop it because I cant do anything really except buy things and build it later when I have energy so I would appreciate it if we could earn energy quicker so when you change that I will give you five stars but I do recommend this game its awesome for all genders even though it looks like a boys game I'm a girl and I like it so get it and let me know how you liked it say it to bling girl okay?

B0085A9J18|5.0|\\"The Raid:  Redemption\\" is a much-talked about, highly anticipated movie that did not make it into my part of the region for a theatrical screening!  I suppose the distributors had a rough time when they tried to distribute the movie because:  (a) It was one of the best I've seen this year; (b) it wasn't a stupid, epically boring love story, or (c) it wasn't animated.  Shows you where Hollywood's tastes really are:  in their mouths.<br /><br />\\"Raid\\" is a non-stop, b*lls-to-the-wall movie encompassing the maelstrom that 20 of the \\"best\\" cops are thrown into while they try to take over a 30 floor drug empire disguished as a tenament and arrest its sadistic boss.  I was hooked after only five minutes which is basically all the movie takes in trying to deliver any \\"warm fuzzies.\\"  Once the policemen arrive at their location, the viewer is then privy to watching (and even more importantly ENJOYING) one of the best action movies ever made.  You will be left speechless watching some of the fight choreography.<br /><br />The movie is Indonesian with subtitles, so I'm not going to try to tell you any named actors because, well, I didn't recognize any!  There is a plot twist that I did not anticipate, and that made the movie even more enjoyable.  So, if you like your movies (like I do) to consist of a basic plot, tons of carnage, and LOTS and LOTS of action, this is the movie for you.  It is unrated for lots of violence and language, but, really nothing you've haven't seen in many other movies.  This one is just done WAAAAY better!!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 8-20-12.
0553801473|3.0|What I suspected was happening half way through A Feast for Crows is now confirmed with A Dance with Dragons: GRRM has fallen in love with the world he created. This is not uniquely GRRM; it happens when an author chose a particular series as the defining work to cement his legacy in the literary world (i.e. Jordan and his Wheel of Time). We've passed the \\"projected\\" half-way point in the series. So instead of tying off loose ends and bring in the story arcs for the much anticipated finale in the 7th book (the \\"projected\\" final book), he is expanding the story universe and filling in extra details to add more color and substance to the fictional world he created. A Dance with Dragons continued in the same vein as A Feast for Crows with excessive character dramatization and painfully slow pacing. To truly understand how slow the pacing had become, one needs to look at the chronology of Steven Erikson's Malazan Book of the Fallen series. Erikson completed this incredibly well-written, massive, and world-spanning 10-book series in approximately the same time it took GRRM to finish the last 2 books. For true fans that followed this series since the beginning, this book is still worth reading. It's not as incoherent and meandering as A feast for Crows. The plot does advance in A Dance with Dragons, just at a snail's pace.

B005LAIGWS|3.0|I get a kick out of the editorial review for this flick - \\"(it) is unable to thread its diverse elements, which include ... assorted exorcisms, rituals, and come-and-go powers, into a cohesive and believable film.\\"  A believable film about a guy with his head on fire.  Somehow, I don't think believable is what we should be looking for.<br /><br />Coherency would be admirable, and, unlike some other reviewers, I thought this installment of Ghost Rider made perfect sense within the logic of its own universe.  Cage as Blaze is enlisted to help protect the Devil's son, whom old Scratch needs as a new vessel for his powers; and the only ones that seem capable of stopping the transfer is an assembly of coven-like monks led by Christopher Lambert (Ha!) - but they need the help of the Ghost Rider to do it.  In exchange for his help, they'll exorcize the Ghost Rider demon for him, once the Devil gets his due.  As one might guess from thousands of other movies, that deal is probably not going to work out, and in the end, Blaze is forced to re-rent the spare room in his head to the demon in order to save the day.<br /><br />I get it.  In fact, I saw most of it coming once the parameters of the movie were established at about the thirty minute mark.  But there's a sort of manic energy about the whole thing that made it fairly entertaining.  That, and the fact that the film got such poor reviews that my expectations were flatlined.  Reading other reviews, it seems that either people don't like that this (sort of) sequel departs from the tone of the first, or that it doesn't conform to their idea of the source material, or that there's a kind of 'piling on' now that it seems safe to pan the flick.  I think the second reason is the only one that might hold water - if you've been following this character for years, I think you have a right to expect certain things.  You're the reason the franchise ever got off the ground in the first place.<br /><br />I never really got into the whole Blaze character before, and thought that the first flick really dumbed down a bare-bones (ha again!) concept in the first place.  This one goes darker, albeit at the expense of much character development.  I like the drunken priest Moreau (Idris Elba, also known as Heimdall in the Thor franchise) best here - everyone else is pretty much cardboard.  So, thread-bare characters, threadbare plot, lots of crazy energy.  Pretty much like any other empty-headed action flick.  Great for a Sunday afternoon rental.ole Blaze character before, and thought that the first flick really dumbed down a bare-bones (ha again!) concept in the first place.

B001V7YWTQ|2.0|Just like the title says... the recording is pitiful.  I was really dissapointed. I love most the songs and love Clapton and Winwood, but I cannot tell you how upset I was at the sound.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|its a great app and would get five stars except it was confusing af first and took some time to figure out how to play, other wise great app
B008EL4YX6|5.0|Awesome puzzler for when you're on the go with the ability to play and or create user generated content. Some levels really make you think!
B004DLPXAO|4.0|This is the best. I started reading again after 10 years. There are a lot of free books on amazon that are great to read. I enjoy the cookbooks that I got on here also.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B004DLPXAO Kindle for Android]]
B0084IG7KC|5.0|We loved it.  Saw it in the theater, watched it on amazon instant and can't wait to watch the bluray with 7.1 surround.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|this is a super fun app there r solo many different level and the creatures r ADORABLE :) I recommend it for all ages you will love it from cuteness :)
B000PAU032|5.0|Well recorded... I like this one a lot.  You will have to kinda be into classical music to really appreciate.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|The Fifty Shades trilogy would make a great sex manual for young males. The author, to her credit, reminds us that humans have five senses;not just touch. Pity about the S&M but our hero and heroine seemed to strike a balance by the end. The story line made me read to the end.
B000RJO578|5.0|This is one of those movies that I can watch again and again, and catch another small detail. The humor is wonderfully off-balance, with a mystery that gets stranger by the moment. If you think seeing a woman riding a bike, shooting pistols with both hands is classy stuff, you should enjoy this movie.
B004UID2LC|5.0|its works perfect if u hold down long enough on a vid then u can hit download as vid and it saves it in your gallery for free how awesome is that!!!!!!!!! :)
B00846REIS|1.0|I did not like this book at all. Read the whole thing but it really had no hold on me. Disliked the characters and their behavior is really not normal. This book seems to me like a bad copy of Fifty Shades of Grey and the dialog and the sex scenes are really not believable.<br />For example, they have sex in a room of his parents home during a fancy party and two people walk on them, they see it and just keep doing it and carrying out a conversation.... seriously?????<br /><br />Glad I got it from the library and did not spent a cent on it. Not worth anyone's time.
B007UQ5Z1G|2.0|I am a fan of some of their music, but this CD only had about 3 songs maybe that I even loaded into my main playlist.  Not too excited about this one.
B005LAII58|4.0|\\"The Expendables 2\\" resurrects every surviving action star from the 1980's and dumps them into a formula action movie with a tissue paper thin plot and bucketloads of one-liners, and guess what?  It's not bad.  \\"The Expendables 2\\" is entertaining, rolls with its own punches, and stacks one outrageous action scene after another on the audience, helped along by an unending parade of cameos by Jet Li, Chuck Norris, Arnold Schwarzenagger, Bruce, Willis, and Jean-Claude Vandamme, among others.<br /><br />The exotic opening sequence has a group of aging mercenaries known as the Expendables rescuing a Chinese millionaire from a rebel camp in Nepal.  Afterwards, they celebrate, led by crew boss Barney Ross (Slyvester Stallone).  Their next mission is a CIA tasking to retrieve a mysterious package, accompanied by a female minder named Maggie.  The retrieval goes badly, a member of Barney's crew gets killed, and the crew decides to seek revenge.  The final confrontation with a group of nasty mercenaries in a remote airport is part action thriller and part a collection of sight gags, as stars and former stars wander in and out of frame.<br /><br />The violence is practically continuous but fortunately manages to be mostly over the top, along with most of the acting.  \\"The Expendables 2\\" is a fun way to spend a couple of hours, and recommended for that.  It helps if you are a fan of older action movies; more of the jokes will make sense.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|Splendid acting, engaging story, and beautiful cinematography. However, there are a few graphic scenes, so I wouldn't recommend this as a casual, watch-with-the-folks sort of movie.
B004J2TPSI|5.0|I bought this for my kindle fire so that I would not have to deal with the tangled mess of wired ear buds or headphones and to use with a bluetooth headset that I have.  I like to listen to audio books when I am sewing or cleaning house etc...  .  Item was shipped promptly (thank you Amazon) and it is very simple and straight forward to use and connect.  I do have a few other non bluetooth items that this will also work with so that in itself is worth the price.  A great buy for a great item!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|having a blast with this game on kindle fire. me and wife compete constantly score wise. very fluid game and good for children as well
B005LAIH4A|5.0|We bought this movie 2 weeks ago for our 3yr old and 18mnth old. They are still watching it 3 times a day. Surprisingly enough I haven't gone crazy. It is a great family movie with a good lesson. The songs, I think, are super catchy and get stuck in my head every time we watch it (my husband has admitted to having the same problem). I will catch myself singing the songs while doing the house work!! Great movie. It was definitely has become a family favorite. Worth every penny. I was skeptical at buying because of how disappointing all the other Suess movies have turned out (cat the hat way to many sexual references for my liking).
B0084IG7KC|5.0|I am very satisfied with the movie.  It follows the book very well.  I don't think they could of picked better actors/actresses.
B000FDFVZ6|5.0|I borrowed this book from a friend. I recognized the name of it, as a recent movie had come out based on the book. The opening line is such a powerful attention-getter, I half-heartedly added it to my to-read list. It just bubbled to the top recently, and I blew through much faster than I had anticipated. The chapters are long, but it's hard to put down. And best of all, it was unpredictable (well, at least to me). After one too many formulaic books about murder and revenge, I guess I expected one thing, but was handed something completely different.<br /><br />The book is written from the perspective of a young murder victim, who doesn't invoke some mysterious hoodoo to haunt her murderer or solve the crime. She just has to watch everyone around her cope (or fail to cope) with her disappearance/murder/death.<br /><br />At the end of the book (after the novel has concluded) there a number of thought-provoking \\"book club\\" discussion questions, which really were quite interesting to contemplate. In addition, there was an excerpt of an article written about the author and how her own experiences shaped the novel and her career as a writer. Both items were absolutely engaging as a postscript to the novel itself. And all the better, I had no idea about any of it until I finished the book. If you can find a copy of this book with those two items at the end, I would recommend reading them as well.<br /><br />This book was a fantastic read.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This helps me a lot because I tend to forget to charge my kindle fire and this warns me before it goes dead.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Its pretty fun. Would be better if the invest points would accumulate faster. Would have given it a five star rating if it wasn't for the invest points.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|i started this app on my I phone andso so happy to find it for my kindle. I love being able to sit outside listening to the birds that God created too and at the same time have the bible spoken to me. I love this app!
B005C7MVC6|5.0|Heard several Bon Iver songs on NPR, but what really turned me on to the group was listening to this album in its entirety while sitting at the counter of a funky little restaurant in Auckland, NZ.  Several glasses of NZ sauv blanc in along with green lipped mussels and I was hooked.  Downloaded it the next day, and have been hooked ever since.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|The book is awesome.  I couldn't put it down and my \\"to-do\\" list got pushed a day back. I loved it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love love love Pinterest and was so sad there wasn't an app for the Kindle. So happy and the app is great!!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The book was good but very much an unbelievable romance novel. I usually like a book with more substance. Very predictable.
B008BM9L72|4.0|Much has been written about these books.  I'm taking a break, so have still to read no. 3 - Shades Freed.  Like many others, I agree that it's only 'soft porn'.  Apart from the Red Room, most married couples/partners would have done much of what is written about the love-making.  However, perhaps not with such continuous 'mindblowing' orgasms!!  I have enjoyed the first two, even if only to fantasise over having such an incredibly rich boyfriend.  I wish.  I accept it for what it is - light fiction.
B004NOCCEG|5.0|This is a fantastic movie. I wish the evening news teams would cover these topics with as much integrity and breadth. Wish everyone in the country would watch it before they go into another voting booth.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I am not a reader and I loved all three of these books. Very entertaining, I could not put it down.
B004QL7K8E|4.0|This movie did meet my expectations and more.It will be a classic. this is a must have.I hope there is a follow up.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Five stars is accurate. This app is perfect for any person who wants to get ideas out of their mind and onto paper... or e-paper. I am a writer, and I really enjoy Evernote's versatillity. Whether its just to remember something like a song, or to write a chapter for one of my novels, Evernote is there to do the job. Their is room for improvent and I still long for more customization, however the app is good enough just by itself.
B005IQZB14|3.0|Pretty good book, I enjoyed reading it while on vacation in the mountains - definitely made me consider a hike on the PCT.
0375507256|5.0|How on earth can they make this into a movie? This is a rare book I'll read twice and refer back to my bookmarks often. This book doesn't read itself for you... you have to pay attention to understand what's happening. That's what I call a good read, and one that will stay with you for a long time.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I am so happy they have this for Android now! I have always loved this app! Now I don't have to ask people to play on their iPods or iPads! Thank yoouuu! P.S. Amazon, you should see if you can get Battle Nations on here.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|If you must see it--rent it. It's not terrible mind you. Just not very good. Don't buy it-you'll thank me later.
1476712042|4.0|I enjoyed this story very much.  The characters were well developed and the romance was much more \\"real\\" than you would expect.  There is no love at first sight, it is earned.  The romance isn't a perfect one, it has its ups and downs.  It sucked me right in and couldn't put it down.
030758836X|5.0|I was unable to put this down and am haunted by Amy and Nick-GONE GIRL is a masterpiece.  Flynn has a way with words like no other.
B004I744AS|5.0|I love having a dictionary at my fingertips, and being able to learn new things every day!!  I love the weather report and games that it has to offer. Plus it is so easy to use! Love it!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app! it helps me track when I need to charge my kindle and how long I have until it dies! its an amazing app
034580404X|5.0|Wow  I loved the books and could not put them down until i finished all three. Many nights of 5 hours of sleep. I had my doubts about the books after all the controversy about them, but once I started and got to the real story line, I could not quit reading. After I finished the third books, I wished the story would have continued.  Fantastic  a must read for anyone who enjoys a good book and loves to read.
B000PKG7I4|5.0|I didn't realize what a truly great style Amy Winehouse had...I will miss her even more now that I've heard this CD.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have read the entire trilogy and loved it...At first, I was unsure. However, upon finishing the first book, I just had to read the second..then the third. I enjoyed, how the story was told and the reflections made by the main character. The second guessing, self doubt, love and attraction that she struggled with throughout the series made it real and an easy book to read. I would definitely recommend the series!
B008BM9L72|2.0|The Fifty Shades Trilogy has been the best marketed product in a long time.  Clearly appealing to bored housewives, the grammatically challenged series is anything but thrilling. In fact it's Mills and Boon with porn.....mind numbingly boring, the story line leaves much to be desired.  I kept on thinking it MUST improve but alas, it was not to be....
0345803507|4.0|It is not porn, but nothing like I have ever read.  I did, however, enjoy it and did finish all three books.  It is surley for mature readers.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|its so fun to play I wont this. on my phone so bad that's how muck j likethis hy hnj j
B003K1EYM6|5.0|First of all, the connector kit was purchased by me, G.A.Flickinger Jr., not by my daughter LiLAnne, from amazon<br />The connectors arrived in perfect condition. Both connectors worked superbly<br />. I thank you for the fine service and the excellent product. I would not hesitate to order from your company again.<br />We have purchased many items from Amazon and never had aproblem even when we had to return an item.<br /><br />G.A.Flickinger Jr.

B00003CX5P|5.0|[[ASIN:B00003CX5P Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (Widescreen Edition)]] I got this dvd because my VHS tape of this episode was no longer viewable. The dvd was quite excellent alot better than my VHS tape of this episode. This product arrived unscratched and undamaged. The packaging was undamaged as well. This product arrived within the time specified as indicated by the Seller.<br /><br />  Signed,<br /><br />  Robert Gaskill
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is great for knowing if your Kindle is really charged completely! ! With out this I would probably never charge it right!
B0084IG7KC|3.0|This will be the last \\"pre-order\\" I do with Amazon.  There was no advantage to this because I actually received my copy later than the store release.  I was out shopping Walmart, Sam's, and others Saturday.  They were loaded with this DVD, and it was the same price.  Although I was offered the streaming copy through Prime it was not of the quality I will have with the DVD.  I read the trilogy prior to watching the movie, and it helps quite a bit.  I understand that the movie cannot include the detail of the book, and it was evident with this production.  Entertaining movie anyway.
0385360169|5.0|I loved the book and couldn't put it down. It's a very fast read and a so not real love story, but hey that's what fiction is all about. Loved all three books. I was hooked and could not wait to find out what happened next!
B004UID2LC|3.0|this app is really nice but the only thing that is REALLY ANNOYING is that it crashes constantly. recommended only cause you can download videos.
B00003CXCT|5.0|[[ASIN:B00003CXCT Star Wars Trilogy (A New Hope / The Empire Strikes Back / Return of the Jedi) (Widescreen Edition with Bonus Disc)]]<br /><br />We really enjoyed this product, especially since it's now available on DVD. We also purchased this product to replace the VHS version of these great movies. This product arrived undamaged and was unscratched when it was opened. They played well with no skipping,and no fuzzyiness. I would by from this Seller again. The packaging was in excellent condition when this product arrived. It also arrived in the time as specified by the Seller.<br /><br />Robert Gaskill
0606264485|5.0|I couldn't put the books down.  I waited months for Fifty Shades of Grey to become available from my library. I got so hooked that once I finished Fifty Shades of Grey I could not wait to read Fifty Shades Darker, so I ended up buying the book instead. (Same is true about Fifty Shades Freed). I barely slept because I couldn't put the books down.<br /><br />The only negative thing I can say about the books is that the depth of the sex scenes were not necessary. I know many people who would love the book if the sex scenes were toned down just a bit. For instance, I know my mother would love the books, but I can't suggest them to her because of those sex scenes. The scenes might be hot, but there would be a larger audience that could enjoy the books.
B008XG1X18|5.0|So happy to finally have the Pinterest app for the Kindle Fire. I'm obsessed with Pinterest and absolutely LOVE this app. It's perfect.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|only used this app for a short time. it's nice to sit on my couch with my kindle and balance my checkbook or what ever else i need to get done while im am watching tv!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I've tried several different Bible and Bible study apps, and this one is by far my favorite.  The app is simple to navigate and there are so many options for reading plans to choose from.  I especially like the fact that I can download my favorite Bible versions to my device for use without Internet access while still being able to choose from any version I like when I do have Internet access.  Great app!
B007W7P5L8|5.0|It does what it says it does -- protects the Kindle.<br /><br />Though, I'm not sure how long the strap will last.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|OMG these books are BRILLIANT.<br />I have read them 4 times, maybe i am sad but i find these books compelling. Anna and Christian are complexed and sexy. Christian is looking for her and needs her but wont accept this, fate is kind. Anna also needs Christian and knows it but does not think she is in his league.<br />I was riveted to the books. I have not read such a good series sinece J R Ward and the Brotherhood,and Sherrilyn Kenyon. Well done E L James.
078617286X|5.0|I had bought this CD with a gift card for lack of any other interesting choice.  It was wonderful.  I let others use it and they were equally impressed, so much so that one of them didn't return it to me.  I finally ordered it again.  It is wonderful for teenagers, adults, and everyone.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|A game you can easily play and waste time on. Easy control and lots of cool upgrades. And they can be bought with in-game money.
B005K17RU0|4.0|A few months back I tried this app and it wouldoften freeze up.  The bugs seem to be worked out and it loads very quickly.  I love the radar screen!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I can't wait to read the third book! It's hard to put this book down once you start reading it!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this because it reminds me of Mario! I can play for endless hours! and it's great there are free updates
B005LAIHY0|4.0|I walked out of the theater loving this and heard a great comment while stopping off in the bathroom before heading to my car.....\\"This movie was supposed to have something to do with the movie \\"Alien\\" right?\\" Best thing I heard all week, and a great marker for how people reacted to the movie. If you love the Alien series then you completely got this installment. The visuals were stunning, Noomi Rapace was great, particularly in one cringe worthy scene, the story behind the race that you received a glimpse of in the first Alien movie was incredible and leaves room for additional movies. I can see where some people will hate this and ultimately pass out a one star rating but if you really love the series, you will love Prometheus!
0345803493|5.0|This book was better than the first... if you are looking for more than an erotic novel then you must read this book. This book combines the erotic details of book one with the love story that you were searching for.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I got this app because I wanted a drawing app for my kindle fire. It features a wide variety of colors and backrounds that come with the app(you don't have to pay extra for them). There are different textures that you can use (Crayon, marker, pencil, etc.) and objects like dinosaurs and cars they you can put in the picture. A great app that definitely deserves 5 stars!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is really nice to have. I like being able to see exactly how long of battery life I have.
B008MEM24S|5.0|totally worth a buck! can't wait for more levels! not into the show phineas and ferb but it's still a fun game.
B0085776BG|5.0|I rented this movie because George Lucas helmed it and I love Star Wars. However, I was reluctant because the initial reviews were mediocre. Fortunately, I think Red Tails works very well as a movie as long as you approach it the right way. This is a popcorn movie. This is Star Wars in World War II. The good guys are good, and bad guys are bad. The dialogue is corny but to the point. Unfortunately, many people, seeing that the movie was about the Tuskegee airmen, have held the movie to the standard of a historical drama, but it isn't that at all. I don't know if the film is historically accurate to the tee, but it does a great job building lovable characters and creating spectacular dog fights. I think if you take the movie as the action flick it is, you'll enjoy it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|very fun game. some of them lag a little and the developers could have put a little more thought in them but overall it is fun.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It was a nice day today, sun was shining, not too cool, not too hot - rare occurrence here in England.  So I bought what I thought would be a light, easy read for sitting in the garden while the kiddies played.  WOW.  Such a good story, it was a quick easy read but not light by any means...off to buy the rest of the series.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i like this game! its got lots of fun mini games. some are challenging, but theyre still really fun! so far i have not seen an update, so its working for me. i recomemd this game from what ive seen, but maybe for other people its not working. i like it, but im not saying to not listen to other reviews.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|The game is super fun.Only thing is that I wished the screen wasn't cut off.Happy Jetpack Joyride is only available on aneroid through Amazon.
B00884GR0W|5.0|best app ever totally deserves 5 stars its better then mcpe its got quests and everything just a few bugs thats it if you are thinking about getting this do it!!! Totally worth 5 bucks thumbs up mind blocks :)
B00127RAJY|5.0|I purchased this video because I wanted to lose 10 lbs. I was doing JJ Smith's lose weight plan without exercise and that wasn't working for weight loss.  JJ Smith's plan is vegan with low sugar and no caffeine intake and mag 07 among other things in her book. There is no calorie counting. I thought if I did JJ Smith's DEM plan with the video I would lose weight.  I did it for 30 days straight every single day.  I did 10 days on each level.  Level 3 was definitely the hardest except for the push ups on level 1. During my first go around I lost 2 lbs on level one.  I gained them back during level 2 and never lost them on level 3.  I was only 10 lbs overweight and those 10 were so hard to lose.  I did not lose inches either but I did replace fat with muscle, lose some of my cellulite and feel much healthier. I could see a 6 pack forming by 15 days with a solid 4 pack but a small lower ab fat pouch slightly covering the 6.  This video paved the way for a much more extensive exercise plan that I have been sticking to for 4 months.<br /><br />I eventually lost 8 lbs alternating days between Jillian Michael's Boost Metabolism and No More Trouble Zones CDs with one day off a week. I did that along with a 1200 - 1300 calorie a day diet with meat as a protein source. (you should see my 40+ body now -- amazing).  On this CD, Jillian doesn't tell you about the 1200 calorie diet until level 3 which I thought was a little absent minded  (\\"you all should be sticking to the 1200 calorie diet plan\\"  What the blank?  I didn't know about a client plan). You then have to search her website or the internet to find what plan she is talking about.  BTW I absolutely love NMTZ. Get good cross training or dance sneakers.
B008MEM24S|4.0|Great game! It's so fun. I saved my money to buy it, and I am happy I did. It's awesome!
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|u should make a button that the main character can use a human shield. what about IT?<br />plus love the game play and I will never stop playing it.
0345803507|3.0|I read all three books, so congrats to Ms. James for making money off of me for at least the one I was unable to get at the library, but by the third I was found myself so bored with the sex scenes that I started skimming over them.  Repetitive, unrealistic.  No one gets orgasmic every time their significant other merely brushes their arm against them, looks at them, happens to walk by in his pj's.  And once you have heard about Ana's \\"inner goddess\\" for the 80th time you will want to spank her yourself.  Interesting to read simply for the novelty of the book and the controversy that was out there about it, but if you are looking for a real plot, a realistic story, a real writer, anything other than just something to read on the beach, please find something else.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Fifty Shades of Disappointed. I am not sure what all the hype was about. The characters were not at all believable and I've read steamier stuff in the romance novels my mother used to read.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it was the best free game I got. it got 126 games of fun and excietment. the ds game is just as good.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|It cuts off part of yor score, but runs real smoothly and its fun.  if it wernt for the format, 5 stars.<br /><br />UPDATE:  just reloaded, and works fine, five stars :)
B007WFQZF0|3.0|I like the mood of the album, it's nocturnal and rather hypnotic....I would say it's at least worth checking out if you appreciate introspective music. Lately, I don't happen to find much out there that does a good job on the creative front, I think this does a good job at it.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|its a really awesome game i like how you.can get your own monster and stuff. i amlike glued to it every time i play it
0345529057|5.0|I was excited to find this book series at a great price. I received it in a good time frame and was thrilled when I got this product which I thought was in good condition to find that it was like brand new condition, still in the wrapper!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I have not got it yet baceuse it just came out free so now I can git JETPACK JOYRIDE oooyea
B0063IH60K|5.0|Enjoy playing this! Great for a quick break to clear your mind. Easy to play with a stylus on my Kindle Fire.
B001MTENOC|3.0|The knowledge contained here is undoubtedly precious, but I find the way it is represented to be almost denyingly dull. I mean the style of dialogs which is like an endless conversation with one and the same underperforming bot; and leangthy scrupolous descriptions of meaningless matters as color coding of spirit development levels and such.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|This is a poorly written book with no reason to exist except to stir sick interest in S&M sexual practices. I find it hard to imagine why so many people have read it, thus getting it on the Best Seller list.<br />Boring and a bit weak in story telling. I read this and the original Fifty Shades to see what all the fuss was about. What a disappointment.
030758836X|4.0|This is a book that you do not want to put down. I finished this thing in 2 days and I was on pain meds for an injured foot that kept knocking me out.  I struggled to keep going because I NEEDED to know where this story was going next. OMG just when you think you know what is coming next it goes a step further than you thought possible.<br />It ended where there could be a new book to take up where this one leaves off, and man oh man I hope it does.  I like Nick, I love Nick, I hate Nick, I dislike Nick, now I am cheering for Nick, No, he is SO stupid, No I really like him again. I was all over the place with this book. Read it and review it Please I am dying to know what you think!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I give this game a five star beacause most games don't work on kindle fire but the game works great and its good for ages 7-and up cause u got to read stuff and that is why I give it a five star!!!!!!!
B003G4W49C|1.0|The sample for this book is absurdly short. Nearly 90% of it is taken up by the author's introduction. The actual story part of the sample is only 5 pages long.  I was seriously disappointed by this. Five pages is not nearly enough to tell me if the book is worth buying. Next time, someone should really pay attention to how much of the actual story is included in the sample.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|Call Me Maybe By Carly Rae Jepsen is a song that you can dance and sing with. It's got a nice beat to it and Carly has a good voice. I got this song from Amazon.Com cause I feel in love with it the first time that I heard it.I just really love this song:) and I've already recommended it to all my friends and family!<br /><br />Mailani
1451629184|5.0|A stolen life is an account of Jacee Dugard's kidnapping and the events that occured during that period of time, and also her recovery. It is hard to read at some points, because it is very heart breaking. However, it is captivating to say the least because she recounts the story with detail, and brings the reader into the journey with her.
B004UID2LC|3.0|I really hats it when it dose not show you the video and it skips a lot and I mean a lot.

B002WWKZJK|3.0|I wanted to like it but I just cannot like a heroine that is too naive plus not enough scenes that convinced me how the main characters fell inlove.
B0083GQ2A0|5.0|Existentialism at its best.  If you like man vs. nature stories, and don't mind running into a cold universe then you should really enjoy this movie.  I loved it!  In fact, I thought it was one of the best movies of the year.  Sorry, but I don't feel this deserves a low rating because the ending was ambiguous or didn't \\"feel-good\\".  If that's you, then might I suggest The Lion King?  It also has a good story and plenty of symbolism, but has an ending you can hold onto.  Plus you can sing along!  All others will enjoy The Grey's solid acting, adventure, and symbolism.
030758836X|1.0|Never mind reading this book. The endind sucks! Like a deflated Balloon. Incomplete. Unsatisfactory . Like a child changed her mind in the middle of a play, got up and left the mess. Unfinished.
B000AY74OG|1.0|I bought this dvd as new and I got a used copy of this movie, it wasn't sealed. I just happen to look over the other comments on this movie and other people are having the same issue. I've actually never had this happen before from amazon.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved the entire Fifty Shades book series. Yes some things were repetative and the editing was not great, but I still felt emotional attachment to the characters and the story. I feel that anyone who wants to get away from reality and just enjoy a great romance with a lot of extra hottness this is the book series for you. For those who want to spice up thier love life this book series will definetly give you a few great ideas for that department. Over all I loved Ana and Christian's journey together and I did not want it to end. Love Love Love the email exchange they had going on throughout the series. Read it for yourself and if you like it great if its not your cup of tea then move on.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|For anyone who enjoys reading 'apocalyptic' novels, you must read this series.  Its concept is what grabbed me and I was hooked within the first couple of paragraphs - a rare thing to happen to this easily-bored reader.<br /><br />I was reluctant to finish book 5, hesitant to let go of a good friend and lo and behold I discovered Hugh Howey had written a 6th!!  I quickly consumed the last few pages of #5 and am happily now sinking my teeth into the last of what is one of the most interesting and captivating series of novels I have read!
B007L3BMGA|4.0|Totally enjoyed this book and will miss Ana and Christian's story. I have started reading 'Tess of the D'Urbvilles' and although its totally different to 'Fifty Shades', it was nice to relate to the characters and further my understanding to some of the text in 'Fifty Shades'. In a funny kind of way I really didn't want it to end. Oh and by the way love, love, love Jos'e Gonz'alez who was also mentioned in the 'Fifty Shades'trilogy. Try listening to 'Heartbeats', its a lovely song.<br /><br />This was the first ebook that I purchased on my iPad and I was delighted with the fact that I finished the first book well after the bookstores had closed that night and couldn't wait to start reading the second book. It was easy peasy to logon to Amazon and instantly get the second book without having to go to a store the following morning like I would normally do(zero down-time between books).<br /><br />However (me playing the devil's advocate) if i were to point out the negative, it would be that there were a couple of small typing error's found in the ebook. Besides that I would definately recommend this trilogy to other readers. Enjoy ;-)
B008BM9L72|4.0|This trilogy lived up to and exceeded all comments and expectations. I really started to long for my reading time to see where the lives of these people would go to next. I'm so pleased I had the whole trilogy, because I would have gone stir crazy waiting for a sequel. As much as you get involved in the raunchyness of these novels, it really is an insight into the thinking mind of someone who lives Fifty's behind closed doors lifestyle. I'm sad now that I've finished but can once again get back to thinking about something else besides what is happening with Christian and Ana!
B00846REIS|3.0|I enjoyed this one, I will read the next one but it didn't leave me gasping for air or teary eyed. It just didn't quite have the \\"WOW\\" factor I was looking for. I agree with the review previous to mine. The sex scenes were almost to overdone....the everlasting erection, the multiple orgasms.....sex just isn't always like that. It's not believable. I felt like the story was rushed and could possibly have been split into 3 books instead of 2. Just my opinion, the emotions of some characters bothered me, once again not believable. I would recommend it to others just simply to see if they get the 'left hanging' feeling I got from this book. I'm hoping the next one, will be more up to the standards I have set for this book since it's so frequently compared to 50 shdades....I think this book is only actually maybe 10 shades...
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|ive been waiting sooooooooooo long 4 this game. About a week ago I wrote to amazon telling them about how my charger broke so I could get a new one. In the email I also put about how they need to get jetpack joyride!!!!! I think it worrrkkked!!! I LOVE THIS FLIPPIN AWESOME GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I received a perfect product and I really enjoyed the music. I am adding words so that they add up to 20.
0553378384|3.0|I read Celeste Teal's book on the nodes prior to buying this work by Jan Spiller. While Jan's book has arguably a lot more information, most of it appears to be repetitive. It seems like Spiller got paid by the word because descriptions of the various aspects of a nodal placement are pretty much the same as you go through about 25 pages of let's say North Node in Gemini. The reason I called my review \\"incomplete\\" is that you really need Celeste Teal's book on the nodes to fill you in on the aspects that the nodes make. Unfortunately, Teal's work is not very comprehensive. My main complaint about it is that Teal fails to take into account (a) horoscopes that show many challenging aspects to the nodes and (b) if and how to mature and transcend those challenging nodal aspects through the transits and progressions that planets make.<br /><br />Now, what I said last may not really help you. So, if you are interested in just finding out about the nodes themselves than Jan Spiller's book is the one to get. Very detailed. However, as you will see from Teal's work, there's much more going on with the nodes than Spiller gives you. So why couldn't Spiller incorporate that in the hundreds of pages that she penned down for Astrology for the Soul? It's like buying a car without an engine. In other words, Spiller's book = 3 stars, Spiller + Teal = 4 stars, Spiller + Teal + the missing author who will fill us in on how transits and progressions affect nodal placement = 5 potential stars.<br /><br />To her credit, Jan Spiller mentions that she is working on a book on nodal aspects. But that was more than 10 years ago if I remember correctly. She has since published other works but not the nodal aspect book. What gives?
B0059GVBHG|4.0|Saw it in a theater back when it came out. Forgot how relentlessly grim it is. It's depressing but sometimes I like movies like that.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This is a gem! One strong word of caution, however: if you were a teen or young adult in the late 70s/early 80s, know the name Gary Gygax, dabbled in Dungeons & Dragons and other roleplaying games, had a TRS-80 or Commodore 64, liked Star Wars, then you will absolutely LOVE this novel. If none of these topics appeal to you in the least, there's a good chance you will hate this book.<br /><br />This is a sci-fi novel set in the highly sophisticated, multi-user domain world of OASIS. It's an adventure tale of intrigue and strategy, focused on the high-stakes objective of winning the big prize left by the dead billionaire inventor of the game. Add in a big brother-like global corporate conspiracy, interesting characters and a fast paced, inventive story and this is a fabulous read. The detail is amazing -- when the author brings up the Tomb of Horrors (a Dungeons & Dragons module), he described key aspects well and brought back ancient memories from my (yes, gasp) roleplaying days. He manages to do this for all old gaming technology platforms and games -- Atari, PacMan, Galaga, Joust -- it's clear he spent a lot of his youth doing this or his research is phenomenol. The backdrop doesn't just apply to gaming: music groups, marketing icons, and a touch of 80s politics is threaded throughout with amazing detail.<br /><br />If any of these niche and nuanced aspects appeal to you in any way, you'll thoroughly enjoy this. If you were the star football player who shoved D&D roleplayers into lockers, chances are you will not like this. I'm thinking there is a loyal audience that fits the former pattern out there!
B007SGM084|5.0|I was at the golf course and all were talking about his book, had to read it, could not put it down, read the three books on my kindle in 3-4 days.  It was a different kind of book that I'm used to, I would recommend it especially for the women who likes a bit of adventure in their relationship.

B008OOYALE|1.0|TL;DR: This application tried to steal $20 from me.<br /><br />I love the freemium model because you can basically choose how much of an investment an application is worth.<br /><br />Imagine my surprise when this application seemed to believe it's worth $20, and without my knowledge attempted to do an in-app purchase. While this might have been some series of touches that my daughter managed, it was accomplished by an illiterate 3 year old that was just trying to move around the pretty pictures.<br /><br />It certainly made me realize I should enable parental controls, which I did immediately, but it made me really question the design and motivation of an application that makes their interface specifically so that you have to work to avoid getting charged. Amazons automatic billing did the rest.<br /><br />Since no other application I've ever installed made it so easy to take your money, and most provide some game play without it, I've already deleted the app, and wanted to warn you all that this application will absolutely try and take your cash. Watch your statements!

B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|If only all of our lives had a beautiful soundtrack...sigh.  Elizabeth Bennet's did and it made a BIG difference, believe me.  At any rate, If you loved the film you will enjoy this wonderful CD.  It is amazing.  The music makes me wish that I had a long, flappy coat and a moor to stand on...unfortunately, we are low on cliffs and moors where I live.  Skyscrapers we have, moors...not so much.  But I digress.  Number 15, \\"YOUR HANDS ARE COLD,\\" is just so...  OMG is that Mr. Darcy walking across the fog shrouded field????  See? The music is THAT good.  Highly recommended.  Love it (and the film).  Buy one for the car, then you won't be upset if you find that you left your CD at home.  It just stopped playing so I have to go press \\"play\\" again.  Enjoy it.
B008S4YZCO|3.0|good game but put it this way.90mb Plus MORE???!!! too much space.if you just got a kindle get it because you probobly don't know how big 90mb even is.
B003O86FMW|5.0|While some series flop after the first book, this one certainly doesn't!  I was turned off at first by the reviews which complained about the main character, Katniss, being too whiny, weak, or indecisive in contrast with the first book.  I did not see it that way, although I understood why people were complaining of that.  I think Suzanne Collins does a good job with character continuity and deepening throughout the series and people who think that Katniss devolves into some sort of helpless Bella Swan didn't really understand her in the first place.  She is a scared 17-year-old forced to grow up way too quickly in a society which is really just trying to kill her, with hardly any support network, shoved unwillingly into a conflict bigger than herself.  Her biggest fault is probably wanting to live a semi-normal life instead of becoming the rebel leader that others are trying to mold and manipulate her into being.  Her behavior towards her two love interests, Gale and Peeta, is aggravating and perhaps selfish in that she seems unable to firmly choose one, but honestly, what 17-year-old has the emotional maturity to make such a heart-wrenching choice when she barely feels in control of her own life?  Overall I found the characters understandable, the plot gripping, and the universe that Collins creates very believable.  I tried to read as slowly as I could to savor it and still ended up finishing it in a day.  HIGHLY recommended.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I love this game its finally realesed on kindle but I don't like that only one gadget throws fire and kills the rest just make you fly
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|Paris looks beautiful.  I loved the over the top characterizations of Dali, Hemingway and all of the others...perfect.  Gil (Owen Wilson) reminds me of James Stewart (in the old \\"classic\\" movies).  He is always in the background, holding back, watching everything that's taking place but not saying what he thinks and seemingly unable to change the things that are going on around him.  He's a \\"nice\\" guy who has taken it a bit too far so that people dismiss him and take advantage of his good nature.  He is a writer who is in love with the past and in this film, his fantasy of visiting the past, actually comes true.  Once he slides down the rabbit hole, he is able to interact with his heroes, fall in love, and catch a glimpse of the old Paris with which he is so enamored.  Scott and Zelda are wonderful and the party filled world that Gil accidentally stumbles into is a feast for the eyes.  If you can overlook or laugh at the snobby, conceited, moronic people that surround Gil in his everyday life, you are in for a treat.  The music is pretty good as well.  The moral of the story is that no matter what period of time you actually live in, most people glamorize/romanticize a certain period of time in the past.  When Gil finally made it to his dream past he found that the people he admired so much were dissatisfied with their present and when he went back even farther, he found that those people were unhappy about their own time period and felt  that the Renaissance was the best time to have been alive.  We are too close to our own present...we can't see it...no matter how Gil tried to impress the importance of THEIR time on those around him, they couldn't understand what he was seeing/saying because they were too busy living it and writing/painting their world into existence.  I liked it.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|It was a good movie with heath Ledger.. But in all and all it was still a great movie..... I wish Heath ledger was in this movie.... it would've been great....
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This series is not a romance.  It is also not an action-adventure series.  This book, in particular, is a real, no-fluff portrayal of the psychological agony that comes along with conflict and great upheaval.  When I read the other reviews for this before deciding to buy it, half of them praised it for being accurate to the physical and mental ravages of war, and half of them lambasted it for being slow-moving, the characters being weak, and overall not delivering to the level of the Hunger Games.  I would have to say that the first people read the novel for what it was and the second people were simply expecting something that it isn't.  I will admit that sometimes I got really angry at Katniss for the decisions she was or wasn't making, but then I had to stop and think about how 17-year-old me would have handled the kind of pressure and manipulation she was facing.  In a society that's set up to kill you, you discover more and more that even your closest friends are trying to mold you to their purposes.  You can't trust anyone and every time you let yourself get attached, more pain and destruction comes.  Can you blame Katniss for being a mental and emotional wreck?  Yet Collins portrays her very sympathetically and not as some strong superhuman character who doesn't need relationships and affection.  Katniss is probably not a good model for feminists, but she is real.  Whether or not you agree with her course of action, you can usually understand and sympathize with why she does what she does, which is the mark of a well-developed character.<br /><br />My one critique of the book would be the hurried way in which it ends, in a huge montage of action-packed scenes that honestly seem like they were mostly just put in to tie up loose ends.  You get so involved in the characters that you feel like there's not enough closure at times, but then again, that is also a real aspect of war.  There is a big twist at the end but somehow it doesn't feel fake or staged just soit can keep you hooked all the way through.  I knew how fast I would blaze through this so I tried to read slowly and go over every passage twice, and I was still done within a weekend.  Beware, this is not a book you can easily put down!
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I so love to find books like this.  Obviously this series has been around for awhile.  I'm not sure why I hadn't heard of it.  But man, am I glad I did find out about it. I downloaded this book 1 on Friday, and read all three of them by Sunday evening.  I couldn't put them down, could barely sleep, was totally engrossed in the maze and the world of WICKED.  Warning: the story is violent. Some of the scenes and events are hard to read and one particular method of death ... involving drops of silver ... totally freaked me out.  This is supposed to be YA, but that particular thing and much of the other parts of the book, seem inappropriate for younger kids.  Older teenagers yes, 15 or 16, but no younger I wouldn't think.  Rapid pace, great characters, totally engrossing, and the suspense is sustained through all three books.  Fantastic books.  Buy them. You won't be sorry.
B000BISBDY|5.0|A variety of wonderful tunes on this CD. This is actually my second copy, the first one that I'd had for years went missing some time ago, so I decided to purchase the same one again because I love all the music on it so much and really missed it. Highwayman with Willie Nelson, Kris Kristofferson, and Waylon Jennings is one of the many treats on this album. There's also a wonderful cover of NIN's Hurt, and the song The Wanderer with U2 is equally awesome. Variety combined with great songwriting, singing, and music make this album super! Whenever friends were in the car and I had this CD playing, they wanted a copy of it (and they weren't necessarily big Johnny Cash fans before hearing it). Great intro. to his music for newcomers, but also a super mix for long-time fans.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|First of all, the movie is an epic love story and if anyone missed that point, they need to see it again (i.e. John 15:13 + the ending).<br /><br />It also helps to have read the book as so much is left out in the movie.  The movie seems to assume that you have read the book, so your mind can fill in the missing details.<br /><br />The world is full of Katniss Everdeen's, but we seldom hear of them.  For an example of an Katniss character, we could conjure up a young Margret Thatcher, but still that's not right.  Katniss would be the sweet young girl who is consumed with taking care of her family until she is suddenly thrust into a mind boggling circumstance from which there seems to be no escape.  It's a time when you die or accomplish the impossible and even in the end her decision to die becomes.....well you just have to see the movie.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|After watching the movie it made me want to read the book...Love them both! One thing that doesn't really come across in the movie is Peter's character. He's a lot smarter in the book than he appears on screen.
B008469DGY|5.0|pretty good graphics and very entertaining. kinda hard to figure out the power you need at first but after a while you get the hang of it.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|I think the movie's near-hysterical marketing campaign did it in more than any number of flaws and acting problems in the movie itself.  Being billed as somehow the next generation of movie-making, an epic so incredible and so beyond the medium of cinema itself, with a plot supposedly so spellbinding and powerful that it has to be kept secret until the screenings.<br /><br />And I can safely say there was almost nothing original, colossal, or paradigm-shifting in this entire movie.<br /><br />The plot is basically the next step to the Ancient Alien craze brought on by the crazies on \\"Ancient Aliens\\" on History Channel (IF ALIENS DIDN'T EXiST, HOW DID THEY BUILD EVERYTHING?!  I DON'T KNOW, THEREFORE ALIENS), by having someone rich and stupid enough front a trillion dollars for a deep space vessel to follow up on what they think to be a starmap in the form of pictographic carvings found all over the earth from far-flung, disconnected civilizations all portraying the same set of circles in the sky.<br /><br />Leaving side the obvious conjecture that maybe they all saw the same cosmic event or series of meteors rather than assuming it's somehow alien-related, the fact that this starmap leads where it does makes it a gaping plot hole, considering that the location the go to is one where the aliens clearly would never want us to ever find if we did manage to reach the technological level to find it and go to it.  Add to that the fact that it's a trillion dollar mission that could have ended up leading to nowhere if my hypothesis that it wasn't aliens was correct.<br /><br />There are no real \\"characters\\" to this story; they're little more than cardboard cut-outs with their personalities etched in their faces and speech.  Archetypes largely consisting of people with no discernable purpose beyond dying and being \\"sciencey\\".  Their only role in this movie is as \\"Meat 1\\", \\"Meat 2\\" and so on.<br /><br />Considering this is a TRILLION DOLLAR MISSION trying to find THE FIRST ABSOLUTE EVIDENCE OF LIFE OUTSIDE OF EARTH, much less ALIENS WHO CREATED US, this is facepalmingly stupid the cast of cretins they've gathered up for this mission.  I literally thought the random punk guy was some random mercenary hired on for protection, so I was genuinely shocked when they started relying on him being \\"sciencey\\" later on in the movie.  The rest of them are stupid enough to make people with even the most basic knowledge of archaeology and biology shake their heads.<br /><br />Considering once again that this is a TRILLION DOLLAR MISSION bent on finding LIVING ALIENS, I honestly thought it was either an inside joke or a jab at the people when they walk into an ancient cavern on the alien planet, unopened in 2000 years, and start TOUCHING everything, stepping everywhere, and SITTING on the artifacts.  There's a reason archaeologists use those tiny little brushes to dust off found artifacts; THEY'RE TRYING TO PRESERVE AND DOCUMENT A SITE; THEY DON'T JUMP INTO A PIT OF BONES AND START KICKING SKULLS AROUND.<br /><br />They also see fit to take off their helmets, just because the air is breathable.  Nevermind the fact that people are strongly urged to immunize just to visit another country for fear of contracting some unknown disease, these people are on a WHOLE OTHER PLANET UNTOUCHED BY HUMANS OR ANY LIFE FORM FOR TWO THOUSAND YEARS.  The TRILLION DOLLAR MISSION could've ended then and there with all of them dying of space-smallpox, and all due to their own stupidity.<br /><br />Pretty much from the moment of their arrival, the movie plays out less as THE STORY OF OUR BEGINNING and more like a typical horror movie.  I had constant instances of deja vu with this movie reminding me of scenes from \\"Alien vs Predator\\".  Even the characters had exactly the same tones and reactions as those in AVP.<br /><br />Michael Fassbender is a great actor, but his performance here is terribly uneven, though it seems more to me symptomatic of bad writing than any fault ofhis own.  His entire opening sequence of him watching Lawrence of Arabia, combing his hair like Peter O'Toole, riding his bike while shooting perfect hoops in basketball, and just walking around maintaining the ship play him up as a bright-eyed innocent, an android fully aware of what he is and giddy to learn more about the world and himself.  Then at random instances, he becomes sarcastic, dry, seemingly malevolent, even snotty, enough to arouse suspicion in a child, much less supposed scientists on a TRILLION DOLLAR MISSION.  He then pulls a temporary heel turn with a little \\"science\\" experiment that would be considered crude and reckless by Medieval standards of medicine---people DID practice quarantine back then.<br /><br />I say temporary because as the film progresses some more, this action of his not only proves to be pointless, but is subsequently dropped and ignored for the rest of the film.<br /><br />Then comes the whole moral of the story... I see a lot of positive reviews mentioning that it's okay that the story \\"doesn't explain\\" everything, or that it's not the film at fault if you \\"don't get it\\".<br /><br />Well I got it.  What I got was grade-school navel gazing hiding its own childishness behind a slick veneer of cool and hip to dismiss any criticism as \\"You just didn't get it\\".<br /><br />As much as I trash on \\"Ancient Aliens\\" on History Channel, I find the idea of paleolithic contact to be utterly thrilling, only waiting for even the slimmest shred of evidence to justify giving it further exploration.  This movie began with something like that, and close to the end, completely dropped the existential navel-gazing unaddressed to turn to the philosophical quandry of a bawling child wondering \\"Why is daddy hurting me?\\"<br /><br />From there, another gaping plothole emerges; the aliens are suddenly hostile towards us, and the humans can't understand why.  They then proceed to make up reasons that completely ignore the facts; we're BAAAAAD people!  We burn fossil fuels!  We don't recycle!  We kill each other!  We eat animals!  We invent big shooty guns and bombs!  We touch ourselves at night!<br /><br />It never gets that specific, but the \\"Why me?\\" wailing gets tired, fast, and suddenly I realized I don't care what the aliens wanted.  If they have a problem with us and are unwilling to negotiate, we can just kill them all.  They DID leave their planet full of a self-replicating biological superweapon ABANDONED for two thousand years, and then left us with the starmaps all over our planet!<br /><br />The ending is typical, and would seemingly open the door for sequels, though of the sort that would be close to nothing like this movie, and thoroughly unwanted or uncared about.  Considering they had devised this great plan for the human race, it seems downright nutty of the scientist to STILL want to meet with them and ask them \\"Why me?\\"<br /><br />As for visuals, I suppose they were impressive.  I wasn't impressed with them; CGI is cheap, fast, and easy these days.  A dozen movies are churned out with better and better visuals and plots and characters just as bad every year.  Boasting the greatest special effects with no substance to justify them will only make the movie look quaint and silly in 5-10 years when something better is done.<br /><br />I found a slight comparison with this film and \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" and realized it was literally the exact same basic plot:  Man finds evidence of ancient aliens, invests in a deep space mission to seek out the aliens based on their map, stuff happens, only one survivor and their pet robot.<br /><br />What separates this from \\"2001\\" is that \\"2001\\" told a story that needed no words; it was the story of us, open to all manner of interpretation, with scientists actually behaving like SCIENTISTS---Poole and Bowman kept their calm when they suspected HAL of lying to them, they casually gathered inside a space pod to discuss it, they didn't freak out and start cursing at each other or playing childish games of pretend with a damn SUPERCOMPUTER thinking they could outsmart a machine designed to read people like a pamphlet.<br /><br />In \\"Prometheus\\", they don't let you think, at least not the way you're expected to.  You're not left thinking about our beginnings, or the ancient alien concept, so much as wondering the same dumb question of \\"Why us?\\".  In fact, when we saw the movie, the only thing we kept wondering about is exactly what the alien at the prologue did and whether he knew what was happening.

B0084IG8TM|2.0|Despite a cast of fine actors, this film was not very impressive. First of all, the plot steals largely from Kinji Fukasaku's 2000 masterpiece [[ASIN:B006L4MWVE Battle Royale]] (based on the 1999 novel by Koushun Takami). Secondly, this film -- while recycling that plot -- merely adds in a bunch of weird costumes, a love triangle and several little side plots that take away from the main point of the film. Don't forget that this is a story about youngsters forced to kill each other. That should be the central focus of the story, which it is in [[ASIN:1421527723 Battle Royale: The Novel]]; however, in \\"Games,\\" the deaths (except for one that contributes to the emotional intensity of the story) quickly flash by on screen. I'm sure the movie team did this so they could get the PG-13 rating and rake in more kids to the box office. And while I'm sure parents and kids alike probably will appreciate this, I think it steals away from the seriousness of the situation. I have not read the book and can only hope that the lives in there are not simply a quick, few sentences. But, in the film, by flashing through the deaths, it's as if the filmmakers are saying that the lives of those lost is not really that important. Also, the budding romance between Katniss and Peeta is too distracting and takes up too much valuable screen time. It makes the audience forget what this film is ultimately about: kids being forced to kill one another! I know this is a trilogy so this is merely the beginning and the story is being set up, but it's a poor first act. Even the predictable outcome of the two leads is a bit forced and unrealistic. The only character with any credibility in the story is Harrelson's Haymitch Abernathy. Now, if there were an entire novel/movie about his winning the games and what lead to him being the way he is in this story, THAT would be a film worth making! As I said, want a film that has the same plot but better writing, direction and music? Check out [[ASIN:B006L4MWTQ Battle Royale: The Complete Collection]]!Q Battle Royale: The Complete Collection]]!
B007L3BMGA|3.0|With all the hype about this book i was intrigued to read it after chapter 3 i knew i would not buy the follow up book,maybe its me but i found the book predictable and repetitive with alot of \\"oh mys' and kinda thought it was alot like ' princess di meets casanova\\"and being a lady of a certain age i also found it very boring..To be fair maybe if i wasnt so busy and didnt have to keep putting it down and going back to it later it might have been better,but having said that considering it didnt have that [oh gosh cant wait to see what happens have to hurry back to it type thing],I really cant see what the hype is about, i cant tell readers what i think the second and third books would be like without spoiling the ending of this book,Also because for the first time ever i had the book sent to my p.c. rather than purchase the paperback this meant i didn't have the portability of normal kindles or e.books as the laptop went low on battery when i read the book without power so had to interrupt reading to power source ,plusi didnt take it to public places and couldn't read it in car when i had to wait for people, all in all id say read it form your own opinion maybe my reveiws too harsh after all we are all different!

0061726834|2.0|Definitely not my type. Remind me next time to be cautious to read YA genre. Beware you out-there sci-fi fans. This is not a sci-fi book. It is a teenage love story with a hint of sci-fi.<br /><br />This novel is telling the story of the main character Lena, who lived in a supposedly a utopian society, which is peaceful because \\"love\\" no longer exist.<br /><br />First, the premise is bad. Love (or according to this novel: amor delirium nervosa) is a disease. If it is a disease, what is the pathogen? Virus, bacteria, amoeba, or what? Then, what is the vector carrying the disease? Insect, airborne, water borne? None! It is bad science. The cause is simply raging hormone in adolescence, which is neither a disease or a threat to human society. It is a process of growing up.<br /><br />Second, assuming it is a disease, the cure is definitely ineffective. The ancient has already found the perfect cure for this disease (at least for the male part). It is call castration. You don't need hi-tech, just a sharp knife. In order to procreate, you can simply store the sperm before doing the castration.<br /><br />Third, assuming it is a disease, it is not called love based on the symptoms. It is called teenage angst, teenage rebellion, puppy love. When you fall in love you think that that is the most important thing in this world, not global warming, financial crisis or world justice. And the cure is also simple, it is called growing up.<br /><br />The sci-fi movie [[ASIN:B00005JLWN Equilibrium]], starred by Christian Bale and Sean, explored this theme much better. The disease is the human emotion, which sometime hinder us from using rational thought. So the entire population is vaccinated to suppress the emotion. But when emotion is taken, we are half the human we are.<br /><br />This book (and the following series) definitely aims for teenagers with their daily routine problems: not allowed by parent to go to wild parties, listening to trash music, going out with boyfriends. And the parents supposedly create this dystopia. In the eyes of teenagers, every parents are fascist, then. The entire book is built on this premise: an analogy of teenage rebellion against parental authority. Maybe this is the cause of the booming of this book, because it touch the reality faced by teenagers.<br /><br />But again, this is not a sci-fi novel. I give it a two star instead of one only because it is well written, especially the note before every chapter. The nursery rhyme is the best part. Otherwise it is simply worthless.d the parents supposedly create this dystopia. In the eyes of teenagers, every parents are fascist, then.

Not everything is how it seems and Will and Layken's relationship comes to a sudden halt yet their feelings do not.<br /><br />This book has so many emotional ups and downs and is full of poetry, romance, love, heartbreak, friendship, family and hope!<br /><br />If you have not put this on your to-read list, do it now or just go ahead and read it.

He is an underground street fighter, covered in tats and rides a motorcycle! He challenges Abby to a bet that if he loses he must remain abstinent for a month and if she loses she must live with him for the same amount of time. This is a recipe for a beautiful disaster if I've ever seen one! As the month progresses so does their crazy, messed up, heart-breaking, loving relationship.

B005GSZZ1A|3.0|This story is one of the most interesting, most fascinating story I have ever read. I love true stories and I think brutal truth is what people need - this book fulfills all my requirements from this point of view. Everyone should read it.<br />On the other hand, the book as a novel fails. A mediocre documentary or a really bad novel. The structure of the book, the sentences, the narrative - it feels like it has been written for 5-year-olds, not adult human beings. I think the author had a \\"story of a lifetime\\" in his hands and kinda messed it up. It could have been a really really good documentary (with more facts, more history) or a really really good novel (more adventure, more detailed line of events, better narrative). Maybe he was short on time, maybe the pressure was too big, but he produced a short story about a awesomely long and tragic story.

B0040T7B2W|3.0|Released in 2010, WRITE ABOUT LOVE is the eighth album by Scottish pop band Belle and Sebastian, and the second produced by Tony Hoffer. While the production isn't so electro as on the album's predecessor of five years before, [[ASIN:B000E11568 The Life Pursuit]], Belle and Sebastian continue their evolution to more adult themes, with increasingly less of a twee pop feel.<br /><br />While Belle & Sebastian changed greatly in the new millennium, they have generally remained recognisable as the same band. What disappoints me about WRITE ABOUT LOVE is that in their tributes to certain British and international pop forebears, they efface their distinct personality entirely. \\"I Didn't See It Coming\\" and \\"I'm Not Living in the Real World\\" don't at all evoke the band I've come to love, and this phenomenon reaches its lowest depths in the horribly misguided decision to bring in Norah Jones for guest vocals in \\"Little Lou, Ugly Jack, Prophet John\\".<br /><br />Of the songs that sound like classic (or at least earlier) Belle and Sebastian, a few are generally weaker than previous material. Stuart Murdoch's lyrics have gone from twee storytelling to cryptic verse, though sometimes being unexpectedly open about his religious faith, and I'm rather baffled by \\"Calculating Bimbo\\", \\"The Ghost of Rockschool\\" and \\"Read the Blessed Pages\\". However, what redeems this album for me and brings it up to three stars is the inclusion of \\"I Want the World to Stop\\", which I'd put in my Belle and Sebastian top 10 list, \\"Sunday's Pretty Icons\\", and the fine Sarah Martin-penned \\"I Can See Your Future\\", which won over this listener who usually doesn't like when Murdoch delegates songwriting duties.<br /><br />Fans of Belle and Sebastian will want to pick this up. However, it's clear to me at least that the bulk of Stuart Murdoch's recent inspiration had gone into the superb [[ASIN:B002736YNA God Help the Girl]] album that Belle and Sebastian released as a side project the year before.

B007USWD0U|4.0|Criterion has done another great job rescuing a little seen gem from Finnish director Aki Kaurismaki.  Set on the French coastal port of Le Havre, an aging Marcel (Andre Wilms) ekes out a living on the street as a shoe shiner.  He lives in a small apartment in a poor neighborhood with several small markets nearby.<br /><br />A cargo ship unloads a container ultimately headed for London.  Authorities discover it contains 20 or so people from North Africa.  One teen age boy (Blondin Miguel) manages to get away and finds his way to Marcel while he is having his lunch.  Marcel shelters and feeds the boy even though he worries about the authorities ultimately catching him and deporting him back to Africa.  He also has to contend with his wife (Kati Outinen) who is in the hospital for what appears to be stomach cancer.  Her prognosis is grim but she hides the probable outcome from Marcel.<br /><br />Using his sympathetic neighbors and an unlikely police detective (Jean-Pierre Darroussin) for support, Marcel finds out that young Idrissa was enroute to London to reunite with his mother.  He manages to get a neighbor and former headliner rock musician Little Bob to hold a fund raiser in order to pay to have the boy smuggled into England.  Kaurismaki, who also wrote the script, never plays this too serious.  But it's not a comedy either. You really have to think of it more as a fantasy.  And a good one it is.  The film ends with an unexpected surprise.  Check it out.

B004RE29PO|5.0|Having recently acquired the \\"Alien Anthology Blu ray collection\\" this is my first look at the second of the set in the original franchise.  I chose the \\"director's cut\\" which adds about 17 minutes to the original theatrical cut.  The biggest add on provides more of a back story for the character Newt, the young girl Ripley essentially adopts.  Another section provides more substance as to why Ripley would return to the planetoid that was inhabited by vicious alien creatures.<br /><br />With Ripley's crew wiped out in the original \\"Alien,\\" she travelled alone inside the lifeboat/escape ship in statis until rescued by chance by a merchant ship.  She learns she has been adrift for 57 years.  The military tells her that the planetoid is now the sight of a huge scientific mission to make the air breathable.  Communication between the colonists and home base has ceased and they want Ripley to accompany a unit of Marines to check it out.<br /><br />Under director James Cameron this great sci-fi classic builds on the wonderful horror film, \\"Alien,\\" that preceded it. Much more action oriented, especially the last 35 minutes which may be the most exciting ever filmed. Sigourney Weaver's Ripley character is fully developed here and she manages to show both a tender side and one kick-ass lady at the other extreme.  Like all great films of this nature Cameron doesn't show us the alien creatures until into the film more than an hour.  And when they do show up, it is in great numbers.<br /><br />This is an early film for Bill Paxton whose goofy Pvt. Hudson suggests the idea of an ant like colony of creatures with a queen.  Others in an early stage of their careers include Michael Biehn as Cpl. Hicks put in charge by default, comedian and actor Paul Reiser as the corporate shill, Lance Henriksen as the android Bishop and Carrie Henn as Rebecca (Newt). Without question \\"Aliens\\" remains one of the great action/horror films of all time and this longer version is the one to watch.<br /><br />The Blu ray transfer is beautiful to look at.  The film-like quality shows some grain as it should but check out the close-ups on the faces of various characters.  Skin pores, eye color, clothing stains all vibrant and clear.  You'll swear the juicy drool coming from queen alien is getting all over you.  The DTS-HD Master Audio is even better.  Applied to 5 channels plus the LFE, everything comes to thunderous life.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is just simply terrible.What a waste of time and money. So after hearing on TV/Radio/friends, etc. that this book was \\"really good\\" I decided to check it out and I purchased the trilogy. I am almost done with the first book and I just can't take it anymore. I'm about to set on fire all three books because I don't want anyone else to waste their time reading this.<br />There are plenty of reasons why I hated this book (no plot, repetitive language, etc.)but my #1 reason to hate it us because it promotes domestic violence. I don't understand how someone wouldn't be able to see it. Is as clear as can be. I am not a conservative person and I believe sex is supposed to be enjoyable, fun, and playful. However this book portrays sex as something where only the man has control and can do whatever he wants with the women. Absolutely ridiculous and humiliating the way he forces her to call him \\"yes sir\\" for everything (\\"I do as I'm told\\") and the way he beats her just for rolling her eyes. I understand that she's a fully consent adult, but the fact that she agreed to be a toy of Christian is where the negative message come, specially to young women that don't know any better, this book influences people to be submissive and believe that is okay to get beat by their lover and then have sex with them. Nobody has the right to hurt anybody. This book is completely useless, I'm not getting anything from it. it's not funny, enjoyable, educational, nothing. It doesn't have any value.<br /><br />STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK! If 50 shades of ridiculousness.

B000QUUD60|5.0|Having been born in the last year that Mr. Crosby worked for Paul Whiteman and the year before he began his sensational career on radio and in the Coconut Grove and Paramount Theater in NYC, where he was Emcee, kibitzing on stage with a vaudevillian named Bob Hope, during the latter's act; being only a five year old, listening, no doubt, to the Major Bowes Amateur Hour (everybody's family favorite) when the singing group, which included Frank Sinatra, did not win the first prize; I took Elvis Presley in stride and, so far as I can recall, saw only a few of his TV appearances and concerts, and a couple of his movies (one because it co-starred everyone's favorite of the day, Mary Tyler Moore), I approached this DVD, with no nostalgia and very little acquaintance with its Star. Naturally, I had heard of his meteoric rise, his being drafted, his successful film career and, what else, the hysterical females, but I came to it without the sense of nostalgia and ' those guys from my time' which a Crosby or Sinatra show would elicit.<br />I was surprised and pleased. What I got was a straight club act by a professional singer and entertainer, who skillfully held the audience in his hand, through the appeal of his singing and the strength of his accompaniment. There was almost nothing of the glitz one sees in the massive, glittering, technologically explosive acts, in which a contemporary Star, plays his/her Central Role.<br />I cannot tell, as I can immediately for Crosby and Sinatra, at what stage of his career he has arrived by the sound of his voice and his physical manner, but, it is apparent that this guy is in good voice and in control of his stage and his audience. It was quite enjoyable, although most of the songs were new to me (or had made no particular impression on me at the time).<br />So speaking only to those who are not fans, old or new, of this very important figure in popular music of the 20th Century, take a look, don't come with preconceptions built on what you might have heard or read from your elders, sit back and, I think, there is a good chance this guy will please you, whomsoever your real favorites are: the performers of today, your day.

Yes I'm being dramatic to be ironic about people who review things with such &quot;eloquence&quot;.

I saw the movie \\"The Kite Runner\\" and was very enthusiastic when I came across \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\".<br />  I lost interest a few times because it sort of went on and on with hardship after hardship. The author also tries too hard giving emotional situation after emotional situation but it never sticks to the reader because he does not elaborate at the proper times and to make matters worse he propells the story foward to another situation or time of day, another day often another month or year too quickly. It annoyed me having to re-read certain parts to make sure it was not me reading sentences incorrectly or skipping paragraphs.<br />  The book does not have much of a happy ending. It seems the author was compromising his creative story telling by inserting about 15 or so pages at the end of the book with a bland spiritual healing type of reason to end the story and balance everyting out. Seems like he wanted to give readers a Hollywood ending, a little happiness that love conqueres all or good people overcome adversity. Some stories don't end well and he should of stuck to the vibe of most of the book, which is the depressing reality of daily life for people in that part of the world.<br />  In my opinion not one character in this book comes out a winner, but depending on how you see things there may be a few winners if you want to call them that. If the author was going for bittersweet ending he accomplished his goal but not to the fullest. I felt it was a weak ending.<br />  This book began so wonderfully engaging and I was becoming sympathetic to the main character but the author lost it when adding other characters to Miraims life story. He did not develope those enough for the reader to have an emotional journey with them. Then he adds a second main character to the story and it's downhill from there.<br />  Two stories tied together but not woven well to touch the reader. Felt like I was reading a history book with a few tidbits of someones personal story here and there.<br />  The writer does educate the readers with the cultural and politcal history of the country and is very descriptive in bringing imagery to the mind, but again a little to much describing. He spoon feeds you the dialogue, feelings, thoughts and actions of the characters back and forth so much and way to often back to back that one doesn't notice the change in time. It almost reads like a movie script. Many times I chuckled to myself because it felt that the author did write the book with the intentions for the book to be made into a movie. I'm probably right.<br />  This story had the potential to be epic, especially with an issue that is relevent. This book should have been double in size of pages so that it should have taken the reader on the cathardic journey the story was supposed to have been. I'm not saying it is a bad book or story, but for those of you who saw or read \\"The Kite Runner\\", \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" was almost a sophmore flop. Keep that in mind so if you feel disappointed; at least my review may have softened the blow. Remember it may be my fault for comparing the two books. I still recommend this book but with no huge enthusiasm.

B000026FJ6|1.0|I wrote a Review before, a great CD by Mike Oldfield no doubt, but the songs are damaged from 11-th to 17-th. Every song you listen was jumping from a second to 5 or even more, making it almost impossible to listen. I couldn't write this 5 days ago because I was returning to my other Camp in Afghanistan so this is my last review. Really disappointed by a seller.

B0036T52NM|4.0|You will enjoy the movie, it leaves you thinking what is next; what is going to happen.  It will also make you think what would you do to change fate or except fate.
0345803485|5.0|I love this book so much I bought the other two in the trilogy.  It took a while to receive, but I did get the book in the time frame given by this vendor.
B0067QPVJ6|3.0|Was really excited to watch this movie. Huge fan of the original and the John Carpenter version. This prequel is related to the latter movie. Other than the special effects there is nothing that approaches the 1982 version. Its hard to buy the prequel premise. It borrows many of the scenes and dialogue from the JC version. Its almost like they were going for a reboot and decided to go down another track. The other issue is the casting. The first 2 movies had great dialogue with a cast that meshed together well. All of the characters in this one are weak, nondescript and completely forgettable. Yes paranoia is the underlying theme. Yet it would have been more interesting if some characters got along better in order to build up to some sort of tension.  Most of the characters are too aloof and underwritten to care about them.  Even with superior effects technology in todays movies, they cant come up to the level of the 1982 version. They seem obligatory and just there to get the scares. Still I have it at 3 stars if I take it as stand alone and separate from the original[s].

B005LAIGLO|5.0|Action packed. Mark is a great actor. Definitely a must see. I would have liked to see Kate Beckinsale with more of a substantial part, but all in all it's still a great movie.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is a very engaging, can't-put-it-down read.  Although this is not the best written book, it is not poorly so either.  Defending Jacob raises thought-provoking questions, especially as a parent.  I highly recommend this book for book clubs.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|I had gotten a referral from a friend to see this movie because she knows that I LOVE SUSHI!!!  And I'm a fanatic when it comes to eating great sushi and hearing about everything that goes into it, where to get it, how to make etc. So I made it a point to get the movie.<br /><br />Now I'm even more enthusiastic about getting me some good sushi....it was incredible watching Jiro and his journey....its true he is the absolute master in the game. It goes to show you, find something you truly love and then find a way to make money!!! that's the secret to his success. Jiro is such a wonderful person, he went through many struggles. I loved seeing him; this was a great documetary....it won't really show you \\"how to make\\" sushi but its the look into the mind and world of a man \\"truly sent here from God\\" who possesses the integrity and desire to BE THE BEST at his one true gift; that is making sushi. His outright determination to honor the skill and craft his ability to respect the art of making sushi is enough to make you want to cry. He has mastered this skill to a level that no one else could dream of; at all the same time mentoring his sons to follow in his footsteps!!! what an exepctional documentary; the boys were so loyal and greatful to have been taught by the master.<br /><br />Jiro has done this same craft for over 75 years!!! I can't even imagine what that must be like that's why I rented the movie!! the filmmakers allowed us to see up front what kind of person it takes to become a legend like Jiro. I'm simply in aw over him. I can't believe i witnessed it with my own eyes.  It does not get any better than this.<br /><br />As I continue to salivate I'm saving to make my way to Japan to see if I can get to his restaurant!!! Maybe I can meet him and shake his hand....we'll see!!<br /><br />Happy eating!
0061801313|5.0|I got this set for my wife because she started watching the TV series and got hooked. I personally have not read the books but from what she tells me the books are more detailed and have extra characters and depth than the show(as to be expected) and is suspenseful and entertaining to read. If you are a fan of the show or just looking for a new murder/mystery book then judging by my wife's inability to put the book down I would say get it.
B004132HZS|5.0|After reading rave reviews about this show, I finally watched it. It's probably one of the best shows I've watched in a long time! The actors portray their characters excellently, and bring to life a very smart script in each episode.

B0083SBJXS|5.0|This movie is one of the most amazing movies Ive seen ever. Action, Adventure, Comedy, Drama, Suspense....it has it all in one. I was on the edge of my seat the whole ride and didnt wanna get off. Movies like this, I wish they would make them longer.This movie was just FREAKING AWESOME! I dont think I can name a better movie right now.I am so stoked I wanna go suit up fight bad guys now and save our world! Get this in bluray. Watch this on the biggest screen possible. Throw on the surrond sound and put the bass all the way up. Make the walls tremble and then enjoy the ride. I would love to watch this in 3D. I can only imagine how much better the experience would be! I will be sure to watch Avengers 2 in the theater when it comes out..., hopefully IMAX. I dont see how anyone could rate this less than 5 stars, unless you lack a pulse.

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|The only thing wrong with this game is that when you play it on a Kindle Fire, some of the top part of the screen is cut off. If Halfbrick could fix this, it would be perfect.<br /><br />P.S this is not a killing spree game, so don't complain about not being able to kill people. There's a machine gun gun jetpack for Christ's sake!
B0036EH40Q|2.0|One reason that I really enjoy Blu-ray releases is that they're generally aimed at a film aficionado who wants the best video and audio presentation possible - as close as we can get to the theatrical experience. Additionally, most of us are anxious to see the director's unfettered version on his/her film, but Vista doesn't agree with me. They released an extended cut on their 2-disc Director's cut [[ASIN:B00005RHGL Tombstone - The Director's Cut (Vista Series)]], but chose not to use that on the Blu-ray release (and cutting 4 minutes is cutting a lot of plot development in any motion picture) that could have accommodated *both* versions of the film like so many other Blu-ray discs do. So unless they're were respecting expressed Cosmatos's wishes, they're acting like the same company that made viewers sit through all the previews on their first DVD releases. Since I haven't read anthing that suggests the director has repudiated the longer cut of his film, I have the choice of either keeping the earlier release, or purchasing the Blu-ray theatrical cut because of the high marks it got (and that makes the Mouse happy!) and/or keep the extended version of the film. Very disappointing.
B002XTXG1G|3.0|The main character is unforgettable.  the movie is slow at times but I found myself glued to the screen every time Bronson opened his mouth or did something, very unpredictable and wild.  Tom Hardy did a great acting job, you'll actually be scared of this guy watching the movie.  This movie is worth seeing but a strong stomach is recommended.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|Sorry to neglect the actual film here but I've put off buying the \\"extended\\" blu-ray for the 3D version. Cameron shot the entire film in 3D which is why it looks so good and if you have a 3D TV is one of the few blu-rays worth having (see also Hugo & Tron Legacy)<br /><br />Now, Avatar was under exclusive contract, the 3D version was only available with Panasonic 3D TV's (hence it not being for sale immediately) instead they did two releases a theatrical, followed a very short time later with an extended.<br /><br />Now, the question is, is there going to be an extended 3D or not? Do we buy the theatrical before the E-Bay hoarders get every copy to re-sell at twice the price once the stores sell out (see the word \\"Limited\\" on the box?) or do we shell out the $30 now and then grit our teeth and do it again when and if the extended 3D comes available.<br /><br />Sorry, but they have really botched this, I'm not happy if I pay $30 for the first disk, $30 for the 3D now and $30 for an extended 3D later.
B0009S2T0M|3.0|this is one of the most bizarre, twisted movies I have ever seen.  You may not be incredibly surprised at the end but you'll be shocked.  not sure its worth buying the DVD, it's the type of movie you'll only watch once.
B0086700CM|2.0|u can not put this game down. it makes it even better that's its free. this game is the beast
B00005JLR2|5.0|My kids LOVE this movie.  We had never heard of it until we saw a preview for it on another older DVD.  we were all very pleasantly surprised and watch it often.  Its a fun story with a hero that is easy to root for and good villains.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Stumbled across this while searching for a new Sci-Fi read.  Got great reviews so thought I should return the favor.<br /><br />Was an extremely well written story from start to finish.  Have since read several other of his books (First Shift, Half Way Home, Plagiarist) and all of them are engaging and amazing stories.<br /><br />Thank you for introducing me to Hugh Howey fellow Amazon reviewers.  I hope my 5 stars encourage another reader to give these books a try.

B002SQ364Q|2.0|I did not like this movie at all. It was too long, the acting wasn't very good and it was boring at times. To me it was a recreation of the documentary which is pointless to redo. The only reason I didn't give this 1 star is because the background story, in the beginning of the film, got my attention. If I'm going to sit for 2 hours and watch a movie about Woodstock I'd rather just watch the real thing via the documentary.
B0027DK206|4.0|I read a lot of reviews online and was worried when I saw that many people had the problem of films not coming out. So far I've used up one and a half pack of films and all the films came out OK so thank God for that :) However, a few did come out totally black which made me sad. I think you just got to figure out the settings.    EDIT: have been using this for a couple years now, and I find it usually malfunctions indoors. A good flash helps, but make sure to diffuse it so the subjects nearer the flash aren't washed out. I usually use a tissue paper to cover the flash and it works, haha.
034580404X|5.0|Never have I read a book quite like this before. Seriously HOT! I would not recommend that you leave this sitting around for your teenage daughters to get their hands on. Keep it locked up. Thoroughly enjoyed to put it mildly.
B002ZG98UA|3.0|Right off the bat I have to tell you that I did NOT see this in 3D on the big screen. I'm not a fan of 3D in general and am disappointed to see so many filmmakers getting on the bandwagon. However, I'm sure it was a visual stunner in that respect.<br /><br />After LOVING the first 3 movies in this series, I'm sad to report I was disappointed by \\"Afterlife\\". The first 3 films had so many taught, tight, and tense actions sequences. Lots of close quarters and surprises. More infected goo than you could shake a stick at. An evolution of a heroine unfolded in front of our eyes. (Which was a real surprise in a bloody sci-fi action film.) This movie? Has Alice. Has Claire. Has infected. Has the Umbrella corporation. Has some good action, but it doesn't have any of STORY or HUMANITY that surfaced in the previous movies.<br /><br />Everyone seems to be moving in slow motion. It felt as if they were marking time just to get to the next film. There aren't any real connections between characters; not even with Alice. Alice herself seems to be completely uninterested most of the time; even after finding Claire and some survivors in Los Angeles. By the way - the survivors in Los Angeles seemed pretty healthy for folks that had been living like that for what(?) over 4 years?<br /><br />There were some good action sequences, especially the opening scene (which was pretty fantastic) but unfortunately mostly they were TOO stylized. And again - in SLOW MOTION too often. There wasn't the same anxious and desperate survival feel as we were given in the other films. Even so, it wasn't all bad. It was somewhat entertaining and for fans of the series it does have important information for the next film.  I do hope that they return to more of the style of the first 3 movies when they give us the 5th. And maybe actually give us a final resolution.<br /><br />On a side note, I hope they leave Wentworth Miller out of it. He was horrible. Utterly horrible.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT:<br />I'm not so sure that Alice doesn't still have powers. I know he \\"cured\\" her early on in the film but she still seemed to be \\"better than everyone\\". So...yeah.so sure that Alice doesn't still have powers. I know he \\"cured\\" her early on in the film but she still seemed to be \\"better than everyone\\". So...yeah.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I had trouble putting this book down. I thought it had the proper amount of mystery, action and suspense. I really look forward to reading book 6.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This was one of the hardest books to finish I've ever read.  I kept thinking maybe the book would redeem itself, but alas no.  The plot is non-existent.  The characters are annoying.  The language is sophomoric.  The sex scenes are repetitive (actually the whole book is repetitive).  On top of all this, there is little believable about the story (a virgin college senior who doesn't have an email address; a young, stunningly gorgeous, philanthropic billionaire who has never had a girlfriend... REALLY???).  I know there is a lot of buzz around this book & that makes people very curious to know what the hype is all about.  I know it is hard to believe that this book could be that bad (the sheer volume of sales means it must have some redeeming qualities, right?) but believe me... don't waste your time or your money on this one.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|This is one of my favorite ipod apps, buy the kindle version has some issues. Screen formatting and serious hiccups bring the score down. it feels like an emulated port, and should run way better on this considering it ran flawlessly on my ancient ipod touch. With some patching, however, it will be one of the best games on the kindle.
0812982622|5.0|In all candor, I must tell the prospective reader that this is not an easy book to read. At the same time, it is one of the most fascinating and revealing I've read in a very long time. First of all, who else has tackled the inscrutable mystery that is North Korea? And Johnson has done it in a way that brings you into the narrative almost as an on-site observer. You won't always like what you see -- if you do, you're likely as inhuman as some of the characters Johnson describes. But you won't be able to put the book down. And throughout your reading, you will pause in amazement at the frequency and impunity with which you and I and all of us regularly criticize our government, our politicians, anything we care to complain about! All without retribution! Do yourself a favor and read this book.
B008BM9L72|5.0|I read the 3 books over a weekend, couldn't put them down, very addictive. 2nd book was harder to get into
0385534639|3.0|I wish Amazon would've let me give this 3.5 stars.  This was a beautifully written tale about a challenge between two magicians and the Night Circus, the venue for the challenge, which grew up around it.  This story had my attention all the way through.  The visuals were stunning.  The Night Circus felt like a dream, and I came to the end feeling the way a person does after waking up from a strange dream.  It was off-balancing (in a good way!)<br /><br />The reason why I didn't give this 4 or 5 stars is that I felt as if the characters didn't quite fit the story.  I felt as if the characters were jammed into place and forced to do the bidding of the author, rather than their actions being the natural result of being who they were in response to the challenges given them.  For example, I feel that a boy who grows up as Marco does, secluded from the world and discouraged from interacting with others, would have been too distrusting and too socially inexperienced to have been able to forge the relationship that he did with Isobel, and later with Celia.  I also felt as if there was no really convincing reason for why and how Celia and Marco fell in love in the first place.  It just kind of happened in an off-hand sort of way.<br /><br />At any rate, despite my issue with the characters, I loved this book and would highly suggest it to anyone, as it was a wonderful read!
B0059XTUVI|2.0|Imagine a movie made about Winston Churchill that concentrated for 2 hours on his habit of writing, smoking and drinking in bed, inter-cut with moments of his days in the political wilderness before WWII and never told you any of the rest of his amazing life! That's what this movie does to Margo Thatcher. I read a review that said it was a \\"lefty's wet dream\\" but I don't understand how NOT telling her story serves anyone's purpose? And that's what this story is guilty of. I gave it 2 stars only because Streep was great as an actress. You can't blame the woman that the movie went nowhere. Left or Right, if you've an interest in the moments of this woman's life that made a difference to the world, then skip this one.
1400069289|2.0|I am actually trying to be kind giving it 2 stars. I am more with those who rated it at 1 out of 5 - so read those reviews first.<br />I bought the book after hearing the author interview on NPR Think. Impulse buy. Or perhaps I am spoiled? I expected something<br />that rivals Blink by Malcolm Gladwell. Oops... This doesn't hold a candle to it.<br /><br />A few pieces of something interesting and informative and more or less to the point - ok. But then: heavily touted \\"habit framework\\" of Cue-Routine-Reward with dumb drawings throughout (indeed, their supply seems larger than necessary) and anything that can be bent to fit into the above framework (you can also call it \\"instincts\\", \\"second nature\\", \\"polished training\\", etc).<br /><br />Eventually, the bigger picture forms: this seems like a mediocre-written and quite poorly organized book (long footnotes, long list of notes at the end - oh, didn't know those were there, too!), i.e. something hastily thrown together to make a quick buck.<br /><br />I would not recommend it to a friend. Instead, I would recommend reading 1-star reviews to get the gist of it.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Cloud Atlas is in one word, a wonder. It's spiritual and gorgeous in breadth. It's highly challenging in structure. It's poignant in theme--so poignant that I find my self many weeks later thinking back on its characters with a bit of loss and a bit of hope. It truly is the kind of book that you never forget, no matter how many whodunits or chillhangers you've run through at the beach or on the train. This one stays with you, because it lives in the human heart.<br /><br />Much has been made of author Mitchell's unique structure for this books, which was actually called \\"unreadable\\" by some baffled reviewer who is responsible for making nominations for the Booker Prize. Honestly, if I can read and understand this, and I have no Cambridge degree, then I'm sure that any reasonably smart person can put it together. Sure you scratch your head after chapter one ends inexplicably. But when you find that someone mentions to the letter-writer in section two that he has been reading section one as a book--and can't find the second half--well, your mind begins to go to work. Let's just say that it takes longer for some than for others to realize that Mitchell has written a literary clamshell with early history forming a coating around the ever-engrossing forays into the future. When we hit the ultimate future, we go back again to the past, meeting all the characters we met again on our way out. It's a fascinating way of telling a story and I never found it let me down, even on the way out when you'd think the story would decrease in interest. It actually worked a bit as a detective yarn and answered a number of questions that were left hanging.<br /><br />However, structure is not what makes this book so incredible. It's the way a musical composition, \\"Cloud Atlas Sextet\\" by Robert Frobisher (of the second segment) permeates the book. Whether they are aware of the composition or not, the characters are held together by music, as they are by a birthmark many of them wear. You can believe in reincarnation or not (and Mitchell even makes fun of himself for putting the belief in the book), but something like it keeps everyone and everything connected in humanity. Call it love at its deepest level, call it God's touch, call it whatever you like, something has united these characters and the music in an aural way of making the connection real.<br /><br />This is a book for people who take big issues seriously and not for those who like little tricks. I'm hoping the movie that will come out in October will also latch onto the spiritual theme.can believe in reincarnation or not (and Mitchell even makes fun of himself for putting the belief in the book), but something like it keeps everyone and everything connected in humanity.

B006LSZECO|1.0|I purchased this book because it was #1 on the NY best sellers listing and Kindle. It was not written in a style that I am fond of, it switched from Amy telling the story in one chapter and then Nick in the next chapter.  It started out as a good who-done-it, however the plot was revealed to early by Amy, in her telling of the story.  I did not like that Nick was portrayed as such a simpleton, and Amy so devious, and the ending completely turned me off!  Really!! His wife confesses the murder to him, and that she set him up to look like he murdered her! Then she  stays with her because she is pregnant.  He tells us in the book he is not sleeping with her, and so we are to believe he is such a simpleton that he just blindly accepts her word that the baby is his! Could this man be portrayed any weaker?  Also the FBI and cops bought her new version of the story, not likely!!<br /><br />A reasonably sane man or woman would set out to see justice done on this crazy woman! The last thing you would do is to allow her to raise this child,whether it was yours or her accused rapist,Desi, the man we know she framed as her abductor then killed. Knowing she is insane how could you stay in the same house with her?  HUMPH!I don't recommend this book at all!! I was truly disappointed in the ending, which had so many possibilities, but not the one the reader is left with. Of course this is just one woman's opinion, and I give[[ASIN:B006LSZECO Gone Girl: A Novel]] no stars!!!

Infact it contains both two Wilburys' Album and a very very special extra bonus 12'' inch vynyl which includes the extended versions of \\"handle with care\\" and \\"end of the line\\". Both of these tracks have never ever issued on a cd! Incredible, innit, but it's true, so you'd better come back to the old vynyl if you are pretty damned good records collectors and, first of all, lovers of the Rock'N Roll Music. What are you waiting for?? Fasten your seatbelt and get ready for a neverending journey through your memories. As i said......legends never die, bear it in mind!!!

B004NJC0B6|5.0|I saw this in a movie theater when it first came out and I'm glad I own this now because I hardly heard a word that was said because of all the screaming that was going on. This is vintage AC/DC. No one can replace Bon Scott and all you got to do is watch this DVD to see what I mean.

0783226837|3.0|A playful bit of rubber monster schlock from the tail end of the '80s, this is one great big vat of cheese and it makes no efforts to conceal or apologize for that. I can respect that kind of dedication to identity, even if it is grade-school simple and lowbrow, and that's a big part of why the movie's still such a blast to watch today. Kevin Bacon, Fred Ward and Reba McEntire head up a cast that's about as one-dimensional as it gets, flaunting their stereotypes with enthusiasm in the midst of an utterly ridiculous set of circumstances. The premise behind the monsters is original, and the effects actually look pretty solid considering their age, but the concept is pushed to such extremes that there's nothing to do but laugh at the sheer, ballsy idiocy of it all. It's stupid, thin and thoroughly overdone, but just as much dumb, naked fun to watch today as it was when I first caught it at the age of twelve. A gratifying way to senselessly waste ninety minutes of your life.
1932735410|5.0|I was in a study group for PMP certification and bought this instead of Rita's CAPM Exam prep book.  We were a group of 4 and 2 were seasoned PMs and 2 of us had experience in project work and PM responsibilities but not in an 'official capacity'.    I was actually waffling as to which exam to take and finally opted for the CAPM. I just wanted to go into summer with an accomplishment and a break from studying.  Note: I also spent 1500$ on the Kaplan University PM IT courses.  It was good for me as it kept me on task for 6 months.  It involved 4 courses and a lot of work.    Once I decided to take the CAPM I bought Rita's CAPM prep book.  If you are considering the CAPM I'd still get the PMP book.  I think the PMP book is more up-to-date.  The CAPM book is a subset of the PMP book + an Input/Tools/Output game which you could make on your own.  Just really work hard on memorizing the Inputs, Tools/Techniques and Outputs.  However understanding the process reduces the amount of memorization required.    Here is a link to CAPM Exam Simulation software for $29.99 that really did a good job of mimicking the CAPM Exam.  I found a coupon for 5$ off somewhere, sorry can't remember and be sure to delete the $5.45 Extended Download Service if you think you don't need it.  [...]    PS. I passed the CAPM exam in June 2012!  PSS. 2 in the study group passed the PMP and the 3rd passed the CAPM like me.    Good Luck to all!
B0083SBJXS|4.0|The culmination of Marvel's four-year, five-picture master plan is, puzzlingly, both as good as I'd hoped and a mild disappointment. It excels at playing up the larger-than-life aspects of the story, from the testy initial relationship between heroes and the looming magnitude of the threat they're called together to face. Such moments are dispersed liberally, perhaps once every five minutes, and they're an effective method of keeping the audience on the hook for the duration. What's missing, at least from where I sit, is a measure of substance or depth behind those fireworks. Robert Downey Jr. is again excellent in his nuanced interpretation of the paradoxical Tony Stark, and Mark Ruffalo might just be the best Hulk to grace the silver screen, but by comparison the rest of the cast feels quite thin, shallow and (for lack of a better word) cartoonish. Captain America, for example, wears a completely different personality than he did in his solo picture, and never feels quite right as the commanding field general he's presented to be. The most intriguing aspect of his character, an emotional detachment from modern culture, is barely even mentioned. He, and the rest of the team, feels like a suit of armor with a few good one-liners, not a living, breathing human being. It's a trap that was mostly evaded in the stars' preceding solo shots, so it's a shame to see it tripped here, especially given the amount of time and effort that was expended to define each individual's motivations. Those nitpicks certainly aren't enough to stop me from enjoying the closest thing we'll ever get to an all-splash-page crossover mega-event on the big screen, but they're also irritating enough to keep tickling the back of my mind while the next set of fuses are lit. It's a herculean effort with some truly great rewards, but not the picture-perfect ensemble masterpiece it would have you believe.
B005FISBTO|4.0|By far, one of the best programs ever conceived. Many other series have waned in creativity after the first season but Dexter is still going strong in its sixth season. There are a lot of (unexplained) references though to previous seasons. If you've never seen Dexter before, I recommend starting with Season 1. It will be worth the effort. There is strong continuity between the seasons. It's like watching a very long story. The season ends with a surprise (of course!).<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />The DVD has an obnoxious, loud and very long ad right after the FBI warning and you can't skip it. It's on every disc in the package. If you pause long enough for the screen saver to kick in or accidentally hit 'stop' then you must sit through another viewing of this ad. When I went to the Bio section of the last disc, I clicked menu to get back to the other bio's. It went back to the beginning again and Oh,boy! another viewing of the ad. I can understand having the ad but does it really have to be on ALL of the discs? Very annoying.<br /><br />I would have given this 5 stars but for the ad.

B005LAIIRQ|2.0|Filmmakers of \\"The Grey\\" should thank ever-reliable Liam Neeson for joining their project. Without his strong performance \\"The Grey\\" would have been an unwatchable mess.<br /><br />Liam Neeson plays John Ottway, a man hired by an oil company in Alaska to \\"protect\\" the workers from wolves by shooting them. Ottway take a flight with the crew of oil workers, but his plane crashes in the Alaskan wilderness. The premise may reminds us of \\"Alive\\" (1993), a film based on true events, but \\"The Grey,\\" directed by Joe Carnahan (\\"Narc\\" \\"The A-Team\\"), it seems, aims for something different - something more mystical.<br /><br />Thus grey wolves are depicted as very violent creatures with uncanny abilities to spot the humans. I do not disagree with the idea of turning wolves into symbolic presence, but I still don't know whether I should take the film's story seriously or not. While Joe Carnahan's approach to the subject matter of survival tends to emphasize the realism (with the spectacular visual of the freezing snow and wilderness), the story that unfolds here often looks like an action-movie template, with a group of blood-thirsty wolves (special effects included) and cliff jumping.<br /><br />Some viewers would find the film's abrupt ending (including one post-credit scene) unsatisfactory (is there an alternate ending?) Some may find the film's tone too depressing. But what I didn't like about the film is its lack of credible motives on the humans' side. Why do they have to leave the plane, for instance? Neeson's character explains, but never convinces, as his character, if not his performance, lacks the credible voice of Jack London, who would have given some advice to filmmakers.<br /><br />\\"The Grey\\" has two good things in it, Liam Neeson's acting and beautiful photography. Two stars for them.

B008QE9VJI|5.0|A man of privilege Barnabas Collins develops feelings for a woman whom is of what would be considered a working class or a poor and undesirable type.  While Barnabas never treats Angelique any differently than anyone else just because of her social status, he never truly loves Angelique.  Barnabas then later meets Josette Dupres whom is the true love of his life.  While Barnabas was also still involved with Angelique, he decides to end his relationship with her and stay true to Josette as that is whom he truly loves.  Other things transpire and after the Death of both of his parents, Barnabas develops a strong interest in Dark Magic in hopes of finding answers.  The woman, whom he had previously been involved with and no longer cares for, Angelique Bouchard, will not leave Barnabas alone.  Obsessed with Barnabas and not wanting to accept he has moved on, Angelique curses Barnabas and he is imprisoned from the 1700's until 1972.  Barnabas is finally able to escape his prison, and returns to his former home which is now inhabited by his present day relatives.  Barnabas has a difficult time adjusting to modern times as well as getting to know his family whom was not alive at the time he was imprisoned.  Angelique is not only still alive, but is also doing remarkably well and soon seeks out Barnabas whom is not very happy at all to see her, let alone know that she is actually still alive.  Angelique is still very much in love with Barnabas as he is slowly developing a new love interest with Victoria Winters.  To further complicate matters, Victoria bears an uncanny resemblance to Barnabas's true love Josette Dupres.  Barnabas decides as his new purpose in life, he is going to restore his family's name and business to what they once were.  However, the chief competitor in the business is none other than Angelique - Barnabas's former lover and long time nemesis.  Further developments and events follow and ultimately end with a climatic showdown which also throws in a few twists not hinted at earlier in the movie.<br /><br />I must say that first I am not very familiar with the Original TV series, so for some of the people whom have reviewed the movie and were disappointed I am sorry to hear you feel that way.  However as someone, whom had no knowledge of the back story or much else at all for that matter about Dark Shadows, I really loved the movie very much and I am looking forward to the Bluray.  I loved the way the story was told from this perspective, as a movie by itself (if you do not take any of the previous Dark Shadows material into account....) it was great!  There are times when the movie seems to slow down but overall I loved how the odd jokes and the sarcasm were presented in the way that only Johnny Depp can present them!  I don't want to give anything away other than if you have not seen this movie, what are you waiting for?  Pre-Order this like yesterday!  The movie will be even better than it was in the theater!<br /><br />I cannot wait to see what additional footage was left out of the original cut!  For the people that saw the movie and hated it because they were longtime Dark Shadows fans - Perhaps you may like the movie more with the extra footage?  I want to see to see how holes in the story onscreen are filled in and other elements of the film are expanded upon.<br /><br />I also want to say that I am not very familiar with Eva Green (Angelique Bouchard); however she was amazing in her role and bought the character to life. It was great to see Chloe Moretz (Carolyn Stoddard) again who will only continue to become a bigger star in the future.  One of the reasons I was interested in this movie was Johnny Depp whom of course portrays Barnabas Collins.  That's not to say the movie is shabby or anything of the sort, I was just not familiar with the Dark Shadows Franchise in anything other than the name.<br /><br />Helena Bonham Carter (Dr. Julia Hoffman), Michelle Pfeiffer - (Elizabeth Collins Stoddard), and JackieEarle Haley (Willie Loomis) were all great casting choices as well as of course Bella Heathcote  (Victoria Winters/Josette Dupres).  The only other part I can think of that was of more than just a passing mention would be that of David Collins played by Gulliver McGrath.  The one role I was not impressed much at all with was that of Roger Collins played by Johnny Lee Miller whom is a solid actor though this was just not his movie.<br /><br />I loved the movie, a sequel would be nice...though Depp may be tied up doing the next two Pirates Of The Caribbean movies (which are going to be filmed simultaneously and then released separately).<br /><br /> So Pre-order Dark Shadows already! Or at the least, rent this on Amazon as soon as its put up for streaming and then buy it when you can.....but do whatever you can to see it.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|as an avid reader this book easily makes my top 10. the style is fluid the characters real and while the story is pretty standard fantasy its executuon is perfect and sets it above the rest.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|this game is pretty fun and addictive as the title of review States. have not found a lot to complain about so far. grab it while it is the free app of the day for sure.;)
B003XDXVXO|5.0|I loved it! I am pregnant for the first time and in a pretty new relationship and the movie showed so many things that go on in during this time in such a funny way.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|It is incredibly well designed and I have waiting 5+ months for this game and is one of the greatest ideas to put this uber popular app on the Amazon market after being in the ios market after so long.
B001P06GX4|5.0|This game is a family favourite that can be played by young and old. It is great because younger kids can join in too as there is no reading involved. It is good for developing visual-spatial skills and for strategic thinking. Love it so much I have the smaller version for two players... and have purchased it for friends' kids.
080214473X|5.0|Almost 100 of America's elite warriors were on mission in Somalia on the edge of Mogadishu.  The task force was composed of US Army Rangers and Delta Force soldiers are asked to capture two of the key lieutenants of the Somalia war lord to gather information about his location.  During the mission two Black Hawk Helicopters are shot down with RPGs as the forces are attacking the building that housed the rebel headquarters.  The entire city of Mogadishu becomes a battlefield as the rebels rally to kill as many Americans as they can.<br /><br />The Americans have to fight their way out of the hostile city and some have to even go back to try to rescue other fellow soldiers.  Men gave their lives to rescue other men because they were fellow warriors. A total of 18 American soldiers were killed, 70 were injured while over 500 Somalians were killed and over 1000 injured.  In the end some of the men had to literally run out of the city on foot as they had no rides to escape the rebels.<br /><br />It is a story of bravery and the horrors of war.  This book, to me, was far better than the movie and the final pages regarding the rescue of the American pilot are told differently than the movie.  This is an outstanding book and I recommend it to you as an excellent read!  I enjoyed reading the story and understanding the bravery of our soldiers.
B003KK65KG|4.0|This was a terrific book.  It kept me so intrigued that I wanted to keep reading it to see what happened next.  It also made you think about things that happen in your own life and help you appreciate how lucky we are sometimes.

B003L77G06|5.0|LOVE this show, it is freakin hilarious and I didnt start watching it until season 3, for no other reason than I already had enough shows to watch but I saw ONE episode and was hooked. All 3 season are so funny and fun.  Its worth the price absolutely.
B007UW9VWO|3.0|Jiro Ono is an 83-year-old Tokyo sushi master who has spent his life perfecting the art of putting dead bits of fish on rice rolls and doesn't really seem to care for much else. He has a three-star Michelin restaurant and dinner starts at 30,000 yen, which is about $380. If you like the idea of shelling out hundreds of dollars on sushi, and are partial to endless pictures of people cutting fish into thin slices, this is the movie for you.<br /><br />Jiro has a wife, but we really don't see her at all. Although he should have retired a long time ago he sticks at the job, much to the frustration of his eldest son, who is waiting patiently to take over. Jiro's younger son bolted when he could and has his own restaurant elsewhere in the city. Jiro is a perfectionist and complains he will never be good enough. His apprentices stay for 10 years before they can qualify as proper sushi makers. One poor boy is seen kneading an octopus for 50 minutes to ensure the right texture.<br /><br />The problem with the film is that the chief protagonist is chilly, to say the least. All he cares about is his sushi and this makes it hard to stay engaged. The film glosses over what he did during the war (there is a brief reference to serving food to soldiers) and seems content just to watch the master talk about fish. Almost as an aside do we learn that certain kinds of fish are disappearing from the oceans, but no one makes the connection between this and the glorification of sushi.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|They are simple little games but I love playing them. I love hard challenging  games but sometimes I loke to give my brain a break  and this is the perfect way to do it. I'd give it 10 stars if it was an option.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|This movie is great.  Better than that, watching it on Amazon saved us from having to find  copy somewhere.  We watched Begins and Dark Knight the night and morning before we saw Dark Knight Rises.  Awesome series!
B008MEM24S|4.0|Fun, but puzzles tend to not be very challenging. I think this was geared towards children. Still a solid game.

B006R8GK2Q|5.0|mini games slightly annoying, however game over all is fun and not too challenging but enough to not be boring.
B008602KQI|4.0|Solid movie but ending left me wanting more closure.  Leaves it open.  Loved the three-fingered solidarity salute.  Found some of the costumes atrocious.  Definitely worth renting.  Could see this as some foreshadow of the future.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to read and use. I use it daily in my work. It's free and can be used to get quick and accurate answers.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Seeing how many others love this series, it is clear my little review likely won't really mean anything to anyone. Still, I wanted to say how much I enjoyed this work. The premise is fresh, the characters are rich, and the plot hummed.<br /><br />I discovered this after the author interviewed on Jason Matthews' blog. What a treat...what a find!<br /><br />I look forward to more in the series and will definitely look to the other titles Mr Howey has to offer now and in the future. Well done, sir.<br /><br />J.

B0089AF2DS|5.0|While markedly different from past endeavors, this is indeed a great album. Ambitious, moving, melodic, and moody. Don't pick this album up expecting a similar experience as Red and Blue, but do pick it up if you want a unique take on music. Still has crunchy riffs, progressive metal elements, but instead of relying on those elements it uses those in harmony with haunting vocals and weird melodies. Psalms Alive is one such example. Starts off with a strange dreamlike progression, which then feeds into the sludgy riffs we are used to. Loved it. Understandably some won't. So before you buy or criticize, go to NPR or one of the other places that stream it for free and give it a listen. That will help your expectations when purchasing this album.
B000OCXIDK|4.0|This book was a great vacation read. It appealed to my preference for historical fiction without stressful political or war scenes. It was not exactly lighthearted, but not too heavy either. I enjoyed the sensual descriptions of art, beauty, love, and even food.<br />There is also a theme of family and an interesting twist of religious difference and ultimate tolerance.
B003TZ9EGO|3.0|I bought this to sample the famous Gaga and wasn't very impressed.  She is certainly a piece of work visually but her voice and lyrics don't cut it.  I'm sticking to Adele.
B000002KKD|5.0|This is one of the Punk/New Wave masterpieces for sure. Great, clever songwriting, infectious beats, searing vocals. A landmark album.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|My hubby and I really enjoy this app. Clever and amusing games with a wide variety of different types. The only problem we have is that we fight over who's turn it is to play. :)
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This app is envigorating. I thought that it is challenging in the 9 by 9. This app used parts of your brain that don't get used very much.

0345803485|1.0|I had heard all of the hype surrounding this trilogy and decided to give it a try.  I listened to it on my iPhone while I did housework.  I figured it would be a great boredom chaser.  Not so much.  The polish on my end tables was more intriguing.  I expected some erotica and got sleepy.  I was so very disappointed.  The amount of buz about these books was equal to the DaVinci code and I was set for a good read.  I found it juvenile, repetitive and it lacked any character development at all.  I hope that if young girls read this they don't take this as the way life is.  Christian Grey is just too uber perfect.  The guy doesn't exist.  I would love some ideas for good erotica with a bit of a story line.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the overall game is really nice but some of the games you play name you feel like your doing the same thing over and over and over again. its difficult to keep me interested for long periods of time.
B007P4OTHO|5.0|Being a hardcore fan and collector of several different versions of this seminal album, I have to admit though that I was a bit sceptical when I read about this Nth re-issue... But I was wrong, I listened to the vinyl at some friend's place and the first thing I noticed while Five Years in crescendo was playing is the depth of the kick drum (something that just doesn't exist in previous vinyl re-prints (Rykodisc and Simply Vinyl's) and the spatial sharpness of each instrument, specially the strings arrangements, so I bite the hook and ordered my copy.<br /><br />I'd rather say that this is the definitive version and as a giveaway it includes a DVD-A with the quite collectable 2003 Ken Scott's mix that was issued previously on SACD (Quite sought after by the way) and new 2.0 and 5.1 mixes, both of them excellent jobs in stereo; I can't tell you about 5.1 surround versions, since I'm not a surround camp fan) So get away and order it... PERIOD.
B008XG1X18|1.0|Could not log in through Facebook  so I uninstalled it. I would love to try it and give it a better review.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed this story.  I was moved to root for each character and then change my mind on a daily basis.  I like books that keep me guessing.  The only flaw that I found was the actual way it was presented.  It took a while to get used to the back and forth of each main character's version of events.  It did not seem to \\"flow\\" at first.  When jumping from one character to another,  one time period to another,  it helps to keep it fluid.  However, this was only a small annoyance.  The story was intriquing and nicely concluded.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Fifty Shades of Grey, recently purchased and shipped from Amazon, was an intriguing and unusual book for me to read.  The characters are quite adventurous and show their love in most unique ways.  They certainly seem to be meant for each other.
B008ANFRGQ|4.0|Wow! The Story of Light is one heck of a grower. Each time I listen to this album beginning to end, I'm always hearing something I didn't pick up before and it just keeps getting better and better. Continuing where Real Illusions: Reflections left off (where did it leave off, by the way?) The Story of Light is another impressive collection of Steve Vai's guitar meanderings.<br /><br />Never a dull moment on this album, as I'm finding there is something here for every mood.  Vai has always had the knack for nailing down the particular mood with his guitar. Whether it's the glorious confusion of \\"Gravity Storm\\" or \\"Weeping China Doll\\", Vai has it down! He'll go from one extreme, say the high-speed, pell mell cacaphony of \\"Velorum\\" to  the sugary-sweet sound of the beautiful \\"Mullach a' tSi\\" where he brings things back to a slower pace.<br /><br />There are other areas on here that I didn't think worked so well including, the \\"John the Revelator\\"/ \\"Book of the Seven Seals\\" section. I like it for what it is, but I just didn't think it fit well with the other songs - just my opinion.  I also have not agreed to well with a lot of the synth sounds on songs such as \\"The Story of Light\\" and \\"Racing the World\\".<br /><br />However, back to what I was saying earlier about the moods and how this album grows on you: \\"The Moon and I\\" is one of them. At first I thought it was another 'uh-oh Vai is singing, ho-hum' type of track but that is not the case. This one is very fun and reminds me of something that might come off of Alive in an Ultra World. Love the thick bass line to this baby. Can I mention \\"Gravity Storm\\" again? I don't know what the heck one is, but after hearing this track I feel like I've been in one!<br /><br />Another quality of this album I like is some of the familiarity. I like how he tried a few different things a la \\"No More Amsterdam\\" with Aimee Mann, but I also like coming home to the straight ahead rock of \\"Racing the World\\". This song to me sounds so much like Joe Satriani and I love it! (Would love to see this live at a G3 show with Vai/Satch tearing it up!)<br /><br />And he wraps things up with the closer \\"Sunshine Electric Raindrops\\" which sounds absolutely perfect. I start to picture closing credits to a movie in my head whenever I hear this.<br /><br />I have to say I am impressed with The Story of Light as a whole and am amazed that Vai is still going at it into his 50's still creating mind-blowing music for the masses. Ya gotta love it. As of now, I am giving this album 3.5 stars but I feel that will will probably change to 4 and back again. Enjoy!

044024630X|5.0|I've read all the Reacher novels and this is one of the best.  I prefer the plots related to his early military exploits since they are more believable than the \\"bum on the road with nothing but a toothbrush and no visible means of support\\".... This is typical Reacher- a complex whodunit, with a smattering of violence, and the hot chick who immediately falls for his scruffy look. Early on you are given a choice between two plausible murderers, and the clues keep the reader guessing about the motive for the crimes.  My only problem with the book was the page long descriptions of such things as how 3 people got into a car, and repetitive scenes in the diner etc.  This was the longest Reacher book due to this type of padding.

0143119680|1.0|I tried to read this book after reading a positive review online.  I also thought that the fact that every copy was checked out of my local library was a good sign - someone was reading this book, so it must be good.  I finally got my hands on it was very disappointed.  The beginning was very slow but I kept with it.  20 pages in and nothing really that interesting happened.  Then, it was frankly amazing that 65 pages in, and still NOTHING happens!<br /><br />I gave up around the 100 page mark.  So you don't waste your time, here's what I got:<br />This book follows a young witch who refuses to use her powers and wants to be successful on her own.  She spends lots of time at the library of the university where she works.  She meets a vampire totally lacking any personality or interest, but the reader is supposed to care for...what reason?  I'm not sure.  She meets up with demons while she does research at the library, but they don't seem to bother her.  And...I'm exhausted, forget it.  Nobody cares.  NOTHING happens.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I do not typically read books that have so much graphic detail, but do love a good romantic story.  This book did not disappoint.  Once I started reading, I found I could not put the book down reading late into the night.  As soon as I finished this book I had to get the next two to see how the characters ended up.  This book is definitely one that I am keeping in my Kindle library so that I can re-read it again and again.

B008KMHFJY|5.0|***6/5 stars!***<br />Beautiful Disaster is the type of story I've been looking for.<br /><br />Travis Maddox (can his name get any hotter?) is a tattooed sleep-with-'em-and-dump-'em college student and he smokes, drinks, fights. No one hits him unless he decides they do, and no girl is worth seeing the next day.<br /><br />Abby Abernathy is the girl we can relate to when she comes to Eastern College (albeit a different past): likes parties but cares about her studies, is thisclose with her best friend, and is liked without being popular or a loser.<br /><br />Put them together and you have a modern Romeo and Juliet story to please even the toughest of readers.<br /><br />Abby spends a lot of time at the beginning of the novel ensuring Trav gets that she isn't interested in being used and forgotten. Trav? He's mesmerised by Abby. They soon develop an amazing friendship to watch, as the reader.<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster is everything the title suggests.When Abby and Trav are happy it's high and beautiful and sexy but when they're fighting they rock everyone around them, it's controlling and desperate and shocking.<br /><br />I've been reading plenty of romances lately but this one is a standout for so many reasons. One, so many authors try to please the readers by making everything seem right in one way or another and this book isn't that. It's wrong but it's right and oh! so addictive. Jamie McGuire doesn't hold back. For those who know the type of guy who's capable of loving his girl more than life itself will probably have known the controlling nature that goes with that.<br /><br />Well, Beautiful Disaster is life captured in a book.<br /><br />Trav shamelessly doesn't do bad things for reasons like `he has no other choice' and that type of thing. He tells girls when they leave his apartment not to leave their number 'cause he's not gonna bother calling. He'll pummel the sh!t out of a guy if they threaten or lay a hand on someone he cares about. He's each end of the emotional rollercoaster -- both passionate in love and crazy in rage.<br /><br />I won't spoil any more (hopefully this wasn't too spoilerish) but Beautiful Disaster is a dangerous, hot, sexy mess of a love story and my oh my it'll keep you up. I read this novel in a couple of days and, YES, I 100% recommend it.<br />***6/5 stars!***of the emotional rollercoaster -- both passionate in love and crazy in rage.<br /><br />I won't spoil any more (hopefully this wasn't too spoilerish) but Beautiful Disaster is a dangerous, hot, sexy mess of a love story and my oh my it'll keep you up.

B007TNS6JI|4.0|It's a fun game but there is a bit of grinding. Fun with multiplayer so no big deal. Takes a while to upgrade gear. Also I found a way around character being deleted bug. Just create new character of same class and use same character name. I was lvl 1 again but had all my gear so no big deal. No multiplayer until amazon puts newer version on store.

0345803507|5.0|These are great books, but people either seem to love them or hate them.  You really dont understand the story line(yes, there is more than kinky sex) until you finish book three.

B007TNS6JI|3.0|this is a good game, especially when I updated it on my kindle fire because the update was multiplayer, but a few weeks later, it said to update it again but there was no update and I went back to the game and tried playing multiplayer, but it said I needed to update it so I deleted it.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This is a great kids movies.  It's somewhat telling that it is less offensive than most domestic releases and contains little more than children's entertainment without being infused with messages or lessons designed to push a belief system or agenda.

B003Y5H53S|4.0|One day it dawned on them folks at Industrial Light & Magic that the animated film may not be this ephemeral thing after all, may not be so flash in the pan after all. Maybe in the last annual nerd jamboree, the Pixar posse lorded it over ILM. Whatever, whatever. RANGO happens to be ILM's first foray in feature length animation. In 2011 it won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, officially marking it as an auspicious debut. The lording-it-over honors have just shifted.<br /><br />Johnny Depp and director Gore Verbinski reunite, if you care about that. Depp provides the voice of our lead character, a lonely pet chameleon harboring big dreams but whose universe is encompassed in a terranium. It's kind of neat that the chameleon doesn't attain a name until the narrative requires him to come up with one.<br /><br />When a highway accident shatters his terranium and plummets him out of a speeding vehicle, the lizard with no name finds himself trudging across the Mojave desert. Eventually he shuffles into the desperate, ramshackle frontier town of Dirt, and it's at this stage that the film morphs into a western.<br /><br />It's been remarked that RANGO lifts a bit of CHINATOWN's plot trajectory, and there's truth to that. Dirt is a dying town, its populace wilting under an extensive drought and sorely in need of hope. Along comes our lizard, an out-of-towner with a theatrical bent who is facile with words and who, in a moment of jeopardy, assumes the mythic persona of an accomplished gunslinger. In that saloon, he sells his tall tale to those within earshot, convinces them that seven bandidos could be killed with one bullet (providing the seventh hombre expires of the resulting infection).<br /><br />I had to be talked into watching this one. I'd looked at the promotional art and at an image of Rango with his weird, zigzaggy neck and Hawaiian shirt and I extrapolated (wrongfully) that this would be too weird and unconventional for me to absorb. But even though the film renders the characters as occasionally grotesque, the animators devote an underlay of amazing texture to them and to the sets. While the film retains its cartoony elements, it also touts a photorealistic look. The backdrops are stunning and I really enjoyed watching these characters in motion. The animators evoke the sensation of what it's like to thirst in the unforgiving desert. I must've guzzled eight bottles of water, purely out of sympathy, while watching this film.<br /><br />The story itself isn't groundbreaking; it pulls familiar tropes from Old West cinema. The laughs tend to be more hit and miss. But the execution of plot and voice performances and exquisite animation make RANGO a must-see experience. RANGO is a family film in that there's something for both kids and grown-ups. Ned Beatty and Bill Nighy are tremendous as, respectively, the tortoise town mayor and the frightening Rattlesnake Jake (who, admittedly, may prove to be too scary for the younger kids). Timothy Oliphant does a passable impression of the most iconic figure in spaghetti western. But what really sold me on RANGO? It's those damn owl mariachis. When you're ranking cinematic Greek choruses, the owls are right up there with the girl trio from LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS and Jonathan Richman from THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY. And if you're looking for a narrative in which the protagonist is in search of an identity, well, fine, that's here, too.<br /><br />The DVD's bonus stuff:<br /><br />- option to view the film either in theatrical version or extended version<br />- Audio Commentary with director/producer/co-writer Gore Verbinski, head of story James Ward Byrkit, production designer Mark McCreery, animation director Hal Hickel, and visual effects supervisor Tim Alexander<br />- 10 Deleted Scenes, although if you'd watched the extended version, you've seen these already (totals 00:08:52 minutes)<br />- \\"Real Creatures of Dirt\\" - meet the real life desert creatures that RANGO ended upanthropomorphizing (00:22:12  minutes)anthropomorphizing (00:22:12  minutes)

0811879542|3.0|I think this is certainly an interesting/entertaining book for children. And I applaud the author for such an original concept--though it seems much less visionary/compelling when I remind myself that it was published in the iPad era where interactive reading is commonplace. But the reviews (5 stars across the board) are too generous.<br /><br />When I look at a unique book like this, I think not only of what was done well, but of what could have been done better. I feel there were a lot of missed opportunities in this book, and that it could have been improved so much if it had been given to a dozen children and parents for comments/critiques before it was published. With all the hype surrounding this book, I had high hopes...and was disappointed with the actual product.
0374275637|5.0|There are an increasing number of books that provide insight into how our minds work.  Emotional Intelligence by Daniel Coleman and The Wisdom of Crowds by James Surowiecki are two good examples.  Daniel Kahneman, in Thinking Fast and Slow, picks up that theme and advances it by an order of magnitude.  In my view, this is the must read book of the year, and absolutely required read for anyone over fifty.<br />Each of us know that there are parts of our brain that toil away ceaselessly regulating breathing and blood pressure, managing digestion and keeping our heart beating on schedule without us being consciously aware of it.  From other books like Emotional Intelligence, we know that there is also a high-speed circuit that responds to stimulus far faster than conscious thinking.  There are numerous examples.  Touch something hot with your hand and you'll move it before you actually feel the pain.  See someone you know in a busy airport or train station?  Not only will you recognize them instantly, you'll know if they are sad or angry - our brains are hard-wired with high-speed circuits for facial recognition.<br />Mr. Kahneman, through a series of examples, tests, incorporation of original research and reports of research from others, informs us that our autonomous brain does far more, including a lot of things that we should be doing with our conscious thoughtful brain, but we don't.  He uses the term System 1 for the autonomous function and System 2 for our thoughtful, conscious brain.  System 1 is fast, intuitive and emotional.  System 2 is slower, more deliberative and more logical.  Read the book and you'll know that System 1 is doing a lot of stuff.  Most is either critical and performed well, or performed poorly but unimportant, but a certain part is done because of laziness or a concentration failure on our part, and would be much better managed by System 2.<br />The first few chapters are reasonably easy read and full of interesting little quizzes.  You'll probably answer some of those quizzes wrong, and it will be because you let rapid-fire System 1 come up with the answer instead of deliberating with System 2.  One of these tests (I won't give it away) was given to a class at Princeton, conceivably some of the best and brightest in the country, and a majority of them failed, so don't feel too bad if you fail it also.<br />However, I must warn you that the content gets harder.  I'm reasonably literate in at least basic statistics, and I found myself challenged a number of times.  On more than one occasion, I didn't understand the answer even when Kahneman gave it to me.<br />After proving to us that we let System 1 interfere when it shouldn't, Kahneman provides chapters on our various thinking and logic errors and guidance on what to be on guard for to make sure we put System 2 in charge, and we prevent the vast number of thinking shortcuts that lead to suboptimal decisions. There are chapters on how a tired and overloaded brain makes bad decisions.  How we tend to be poor assessors of risk, overly concerned about low probability events and not sufficiently concerned about riskier activities.  This extends into how humans make investment decisions.  I found the chapter on \\"Anchoring\\", that is, how we attach value to a reference number, even if we shouldn't, particularly useful, and very valuable when approaching a negotiation.  There is thoughtful, research-based advice on when to rely on an \\"expert\\" and when not.  Why do I say that this is a must read for anyone over fifty?  Let's face it.  Once we've crossed that line - maybe fifty for some of us, sixty or even seventy for others, we simply don't think as fast.  Do you watch the famous game show Jeopardy?  Generally I can hold my own with many contestants.  I know a lot of the answers.  However, I also know that I can no longer come up with those answers fast enough.  The contestants buzz in way too fast for me.  There is research on the ability of us in our second fifty years to make wise investments.  It turns out that not too many of us are Warren Buffet.  We need to be cautious and thoughtful when putting our money to work.  This book provides very valuable insight into our unconsciously lazy mental habits and equally unconscious thinking errors.

B007URVZJ6|5.0|Amazon has prepared a guide for aspiring authors who are working on a book to publish for Amazon Kindle: Building Your Book for Kindle.  Full disclosure: I'm a recently published Amazon Kindle author (Jobs Over Fifty The Guide to New Employment for the Experienced Worker).<br />Here's the punch line: if you are working on a manuscript, get this book ASAP and read it cover-to-cover. (It is free).  It would have saved me dozens of hours - probably more than a full work week of long days- if I had read it before finishing my book.  Essentially, I had my book written, always intended to publish on Amazon Kindle before I read this book.  Mistake.<br />A first step in publishing on Kindle is conversion of the manuscript into HTML.  Once I converted my document to HTML, many of my margins, indents, underlines, bulleted lists and particularly tables, went wacky when converted from Microsoft Word into HTML.  Reading this book will guide one as to which Word features are likely to be OK in a conversion and which won't.  My best example is the Table of Contents in my book.  I cannot explain what I did wrong with my TOC, but it was consistently screwy in HTML.  Starting with knowledge about the conversion steps required to publish on Kindle will be a labor-saving step.<br />Kindle publishing then goes into a second step in which HTML is converted into Kindle format.  Again, there are tips on that conversion.  Generally I found that if the HTML version was OK, that conversion went more smoothly.<br />There are chapters on \\"Front Matter\\" e.g. title pages, forwards, etc., book cover formats and file sizes, table of contents and instructions on file uploading.<br />I referred to this book continuously while publishing.  If you are a serious HTML code monkey, then you probably don't need this reference book.  For others, I think you'll find it more than very useful: I would call it essential.

B007PVHANM|3.0|Scottish director Kevin MacDonald has created a long-winded biographical documentary in \\"Marley\\", which follows the life of reggae star Bob Marley from his childhood in the country village of Nine Mile, Jamaica until his death from cancer in Miami in 1981 at age 36. We see his youth in Kingston through the eyes of friends and bandmates, his success with The Wailers, his conversion to the Rastafari movement, international success and rifts within the band, their African concerts, and growing popularity in the United States. The roster of people interviewed for this film is enormous, and, in some sense, it is nice to hear these people's perspective, but the 40 or so interview subjects contribute to the film's general lack of focus and limp tone.<br /><br />We get a decent overview of who Bob Marley was, how he came to fame, and the influence he had. But, at nearly 2 ½ hours long, it's almost shocking that we don't get more than that. \\"Marley\\" touches on issues of Marley's driven personality, his music, his family, his politico-religious beliefs, his involvement in Jamaican politics, the evolution of The Wailers and of Marley's career, but it presents a smattering of information on these topics. Nothing ever crystallizes. There is never enough depth to convey an understanding of Marley's relationship with these themes beyond the fact that he did them. Even when addressing a specific event, such as Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer's split from the band in 1974, we get a fuzzy explanation that avoids controversy.<br /><br />Kevin MacDonald seems not to know what he wants to say about Bob Marley. This is surprising, as his fiction films have not lacked focus. Many of the interviews included in the film have no relevance. It could have easily been edited down to 1 hour 45 minutes. I'm sure MacDonald had a huge amount of footage that could have been fashioned into a good film, if only he and the editor had a clear idea of what they were trying to convey. As it is, \\"Marley\\" is a bunch of interviews cobbled together that left me with only a superficial understanding of Bob Marley, his career, and his legacy. I was surprised at the paltry concert footage, as well, as Marley was so dynamic in concert. Marley was a driven, energetic man, but this film is overlong, tedious, and for all the talk, doesn't say much.bunch of interviews cobbled together that left me with only a superficial understanding of Bob Marley, his career, and his legacy.

B007GEMQ2I|5.0|I've become a big Lego fanatic over the past year or so and have now built every modular building offered as a set from Lego (Market Street, Green Grocer, Cafe Corner, Pet Shop, Grand Emporium, Fire Brigade).  They all bring something a bit different and I must say if you are a fan of this modular collection, The Town Hall is a must.  Sitting next to a Green Grocer or Fire Brigade, it's just much bigger and towers imposingly over the others.  The main brick color which is a brownish/orange is also very unique and makes the set very visually interesting.<br /><br />The 2766 pieces make it by far the largest Lego modular building and with it comes a larger retail price tag of $199!  Trust me, it's worth it.  Many Lego sets are now coming in with a piece/Cent ratio of 10 Cents per or more and this one at well below that still seems like a great deal, especially since many are large bricks and you get 8 interesting minifies.  The build itself is not in the least bit complex so any experienced Lego builder or one with even just some experience could probably build this-just make sure you sort the pieces well within each bag number to help you go faster!<br /><br />I must confess that I actually own 3 of these.  With the second one, I used the two middle floors to make my Town Hall HUGE and then interestingly the base level and roof become a Church!  Picture it in your mind and indeed it looks cool.  The third one I actually built a custom consulate to put next to it from instructions I found on eBay.  So, to say I am all in with this set is an understatement.  If you already have module buildings, this one is a must and if you are looking for a place to start, dig in right here.  Yes, $199 is a lot of money, but it's right in line with all of the other Lego sets of this piece count nowadays and actually one of the better deals.<br /><br />One last thing, the working elevator is pretty cool and unique so something fun for kids.  As with all Lego Modulars, there is very little \\"Furnishing\\" on the inside (although there is some), so it leaves something else you could do for little cost with your spare parts.ttle \\"Furnishing\\" on the inside (although there is some), so it leaves something else you could do for little cost with your spare parts.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|After hearing about the 50 shades of Grey from nuemerous women I know I always laughed at the thought of reading this book seeing as i am really not into reading erotic books, However, I work in a hair salon and kept seeing various women coming in with this book ages ranging from about 22-62, and i must admit that after seeing that 62 year old woman reading this book my attention spiked. About a week later the book was on my local news channel and i had had enough!! I bought this book because I just had to see what all this hype was about!! After starting to read this book i found that i could not put it down! It does have alot of sex scenes but it also does have a point!! (which is somthing that i didnt expect). I am now halfway through the second book (after only starting the first book about 5 days ago) and I cant wait to see where the story is heading, reading the change in raltionship between Christian and Ana is a beautiful story and I am eager to keep reading. So I would definitly recommend buying this book... If you are apprehensive like I was because of all the sex, rest assured that you will not be disappointed because other than a few graphic sex scenes which are pretty hot i might add, the book has much, much more to offer..

It is a treasure for anyone serious about understanding ones own mind and then how life evolves from the guidance of ones subconscious mind. Highly, highly recommend it!

B008OM0M4U|1.0|As an international affairs junkie, I was hoping for a little levity and a lot of laughter with this film. This DICTATOR like all dictators was a total failure. I love Bruno and Borat and Ali G, but simply The DICTATOR and Baron Cohen was a real disappointment and a total waste of time. My wife began reading her Kindle half way into the film, and I powered through hoping for a laugh...it did not happen. The idea of the movie is more funny than the actually movie. SBC really lost his edge on this one.

0062206281|4.0|\\"For Fermín Romero de Torres, who came back from among the dead and holds the key to the future.\\"<br /><br />Another outstanding Gothic thriller that follows the prior two great books in this series; Shadow of the Wind and The Angel's Game. This book delves into the life of Fermin Romero de Torres as his life intertwines with the lives of the protaganists of the two earlier novels, Daniel Sempere and David Martin.<br /><br />The novel is at once full of despair and unyeilding hope. Fermin who is imprisoned for his politics in Spain finds his life changed by meeting David Martin, who he considered the most important writer of his time. Martin is also a prisoner and to say much more is to give too much of the story away. Fermin escapes with Martin's help and in promising to protect a friend of Martin's comes into the life of younng Daniel Sempere.<br /><br />The novel moves fromt he present back to the past with ease and the beautiful prose of Zafon breathes life into these tales of despair. An excellant and moving read.<br /><br />The Prisoner of Heaven continues the tales of the Cemetary of Lost Books without giving away the stories of the two prior novels.<br /><br />An excellant opportunity to introduce the reader to Carlos Ruiz Zafon.

B004EPYZQ2|5.0|I have watched probably 30 movies in the past month or so, and this is the first one that has made me want to review it. There is so much junk these days, so many bad stories, repetitious stories, so much bad acting (mostly bad directing), coming of age movies, or deadly B-rated shark attack movies (the new and \\"improved\\" syfy channel batters us with some of the worst movies, my husband and I watch them because it's actually entertaining making fun of them), paranormal movies that not only do not scare me, but make me cringe they are so terrible (why does the woman ALWAYS scream????), movies where the theme is about dying, but the character either meets the love of their lives or becomes some sort of hero, movies about today's new and improved families (usually pushing one or several of today's interpretation of family and how wonderful they are - I call them preachy movies), lame love stories that usually make me wish I had those 90 minutes of my life back at the end, or so-called comedies, filled with so many bathroom references, it just stops being funny. I've recently been complaining that there aren't enough of the wonderful big movies like Gladiator, Terminator, Independence Day, Silence of the Lambs, Braveheart, or any Alien movie or Underworld type movies these days. Batman, Spiderman or any of the comics superheroes seem to be the only ones being produced. (Exception being the Hunger Games movies which are exceptional!)<br /><br />Today, as I was perusing my sad selection of Netflix movies, I noticed this one (Super 8) made by JJ Abrams and produced by Steven Spielburg. I read the blurb about six kids making a movie and catching something supernatural with their Super 8 camera. There are two genres - there is supernatural, and there is sci fi. Sometimes the two intertwine, but honestly, this one fits neatly into the sci fi genre. SPOILER ALERT: you might not actually know that until about 3/4 of the way through the movie, however. So, I almost passed it up, having had my fill of the many, many supernatural movies available these days (most of them pretty bad). But JJ Abrams? I took a chance because for the most part, he is one of today's brightest stars in sci fi genre TV shows and movies.<br /><br />WOW! Maybe because my expectations were so low, I actually loved this movie. It's been a while since I have loved watching a movie like this one. The story centers around six middle school age kids, Joe, Cary, Preston, Charles, Martin and Alice, who want to enter a contest with their movie. They borrow Charles' parents' Super 8 movie camera, as the movie is shot in 1979, just before the DVD movie cameras burst onto the scene. The interaction between these six kids is simply amazing to watch. Instead of being snotty, or over-the-top nerdy, they are played as real kids who, before the age of Nintendo and computer games, still have to amuse themselves with either sports or in this case, the arts. Watching these six together, as they meet after dark at an old-looking train station on the edge of their all-American town, I was drawn in as they set up their scene between Martin and a reluctant Alice. Martin is all geeked out in a suit and old-fashioned looking hat, and Alice just stands there in jeans and a t-shirt waiting to begin. Looking back, somehow, I have to imagine a very young Abrams maybe taking a scene out of his own childhood. These kids are really ready - they have scripts, and they know the on-set jargon, they have a make-up kit, and a nice looking tripod for the camera, we even find out that Charles, as director, has a good set of ear phones. This first scene is practice - and as Martin begins his lines, we watch the absolutely wonderful Elle Fanning as Alice come to life playing a young woman trying to convince her husband (or boyfriend) to stay with her and not leave. It was almost literally the opening of the movie and I was already completely pulled into the story.<br /><br />As they set up for the first \\"take\\" of the movie and begin filming, Charles sees a real train coming down the track and yells \\"PRODUCTION VALUE,\\" for the first of several times as he sees (and I'm thinking now, DEFINITELY a blast from Abram's past) a chance for some real cool background (the scene set to the train screaming by). They quickly get all set up and start filming the scene for real. The actual star of the movie (Super 8) is Joe, played very well by a relative newcomer named Joel Courtney (a young actor to watch). As the other five kids are involved in the filming, Joe looks backward for a moment down the track and watches as a truck rolls onto the track and aims straight for the train. He alerts the other five and they watch in horror as the inevitable collision draws near.<br /><br />The ensuing crash was a bit over-the-top spectacular (seriously, I doubt a smallish old truck like that could create the mayhem that followed), but I'm already hooked and loving this moving so I suspend my critical eye right now and watch the spectacle with heart-stopping excitement. Every car on this longish train smashes up in the air, over the little train station, spilling tons of explosions and debris everywhere. We lose Alice as the boys scramble for safety, but in the end, (again suspending reality a bit) all six kids are OK. What they don't realize, but we are privy to see is that the camera rolled, on its side, throughout most of the collision and fireworks. As the kids regroup, slapping each other on the back at not only seeing the spectacle, but living through it, the nefarious military vehicles roll up, causing them to grab their stuff and run.<br /><br />At this point, I'm in! The rest of the movie is a wonderful mix of great action and moments of sweet contemplation, these kids really deserve high praise for their performances (or probably JJ Abrams can get a great performance out of an orange, not sure, and yes, I am a huge fan of his). The story continues to be strong as the secrets are discovered by the children, and eventually the fathers of Joe and Alice (the always wonderful Kyle Chandler and Ron Eldard both of whom are among two of today's best but seriously under appreciated actors) who both end up helping them, thus removing the normal - parents are bad, kids know everything theme I see so much these days. I read a review where someone criticized too many longing looks and too much boring dialogue, but I say, if you play too many games or watch too many violent movies, you probably won't like the sweet moments between Joe and Alice, obviously both harboring crushes on each other, or Charles and Joe (as they are watching the movie it took two days to get developed, the scenes taken when the camera was on its side and continued to capture the train wreck), as they quibble over both of them liking Alice.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT: The end is a bit of a twist, although if you read my caption above, you might have an idea about what happens, but I loved it. I have to add here that the bad language used by the children was a bit unnecessary here and there, and I am a full-out supporter of the military and I'm afraid this movie plays into the X-Files (which I love) military is bad conspiracies and I admit to wishing it could have been an evil corporation as the protagonist instead of our heroes who a lot of people have no idea how much they give up and how hard they work to keep us safe and free (and I admit to being retired military), but I am not one to throw out the baby with the bath water. Despite these fairly minor annoyances of mine, I still gave it five stars. And trust me, had it been anything less than excellent in every way, I would downgrade it one star for the tired old evil military so many Hollywood producers cast as the bad guys these days. JJ, do me a favor, do our military a favor, too? Make one like this again - but make a pharmaceutical company the bad guy. They actually kind of deserve it. JMHO.<br /><br />Despite that, I am just sohappy to finally be able to recommend a good sci fi movie to my friends! It's been a long, dry period for those of us who love the genre. If you want a really good movie with some great scary parts, big explosions, sweetness of youth, and parents who love, a very winning mix, and no preaching at you or watching sad death scenes or constant dumb bathroom talk, watch this movie.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I admit it. I have no great desire to see movies, or read books about cancer. I avoid them like... well, cancer. However, the buzz surrounding this book was enough to overcome my squeamishness, and what I found was unexpected.  The first surprise is this isn't a cancer book. I mean, it is... but not really. Yes, the dark veil of cancer hangs over every page, but John Green doesn't make it the star of the book. The real stars, faults and all, are Gus and Hazel, who simply refuse to let their sicknesses rule or define them. They demonstrate the kind of strength it takes to get up every time you're knocked off your feet. The story is bittersweet, funny, tragic, poignant, and so much more. It had me laughing on one page, and crying on the next. I was blindsided by it's beauty.<br /><br />Now, if you decide to read The Fault in Our Stars I have a few important tips:<br /><br />1. No matter how cynical you think you are, keep a box of tissues handy. Only the soulless could be unmoved by this novel.<br /><br />2. Read this where you can have some privacy, unless you are okay with suddenly sobbing and then laughing out loud in public.<br /><br />3. Most importantly -- be open to the lessons this book has to teach, and be open to the emotions it will cause you to feel. It was, for me, a cathartic experience.
B0084IG8TM|2.0|In one respect, the film (and book) represents a fresh variation of the post-apocalyptic genre that's saturated the industry over the past decade or so.  However, the dreadfully lethargic flow of the plot, predictable/cliche characters, costumes more reminescent of 1970s sci-fi flicks than futuristic, and the force-fed (but not quite lusty) infusion of troubled teen/puppy love dilemma overshadow the survival aspects of the plot so thoroughly that much is left to be wanted.  In my humble opinion, at least 20-30 minutes of the first hour of the film could (should) have easily and beneficially been left on the cutting-room floor.  Other gripes:  The CGI killer dogs were among the most unrealistic \\"digital dogs\\" I've seen in post-2000 films.  Lastly, the film was peppered with so many cliche, normalized, and stereotypical character shells, circumstances, and conflicts/solutions that the film squanders the potential to create a lasting or profound impression on the film-goer; and while that does not likely negatively impact the film's profit-generating potential in a substantial manner, it does contribute to the film's eventual relegation into the ho-hum (yawn...) category of the post-apocalyptic genre that seems to be the default background setting of contemporary epics.

1439156816|5.0|Two years ago I was hit by a car while walking across the street, in a very random accident that left an imprint on my life that lingers to this day.  At the time of my accident I was a graduate student in biology who dabbled in writing.  Someone mentioned to me that Steven King had been in a similar accident and that he had written about the experience in his memoir \\"On Writing\\".  I was at a juncture where my interest in writing had blossomed into a need to write.  As King wrote about his own accident and the writing of this book - \\"Writing is not life but sometimes it can be a way back to life.\\"  It was in this spirit that I bought this book and it was in this spirit that I began to apply myself to the craft of writing.<br /><br />This book offers a very keen, very insightful look into both the making of a writer, as well as the mechanics of a writing life.  In true Steven King fashion, he does not blunt his advice, temper his observations, or romanticize the life of a writer.  I have read books on writing before, none of which seem to capture the day-to-day realities of writing in the way that King has managed.  His observations on life - from being a kid who wiped his ass with poison ivy to being hit by a person that seemed to be a character straight out of one of his own stories - are all rendered in a very sharp and concise prose.<br /><br />This is not a how-to manual on how to write but rather a glimpse into the formation of the person that brought us \\"The Green Mile\\" and the Dark Tower Series.  King cuts through all of the mystic nonsense surrounding writing and offers a pragmatic view of what a writing life is really like.  He exhibits both a love for the craft of writing as well as a realistic perspective on the struggles that all writers face.

B0040T7CFS|5.0|If you want a complete set of Bach there is really only one alternative to this set and that is Helmuth Rilling's Complete Works of J. S. Bach. That set is well-recorded with excellent musicians and soloists--but it is performed on modern instruments with large choruses. I was looking for Bach on period instruments with small choruses--just what this set offers. (If you are looking for the former get the Rilling set.)<br /><br />  I put off buying this set for the longest time because I was concerned about the quality of the performances (from other reviews I'd read). All for naught! I have by now listened to about 2/3ds of the 157 CDs. I'd say 98% are good to excellent with the vast majority being very good.<br /><br />  Specifically, the 17 CDs of organ works (performed by Hans Fabius) are marvelous, as are most of the keyboard works (all performed on the harpsichord) and many of the orchestral and chamber music works. What really surprised me was how good the 60 CDs of religious Cantatas are! The soloists are first-rate, the Netherlands Bach Collegium quite good and very-well rehearsed. And then there are the Masses and secular Cantatas, again very well done.<br /><br />  I'd give this collection 6 stars if I could. Heck, 7 or even 8 (it's Bach, after all!). This is certainly the best purchase I've made on Amazon.<br /><br />  There are other Bach disks I'll want to purchase, and I may even spring for the Rilling set one day, but for now I couldn't be happier.

B000024KRO|4.0|This is a classic Deep Purple album. \\"Sometimes I Feel Like Screaming\\" is a must for Deep Purple fans. The melodic acoustic introduction and the subsequent screaming rock guitar solos are Steve Morse at his best. Ian Gillan's vocal is as good as ever. The album is a must for Deep Purple fans.
B006T3RM08|5.0|I've been using my Clique for about a week now and have had no problems. I'm using the latest Apple Wireless Keyboard and Trackpad. The Clique worked right out of the box like advertised. Seating the keyboard and trackpad was smooth and trouble-free. No adjustment needed. (It looks like they've worked out whatever seating issue was causing the trackpad click problem). The plastic is firm and has a nice solid feel. Power buttons on the back and side (for keyboard and trackpad) work perfectly. Great for using at my computer desk as well as on the couch with my Mac Mini home theater setup. I highly recommend that you give the Clique a try. I hear that they're making a left-handed version as well (a friend of mine is impatiently waiting for it... poor lefty, hehe.) I will update this review if I have any trouble, but for now 5 stars!
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I have always been a SNL and 30 Rock fan so when a friend told me about Tina Fey's book I rushed to get it.  I was not disappointed.  This is no glamour girl story, this could have been anyone - her<br /> growing up years were typical and, because of that, absolutely hysterical.  Never knew she spent so much time in Chicago...I could have sat next to her on the \\"L\\"!  A \\"must read\\" for anyone at risk of having \\"tears\\" run down their legs!

B007B6VOG0|5.0|One word to describe this album: \\"WOW\\". A lot of people does not know this album, which is sad, this album should get more attention. A lot of you might know and like the song \\"We Are Young\\" , which came from this album,  it's actually not the best song from the album. \\"Young\\" will just fall around the top 5, which means there are a lot of great songs from the album which you will love!
B002FOQY2M|5.0|I just Love this CD! All the songs are really good songs that I dont mind listening to over and over again.

B005LAIGPU|4.0|Yes, it IS a found footage movie. If this offends you to the point of giving the movie a bad review without even considering its other merits, please stop reviewing movies on amazon.<br /><br />-ahem-<br /><br />I'm not going to go on about the plot because the page description pretty much gives the right impression. What I am going to say is that Chronicle is a standout superhero movie that while most likely not setting new standards, will show how to make a simple story intriguing once again. The story revolves around corruption through power, and it commits to it. While other movies like Star Wars Episode 3 will take this premise and throw it in the trash by making the main character unlikable and corrupted from the start, the main character here starts in a position where it only makes sense that he snaps with power but he is still understandably meek at the beginning.<br /><br />Now, back to the found footage. I have to say, I don't know why Director Josh Trank decided to make this a found footage movie. Every once in a while, the movie uses it in a clever or stylistic way, but for the most part it's just treated as something to film regular events with. There really is absolutely no reason that this couldn't be a traditionally shot movie. Many scenes are given a hackneyed reason to have a camera filming everything, and ultimately it just gets in the way of the story; but not in a way that could ruin it. Also, for a found footage movie, most of the action was pretty smooth and didn't contain the \\"OMG SHAKY CAMZ EVERYWHERE\\" effect that usually gets shoved into these things, so anyone comparing this to say, Cloverfield, are just making up things to critique.<br /><br />Overall, 8/10. I would definitely recommend as a casual movie night flick, and I would also consider it an example of modern storytelling to make a old story new again.

B005QUQRE2|5.0|brit marling is like a dream, and the movie is more like her beautiful but disturbed interruption upon wake:  we, the viewers are watching her story unfold.  this isn't like an ordinary 'movie', set so differently from real life, or that the actors are separated from their trailers and coffee breaks, to the players and costumes they portray.  this is like watching a woman, behind a raspberry bush, following her as she walks through life, brilliant, suffocated, ashamed, gracious.  she's the most beautiful, kind-hearted, warm-intentioned 'criminal' i've ever watched upon the screen - and thus the most realistic.  i've rarely been able to hold a piece of the actor's heart, and intentions, into my own personal life - i've, sure, been able to escape into brad pitt's biceps in 'fight club', been thrown off guard by keira's rosy cheeks and beauty in 'atonement', wished my life could be as dangerous and wonderful as the scoundrels in gregg araki's films, but i've rarely felt as approachable to those characters.  if i saw them in real life, i would most likely feel fat, ugly, unhip, unmodelesque, un-actory.  brit is someone i Want to meet, be friends with, look at, despite her looks or actions.  she isn't even acting, in a sense.  she's connecting with another persona, but using her words, glimpses, thoughts, like she would as if making a present for her mum, presenting a graduation speech, listening to a friend as she reaches out in tears... she's all about connecting, and honesty.  she's just like you and i - if we could care less about weight, or impressing our parents - deciding to be in a film and use a new kind of media for discovering about the poetry of life, science, space, people, pain... It's one of those films that will be overlooked, turned down, judged voraciously, but only because it isn't immediate, but it is also the most captivating piece i have watched in a long time.  it wasn't uncomfortable, cliche, frustrating, nor depressing for me.  it was inspiring to see her struggle, heart breaking to know i could be in that same situation and learn the same road - lose my friends, want to die, feel honestly dis-tached from family, and take haven in others stories rather than my own.  it was breath taking to see so many metaphors and music put together - the cello playing every time brit entered the scene, tumbling on rocks, or the piano and cello chaotically together when she made love with the other.  or the way the first human she saw after being set free... was a man in an alien costume. the irony.  or how the astrophysicist chose to speak to the alternate Her from planet 2, asking about Astro Strawberries and when she was 7, instead of the terrified or panicked beacons that governmental employees are known to embark, when speaking to extraterrestrial forms. it's also infuriating how this got a 64 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and that the general public found it dull, repetitive, and over-dramaticized, where i found it fresh, completely realistic, and clenching.<br /><br />the kind of movie where blowing your nose or taking off your shoe - a three second act that removes you from the screen - was enough to make me rewind, and capture those seconds lost.  the kind where after watching, i told everyone i knew in proximity - all of my roommates and my friend that day later, to 'watch this movie, no matter what'.  the kind that isn't even a movie, really, but a piece that i was fortunate enough to see, that didn't use gimmicks or flash to attract me, and is what movies should Aspire to be.<br /><br />it's also one that will be a classic, cult or general, in years to come.  the kind that isn't favored by the public or critics initially, but is well-traveled down the road, for being something new, broad, sweeping, and challenging.  the kind where you Want to be in the main character's shoes, be gawked at by the same brother, make love to the same man, throw up elegantly on the same train toilet, stare at the same flock ofbirds, and tuck the same lock of hair behind the ear, but don't want to, because only she can be as beautiful and honest, as herself.<br /><br />please give this another thought.  at least appreciate it for it's power to invoke a primal emotion, rather than immediate excitement and then forgetfulness.

1451696205|4.0|I give this book 3.5 stars because I have mixed feelings about it.<br /><br />The main character is Charlie, a naive boy who is constantly sad, being incapable to feel any emotion besides sadness. He is also constantly crying, for severel times a day, sometimes in public, in front of other people, for random, sometimes stupid reasons. He acts like a ten-year-old, but in fact he's 16. I had to remind that to myself for severel times while reading the book, because I kept imagining Charlie being so much younger than he was. He doesn't really understand the world around him, he doesn't have any social skills, but he manages to become friends with two seniors, Sam and Patrick, who \\"open\\" the world for him (first dates, sex, parties, drugs). He has a trauma that is revealed in the end of the book, but that still didn't make me understand why Charlie was the way he was.<br /><br />I like that the book is written in letter form, letters that Charlie addresses to an un-named friend (this friend is no one in particular, it's just a symbol for the readers). Also, there are a lot of beautiful quotes in this book.
B008JH5CVS|1.0|This movie is very bad. Not worth the time let alone the money to rent it. If you are looking for a good science fiction action movie look elsewhere.
0142419400|3.0|I went into this book with very high expectations because many people were praising it and I must say that it sort of disappointed me. I didn't hate it but I wish I could have liked Anna and the French Kiss more than I did.<br /><br />There were so many moments in which I felt like throwing the book against the wall. 3-4 pages in the book and Anna-the main character- falls in love with literally the first boy she encounters in Paris, Etienne St. Clair- French name, English accent, American school, the hottest guy in school,maybe in the whole city- and of course he has to fall in love with her, even though he already has a girlfriend.<br /><br />My biggest problem with this book was that I didn't like Anna or Etienne. She annoyed me from the very beginning. Anna is constantly complaing. Firstly, she's angry for being sent to Paris then,when she goes home for the Christmas vacation, she starts complaining about America...like she is suddenly too good for it, because, you know, she is a true Parisian right now. Anna is hypocritical, she tends to judge everyone else and she's very selfish, making almost every situation about herself. Etienne: I have mixed feelings about him. I mean, he cheats on his girlfriend and he is afraid of breaking up with her, but take Anna out of the picture and I might have liked him.<br /><br />All in all, this book just didn't live up to my expectations.
B004EAQNO4|5.0|This movie was very well written, directed and acted. Some jump scenes, creepy moments and lots of suspense/tension! Not for those under 16. Good opportunities for discussions and debates about faith and humanity, good vs. evil.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Enjoyed this book, but did find it difficulty to start given the complexity of the various characters.  I felt it started a bit slow and slowly gathered steam. Would recommend to any fantasy fans, particularly fans of Robert Jordan.  I am planning on checking out the TV series at some point too.
B007Q0K9TE|3.0|I am a huge Andre Rieu. I've attended his concerts in the US and own every VHS tape and DVD he's ever made for the US and around the world, but this DVD was a disappointment. The medium and close up shots were, as usual, excellent, but the wide shots look like they were shot in SD. They look horrible on a big screen. Also, NO EXTRA FEATURES. When you pay top dollar for a Andre Rieu DVD, you expect some bonus material. Not this time.<br /><br />The editing was second rate. Many times, the cutaway shots didn't match the action on the stage.<br /><br />The DVD just looked thrown together. Not a pro job at all.<br /><br />I'll be very careful about buying the next DVD.

0446573027|5.0|I saw some reviews where people said another author did the same thing better and Mr. Baldacci copied him. I never read the other author and could care less. I found this story a page turner and spent some serious time reading it.<br /><br />As a writer myself, I must admit I'd be daunted by the meticulous detail and research he did to bring the hero to life. I noticed at the end of the book that his thank you list was quite extensive.<br /><br />As for the story, having roots on my wife's side in West Virginia, I could relate somewhat to the setting, though her part of the state isn't the wasteland depicted in the story. However, it was still nice to see the state mentioned even though it was kind of negative.<br /><br />The plot had plenty of twists and turns and it didn't go where I expected it to, though I suppose there were plenty of hints from the beginning. I just don't try to jump too far ahead and spoil things or try to out-think the author. I let him (or her) surprise me (most of the time). In this case, it worked well enough for me and I was happy except for one part of the outcome which I didn't like. Oh well, I guess I can't have everything. I almost gave it four stars because of that outcome, but at least he handled it well.<br /><br />The writing is crisp and in solid third person. He keeps the point of view solid and doesn't head hop. The narrative is brisk and never overbearing. He doesn't rant or wander off into endless details. The story moves and makes you want to turn the page. Can't ask for more.<br /><br />I look forward to reading more of his books. This being the second one I've read by him, I'm finding him quite good and highly recommend it, despite what some other people are saying.

B0085A9HXS|5.0|I first heard of The Raid: Redemption less than a week ago.  The reviews seemed to be almost all 4-5 stars and the hype was that this was the Action Movie of the Year!  As an action junkie for many years now (my all time favorite movie is \\"Die Hard\\") I soon became obsessed with the idea of this movie and I just had to see it.  I watched several preview clips on YouTube and I was more than ready to check it out.  Luck would have it we dropped by Best Buy on Saturday and I quickly picked up the Blu ray version.<br /><br />Well, \\"they\\" were not kidding!  This is a kick butt film for sure.  I disagree with some reviews that say this movie does not have a plot.  Tons of action for sure, but there is a story behind it all.  I just heard that there are plans for a sequel and even an American version of this film.  I just hope the American verison can come close to the action elements and plot developments of this action classic.  Maybe they can do as good a job as the American version of The Departed.  I certainly plan to watch this movie several times.<br /><br />The action is brutal, loud, intense, real, relentless, and FAST! But it all fits into the story.  Great lead actor (Iko) and a darn good (make that very good) bad guy henchman called Mad Dog (who also set up all the fight scenes.  Small, but deadly).  I am going to go out and look for other movies by writer/director Gareth Evans and star Iko.  The Special Features are very good as well. I watched the director talk for about 40 minutes on how he put it all together.  And just now a 5-min claymation video called \\"Claycat's The Raid\\".  I think The Raid: Redemption has all the earmarks of being a cult classic.  Best quote (from the Big Drug Lord to all his gangs): \\"Now get to work, and please, enjoy yourself.\\"

B007IXWKUK|1.0|Sucked so hard I'm not going to read the third one.<br /><br />Like most people who read this garbage I was interested in seeing what all the hub was abub. Well, let me tell you, this is by far the worst, most poorly thought out piece of drivel I have ever had the unfortunate urge to read. I figured out on my own that this whole series was actually a fanfic of Twilight, because instead of things coming to their conclusion normally (as they did in Twilight) this book smooshes all the events into a few days and then takes events that took at least a year to happen in Twilight, and forces them into existence unnaturally -- ultimately destroying the plot of the book.<br /><br />((Spoiler alert: Read no farther if you still intend to read this ...\\"book.\\"))<br /><br />I stopped reading this second installment of \\"How hard can we suck,\\" just as the male lead muttered the words everyone who's been dating someone for all of two weeks and nearly been killed several times while being constantly stalked along the way longs to hear. \\"Marry me.\\"<br /><br />I can honestly say that I wish I would have bought the book instead of the kindle version of this piece of... \\"literature,\\" because then I could have gained at least a little satisfaction from burning it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|My Kindle Fire Weather Channel app is good but when the Weather Channel website was offline I needed to know the weather fast. I remembered this AccuWeather app from the local news so I downloaded from Amazon's App store. Functionally, its as good as the Kindle Fire weather app. Organizationally, its easier to find information using the AccuWeather app. So I'm keeping them both and should always have a place to find accurate weather info.

B001JIHGO0|4.0|I personally really enjoyed the move i thought the whole concept was cool and they put a great spin on Dracula who really makes the move- he has the charm worthy of three brides that you would expect from a guy whos been around a few hundred years. the girl's Transylvanian accent makes you want to kill yourself during the whole movie and youll wish that she were eaten by something in the movie, and the movie gets a little far fetched and tacked-on in the crumbling castle scene, but if you take it for what its worth- a cool twist on a monster movie- i thought it had a lot of fun and interesting elements. i wouldnt be looking for the greatest acting - its bubblegum for the mind, cool sets and wardrobes, neat props and some cool Special effects. I thought that the whole explanation of why dracula cant see his reflection in a mirror alone was worth seeing the movie for.

B005FISBTO|2.0|My husband and I are both huge fans of Dexter.  We pre-ordered the DVDs for this season as soon as we were able.<br /><br />Unfortunately, we were not able to enjoy this season.  When you insert each of the 4 DVDs in this box set, you are forced to watch a 2 minute ad for Showtime.  You are not able to skip the ad on any of the DVDs, and are forced to sit through it as it displays a number of Showtime shows.  It even includes an ad for the sixth season of Dexter...<br /><br />The ad for Dexter is only about 6 seconds long.  Interestingly, the marketing team at Showtime thought it would be nice to show THE LAST SIX SECONDS OF THE SEASON YOU'RE ABOUT TO WATCH!  It ruined the entire season before we even got a chance to watch it.  I have sent a letter to Showtime iterating this blatant oversight.  I will update this review if/when I receive a response from them.<br /><br />Update 9/2:<br />I received a response from Showtime.  They thanked me for informing them of the error, but did not apologize.  They then said that Showtime is not responsible for DVDs, and that I should contact Paramount.  They did not provide contact information.<br /><br />I found a contact for customer relations at Paramount, and sent an email to them.  I didn't hear anything for a few days, so I emailed them again.  At this point, they forwarded my email to the VP of legal and customer relations.<br /><br />He responded immediately and asked for a good time to have a conversation over the phone.  He was very apologetic about the situation.  He informed me that Paramount is not in fact responsible for the content of the DVDs, and that they just manufacture them.  The actual content, including the promotions, are provided to them by Showtime.  So it was incorrect of Showtime to forward my comments to Paramount.  He said that he couldn't offer me a refund, but said if I wanted to pick another Showtime or Paramount TV show, he would be happy to send me a complementary season on DVD.  Within a few days, I received a copy of the latest season of CSI on DVD.<br /><br />While speaking on the phone, he also mentioned that Showtime has been, and is still showing the offending promotion in other places beside the DVDs.  Apparently it's been showing for several months.  He mentioned that now that there have been so many complaints, they're trying to pull it from circulation.  He said that there has also been talk of a second run of the DVDs without the promotional material, but that they have not received the content from Showtime yet.<br /><br />Overall, I'm extremely disappointed in Showtime's obvious attempt to pass the buck.  After ruining the show for countless fans, they not only refuse to apologize, but they refuse to even take responsibility for this whole fiasco.  On the other hand, I'm very impressed with Paramount's response to the situation.  Despite not being directly responsible for the content of the DVDs, I am happy that they apologized, and did what they could to make amends.  As a result, I'm adding one star to the review.ys, I received a copy of the latest season of CSI on DVD.<br /><br />While speaking on the phone, he also mentioned that Showtime has been, and is still showing the offending promotion in other places beside the DVDs.

0143034901|4.0|The best summary of my reactions I can come up with: if a Korean suspense drama was sprinkled with Gothic elements and turned into a Spanish novel,  The Shadow of the Wind would be it. There's a scandalously complex plot with characters that intersect with one another and a few plot twists thrown in for good measure. I went into this novel with high expectations, everyone seemed to proclaim it's greatness. I wanted to start the series so that I could read its lauded third installment that just released without being lost: The Prisoner of Heaven. However, despite being entranced in the delightfully complex mystery and the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, I can't bring myself to wholeheartedly recommend it. Partly because its pacing is too slow for my liking in the first third, some characters falling flat, and the denouement disappointing.<br /><br />I'd Never Guess it was a Translation:<br />I am usually hesitant to read translations, fearing that a beautiful literary masterpiece will be skinned bare of its artistic elements into a stoic, mundane read. I'm glad The Shadow of the Wind didn't join that party. I'm not sure how much was lost in translation--unfortunately, my Spanish comprehension ends at &iquest;C&oacute;mo est&aacute;s? and I still haven't figured out how to roll my r's--but I could've been easily fooled that this was the original. Props to Lucia Graves!<br /><br />Story, Bring Me Back To The Cemetery Already!:<br />From the start of the novel, we are introduced to the mysterious Cemetery of Forgotten Books. It's any book lovers paradise, a maze comprised of old books, giving us hope that unknown masterpieces can transcend the test of time and culture. The Cemetery and the mysterious Carax novel were the most beautiful, enchanting elements of the novel, yet almost as soon as it was introduced, I had to leave it to deal with 13-year old Daniel and his infatuation with a blind girl a decade older than he. I found myself wishing Julian Carax's books really existed so I could read his masterpieces for myself. I suppose even if his novels did exist, they wouldn't be found on Amazon.<br /><br />Characters:<br />I loved each character, even the minor characters aided the story in unexpected ways. I found each character special and I proudly say that there were no instances of me struggling to remember who was who.<br /><br />Daniel, The Protagonist:<br />I really wanted to like Daniel, but it just didn't happen. He is good-hearted, but I found him too impulsive. I winced when I read through his first love with a blind girl ten years his senior. I knew it was a nightmare waiting to happen. For a protagonist, Daniel faded in the background. I found everyone else much more compelling than Daniel. Even if the novel was in his perspective, I still don't know anything about him other than he makes horrible romantic choices.<br /><br />Fermin:<br />The idea of being best friends with someone decades older strikes me as odd, but whatever, Fermin is just that perfect friend. My favorite character.<br /><br />Fulmero, The Villain:<br />I expected more back story from him. It seems like he was just evil because he had severe mental problems or something. Oh yes, and his unrequited love problem which made him bitter at everyone else. A guy that killed his own mother (even if she was a selfish, shallow woman)? Now that's spine-chillingly scary.<br /><br />Romance:<br />\\"That was random.\\" pretty much sums up my reaction towards Daniel's romance. I still don't know what Daniel sees in girls beyond a pretty face. Everyone else had a better love story than the protagonist.<br /><br />Gothic Elements:<br />The haunted house gave me the chills. I wanted to yank Daniel out of that house. Pretty horrible place for a date if you ask me. There were also these eerie, divine dreams that some of the characters had. Oh yes, and of course, the Devil also plays a role.<br /><br />Denouement, Is This Lady a Stalker?:<br />I am disappointed that the mystery boiled down to a hundred page info-dump letter to wrap up all the loose ends instead of having Daniel solve something. I don't know how this lady knew all this stuff in such great detail to recall all the dialogue with such precision despite not even being present in most of the events. I wonder if her version of the events are trustworthy for much of was secondhand information (or should be, maybe she is a skilled stalker.) I thought she wrote the letter in a hurry in anticipation of her impending death, but if she could write a letter that spanned a third of the novel I doubt she was in a big hurry. If she had such amazing foresight, I hope she kept cyanide by her side to make her death as painless as possible.<br />I enjoyed the complex plot and finding out how all the loose ends joined together, it's the delivery that disappointed. We ran around for two thirds of the novel gathering clues only to find out we could have just lounged on a sofa and waited for this letter to solve everything.<br /><br />Plot Twists:<br />I wasn't surprised (I probably typed this review just so I can boast my psychic abilities.) Maybe I watch too many Korean dramas to prepare me for these \\"scandalous\\" plot twists.<br /><br />I wonder what the next installment will be about. I am hesitant to read it since I thought the ending tied up the story so well that I wouldn't want a lackluster sequel to ruin it. It's one of those books that I liked, but still feel the story would suffice as a standalone.a hundred page info-dump letter to wrap up all the loose ends instead of having Daniel solve something.

0545265355|5.0|From the first chapter, Collin's writing has you compelled to continue reading.  Once you begin, your brain is in constant \\"Hunger Games\\" mode.  She has a way of drawing you in to the dystopian world she has created and you cannot say to yourself \\"Self, I will put down this book as soon as I finish this chapter\\" because you get to the end of that chapter and her last sentence practically begs you to keep going.<br /><br />When I explain the premiss to people, I get the strangest looks.  I will admit that names such as Katniss and Peeta, a world divided into 12 districts, a game of survival fought to the death... and with kids no less, can all sound a little to kooky for the average reader.  And I hate telling people it is in the young adult section, they almost...No, they actually roll their eyes at me like I am some sort of simpleton.  (Side Note:  Young Adult or YA is becoming the fastest growing genre of book as of late.)  Nonetheless, I have made it a mandatory obligation, for all those who want to have any sort of camaraderie with me,  to read this series.  Most have reluctantly taken the book from me, making no real promises to enjoy any of it...that is until they open it up and are pulled in to all of the perils of District 12.  Mothers and fathers, men and women, young and old alike have all loved The Hunger Games once they put their prejudice against YA dystopian literature aside. (Please be sure to read this last sentence with lightheartedness and if it came across too harsh the first time, be so kind as to re-read it with more of a casual and breezy tone)<br /><br />There's romance and action, adventure and a sense of family, bravery and defeat, deception and honesty all rolled up in a triumphant tale of a girl who was just looking out for her family, but ends up looking out for all of society in the end.

That statement, along with my love for 2001: A Space Odyssey, made this a must read.  I did not want to put this book off any longer, and, having read it, I am certainly glad I did.  Author Arthur C. Clarke is not only a great writer, but a wonderfully inventive storyteller.  Combine that with his brilliant knowledge of space and science and you have a book as close to a masterpiece as you are likely to come across.<br /><br />Written in 1952, Clarke talks about so many aspects of science and our society in this book that have now come to fruition that it is truly frightening.  Over sixty years later, I was amazed at Clarke's accuracy and foresight.  I did not, however, expect the book to be as depressing as it was.  Although beautifully poetic, the concepts the author paints are extremely dark and ominous.  The timeline and epic scope of the story and the weaving of characters were incredibly effective.  But as much as I enjoyed the book, I don't think I'll be reading it again anytime soon.  I intend to read more of Clarke's fiction, but I definitely need some space from this author after such a somber experience.
0765365278|5.0|Sanderson has always been solid, but his work has never been better than it is in this book.<br /><br />I understand that this is the novel he has worked much of his adult life on, and the love and time put in shows.  I do not believe I have ever had a novel make me feel the way the end of this one did (no spoilers).<br /><br />It's huge, but well worth it.  There were moments that seemed to drag by, but in retrospect, those were generally due to the fact that I was just that excited to find out what was going on with a different character.  Easily a 5-star book, and it may deserve a sixth.
1452110581|5.0|This book had me laughing out loud on almost every page! The poems, from the p.o.v. of a variety of felines, are just priceless. Most are paired with the perfect full color cat portrait, bringing the humor and wit up a notch. Terrific for cat lovers, but really witty enough to tickle anyone's funny bone, this will definitely be in many of my friend's stockings this Christmas.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|Got 3 NEO Flex Arms for my workstation desk. They work great and are well thought out. I especially like the power and video cord clips that keep everything nice and neat as well as move with the arm.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game kept me thinking from beginning to end.  It took more than a few hours to complete the game.  Well worth every penny.  Great game!

B00127RAJY|4.0|30 day shred is effective but if your looking to lose some serious weight I would not guide you to this video. However it is effective because you lose inches, I lost 5 pounds then I stopped dieting and gained some of it back. The good thing is because I was losing inches everyone assumed I lost wayyyy more! Jillian gets you \\"shredded\\" ,you get a nice shape with this video even if your 200+. The videos arent exactly 20mins but not 30mins (depends) and she works you! level 2 is the devil haha good luck everyone! and remember my weight loss results does not mirror yours

B008MM9630|5.0|what a great way to waste my time. I just started it but it seems to be a fun little game
B0006AAS5G|3.0|great watch, only drawback is that it is not a true chronograph. very dissapointed as the \\"chronograph functions\\" are not the same as that of a true chronograph. for the price (arround $60) it is a great watch.
B003CN5SAY|5.0|I just loved Nip Tuck, my husband and I watched it years ago.  He hates that kind of stuff (soap operas), but really got into it. We moved to a little town in the sticks of TX, so while we are getting situated we bought alot of movies that we knew we would want to keep.  Nip Tuck was one of them, we got the whole series used.  They were all perfect condition, and we had hours of enjoying them.  Nip tuck is kind of slow starting, but it is really funny cute and does give light to some plastic surgery procedures.  It is interesting, crazy, sexy, and just all way around good.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a great tool for assessing basic or in depth status of your device. Perfect on my Kindle Fire.

B002SJIO4A|4.0|District 9 is a 2009 South African science fiction thriller film directed by Neill Blomkamp. It was written by Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell, and produced by Peter Jackson and Carolynne Cunningham. The film stars Sharlto Copley, Jason Cope, and David James. The story, adapted from Alive in Joburg, is a 2005 short film directed by Blomkamp and produced by Sharlto Copley and Simon Hansen.<br /><br />The story, itself, is about a large alien aircraft that stops above Johannesburg, South Africa in 1982. When an investigative team enters the ship, they find lifeforms on board starving and malnourished.  The aliens, often referred to as \\"prawns\\", are confined to District 9(a government camp just underneath the ship). Unrest occurs between the aliens and the locals which pushes the South African government to hire Multinational United (MNU), a private military company, to relocate the aliens to a new internment camp. Wikus van de Merwe is appointed to lead the camp relocation by serving the aliens with eviction notices. Meanwhile, alien Christopher Johnson, his son, and an alien friend search for alien technology from which they distill a mysterious fluid, storing it in a small canister. While raiding the shack of Christopher's friend, Wikus discovers and seizes the container, which sprays the fluid onto his face. Unfortunately, it slowly begins mutating Wikus into a prawn. This is where the real story begins.<br /><br />I have to admit, this isn't your typical sci-fi movie about aliens. What I liked most about the movie is the fact that it dealt with very real situations. My only dislike about the film is that it mostly was marred by mindless explosions and whatnot that seemed to take away from the real story beneath it all. Even though it seemed more like a political movie, it wasn't by any means. It did have its' flaws. For the most part, however, District 9 is a decent film.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is A W E S O M E............ AWEDOME GET THIS APP RIGHT NOW!!!!! please please please please
B007L3BMGA|1.0|The standard of writing in this book was very poor and I haven't bothered to finish it. i would like my money back!
1469984202|5.0|But then, that's the hallmark of a great book...can you put it down? I couldn't. As a result, my work has suffered, projects were sidelined, and my kids quickly discovered that \\"uh\\" means quick, raid the pantry while Dad's engrossed in whatever it is that he's reading. I'll echo what another reviewer said as well; the lack of misused words, grammatical errors, and misspellings allows the story to flow without one's brain hitting the brakes every time a jarring mistake pops up.<br /><br />As a cautionary tale, Wool Omnibus is scarily on target.<br /><br />Nicely done!
B008S4YZCO|4.0|Typical micro management game. its cute but you have to spend money to enjoy the full experience.  the mini battles are pretty fun though.
044024630X|4.0|Some romance without all the icky details but great TRAIN sequences.  I agree with a few comments that some of the scenes are unrealistically gruesome with violent assaults.<br />Sure we'd all like to kill a few politicians but only in our nightmares...then we wake up.<br /><br />His writing puts you THERE. So descriptive I could feel the train passing at midnight. Just a little short on the mystery part as the characters were laid out so intricately that I figured how it would play out half way through the book.
B0076L9W9Q|5.0|I brought my two boys ages 12 and 11 to the concert at Higher Ground. I had my boys in the front row this was something they will never forget. Thank you for all the attention that the band gave my boys you have made a lasting impression on my sons especially my oldest he plays the drums and he has been rocking to this CD and Empathic and New Medicine since the concert.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|We have always loved the Beach Boys and this new albumn (finally) brings back such wonderful memories of the Beach Boys. We enjoyed this so much that we also bought one for our friends (who also love it). Wishing that the Beach Boys would never end!
B005LCECU6|5.0|Honestly, I've been a Rush fan since I first heard them with 2112 in 1980 (I know, a newbie) and have every album including the latest album Clockwork Angels.  I didn;t know about this until I was looking at the Clockwork Angels book (book?  Who knew?!) and so had to buy it (and the book to, on pre-order).  Man it is NICE to hear them rock once again, oh wait, this was almost 40 years ago!  Clockwork Angels was just this year...they have been rocking amazingly hard for 40 years, I can hardly tell they difference!<br /><br />Well, to hear Geddy's screaming vocals and Alex playing like that and Neil just ripping on the drums back there, OK, maybe a younger, fresher, raw-er than CA, but damn! what a kickoff!  It's up LOUD in my truck, blasting down the freeways!<br /><br />Excellent album, add it to the collection.  Can't WAIT to the CA tour in Nov 2012!  See ya there!
0061989142|5.0|I have to say I truly enjoyed reading this Style book. It really inspired me to take my style and transform it a little. I'm a huge Lauren Conrad fan so I really loved getting to read about her perspective on style and styling tips. It was a wonderful read and I am looking forward to her new Beauty book!
B007TNS6JI|4.0|I got the app and it said I needed to update. I went to the store and it said there was no update. now I can not go on multiplayer.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I got this game last night and I CAN'T STOP PLAYING IT! jeypack Joyride is a really great game. HIGHLY ADDICTIVE!
B0087DFIOU|5.0|What else can a girl ask for? I bought this in Blu Ray today and we watched it. It was very enjoyable, but definitely not a family film. Mel Gibson is superb here and looks better than in some of his previous movies. It was well written, well acted and, while the ending was a fairy tale one, it lacked the cheesiness. And for that, I was thankful. Would recommend this in a heartbeat.
0312360258|4.0|Marked : House of Night<br /><br /> is about a teenager called Zoey who is marked by a vampyre. Unlike any other fledgling Zoey is descended from the vampire goddess Nyx and has the five elements : Air, Fire, Water, Earth and Spirit. As her powers enhance she finds herself in the middle of a secret society and in a rivalry with Queen Bee , Aphrodite. To make matters worse she's falling hard for school hottie, Erik Night - who also happens to be the object of Aphrodite's desire. It's up to Zoey and her new friends to help the society and successfully complete the change.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend Marked to anyone who is looking for a laugh and a bit of excitement in a book.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|Another success for Alawar!  The game is fun, creative, and long enough to call itself an adventure.  My only critique is that there is no pinch and zoom feature.  Definitely worth the price!
B0086700CM|5.0|omg it is soo fun I always ways play it it cost like no money to get the people u just run then boom I recommend this game
B000FC130E|5.0|This was a great modern day fantasy. I thought it was a little slow to start but ended up taking off to the point that I was up half the night trying to finish it! Gaiman is a fantastic writer and I look forward to reading more of his books.
B00005NKK8|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this motion picture and always told my husband it has an amazing soundtrack, I can turn the movie on and clean the house! Anyways he bought this for my birthday last week. It's a 2 disc set and legit has every song from the movie by the original composers, no cover bands! Worth every penny! Amazing, I love it!
B000001E29|5.0|Straight to the point, and straight to the top: this is Tom Waits at his best. Strange? Not for his fans. And it is a \\"must\\" for those who want to try something intense and different from \\"that normal music of each and every day\\".
B00004REF1|5.0|I had to purchase another copy of this movie because mine skipped at the very end. Anyways, It came in the mail quick and with a few scratches I was a bit worried it would mess up, but so far so good! Works great!! I Think I paid like $6 and it is a complete steal. This is one of my all time favs. Very pleased!
B004NELBPC|4.0|Worked great for months now no longer updates articles. They're all days old. HuffPo said new version for Android but not the Fire. Amazon needs to pull it from the store until it's fixed. You can uninstall & reinstall but you'll have to do it daily. I just go to their mobile site now. MY UPDATE: must give credit where credit is due. Significantly improved. Well done.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Total waste of time and an insult to my intelligence.  Reading is entertainment or/and educational; what the attraction was is beyond me.  I'm glad I didn't buy it. A friend gave it to me and asked for my opinion since she was throwing it in the trash.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|Just a mess. This book leaps from thing to thing to thing while Katniss spends time recovering from one incredible malady to another. The author moves from dealing with a grotesque subject (children fighting each other to the death) to simply being grotesque. While the first and second books held my attention throughout the story, in this one I began skimming my way through at around the half-way point until the end. I hope that one day the author considers a complete re-write of what could have been an incredible ending to a story that has caught the rapt attention of so many.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this is a filly cool app I filly like it. I hope you make more cool apps like this in the future
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Love this app -- it's right up front on my home screen.  One glance &amp; you know where you're at power-wise.  The little bubbles while charging are a nice touch -- somebody remembers the old days when you could open up your car battery.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Extremely useful for Bible study!  I am using this on my Kindle Fire and was the main reason that I wanted a kindle.  I was already using this app on my iphone and wanted to have the larger screen.
0307592731|1.0|This book left me wondering why I ever read it.  I kept hoping page after page that something uplifting or intriguing would happen.  Nope.  Nothing.  My mind felt as abused as the blisters on her feet which she describes in detail on about every page.<br /><br />Not to ruin the plot, but here are some of the highlights as I can determine;<br /><br />Mom is dying of cancer and she is checking out the male nurses crotch,<br /><br />Mom dies so she has numerous sexual encounters to help relieve the pain,<br /><br />Mom dies so divorces her cuckold husband who she dearly loves,<br /><br />Mom dies so Cheryl picks the new surname \\"Strayed\\".  \\"Adulterer\\" would have been more direct,<br /><br />Mom dies so she keeps hooking up with a heroin addict for sex and drugs,<br /><br />Mom dies so she had to shoot her mother's horse,<br /><br />Mom dies so she decides to hike the PCT and packs a lot of condoms just in case she runs into any hot smelly men,<br /><br />Mom dies and she finds she is pregnant with the addict's child and has an abortion,  (This takes all of a sentence to happen. Too bad she didn't have all the condoms to use before this.)<br /><br />Mom dies, etc, etc.<br /><br />The only uplifting part of this book for me was the realization that anyone can be a professional writer with little or no skill.  All you need to do is write a book of self pity in detail (if it happened nearly 2 decades ago and you have total recall all the better!) and get Oprah to pick it for her book club.  Instant fame and money can be awaiting you too.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Simple and easy to use. The Large buttons are very effective. It is very usefull for basic every day situations.
B004AYCWY4|5.0|\\"The Greatest Show on Earth\\" (the only game in town) is in my opinion Dawkins' weakest, or should I say least fascinating, book.  That should not really be considered a slur, because his other books are so exquisitely outstanding. This one still is outstanding, but suffers a bit from being clearly written for a larger public.<br /><br />He undertook the writing of this book -according to his own words-, because he's been talking a lot about evolution, but never presented the evidence. I'd like to disagree there, I think he's done a splendid job giving evidence in his earlier books (from\\"The Selfish Gene' and \\"The Extended Phenotype\\" to \\"Climbing Mount Improbable\\", \\"River Out of Eden\\" or \\"The Ancestor's Tale\\"). It comes shortly after Jerry Coyne's \\"Why Evolution is True\\", but it does offer some different angles, although there is -inescapably- some overlap (Dawkins does acknowledge Coyne's book).<br /><br />He starts with a justified diatribe against the \\"only a theory' as opposed to 'fact' argument and proposes the awkward term 'Theorum'. Really not necessary, as Ken Miller (a prominent destroyer of Intelligent Design) pointed out beautifully in the Dover trial. A scientific theory is much stronger than a fact: the latter can easily be replaced by a better observation, a scientific theory is based on a more solid basis. To be fair, Dawkins does allude to the frailty of 'facts'. He was always good at coining terms and memes (the word 'meme' itself, for example, so much better than 'culturgen'), but 'theorum' really is off the mark IMMO.<br /><br />In presenting evidence Dawkins follows Darwin: starts with Artificial (human) Selection and segues quite masterly to Natural Selection, very convincing.<br />It is followed by a chapters on the evidence for Deep Time,  evolution in action (\\"before our very eyes\\"), not missing 'missing links' in the fossil record, and an extra chapter about no longer missing links in our own human lineage.<br />A chapter about embryology, one a out plate tectonics and biogeography, one comparative anatomy which includes messy, unintelligent design,  and one genetics and its implications. He ends with a chapter on arms races and a finale on Darwin's last chapter of the \\"Origin ...\\",<br />He also makes clear, time and again, that each of these independent lines of evidence on their own would suffice to prove evolution.<br />Comprehensive and systematic, covers the subject in quite some detail. Criticisms of a hodge-podge are really neither here nor there.<br /><br />It is, moreover, beautifully illustrated.<br /><br />Some negatives:<br /><br />For those not very conversant with evolutionary theory, the public it is apparently aimed at, this book is an absolute must read. For those well versed in evolutionary theory there is not very much new, although I'm  certain he describes some details and experiments we were not aware of, and does it, as usual, in style.<br /><br />Dawkins, a Master of explaining complex things simply in a page or two, resorts to uncharacteristic cop-outs in this book. \\" a 'viscous damping coefficient'  and an 'elastic spring constant'. Never mind exactly what they mean: they are the kinds of things physicists like to measure in a spring.\\"  Uncharacteristic and condescending, methinks. And there are a few (luckily only a few) passages like that. Why not an endnote?<br /><br />In the chapter on plate tectonics he mentions Alfred Wegener, but fails to mention the one who did more than anybody to prove the theory (from the 30's until the 60's -when the Atlantic Ocean floor was dated-, that is), by recording the stratigraphy of South America and Africa in great detail: Alexander Logie du Toit.  As a South African resident I feel this omission possibly as worse than it possibly is, but still.<br /><br />Another small detail, he names the Galapagos Islands by their former English names (because they sound so nicely 'Naval'), but misses the occasion to link them to their modern names, confusing the 'general reader' at whom, after all, this book is aimed. Admittedly a small detail, buy it gives the kind of 'chauvinistic' impression that should be absent.<br /><br />All in all an excellent account of the evidence for evolution, but don't expect the complex intricacies of an 'Extended Phenotype' (possibly Dawk's finest work).<br />I thought of giving only four stars, but keeping the larger audience aimed at in mind -it would be unfair to use other criteria-, five.

B0060HLX12|5.0|I just love Jonah Hex, and he does save the United States, and other countries, from being annihilated.<br /><br />I have watched it 3 times thus far.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|I must say, I had heard mixed reviews from people who had seen the movie or read the books before I saw the film.  But the idea intrigued me right off from the beginning, so I ordered a copy on blu-ray way back in May or June.<br /><br />Amazon offered me a free copy of the movie digitally (These are usually $10-15 USD), I suppose because the movie was released on Friday or Saturday and the movie wouldn't arrive in the mail til at least Monday (they generally have the item to you on the day of release if you have the two-day service (I bought Amazon Prime, so get \\"free\\" 2-day shipping)), so I was pretty excited and began to watch just as the movie became available at midnight in our time zone.<br /><br />I was enthralled from the first second to the end.  Katniss is played wonderfully by Jennifer Lawrence, who I think does a wonderful job of acting a responsible person, capable of making difficult choices, as well as a soft and caring person.  I have not seen this played so well by another actor or actress before, so it was wonderful to see!<br /><br />It was also so easy to see the evil of the capitol and those living there, versus the humility and goodness of the poorer people from outlying districts.  What does it take for the higher ups to become excited and bask in the glory of their \\"victories\\", while sending off innocent young people to lose their lives?  Well, it happens every time evil dictators begin wars for their own selfish purposes.  It is a reality and has been since the beginning of time.  I think for the young people who watch or read \\"The Hunger Games\\", much has been made obvious, rather than hidden in allegory and symbolism, although there is still much of this for the adult to enjoy.<br /><br />My copy comes today (I hope!), so I can watch it on the big TV in all its blu-ray splendour!  I will loan it out to a co-worker the next day for him to watch, as well.  I'm very excited to watch it again and I've already watched it twice on the \\"little\\" screen in not such good quality.<br /><br />But whatever you may think of \\"The Hunger Games\\" and other books (so far) in this \\"franchise\\", this much is undeniable.  There are some very powerful performances by good actors and supporting actors (such as Donald Sutherland), and at least I think that there is much of the important things of life, which are brought up here, especially what freedom means and how important it is to uphold it.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|This book called me back again and again - I couldn't wait to read it.  The characters were richly developed and the story well told.  It's a graphic and disturbing look at slavery, and I learned so much.  However, the end left me hanging, and it seemed like the author planned a sequel.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is cool so many different levels you can never stop you NEED to get this app its awesome 1000 stars
B004EWEX9Y|5.0|Ordered this to watch Netflix through my iPhone on my older TV in den. Works great, keeps phone charged while watching movies all day. Seems sturdy construction and an Apple product. Well worth the money!!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this game.U might get tired of it after awhile but it's a great game to play when you're bored! I reccomend it for kids that like action!
B000IZ6URY|1.0|There was a time when Tray Parker's and Matt Stone's humor was something fresh, something new that pull laughter out of the most unexpected places. This is laughably the SAME THING as South Park. With the SAME VOICE overs and TOO MUCH of the same crass humor. I should have listened to the reviews that say that some people never mature past 16, it looks more like 12 to me.<br /><br />It's just South Park with marionettes. These guys should call it quits. It has become boring. Their creativity has expired when it comes to making this kind of thing. Yes I looked for the nuances and the smart humor \\"hidden\\" within, yet is done so tastelessly that I cannot say I enjoyed it.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|This is the second in the series and I am about 70% finished, and wishing there is another to look forward to!  The main characters are very well developed and the story line is unusual and  entertaining.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|finally a great movie intelligent story and extremely fun funny and engaging. If you see my reviews you see I have low tolerance for bad movies. This one is really well done. It's not one of the best movies of all time but it's a very good movie.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|I really good read to help form an impression of how things were in the small towns of Germany during the 2nd World War. This was an important part of my life line.  I was a young girl in the US during those years.  To have these images of how things might have been for a young girl in Germany as the same time was thought provoking for me.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is so fun and addicting! cant say enough about it love love love it!!! me and my husband like 2 challenge eachother 4 fun
1469984202|5.0|I picked this book because I am a huge fan of post-apocalyptic stories and almost everyone who read this gave it 5 stars.  Man, were these people right on.  This may be the best book I have ever read in this genre.  What a story.  I will definitely check out more by Mr. Howey and I can't wait to read the upcoming chapters in this series.  Definitely read this - you will not be disappointed!!
B008602KQI|5.0|Read the books when they frist came out.  So they are not as fresh in my mind as if I had read them last week.  But this movie gets 5 stars from me.  It moved me in many ways. And I quess knowing what is to come would make this movie more understandable to someone who had read the books and knows what is to come. Can't wait for the next one.
1469984202|5.0|I very rarely comment on books, even though I'm an avid reader, but this book deserves 5 stars. Well written, flawed characters that are so believable, lots of action, a plot with so many twists and turns. It catches you from the very beginning and never slows down.<br /><br />I can't wait to read more from Hugh Howey and I highly recommend this future classic!

B005IQZB14|4.0|I found the main character sort of irritating because she continually took the wrong path in her life, but her journey was fascinating and as always, life is better than fiction. Great read for book club, we had a ton to discuss!
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so addictive! my husband and I love playing this game. and the fact that it's free is also a plus.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This has been a fun game to play. I am very addicted. I must add more words to submit it.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|this is a great app works great on kindle fires and is very useful. I always am wondering how much battery I have left and it shows me exactly how many hours and the percentage of the battery left. get it!
B002WNC5BU|4.0|Always fascinating to eavesdrop on artists' creative influences and process.  The movie could have been longer and I wouldn't have minded a bit.  I guess Davis Guggenheim took a page from the guitarists' book---always leave 'em wanting more.  A must see for those who love music and / or these guitarists.
B004LWZWGA|3.0|In what should have been a fantastic finish to the greatest rendition of Batman, this movie sure left us feeling cheated and unsatisfied.<br /><br />Right away, the 8 year gap seemed unnecessary.  Everyone still acted as if Harvey Dent's death had just happened.  Too much time had passed for anyone to still feel strongly about Batman being responsible for Harvey Dent's death.  8 years is way too long for Bruce Wayne to still be grieving for his lost love.  It also seemed as if Rachel Dawes' death had just happened.<br /><br />On to the head scratchers......<br /><br />Bruce's mother's pearls had a tracking system?  Really?  The necklace that was broken during the night of his mother's murder.  They were re-assembled, and survived the fire that destroyed Wayne Manor?<br /><br />Every single policeman went underground for go after Bane?  This is NOT practical.  Then, they become trapped for months, during winter, and then emerge still looking healthy and clean, as if no time had passed.<br /><br />Bane was able to hold the city hostage for 5 months without any outside intervention?  What was the point of waiting so long?  If his plan was to destroy the city, why not do it sooner?<br /><br />Why would Bane go through all the trouble of sending Bruce Wayne to the desert prison that he was formerly in?  Why not just kill him?  What was the point of keeping your greatest threat alive?  And how did a broke Bruce Wayne get home from the prison so fast?  And how did he enter the city undetected?  This part of the film was nonsensical.<br /><br />How did Bane know that Bruce Wayne was Batman?  During the months that Bane was in Control of Gotham, why didn't he seize Wayne Manor and destroy the Batcave?<br /><br />How did Batman survive the stabbing from Miranda Tate/Talia al Ghul?  She sunk the knife fully into him and twisted the blade to leave the wound open.  He seemed quite immobilized and would surely have lost a significant amount of blood.  Somehow it didn't seem to bother him at all.<br /><br />How did Batman survive the blast radius from the bomb when it clearly showed he was still in the cockpit with less than 5 seconds to go?  I doubt he could have safely ejected and escaped the 6-mile blast radius with such little time.  The fixed autopilot explanation doesn't make sense.<br /><br />It was very convenient to have a wise old man that was also a doctor to help out Bruce Wayne while he was in the desert prison.<br /><br />Apparently the ol' Rocky Balboa formula worked for Bruce Wayne.  A few pushups and pull-ups and he's all back to normal.  Ready for the big fight.<br /><br />Gary Oldman, Michael Cane, and Morgan Freeman are very important to this franchise.  All 3 were extremely under-utilized.  Their characters were absent throughout most of the film.<br /><br />What was the point of Catwoman?  Her character seemed mysterious, but didn't offer anything relevant to the story.  I don't believe anyone truly cared that she was in this movie, aside from the meat-heads that just want a pretty girl to look at.<br /><br />The relationship between Bane and Talia al Ghul seemed like it could have had a greater backstory.  We barely understood how Bane came-to-be, and there was some great potential for those 2 characters to have a deeper relationship.<br /><br />The greatest scene of the movie is the first fight scene between Bane and Batman.  No music, just the fight.  A slow and weak Batman facing a monster and rightfully getting brutally beaten was excellent.  Unfortunately, everything after this moment seemed to get worse and worse.<br /><br />This movie just didn't have the same feel as the first 2 did.  The unbelievable storylines and unrealistic sequence of events made this movie bad.  The pace seemed rushed and slapped-together without anyone questioning why these plot elements are the way they are.  It is definitely the weakest of the 3 films.  Please ask yourself these same questions when watching the film, and hopefully you'll realize:  this doesn't make any sense.ll realize:  this doesn't make any sense.

B002361MLA|3.0|During a particularly rough patch, a friend recommended reading this. She warned that at times the spiritual component was a bit strange, but that the underlying message was worth listening to. Almost a year later, I finally happened upon the book in the Kindle Lending Library - free. I decided it was about time.<br /><br />From the start, it was clear this would be a fast and easy read. But I was oscillating between loving and hating this book. The prologue and author's note was laced with self-congratulation, audacious immodesty, and a downright narcissistic flair. He's the master/teacher. He knows the answers. Let him teach you. And if you don't, you've failed.<br /><br />I'm not religious, nor amply patient towards \\"spiritual leaders.\\" Despite these concerns and reservations, I read on.<br /><br />Tolle's words truly touched me at times. His lack of immaterialism impressed me: \\"...In order to fill this hole they feel within...they strive after possessions, money, success, power, recognition, or a special relationship.\\" I related to my own possessiveness.<br /><br />Time - past, present, and future - is a significant theme. The entire premise is about the now (present). But Eckhart warns of the past and future as distractions and compromises in consciousness. It inspired me to write to myself (as a runner): \\"At first I thought about what I was running from. Then, what I was running towards. Now, I'm just running.\\"<br /><br />His strongest advice comes in the form of radical acceptance. If you are presently dealing with a difficult situation, there are essentially three things you can do: remove yourself, change it, or accept it. The choice is yours, but you must choose.<br /><br />Other strengths included: not trusting time as your salvation, emptiness cannot be filled with love, his relationship advice (practicing non-judgmental vulnerability), and that through pain, you can become more \\"real.\\"<br /><br />The author's spiritual tones move between irreligious andevangelical, making it difficult to understand the role of religion. One thing is clear: This is NOT your traditional, Eastern-themed, mindfulness book. There was far more Jesus, Christ, and Christianity language than I originally expected.<br /><br />At times, Tolle is patronizing and egoistically omniscient. \\"As there is more consciousness in the body, its molecular structure actually becomes less dense.\\" This statement was in regard to slowing the physical (external) aging process by becoming present. From a chemical understanding, there is no way this makes any scientific sense. In fact, he questions himself, \\"Is there any scientific evidence for this?\\" As the teacher, he says, \\"Try it out and you will be the evidence.\\" In other words, with this classic non-answer, \\"No.\\" His scientific understanding is quite weak. When talking about nothingness, he mentions space. \\"Not surprisingly, the latest theory is that space isn't empty at all, that it is filled with some substance. Once you have a theory, it's not too hard to find evidence to substantiate it, at least until some other theory comes along.\\" I screamed at the page, \\"It's called science!\\" His appreciation for the scientific method is nil. If you come from an academic background you will likely question his logic.<br /><br />All in all, the book is a thought-provoking read. From a spiritual journey standpoint, I'm going to read about mindfulness with Jon Kabot-Zinn next (i.e., [[ASIN:1591794641 Mindfulness for Beginners]]).
B005NFW0U0|5.0|Best buy I've made on a long time........can't wait for the next season to start ! I'm crazy about this series!
B007ZCQJOM|4.0|I bought this album after hearing \\"Wishes\\" on the radio and was surprised to find other good songs on it.  There are three songs that I love (Wishes, Myth, On the Sea), but I actually enjoy listening to the whole thing.  That's very rare for me as I usually only like 2/3 songs per album I listen to.  There are some really good sounds here.  The music is inspiring and the lyrics give the impression of depth.  The lead singer is unique in my opinion as she is able to sound both like a man and a woman at different times.  This is high quality music, I absolutely recommend buying it.

B0084IG8TM|5.0|My wife and I just finished watching THE HUNGER GAMES.  When we watch a movie we are looking for something that will entertain us and not bore us.  It must hold our interest and with a lot of imagination show us a situation/story that could be true; remember I said with a lot of imagination.  The most important criteria is \\"were we entertained?\\"  Watching this movie we were indeed entertained.  It is surely not Hollywood's best, but it is a \\"good movie.\\"<br /><br />Before we watched the movie I read all the one star ratings.  I told my wife that we should get ready for a lot of camera shaking, closeups that are too close, camera jerking back and forth so fast that we might get nauseated and just about everything that could make a movie bad.  We were puzzled because we found none of this.  The one star complaints took some little thing and made it a big thing just to have something to complain about or some other motive unknown to us.
B006PAZMMK|3.0|I picked up this album on a $0.99 sale day and I'm very happy with it at that price. There are some great beats and amazing creativity and skills shown. But I just don't feel that there is quite enough material on the album to make it worth the full price unless you are a major Skrillex fan (I am not).
0670023329|5.0|There seemed to be some redundency in the book, but otherwise the story of this incredible jouney is well told and captivating.  Any one who reads this will find new appreciation for the lifestyle and freedoms we enjoy. Granted it is at the extreme of socialist ideals and failure, but it also serves as another nail in the coffin for me on any move in our own government that takes us closer to a socialist mindset.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really like these games. some are a bit of a challenge but there are some easier ones that kids could play too. I had a hard time with the controls for some but figured it out pretty quick.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I was waiting for this game to come out on the kindle fire. Now it is awesome and I'm excited for kick the buddy.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|To quote one reviewer: \\"It's like literary crack. You know it's bad for you, and you feel dirty and low for enjoying it, but you can't stop.\\" Spot on says @krautgrrl. There was more plot to this book than book one, and by plot I mean more real writing and less sex, but there is still a lot sex, and with this much sex; well, one becomes immune. It's like consistent expletive usage, it gets old fast. But ever the reader to finish a book and hope Ana or Christian die, or get kidnapped, or something so all the sex will just end, we get a confrontation with Christian's first dom, who \\"corrected\\" him.<br /><br />Ana and Christian are in love, or lust, and while she doesn't want to be hurt by his whips and canes and hiking equipment, she is still drawn to the Red Room of Pain.<br /><br />IMO, we're pretty tame on the whole erotica theme, mostly because there is all that blushing and flushing and grimacing and lip pulling, and spanking. I'm guessing I wasn't supposed dwell on the issue that they seem to have a lot of time for sex when they both work. As in my first review, the redundancy is what makes the book unbearable. This book took me less time to read because I paged forward past a lot of the sex. Been there, done that, I'm married!<br /><br />In this book we get our prior repetition from book one, plus Ana constantly calling Christian, \\"my fifty,\\" in her head every other page (or so it seems.)<br /><br />Where oh where was the DE on this project? Or was said DE just so amazed by handcuffs and butt plugs that he or she over-looked the fact that the plot compromises about forty-nine pages?<br /><br />@krautgrrl says read if you're intrigued by sex that isn't missionary all the time, otherwise just read the plot bits. The aging dom debacle is well-done!<br /><br />PS: A DE is a Developmental Editor who usually takes the first look at your book before it gets shuttled off to editing.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|right now I'm glad that they finally came out. I'm a little dissapointed though as it sometimes glitches. bit I'm surebits nothing that cant be fixed though.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I seem to be using the word redundant a lot in my reviews of this trilogy, I am also sick of hearing everyone yammer on in the reviews that this is a rip-off of Twilight, this is a massive rip-off of the film, The Secretary with James Spader (who was named Mr. Grey), from 2002; taken from the original story from  Mary Gaitskill. This book took me the longest to read, it's almost 500 pages long, I ran through it in under eight hours; including breaks. I stayed with it to see if a plot would develop and one did. Finally, [SPOILER] a kidnapping and if you're a woman you knew Ana was pregnant WAY before she did. Ana's well-read naivete is still impressive in this book, \\"Why shouldn't I pee?\\" Well, duh.<br /><br />Everything gets sorted in this book. Then you get a nicely tacked on Hollywood-ending where the Grey's live happily ever after, and there are even more Grey's now since Ana has a child and her best-friend Kate marries Christian's brother and they have a kid.<br /><br />@krautgrrl says if you are book addict then read it for the plot, but skip over the boring panting, sex and chronic orgasms, unless you like that kind of thing.
B0063IH60K|1.0|The ads before every hand makes this an uninstalled app. VERY ANNOYING!  I didn't notice  this when first installed but only took 5 hands of play to delete.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Four days of my life I am never getting back for reading this entire trilogy. My friends have been ranting about it, Twitter has been going gang-buster about the movie it will be, and my mum said it was pornographic. I stayed away, even though the New York Times Bestseller list always intrigues me. After going out drinking with @derkrautboy and friends, the female told me I \\"had to read Fifty Shades of Grey.\\" Husband downloaded it off his Amazon site and the trilogy arrived in my Kindle as I was finishing up a Jo Nesbo book (who is an amazing author, and good-looking too!)<br /><br />About mid-way through the book, I did a double-take, just a second here my CPU brain said, this is an elongated version of the film, The Secretary, from 2002, which stars James Spader, whose name JUST HAPPENS TO BE Mr. Grey! Just like Stephanie Meyer stole major portions of the Twilight series from Buffy, James stole her idea from Mary Gaitskill's short story, which The Secretary is based off of.<br /><br />What virgin in her right might throws her virginity away to a 26 year old billionaire who makes her sign an NDA and wants her to be his submissive? Ana's naivete is appalling and gets old fast. The sex scenes aren't terrible in book one, but the redundancy is obvious when you move through all three books in a row.<br /><br />Christian Grey is super hot, always amazing to look at; and I wanted to scream after the 50th \\"baby\\" was whispered, yelled, typed in an email, well, you get the picture. I remember 26 year olds, and they did not always get erections from just a kiss, or a look, or a squeeze. Grey seems to have a permanent horn! I was shocked that the book was based in Seattle because of all the Britishisms I read, I've lived in the UK so I have a few of my own, but regardless of her English language prowess, Ana had never travelled abroad and therefore would not end up with the vocabulary she uses consistently.<br /><br />Then there's the massive amount of redundancy; besides Christian's permanent horn. Ana is always wet and ready, the sex scenes are pretty darn tame for erotica and between her inner goddess and said goddesses chaise lounge and her prim subconscious, Grey and Steele are always flushing and blushing and gazing wantonly at one another, as well as Christian constantly being mercurial.<br /><br />Is it too much to ask for a plot? Oh, there is one; an entire sub-plot where Christian was brought into the BDSM LifeStyle by his mother's friend! The sub-plot gets good in book two, btw, but the redundancy may kill you.<br /><br />I found the writing actually pretty well-done, considering I read a lot. @krautgrrl says if you are easily titillated and bored with your own sex-life give it a whirl.istian's permanent horn.

031620157X|5.0|I am on Chapter 18 and I can tell you this is the best book I have read in awhile. I am also reading along with the audiobook on my Kindle. His voice and the voices he does for the characters are so funny. I love everything about it,the fact that it was written by my fav. Actor,the story,the characters,all of it. If you don't read this or listen to the audio book,you are missing out on a book as creative as Harry Potter and Twilight. What a treasure. Chris is. His imigation knows no limits.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I thought this book was very entertaining, it holds your enterest to the very end.  Christian and Anastasia were made for each other and I would recommend reading the \\"triology\\" to understand what makes Christian \\"tick\\".  I loved it.
B003G4W49C|4.0|This is the first science fiction  book I read and it was simply mind-blowing, if you are a fan of military strategy then you will like this book even more. Ender is a very rich character specially in an intellectual way , I enjoyed how Card displays all of Ender's inner thoughts so that readers can really understand the predicaments of the character. The story is set in the future but explores ideas of the human nature that the reader can easily identify with. This is not a book that shows wars and violence, it shows the meaning behind them. I personally recommend it if yo are looking for something more than simple Human v/s Alien Warfare
B0083GOPSG|3.0|I was unable to successfuly stream this movie after 2 or 3 attempts (there was no audio). I had audio on the trailer, but not when the movie was purchased.

0307730697|5.0|I bought this book for my husband because I know he loves special forces books and he loves God. I wanted him to be inspired and encouraged in his faith. And he did love it! He couldn't put it down; every time I would go looking for him I'd find him hiding out with his new book. After he was finished, he suggested that I would really like it for the humanity part of it. I don't enjoy nor have I ever read a military style book but I agreed to read the first 3 chapters. I was hooked! My sister has also battle addiction for the last 20 years and I know that she has so much untapped potential. All of that could be unlocked if she would completely surrender to God. I finished this book a week later and have been trying to find the next person to pass my book onto. Adam Brown, thank you for living and sharing the truth of a life both challenged and inspired and completley covered in grace. Jesus has now got an outstanding armour bearer by His side.

B00006L7MR|5.0|This is more of additional information about the audio content for audio nerds like me. This DVD contains MLP surround and stereo tracks, encoded ad 48 kHz, in addition to lossy tracks for backward compatibility with older DVD players. While this is not the usual 192 kHz as one might expect, the overall sound quality is still very good, the sound is vibrant and crisp, and it's very pleasant to listen to. Highly recommended.
B001IB7SQ4|4.0|I've just started watching this show on Amazon Prime. I've watched the first 5 episodes and I'm really enjoying it. My initial thought was it's like \\"X Files\\" meets \\"Big Bang Theory\\". I've seen enough that it has me hooked and I'll keeping watching. All in all I'd say the series is interesting and unique enough to keep me viewing.
B0001Z53F6|5.0|This is just a description of DVD-Audio contents for audio nerds like me.

B007FDE4Y8|1.0|If I'm doing an event, I need to remove my camera from the Steadicam then put on my rail slider, then back to the Steadicam. The amount of calibration and adjustment time required does not allow for this kind of workflow in a timely fashion.  I would imagine, if you're a pro at an event you would need to have one camera dedicated to this Opteka or else, removing and reattaching the camera would require a bit of re-adjustment time.<br /><br />I couldn't really get this to work with any consistency.  I have a T3i and saw the YouTube videos by videotestground on how to calibrate.  I could never get it calibrated like he did in the the video.  He bought an additional 3rd party accessory, the Giotto's MH621, to make adjustments more easier and I just went with what came in the box - and what comes in the $199 box doesn't seem to be enough.  To be honest, I only spent a few days on adjustments before deciding to pack it up for return.  I've read that you need about 40 hours of adjustments and practice with most Steadicams.  For this Opteka, maybe double that.

1568363931|5.0|This bento is nice and \\"grown-up\\".<br />I have a few bento making cookbooks and a trend with all of them is making a bento with such small, unpractical food portions that what ever is leftover won't be used in a few days and most likely go to waste.<br /><br />Thank god for this book! Over half of the recipes call for bigger portions, for example full pound of meat being used rather than just five or four ounces. The rest of the meat is assembled and frozen so you can grab it for easier bento making later that week/month.<br /><br />Another handy part of this book is a timeline; a nice handful of recipes have a 30-15 minute timeline showing when everything can be done right down to packing everything up. I use it whenever i'm short on time in the morning or rushed at night. Every recipe also gives about 3-4 variations at the end of the section giving even more options inside this book than you'd think.<br /><br />I adore this book and consider it an essential to anyone who is either just beginning or is very excelled at making bentos.
B002Q1YDLI|1.0|this book was a quick and easy read, but i was totally annoyed the whole time reading it because the heroine, darcy, is basically intolerable.  she's selfish, demanding, a liar, can't take responsibility for her own actions, and extremenly judgemental.  she wants to marry four different men in the course of this relatively short book!  also, the last third of the book became completely predictable.  pass this one up!

B0084IG7KC|3.0|I could not have forseen how boring this could be. You wouldn't think a movie based on massive oppression and life/death struggles could be. The only reason it's not two stars is that the actors definitely did their best with what they were given. The plot meanders, fails to represent the \\"world\\" in the book, and the cgi was amateurish. At least I escaped for the DVD purchase price, and can now give it away.

0839211139|5.0|Chinua Achebe derives the title to his magnum opus from a verse from W. B. Yeats' [[ASIN:B0041D8XRE The Second Coming - W. B. Yeats]]. An apt title indeed, for a novel whose central theme is what happened in Africa, from the African's perspective, when the white man (and yes, the gender is specific) showed up. The book was first published in the late `50's, shortly after Nigeria, where this novel is set, became independent. It concerns the Ibo (Igbo) region of southeastern Nigeria. This region sought its own independence as Biafra, in 1967, and Achebe became a spokesperson for their cause.  There are now more than 8 million copies in print, and Achebe is often referred to as the father of modern African literature. With the novel's widespread acceptance, it has become a \\"school assignment\\" book, (it even has its own \\"Cliffs Notes\\"!) and hence, the posting of numerous 1-star reviews. Some of the1-star reviews are thoughtful however, challenging the author for using the work of a white Irishman for his title, and did the slaughter of World War I really compare with the interactions of white Europeans with Africans? That leads to the true fool's errand of toting up the dead bodies. As for my own reading, I've read several books from the (American) Indian perspective on the coming of the white man, and I have read numerous books on Africa, almost exclusively by whites such as Alan Paton, Nadine Gordimer, Doris Lessing, Albert Camus, Jules Roy, Alistair Horne, and even Joseph Conrad, who Achebe has fiercely criticized. Certainly a read from an African perspective, perhaps the most famous one, has been LONG overdue.<br /><br />I liked Achebe's prose style. Straightforward, and unsentimental. He certainly does not depict a glorious Eden before the arrival of the white man. And almost three-fourths of the novel is set in the period before his arrival. The protagonist is Okonkwo, the son of an indolent father, Unoka. The son's upward social mobility commences with his wrestling victory over Amalinze the Cat. Okonkwo has the internal motivation to rise above his father's \\"station in life.\\" There is the \\"sociological aspect\\" to the novel. I kept thinking of a 600 page treatise, with leaden prose, and tables, describing the rituals of birth, marriage and death, along with the systems for religious observation, the administration of justice, and the economics of village life.  What are the family customs and beliefs that are held important? Achebe covers all of this, deftly, in novelistic vignettes. In addition, Achebe's characters display the universal qualities of the human condition: desire for advancement, greed, envy, sexual relations, pride, disappointment in one's children, and the response to natural disasters, such as too much rain, or too many locust. \\"Chi\\" is apparently the Ibo word for \\"fate,\\" and it is a dominant factor in the characters' lives.<br /><br />The white man first arrives on an \\"iron horse,\\" which turns out to be a bicycle. He pays with his life for his temerity, a \\"casus belli,\\" which quickly leads to an unequal exchange of life. But it is religion, and not armies, that provide the essential wedge for \\"things falling apart.\\" I thought Achebe did a brilliant job in describing how it so often happens. In his novel, the white missionary is rather inoffensive and bumbling. But oh so effective in appealing to the individuals at the lower rungs of Ibo society... basically giving them a \\"second chance\\" in life. The Christian religion gathers adherents, and effectively defeats the \\"gods\\" of the native religion. Achebe also realistically depicts the (in)famous \\"divide and rule\\" tactics of the colonial British. When two quite different social structures compete, all too often, at least for a period, it is the side with the larger warships that seems to win.<br /><br />Achebe's work is a classic, and despite Mark Twain's quip, one that should be read, by anyone seeking to truly understand why things are the way they are, particularly in Africa. Could it be made into a temporary home?  5-stars.ticularly in Africa. Could it be made into a temporary home?  5-stars.

1907411151|1.0|Stephanie Meyer writes vampire fiction as many teenage girls do -- overblown writing, sexy cold vampires, and a vacuously attractive heroine who serves as the readers' stand-in. WARNING: spoilers.<br /><br />But as fluffy and shameless as Meyer's past work has been, she dips far below her past nadirs in the ghastly, sluggish \\"Breaking Dawn.\\" There's a grotesque twist toward the book's spluttering end, and it becomes painfully obvious that Meyer was determined to give everyone an utterly happy ending. And she'll sacrifice whatever plot or characterization it takes to get that happy ending.<br /><br />Resident \\"Mary Sue\\" Bella is getting the royal treatment from her fiance Edward in the days before they marry. The wedding goes off with only one hitch -- her ex-love-interest Jacob's anger at her impending transformation into a vampire. But newlywed bliss doesn't make for a terribly interesting grand finale, so we get the expected twist -- Bella's pregnant with a half-vampire baby.<br /><br />Jacob becomes even more upset when he witnesses the violent birth of Bella's magical super-special baby Renesmee (nickname: Nessie) -- only to have something unexpected (and very icky) occur between himself and the newborn. But turning into a vampire won't solve Bella's problems, because it turns out that other vampires are gathering in preparation to attack... and it's due to the birth of Renesmee. Oh, the suspense!<br /><br />Authors often create all sorts of endings for popular series -- sad ones, happy ones, bittersweet ones, and occasionally ones that make absolutely no sense in relation to the series. Unfortunately in \\"Breaking Dawn,\\" Meyer has opted for the last type of ending -- and that finale starts the moment Bella gets pregnant, and becomes more absurd and inane as the story drags on. It ends up being rather difficult to care what happens to any of the characters, because the readers are being assaulted by a string of absurd plot twists.<br /><br />Not that there's much of a plot to twist -- Meyer desperately pads out the flimsy storyline with a lot of florid prose and endless melodrama. The first part of the book is pretty much consumed by wedding drivel and subsequent soft-focus sex, but after Bella becomes pregnant everything spirals down the drain. All this drama culminates in a ghastly birth scene that may turn some readers off ever having kids. Vampire teeth are involved.<br /><br />Having exhausted what little plot can be wrung from a Edward-Bella marriage and subsequent pregnancy, Meyer struggles to somehow fix this by introducing a Big Bad Threat to the new family's happiness. Unfortunately, it has all the climactic impact of a soggy firecracker. As the final indignity, Meyer crashes down a pedophilic plot twist for Jacob, so he won't be too lonely. You can almost hear the thin plot cracking in a thousand places, as Meyers strains to give a Happily-Ever-After for everybody (except the Indian girl).<br /><br />Bella remains one of the most vacuous heroines in modern literature -- she has the passion and intellect of a wet mop, but once she becomes a vampire she is also shockingly graceful, beautiful, powerful and self-controlled. In case you haven't noticed, she's just amazing in every way -- and it's difficult to control one's gag reflex when reading about a glaring self-insert made so utterly perfect.<br /><br />Not that the supporting characters help much -- Edward is his usual wangsting brooding abusive self, and poor Jacob is turned into a pedo. And the Ultra-Super-Special Vampire Baby is almost as nauseating -- and even more featureless a personality -- as the mother who spawned her.<br /><br />\\"Breaking Dawn\\" would better have been called \\"Breaking Down.\\" Stephanie Meyer had a good thing going with the vacuous vampire soap opera, but here she rips it apart and turns it inside out.

B0068FZ0J2|5.0|Rod Howard's best film by far.  This film is brillant from start to finish.  It should have won Oscars for Best Picture and for Best Director (\\"Braveheart\\" and Mel Gibson ... Really!?!). Even with the wonderful acting, directing and cinematography - the best parts of \\"Apollo 13\\" deal with the creativity and daring that NASA had in the earlier days of our space program.  All this is made better now with a Blu-Ray, DVD and digital copy ... so I can now watch it on my iPhone or iPad anytime, anywhere ... again and again!  Love it!

B002HWRYJE|2.0|I tried to give this movie an honest shot. I really did. I've watched every bit of star trek out there, and sadly, this is pandering crap made by someone who hasn't the faintest idea what Star Trek is about. Instead of thrashing decades old story lines, the director should have just come up with something original.
B00006J3WH|5.0|Let me say, first of all, that if you buy this expecting a broadway quality piece with stunning vocalists and complex orchestral arrangements, you may be disappointed.<br />However... This album is very worthwhile if you are a big Buffy fan! This contains every song that was in this episode, and overall it is fantastic! I respect joss for doing this episode and putting so much effort into it. Plus... It's fun to sing along ( which Buffy asks you to in something to...)!<br />I must say that the voices are not amazing... But I really have respect for all the actors for actually singing. Amber benson, Anthony head, and the man who played the demon, however, are exceptions. They all have great voices! Sarah and Emma have alright voices, and so does nick. However, I'm guessing Allyson hannigan asked to not sing much (she has only 3 lines). But overall, the album is great! As I said... Great for Buffy fans!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This was a great movie, and we enjoyed it. What made it even better was that they actually filmed part of it in the next town to us. All the shots at the train Depot were filmed there.

Anyone who has ever had a close bond to a dog will understand why it brought tears to my eyes. I loved it.

The sound is incredible, natural and spectacular. I very much prefer this Sony cycle to Bernstein's DG remakes, which lack the objectivity he brought to his earlier recordings.<br /><br />Grab this before someone figures out they could be charging twice the price without ill abusing consumers.
1400052181|4.0|Author Rebecca Skloot needed the unprecedented cooperation of Henrietta Lack's family to tell the full story of the omnipresent HeLa cells harvested from her and now so important to scientific researchers the world over. The family's cooperation proves to be a mixed blessing, however, and ends up hindering the book as much as helping.<br /><br />The story of HeLa cells is fascinating, and the narrative of their development is long overdue. Henrietta Lacks, an African-American woman, was treated for cervical cancer in 1951 at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. During her treatment, both healthy and cancerous cells were taken from Henrietta's cervix without her knowledge or the knowledge of the family. The cells were named \\"HeLa\\" from the first two letters of \\"Henrietta\\" and the first two letters of \\"Lacks,\\" the naming convention at the time. Henrietta died several months later at age 31 leaving her young family behind. Her cells proved to be very unusual in that scientists were able to develop them into a so-called \\"immortal\\" cell line that does not die after a few divisions as most do. The cells were a huge benefit to scientific research because they provided a standardized basis for experiments and could be mass-produced in cell \\"factories\\" and shipped anywhere in the world. Her cells are still in use today.<br /><br />Ms. Skloot is surprisingly engaging as she takes the reader through the often dry and complicated world of scientific research methods. It was especially interesting to learn how cells, until very recently, were taken from patients without their consent and sold for profit by doctors and large research institutions without patient knowledge or compensation. Thousands of patents involving HeLa cells have been issued and research companies have many millions of dollars using them, yet neither Henrietta nor her family has been compensated.<br />Henrietta's true identity was unknown to most for many years (her own family did not know what became of her cells until the 1970's), and the author's research finally puts a face on the HeLa cells. We get to know Henrietta as a person, and she finally gets the recognition, dignity and respect that she so richly deserves.<br /><br />The book would have been fantastic if it had ended there. In order to gain access to information other authors did not have, Rebecca Skloot seems to feel an obligation to tell the story of the entire Lacks family. Granted the family probably should have been compensated for the harvesting of Henrietta's cells in 1951, but the story bogs down and unravels when we have to wade through the lives of the children, grandchildren, and various relatives of the family both past and present. The family says they want to learn about what happened to Henrietta, but then they spend at least as much time wondering how they can make money from her cells today. They even ask the author how much money they can get from her writing the book. Yes the family is poor, but it is very frustrating to see their actions undermine the hard-won dignity of Ms. Lacks.<br /><br />If Rebecca Skloot had kept the book tight and on-point it would have been much stronger. It starts well, and the Afterward draws the focus inward again. It tells a very important story, and yet is, perhaps necessarily, weakened by the inclusion of the family in order to gain their cooperation for the back story. I understand the author's dilemma here, and I am going to give Skloot the benefit of the doubt. Writing the book must have been a difficult job, but it was also a necessary one. 4 stars.cells until the 1970's), and the author's research finally puts a face on the HeLa cells.

Finding true, from the heart R&B is hard, but Emeli Sandé makes you believe in R&B again. 'Our Version Of Events' gives you a glimpse of Sandé as an artist. I like just about every song and each song you can relate to. The album is rather short and I expected more vocally from Sandé. Don't get me wrong, she did a fabulous job, but I just wanted to hear more from her voice. Hopefully she will bring it stronger on her next album.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Probably the best written, most compelling story I've read in years. I couldn't put it down and I can't wait for more.
0446401307|5.0|Firstly, I love Connelly's Harry Bosch novels. They usually have a clean writing style, that makes them easy to digest. But they also have a certain adult cynicism that makes them fun. This one is no different. Not all characters are three dimensional, only the ones that need to be. This helps keep the pace going, with the occaisional short respite for the protagonists Chandler-esque musings.<br /><br />The title is a clever pun. The Overlook is the place where the crime happens, but from the very beginning Harry feels that they have overlooked something else. The crime itself is very post 9/11: a murder with a large amount of nuclear material missing. Hence the main theme running through the story is the clash between Federal Agencts and local police, and the trouble this causes. Naturally the incompetence or deliberate blockingof those around him, often a strong theme in the Harry Bosch novels, tends to obscure things. And then there is the love interest who tends to exasperate some situations while being helpful in others and thus delivers even a bit more uncertaintly.<br /><br />I loved this novel and recommend it.
B0067QPVJ6|3.0|Remakes are one thing, but remakes masked as prequels to remakes from the `80s? Now that's a whole new ballgame. \\"The Thing,\\" despite its similarity in title to John Carpenter's cult-classic 1982 film is actually a prequel. But it's also a remake. Make sense? Of course not. Just go with it. The basic premise will sound familiar: a group of scientists holed away in the bowels of Antarctica make an earth (err, ice) shattering discovery that soon proves to be a deadly threat.  It turns out a foreign life-form found buried in the ice is actually a lethal shape-shifting monster that consumes and then replicates its hosts, turning the entire crew on each other one by one. However, this story concerns the Norwegians whose mess Kurt Russell and crew were left to clean up in the original (remake).<br /><br />So how does it fare when compared to the coat-tails it's riding? Well, it's a mixed-bag, really. While Carpenter's film is notorious for boasting some ground-breaking practical effects that still hold up rather well 30 years later, this version will likely be remember for having quite possibly some of the laziest and most blatantly obvious CGI committed to mainstream cinema in recent memory. There are some truly grisly moments in the film that are virtually neutered by their presentation, which is perhaps the film's greatest short-coming. Granted, it doesn't help that the plot moves so quickly that you never get a chance to get to know (or care) about the crew, but a little more effort spent on making the effects look authentic would have gone a long way.<br /><br />On the upside, Dutch director Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. has a strong visual sense that pays off big time. Granted, an isolated snowbound setting almost creates its own atmosphere, but the film does a superb job of immersing you in the bleakness of the situation, much in the same way Carpenter did with his film. Also in the film's favor is Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Final Destination 3, Death Proof) who is essentially stepping in Kurt Russell's shoes. While her character is barely expanded upon, she brings enough gravity to keep you caring. As the film shows, Winstead is truly one of Hollywood's most underused talents. In perhaps a more refined film, she could be this generation's Sigourney Weaver or Linda Hamilton.<br /><br />The thing of it is (see what I did there?) that \\"The Thing\\" is neither a great nor a bad movie. It exists solely to serve a specific fanbase: namely Carpenter enthusiasts who have seen the 1982 film enough that they can quote the characters by heart. To that end, the film feels like a decent piece of fan-fiction come to life. As far as remakes go (and believe me, there's some bad remakes of Carpenter films on the market), this one is on the higher end of the scale. If you can get past the fact that it's essentially the Diet Coke version of a bonafide classic, you might get some thrills out of this new \\"Thing.\\"entially stepping in Kurt Russell's shoes.
