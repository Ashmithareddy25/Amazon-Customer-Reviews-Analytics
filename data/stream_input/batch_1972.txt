B0091ICDHU|5.0|A fantastic book, very sad and moving. Keeps you wanting more and you fall in love with the characters through the hardships they continue to face.
B0094OLFUW|4.0|The music is very low key and very easy to relax to. The xx aren't known for their lyrical prowess, but the instrumentals largely make up for it.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Finally a love story I can believe. Katie doesn't sell her soul to love a pasty, cold vampire. She doesn't have to endure  loves that hurts with whips and chains or change who she is to be with Alex. She's a strong, determined character that saves herself on her terms. A realistic account of what if takes to create your own life on your own terms.
0345803485|3.0|I didn't get the hype that every woman in America got while reading this book. Pretty unbelievable story. And if you like Christian Grey, keep dreaming ladies because no such man exists.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I cried. I laughed. A wonderful book! A beautiful and tragic love story! Thank you John Green for sharing this story!
6305428425|5.0|This is such a fun, lighthearted movie. I wasn't sure if I would like it as much as I did years ago but it didn't disappoint.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Very good book. I would recommend it for almost anyone. It's not one of my favorites, but it s still pretty good
0061122416|5.0|This is one book that I keep going back to. It is a standard on the shelf for all my clients and I love just dipping into it when I have a few minutes spare time. Always prompts thoughts!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Story captures one early on and holds you. Makes me think, what would it be like if our government keeps taking more and more control of our lives. What happens when we let the government control every aspect of our lives? People stop thinking. And even worse, they stop taking responsibility for their own choices and actions. It becomes easier to rationalize and justify their behaviors.
B0000UJL96|3.0|I guess you get what you pay for.  I expected to get a the Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition packaging (the dvd box is a special two disc case) when I ordered this but what I got was the two disc set in a cheap recycled blockbuster case with the original sleeve insert cut down to fit inside the slimmer case. If you've bought the other Special Collector editions you know the dvd case is different.  At least the DVD's work.
B009YU62H2|4.0|This is pretty good, I have to say. It's quite the seamless pickup from their last album --- 15 years ago! If you liked their latter two albums in the 90s, you'll like this. I don't know, one could say there's some strong BMF elements in here as well. If you're a Soundgarden fan, this is totally worth checking out.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Great collection - highly recommend.  Watched them all over a two week period and glad we own them to watch over and over.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Connelly brings Harry Bosch and his adventures to life in a special way.  After reading a few chapters of The Black Box I just didn't want to put it down.  Bravo.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Very good live concert. Music was clear and singers were incredable. I enjoyed it all. I Highly recommend this DVD.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This is a most riveting book of history. Ms. Goodwin has done an incredible job putting &#34;flesh on the bones&#34; of history here. I read it after watching the movie Lincoln, which covers just a small slice of the time covered in the book. I could not help but compare the tools available to Mr. Lincoln then vs those we have available now, to think about how he, in his time, was a great communicator and leader.<br /><br />For those who might say &#34;I know how it ends&#34;, I would encourage them to read as well. Much more than you might imagine is here.
B006LSZECO|4.0|You won't expect what's coming page turn after page turn ... I only give it 4 stars because I didn't like the ending. But then again, I can't think of a more suitable one either. The writing is phenomenal. I've never read a book like it
031603441X|5.0|If you are of the Stones generation you will enjoy this book.  It is thick but goes by like crazy fast
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I valued the message from this Dr. as I long for the Truth of Gods graciousness in our departing this realm to the next. The story flows with beauty and Grace.

B009X01ELC|5.0|The Marware Revolving case is an excellent choice.  It provides good protection and yet is versatile.  It rotates on its stand to allow easy reading from both a portrait and landscape position.  Unlike some cases it is not complicated or frustrating to use.  The ease of use defines this product.  Enjoy your Kindle Fire better in a Marware case.
B009VLXMJA|5.0|amazing I love the music! it is a great album. she has a lot of talent she is also my favorite artist. I love you Taylor!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|There aren't enough stars to rate Yann Martel's epic work of philosophy/theosophy, Life of Pi. It is brilliantly executed, and I felt compelled to take notes... though note-taking is a pastime my eidetic memory normally scoffs at! There was just too much to digest in this marvelous book to leave it to chance that I would recall it all later.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so entertaining and full of promise.  Everyone who is looking for an app to waste time, this is the perfect app. I would recommend this app to anyone.
B007SPN5MA|5.0|Great Singer with HEART to spare!  If you enjoyed a Swell Season and Once...give this one a try.  He is filled with soul.
B0058YZ2KG|5.0|5 out of 5 for being the fifth pair of Merrell minimalist shoes in our household and still the best.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Enjoyed this better than being in the theater.  This is a very deep movie that moves deeply.  Don't miss this one.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Wow, such a rich read.  I have not finished this one but am enjoying it.  Such  rich language and history.
B001CDLATE|5.0|Beauty and Sound that is unsurpassed.  A true cinematic gem.  Don't miss this movie.  Get your lover and enjoy a night of emotion and Love
B009NQX48C|3.0|I won't review the movie. I really like the movie and give it 5 stars. This is solely about the Blu-ray. Some scenes are the usual excellent quality that make you go, \\"Wow, Blu-ray sure is great!\\" and other scenes look just like the older DVD - slightly grainy and fuzzy. I can't believe that was how it was filmed. I don't understand it. Overall, it's still better than the DVD, but somewhat disappointing.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I kept coming back for more, wanting it to keep going but knew it had to end. Thank goodness there are still two more books!
B004FGMDOQ|2.0|The reviews on this book said it was a good read for people of all ages. I would cut of the age for readers of this book to be about 15. The book suddenly ends without any resolution or explanation as to why the events of this entire book happened. I am only giving this book two stars because I would hate to think I completely wasted so much time reading this. Just gonna say I'm glad I got this on sale as a kindle daily deal. Never would pay full price for this.
B00005JLET|5.0|Ordered the wrong thing. Needed a dvd but still kept the movie as I also have a vhs. I was very pleased with the cost, dellivery time and movie in great condition. Thanks
B0036EH40Q|5.0|What else do you need to say? Well, it's a western, too. Great acting, great quality and very great price and service. Thanks, Amazon. Love you, Kurt!
0307594165|5.0|Fine writer at her best.  My book group agreed that she did this novel in the most succinct esy possible while making us care about the protagonists and developing their characters.
B007TXN4TK|4.0|This is awesome. Good hand /eye coordination. I struggle on some and whip through the others. I reccomend this for want to be pianists.
B009D0LBRO|1.0|I don't know how or why, but it doesn't load. We wasted $1.19 on a loading screen. This game only unpacks a download, and that is it. This is probably the worst game on the app store. Or at least one of them. Ubisoft, you stole our money. Something tellsnme that you bribed all these people to give it 5 stars. I whatever this game. It's a shame. It looked fun. I have Internet access, but when I load it, it tells me to get Internet access. What the HECK?!? If all your games are like this Ubisoft, I would Yates to play them. Don't get this.
1449410243|5.0|Fantastic work at a really awesome price. The pull out poster is a little smaller than you'd expect a poster to be, but after all it's about the comics.
B009R5GR1K|5.0|Great App! Very useful tool for study on the fly. Offline is as handy as loafbread. Games are nice for working your vocabulary. I go to it about everyday and come away with a satisfied learning experience. Graded A+ in my book.
B007L96SI6|5.0|I unreservedly love \\"Listen Up!\\"<br /><br />Haley Reinhart's voice is an infectious mix of raw emotion and smooth soulful affections that recall an era where an album's sound felt more like a live concert and less like an over-produced studio creation. This woman has got some song-writing chops too (she co-wrote all but one of the tracks on \\"Listen Up!\\").<br /><br />For me, Haley echoes the likes of Diana Ross (a la The Supremes) and Amy Winehouse, as she expertly crafts old-school, girl-group tunes comprising two parts soul and one part pop.  In today's pop artist vernacular, she invokes the smoothness of Bruno Mars while adding a raspy tinge more common with someone like P!nk.<br /><br />Indeed, \\"Listen Up!\\" has two distinct sounds.<br /><br />Most cuts -- \\"Oh My!,\\" \\"Wasted Tears,\\" \\"Wonderland,\\" \\"Keep Coming Back,\\" \\"Hit the Ground Running,\\" and \\"Now That You're Here\\" -- sound as if they were sessioned by some of the great studio bands of Motown.  The instrumentation is crisp and the vocals are forward.  These are infectious, clever songs that (mostly) clash heartache lyrics with up-beat vibrant tunes and, therefore, resonate in a way that some of today's pop does not.<br /><br />A few cuts have a more up-to-date pop sound (\\"Undone,\\" \\"Walking on Heaven\\"), more engineered and deliberately crafted.  Not technically artificial (no vocoder here), or bereft of emotion, but just less of that unawares, let's-have-fun-in-the-studio, mood the other cuts have.<br /><br />The Motown band/girl-group sound is most impressive, eminently well-executed, and a natural fit for Haley. On those songs it's as if the studio musicians are playing in an old brick studio with a lively sound that bounces off the wall. There is little or no synthesizer; the instrumentation is not manufactured.  Here, Haley's voice (in terms of her sound and what she seeks to communicate lyrically) consistently reaches artistry.  There's no faking this.  She feels it in her soul, and, because of that, the feelings creep inside you as well.<br /><br />An example: On \\"Now That You're Here,\\" where she takes the tension-filled lyric -- \\"Feels like this chemistry might be the end of me \ If love is my enemy, don't set me free\\" -- and combines it with a driving funky beat, you're convinced this turmoil is something you'd want to feel too.<br /><br />Speaking of tension, listening to the album, I could hear the \\"live soul-band\\" vs. \\"engineered-pop\\" dichotomy between various songs, and, sometimes, within the same song (\\"Free\\" and \\"Liar\\").  \\"Liar\\" is a sublime successful mix of the two styles and one of my favorites.  Others on heavy rotation will be Wasted Tears, Undone, and Now That You're Here.<br /><br />The album's main producer (there are five) is busbee who has worked in pop (P!nk, Katy Perry, Kelly Clarkson, Christina Aguilera, Adam Lambert), country (Keith Urban, Rascal Flats, Lady Antebellum, Blake Shelton); rock (Daughtry, Smash Mouth); R&B (Natalie Cole, Toni Braxton); and rap (FloRida, Timbaland).<br /><br />On \\"Listen Up!\\" here you have an emotional unadorned pop-soul voice, combined with great song-writing and a sharp producer who is wise enough to let Haley's voice and song-writing vision be put forward without much interference.  The result is a superb debut album from an artist who should not be dismissed simply because her introduction to us came via a turn-'em-out-fast reality singing competition like American Idol<br /><br />I hope Haley Reinhart is around for a long time.  Over the past decade, if you've followed Idol, where Haley was a finalist in its 10th Season, the star light of some finalists, who were not only good singers but also potentially great artists, blazed brightly then faded quickly.  Season 6's Melinda Doolittle (who, like Haley, placed 3rd) comes to mind. I pray this is not Haley's fate.<br /><br />Haley Reinhart is an artist who deserves to be on the scene, radiant, relevant and, hopefully, prolific for years to come.  Listen up! You won't regret it.

B000088E6D|5.0|Yes, I am a fan but this is a really enjoyable CD.  Easy listening and perfect while entertaining friends.  Great addition to my collection.
B000SEI230|5.0|It's really funny that as you are going through life you don't realize that you are living out God's plan for you. This book even fictional could be true.
B0083Z6AH6|4.0|It is possible to read, put down and pick up again without losing thought processes.  Have read it prior and seen the movie.  Like that era as well.
0736041850|4.0|I really like this book. I am not a beginner and I still like opening this up from time to time to just review the basics and all the necessary exercises to make sure I'm working all the muscles I need to. I also recommend this book to anyone who mentions to me that they want to get into bodybuilding/strength training.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite jane austen books. I love anne and captain wentworth. They both remain faithful to the each other for eight years. That's an amazing love story.

A couple of days later, I opened up the same ePub on my Kindle.  I was expecting to have to page through to where I left off on my Samsung.  But much to my surprise, my Kindle went to the page where I left off on my Samsung!!!  I'm impressed ... GO AMAZON!!!!
B00280LYHS|4.0|Enjoyed this book from Rick Riordan. Great ending to this set of books from him. Would recommend this book and the rest of this series.
B005LAII1C|5.0|But this movie, One of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Really, a pot smoking teddy bear?  hahahaGood stuff
B006LSZECO|1.0|I was so surprised that this book was so bad. I had read many reviews about how good it was and was anxious to read it.  It was wordy and rambling-  Once I start a book I usually stick to it, regardless of its quality, however, this one I had to send back .  I found myself skipping pages just so I could see what the author's was getting at.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Its a great movie and I can't wait for more to come as well.<br /><br />Bonus on the blue ray: I love the bloopers the last one is really funny.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I truly enjoyed reading this trilogy, I finished all 3 in a week during Christmas break! Steamy, eye-opening and totally worth it! Definitely revved up the sex life at home !!

B00AAX68HG|4.0|This is a good game with easy puzzles and some challenging ones. Really hard to get the \\"crown\\" on all the levels. My only gripe is the ads on this version.  Most of the ads had something to deal with smoking pot.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Really love the design and the large display. Using it for tips is great. Even the color tone of the keys helps us older persons out a lot.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It's very hard for me to describe how much I enjoyed this book. The characters, all of them, are engaging. The story is both heartwarming and heartwrenching. Read it, I really just don't know how else to describe it.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I liked the book but there was just too many sex scenes in this book to make it even realistic. After the 2nd book and now this one I just started to skip those pages. I don't mind a few but no one does it as much as this author writes about. It's very redundant and boring fast. You just get done with one and two pages later there's another. I also don't like how they address each other as Mr. Grey and Mrs. Grey in regular conversation. It just ruined the book for me. I will not be rereading these books.
1932100660|5.0|Some people need a lot of convincing to do what they know is better for themselves.  Does anyone think eating hot dogs or cheesteaks on a weekly or daily basis is good for them?  Of course not.  Don't be one of those people who wait until 'all the evidence' is in.  All the evidence will never be in.  This study is well done and the what it suggest is something most people already knew.

You can enter multiple locations into the menu and then scroll through them to find out what weather is like for places you have friends and family around the country or for places you visit for your job.  It also gives an hourly forecast which I find very helpful.  I would recommend it to a friend or co-worker.
0765325950|5.0|Review the content, not the availability of an eBook. Giving the book 1 star is not helpful to anyone.  If you take exception to the way it was released, write a letter to the publisher.  Don't rate a book poorly, simply because it does not accommodate your preferences. We have waited 2 years for this book.  Wait another 3 months for the eBook, if that is so important.  By the way....Yes, Publishers are about money.  That is why they are in business.  If you can't understand that, you may want to consider moving to a nation with a communist government.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|I love Angry Birds.  Star Wars is one of my favorites.  Rio is my least favorite, however even Rio would get a four star review from me.
1609611543|5.0|With a very low BMI, I wasn't worried about my weight. What concerned me was why I, and all of my friends, seemed to complain about just feeling lousy all the time. Well, wheat really isn't wheat any more. Not the wheat, anyway, of my childhood eighty years ago. And Dr. Davis tells us why, in well-researched pages, about its history, ancient and current. Now three weeks into his/our abandonment of any wheat or wheat products in my diet, and now in the middle of reading the book aloud to my wife(!), many of those 'lousy' feelings just aren't there any more. The symptoms of systemic inflammation are almost gone, along with a host of disagreeable 'conditions' which really had no particular reason for being there. &#34;No Wheat&#34; might well be a tough sell for many who consider a wheat-based life to be the only one worth living. Give it a couple of weeks, and you will have turned the corner into a much more pleasant life! And his book will have achieved its purpose, one healthy life at a time!!
0375842209|5.0|This is one of those books that you pick up and you are continuously surprised. The author crafts a great story and uses different aspects and different vantage points to take the reader through the war. The personification and characterization of death was very effective and added so much to the story. I felt as though I knew these characters and we were friends and I was right there along for the ride with them. Really good book in so many ways- characters, plot/story, writing style, this book might not be the best book I have read, but it is the best book I have read in the last year or so.
055380684X|5.0|This is not the be-all and end-all of learning, but it is a good first step to serious learners. Music, athletics, and many other areas would benefit if their present teachers would take this seriously, and then follow-up with other books in the same vein.
0375836675|4.0|I enjoyed this book. The author writes with clarity and allows the reader to get to know the characters as they develop within the story. The moral of the story is very overt and right there in your face and can be interpreted as a bit &#34;preachy&#34; by people wo are overtly cynical, but the overarching theme and the point of the book is something that we all could benefit from taking to heart. This is a fun book that I would recommend to anyone that is looking for some light reading with a wholesome message and some uplifting themes. I laughed, I cried, I ordered Chinese and then volunteered at a soup kitchen.
0385344228|2.0|A personal opinion, and only bought as my book group choice. I finished it, but wished I hadn't. Not a choice I would make for a friend.

This isn't to say I wouldn't have made the same choice again, but the size of this thing (and what it limits in my case) makes the choice less clear than I decided it was at the end.<br /><br />I purchased with this an [[ASIN:B00066ISFC Antec TriCool 120mm Cooling Fan with 3-Speed Switch]] for a second fan (the unit only comes with one) and left it at its factory setting - its lowest spin speed - after putting it on. Also, rather than using the Cooler Master thermal paste that comes with the unit, I purchased [[ASIN:B0002VFXFE Arctic Silver 5 Polysynthetic Silver Thermal Compound Paste 3.5g]] and used that instead.<br /><br />It's unsurprising that this is better than the stock cooling unit that came with my AMD Phenom ii chip, but I was surprised at how much so. Even after unlocking two of my chips cores (for a total of four) and overclocking, idling and light duty temperatures are cooler by at least 20°F (~10°C) than what they were previously with the standard two cores and factory clock setting. The temperature difference before and after is even greater under heavy processing.<br /><br />Installation was only slightly more of a pain than normal for replacing one of these. That was because the instructions were confusing. After deciding to ignore the majority of those instructions (a few were still important to note, once understood better) it was simpler, but if you don't have experience with installing CPU coolers, this one is a bit tricky. Even if you do, it might be helpful to look up a video.<br /><br />One thing that disturbs me is that when installed and tightened, there's still a possibility for the unit to turn in its bracing. Perhaps this is a feature. After all, it helped me square it once it was on without loosening it, and it does remain stationary while running or moving the case around. Despite that, I can't lose the feeling of this-shouldn't-be-happening and taking another look at the instructions doesn't show that I missed anything. No problems so far, but I thought I'd mention it.<br /><br />The big issue that made my rating less than five stars (though if there was a 4.5, I'd prefer to give that) is the size. In my mid tower case, the top of it comes so close to the panel you normally remove to get to the innards that replacing the panel after whatever work you do is a little nerve-racking. The biggest trouble this made for me is because the outer panel on my case has a hole machined into it for a fan. Not only was I unable to install a case fan there, but I had to cover the hole. Another result of its size meant I wasn't able to arrange my cables as artfully with regard to air circulation as I'd like. One could argue that it doesn't matter so much because the unit works so nicely (and there's still room for some extra fans for the rest of the system), but it's bothersome, at least.<br /><br />That last issue is also the issue that made me wish I'd considered a little longer; or, more specifically, considered that factor when compared to the smaller liquid units that would likely work at *least* as well. However, the price of this unit at less than half of the cheapest liquid unit, plus the fantastic performance, means that the above are all nitpicks after the fact. I wouldn't return this item and opt for a liquid unit instead, but if I'd known before I purchased and installed, I might have gone the liquid route instead.ain stationary while running or moving the case around.

B004ZY0VHY|5.0|This is the first book I've read by Lionel Shriver and it certainly won't be the last.  The story is a dark one, but the author does a superb job of giving that darkness a depth you won't find in many other novels about similar subject matter.  Told from the perspective of a woman who struggles with the very construction of motherhood, &#34;We Need to Talk About Kevin&#34; focuses on the disconnect between humans bound by a social contract and what happens when we as humans lose faith in that unspoken agreement.  Eva is a beautifully written and supremely complex character whose chilling honesty sets the reader up to meet Kevin, the emotionally void son and subject of Eva's letters to Franklin.  If there is anything more unnerving than Kevin's actions and cold detachedness, it's Eva's ability to openly discuss her misgivings about motherhood and her struggle to love her tormented son.<br /><br />I could not put this book down and was disappointed when I turned the last page, knowing that I wouldn't be able to continue reading this incredible story.  Shriver is incredibly talented and has a knack for upending the sublime to root out the darkness underneath.  Put this book in your cart right now.

B0070Y46UY|3.0|The Indian narrator's father was so enamoured of swimming pools that he named his son Piscine, which unfortunately lent itself to the kind of mispronunciation with which the boy's schoolmates mocked him.  So when he moved to his secondary school, he firmly announced that his name was Pi.<br /><br />Pi's father ran a huge zoo in Pondicherry in the 1970s.  The narrator gives a thought-provoking defence of well-run zoos and an attack on the \\"myth\\" that animals are \\"freer\\" in the wild.  His father warns his children against anthropomorphizing animals, and always to remember that, however cuddly they may be as youngsters, they are almost all potential killers or maimers if you approach the adults as if they liked you as much as you liked them.  And there are many other words of wisdom about  what animals need and what they fear, and how a good zoo keeper will understand that.<br /><br />From infancy Pi grew up steeped, first in the sounds, sights and smells of Hinduism and then its teaching, one of whose remarkable qualities it is that it there is room in it for all gods of all religions, including Christianity.  The adolescent Pi himself, despite his misgivings about how unlike the Christian and the Muslim God is to the gods of Hinduism, recognizes that, in their pure form, these religions, like that of the Hindus, teach Love, and he embraces them all together, worshipping in temple, church and mosque - to the anger of their presiding clerics when they find out, and to the perplexity of his \\"modern\\" father.<br /><br />All this takes up the first quarter of the book - no hint yet of the  shipwreck and the lifeboat together with the tiger, which is what the cover of the book and the film suggest the book is really all about.<br /><br />Pi's father found Mrs Gandhi's rule intolerable, and decided that the family should emigrate to Canada.  He would ship the animals across the Pacific with them with a view to selling them on arrival and starting a new life.  The Japanese cargo ship goes down in a storm, and only Pi, the tiger, a zebra, an orang-outang and a hyena survive and share a life-boat.  The story now for the most part loses its philosophical content and becomes an well-told and long (in my opinion over-long)  \\"adventure\\" one about survival at sea.  The latter three animals don't make it - the details are horrific -  and in the end Pi shares the boat with the tiger.  The danger that the tiger will make a meal of Pi is slowly transformed into a less terrifying coexistence, partly because Pi really knows a lot about animals.  He is also avery practical sixteen-year-old and he learns fast, and is only occasionally lamed by fear or sorrow. At times he briefly reflects philosophically: against  the infinite sea and the infinite sky, he reflects that his suffering was finite and insignificant.  He survived an astonishing 227 days.  When he and the tiger are at the point of death, they are restored to life in a totally surreal episode in which the strains of incredulity under which the story has laboured all the while finally snaps.<br /><br />Since the story is told in the first person singular, I am not giving away anything when I say that he survived to tell his story to the representatives of the Japanese shipping company. They don't believe his story, which doesn't fit in with anything in their experience;  so, after making some philosophical points about rejecting ideas that do not fall within our experience, he tells them another one which they find more credible because - they realize - it substitutes human beings for the animals in the life-boat.<br /><br />Many of the stimulus questions in the appendix point towards the religious elements of the novel; but I think that after the first promising quarter, that strand was too thin for the adventure to be a kind of parable, and I cannot quite share the enthusiasm with which the book has been received.rgo ship goes down in a storm, and only Pi, the tiger, a zebra, an orang-outang and a hyena survive and share a life-boat.

0738212415|5.0|I need to draw diagrams occasionally for work, so I already have the ability to draw various line-art, schematic-style 3D drawings.  However, at only lesson 4, I've learned loads on how to draw more realistic drawings.  Shading, shadows, perspective, foreshortening, etc are all tools of the trade for drawing that I'd never really learned.<br /><br />The author's writing style is easy and supportive, and each lesson has many many drawings to help you along if you're confused about what _exactly_ to do next.  While I recommend this for adults, it is also suitable for kids.  Read some of the sample pages to make sure its not over your child's reading level, then have them go at it.  They'll thank you later in life. ;)<br /><br />No special equipment is needed, but I am using a &#34;Sanford Design Drawing 3800 4B&#34; drawing pencil, which at 4B, is soft enough to get good and dark lines.  The author recommends a run-of-the-mill mechanical pencil.  He also recommends a &#34;Clic Eraser&#34; which I happened to already be using and also recommend.  If you go the non-mechanical pencil route, pick up a small pencil sharpener as well.<br /><br />I found an inexpensive lay-flat spiral sketch book that I am using.  The sheets are only about 6&#34;x8.5&#34; and my drawings are a little cramped.  I wanted something small so I could carry it with me easily, but a normal-sized journal might have been at better bet.

I know the composite inputs work because I connect other devices to it, and that works.<br /><br />But even if it did work, it would be useless to me.  I was hoping to use the cable to do display mirroring -- the same video on the iPad and on the DVD player, so that both my kids could watch the same movie at the same time.

B004RFYEEC|5.0|Take a deep breath, say something, then put a period at the end of your sentence.<br /><br />That last part of the line was something that took Brian Wilson could not do from 1967 until the end of 2012, when this massive box set was issued. We finally have the last word on SMILE, rock and roll's most famous, unissued monolith.<br /><br />Why is this important to music and why is this important to music now. These are two questions any non-fanatic Beach Boy fan would be asking his or her self before plunking down the hundred or so dollars for this massive, almost supernaturally  content-rich set.<br /><br />The answer to both questions are more than exclaimed in The Smile Sessions, recorded in 1966-7. That was when Brian Wilson, musical mastermind behind his band, was coming of the sonic and emotional mastery of [[ASIN:B000SZZIH2 Pet Sounds]]. In those rock yore days, Wilson had the Beatles, Motown, Phil Spector, and other major voices in music to compete with, when the way to rise to the top of the rock heap was to outdo the competition with music uniquely your own.<br /><br />Wilson hired lyricist Van Dyke Parks and started recording the music and vocals for \\"a teenage symphony to God,\\" an album with Dumb Angel as a working title.<br /><br />These heavenly proclamations were no hype, considering the music. There was the vocal mastery of \\"Hereos And Villians,\\" the beauty of the Bachesque \\"Wonderful\\" \\"Cabinessence\\" sounded like vocal church music, while tracks like \\"Barnyard\\" had echos of Aaron Copland.<br /><br />There were more than enough masterful ideas coming from Wilson during the Smile session, more than even he knew what to do with. The Beatles had support from George Martin. Phil Spector ran his studio like a horse stable, and Motown did in fact grind out hits like a factory.<br /><br />But Brian was going it alone, working with a conservative band, doing mountains of LSD, and dealing with the beginnings of a mental illness he didn't understand. He had no idea how to make the ideas presented here cohere. \\"A lot of the bags we got into were just not for vocals\\" Wilson said.<br /><br />And the pressure was on. The Beatles were working on Sgt' Pepper, the album to top Revolver, their masterpiece to date. Soon, that ship had sailed, and Wilson abandoned Smile.<br /><br />That June, 1967, The Beach Boy's missed the Moteray Pop Festival, which was the change of the guard from teen beat to counterculture rock. \\"You'll never hear surf music again\\" said Jimi Hendrix from the stage.<br /><br />Actually, you could have, had Smile been released in full and not in truncated slabs on albums like [[ASIN:B008LA7RI4 Smiley Smile]] and [[ASIN:B000002TRD 20/20]]. What holds this material so well together is its sense of wonder and grandeur--the amazing webs of vocals, and classical sense of instrumentation.<br /><br />Smile is about Americana--not revolving around a particular theme, but playing like a psychedelic photo album of a 1960's road trip. A strange album to make with a musical and cultural revolution going on. There were cities burning, and Brian Wilson is singing about the happiness of \\"Vegetables.\\"<br /><br />Of course none of this matters now: the music is what counts, and on this set, we get to hear it from several vital perspectives.<br /><br />First, the entire album is presented on both CD and double LP. The sound is fantastic on both, and as for the LP you get to see, here and touch the Smile that would have been issued in 1967. You even get two 45 rpm discs, a story book and a poster. This was the era when feeling the weight of an album in your hand, with cover art and surprises inside, were part of the music buying experience, and this set multiplies this by the pound.<br /><br />But this issue is  the easy part: the hard part was--obviously-- making the album, and here, you get breakdowns of every track on the remaining discs of this massive set. It is amazingly instructive to hear all this, as bands like the High Llamas and Olivia Tremor Control made entire careers based on Smile issues, both official and bootleg, trying to make the masterpiece they never could have had Wilson actually finished Smile. You might not be able to digest these out takes and backing tracks in one mouthful, but a serious music person will find years of listening in this set.<br /><br />So: is it a masterpiece. Absolutely. It is impossible to go back to 1967 and hear this in the context it was meant to be released in, and no one can make music like this anymore. But taken for what it is on a musical level this album is a masterpiece of style and nuance and texture. Taken for what was never released and what could have been and what IS, this set is complete, and absolutely essential.amas and Olivia Tremor Control made entire careers based on Smile issues, both official and bootleg, trying to make the masterpiece they never could have had Wilson actually finished Smile.

B001E45XT4|5.0|So I bought this headset for around $20 when it was on sale. Holy crap am I lucky to be able to do that, because they are absolutely amazing!<br /><br />Sound:<br />On their own, this headset is pretty decent sounding. You can get the lows pretty nice and deep, the highs are clear and the mids are crisp and nice.<br />But when amped and equalized:...<br /><br />My god these things are just insane. The bass vibrates your face and the highs are amazing. Everything is. Seriously.<br /><br />Any gamer out there who wants some great audio experience should consider these. Great microphone and durable everything.<br /><br />Now the toughness part:<br /><br />Mine have broken twice. But I bought them TWO YEARS AGO.<br />YEAH. For $20. They have lasted TWO years.<br /><br />If you are scared of a little super-glue and electrical tape, these might last a year for you, but what I put these things through, whoo,<br />im surprised they still work. Yet, these things work like they were NEW.<br /><br />I have thrown these down laundry shafts and out of cars and everything. They will take whatever<br />you throw at them with a grain of salt. They are easy to repair and I LOVE THE COMFORT!<br /><br />Seriously! Most comfortable headset I have ever put on so far, and I have had tons.<br />The foam at the top is extremely comfortable, they are extremely adjustable and will STAY on your head.<br />I absolutely LOVE the thick arm design. The mic portion is really nice too and extremely durable.<br /><br />Overall, these beasts have lasted me forever, have been through hell twice and came back, are extremely comfortable and can pump bass and give great<br />immersion and spacial awareness like a boss! Must buy if you can find them on ebay cheap!

B005LAIIQC|4.0|At first glimpse this film looked like a waste of time. But in fact it was actually not that bad of a continuation of this particular franchise.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It was a pretty good book with interesting enough characters. Not sure the ending was done well, but a fun book to read.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a fun game that teases your brain!<br />The whole family enjoys playing this game an  the different levels is good for everyone&hellip;
B007EECSFA|5.0|Another book club read.it was a very easy read and finished it in two days. Loved the ending! Great World War Two book about women in England.
B000J5XS3C|5.0|EXACTLY what I needed.  Small, compact, functional, and it works!  No off/on power switch though but small consideration when you think about what it can do.  Connect mics, iPods, MP3 players...and control sound and volume, at your fingertips!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I've had numerous calculators and out of all of them I still use this one. Love the size and functions!
0345533054|5.0|I am a huge Harlan Coben fan, and I was definitely not disappointed on this one!  I couldn't put it down.  Just when I thought I had it figured out, the twists came again!  The protagonist's humor reminded me of Myron also which was nice because I miss the Myron books!
B005EGXTHG|5.0|As an author [...]I love gripping plot lines and memorable characters. I lived and breathed this story alongside the characters, barely pausing to stop for sustenance. The final sentance was still echoing in my brain as I scrambled to download Book 3.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|This is not going to be the same as something you've paid $100's of dollars for. But for the price, it is well worth buying. Since it is a lapel mic, you won't have an issue with popping and hissing of P's and S's. I use it to record my narration for elearning development and it works great.
B0012BQ60O|5.0|This mounted swordsman is a great addition to the Schliech fluer di lis soldier set. The figure is highly detailed and has been painted to perfection. I'm sure that those of you out there that allready have a Schliech figure understand the high quality involved in thier products. For first time purchasers you are in for a treat, believe it or not the photo's of Schliech figures do not do them justice. If you purchase a Schliech figure for the first time when you open the box undo the packageing wires and hold these figures in your hand & see them up close you will be amazed. Each figure is hand painted the soldier in this photo differs from my mounted soldier with sword,the soldier in this photo is older with a greying beard while the one I got is younger with a golden blonde beard. He is posed in a position suggesting he is not in eminate danger but has his sword & shield raised to respond quickly to any threat. He also has a flanged mace at his side incase he comes up against a heavily armoured opponent. Like I said before if your familar with Schliech this is a great addition to your Fluer De Lis collection If your a first time buyer of Schliech produts you will hold it in your hand and wonder is this a toy? or is this a mini statue collectors piece? however you look at it these figures are durable enough to let the kids play with and beautifull enough for decorating your flat spaces as unique historical figurines.
0525478817|5.0|I got this book for my 17 year old daughter and she raved so much about it, I had to read it!<br />It had great characters who made you root for them and really understand from their point of view what they were going through.
B00AKYRCNY|4.0|My 4 year old son really enjoys puzzles and he has loved this game. I only wish it had more options as he gets bored after a couple of minutes. Would download again.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Good for anyone who thinks they have too many obstacles to overcome. I don't think I should have to have a certain amount of words on this review.  I really liked it.  That should be enough if that is all I want to say.
B008XG1X18|5.0|They have alot of great ideas how to decorate and lot of helful tips and hints,also the pics of the gardens helps me get ideas on bedding plants.
0451197879|1.0|I have slowly been making my way through the Richard Bachman books, and for the most part I have not been that impressed. I like dark and dreary, and thought this book would be so much better than it was. I was wrong.<br /><br />The book didn't have much of a description, but knowing the type of writing I have come to expect from Stephen King I was hopeful. Between the story being about a guy who is loosing his house for a highway project, and King's talent for writing deep, memorable characters, I though this would be very intriguing. Sadly the further I got into the book the more I wanted to put it down. If it hadn't been for the fact I was listening to the audio book, I would have stopped and probably never gone back.<br /><br />I can understand that the main character Barton was upset about loosing his house and wanted to do something about it. I was really hoping he would loose his marbles and take out his aggression. Instead, Bart whines constantly and only furthers his downward spiral. King always has a knack for creating characters that you can bond with and feel sorry for, or even feel the emotions as the character feels them. All I felt with Bart was dislike. I really didn't like the character and didn't feel sorry for him one bit. Everything Bart did to make his life worse was totally his fault. If King intended for the reader to hate the main character he succeeded.<br /><br />This is defiantly not one of King's best and I can see why he wrote it under a different name. If I was a writer I wouldn't want this associated with my name either.
B009JCL58G|4.0|I don't understand how this wasn't nominated for Best Original Score and the End Title was nominated for Best Original Song. It's a beautiful soundtrack.
0307341577|2.0|So this is actually the third book I read by Gillian Flynn and I think her other two ruined this one for me. Sharp Objects, and Gone Girlwere both such captivating stories that when I got around to this one I was rather bored. My expectations were higher than they should have been going into this.<br /><br />Before I get into the heart of my review I must comment that Gillian Flynn is a wonderful writer and her talents clearly show in this book. It is very well written and the characters are well developed, but when it came to the characters, I didn't like a single one of them. Her dark and disturbing style is clearly evident and I like that about her. I like the dark tone of her stories and when I pick up one of her books I have come to expect that. This book was just not my favorite.<br /><br />One of the reasons I didn't like this books was just that the characters are not likable. I couldn't connect with any of the characters and to be honest I didn't care to much about what happened to them in the end. I actually think I would have enjoyed this better if they all had been wiped out in the end. Again I think her other books, with characters that were interesting and a more in-depth, ruined this book for me. I kept comparing the other books, even thought I know I shouldn't<br /><br />The other issue I had with this story was the plot itself. There was a lot of potential to be one heck of a mystery while Libby tries to figure out who actually murdered her family. Half way through the book I was bored and not really interested in going further. Still I am stubborn and powered through this audio book. The ending was less thrilling because my interest had wandered and I just wanted it to be over. Still, I can see that Gillian Flynn is a great writer and I loved her other works. I look forward to her next book when ever that is and still think highly of her as an author, this was just one book I didn't enjoy.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|They must have changed the design of this case since some of these reviews were posted, because with my Kindle inserted in the case in the most optimal way ( with the ports always accessible) the auto-sleep feature works perfectly. Ignore any review that says otherwise. I just got mine, so issues may come up, but the stand feature works great, the strap keeps the case closed and I don't feel like it will distort the case over time, and I could charge it in the stand position and still have the auto-sleep/wake feature work. I'm confident this case will stand up to everything I'll put it through.
0316228532|2.0|I have given this review a lot of thought. I have been on the fence as to just how I was going to rate this book, but then my wife said I should look at the books I have rated 3 stars and see if this would fit with those. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that I didn't enjoy this as much as any of the books I previously gave three stars. So this is why I gave it two.<br /><br />Honestly, I don't have much to say about this book other than this just wasn't for me. I knew going into this that it wasn't something I would normally read but I wanted to give it a try. I am not one of those people who didn't like the book because they expected it to be Harry Potter, I actually liked the fact this was going to be nothing like the HP series so I thought I would enjoy this a bit more than I did. What it came down to was that this was a character study, and I am just not a fan of those. I need more action, or a deeper plot than filling a seat on the town government. Yes the characters are deep and have issues all there own but I was bored and really should have just quite and moved on. Still, I am stubborn and finish what I start, but I also wanted to give JK Rowling the chance to wow me.<br /><br />The two star rating is purely because I didn't enjoy this book. I am not saying this was a bad book, I just didn't enjoy it. I do have a few good things to say about this book. JK Rowling is an amazing author. Her talent is clearly evident in this book, and it was very well done. My biggest praise for her would be her characters and how she transitions from each point of view. Her characters are all very well developed and they each have their own personalities. This is a rare quality in an author and only a few I read can do this. She also does a great job transitioning between each character's story. I have read other books that are very heavy with characters and they just can't seamlessly transition like Rowling did. With these other works I found myself lost andhaving to go back and re-read. I was not lost once while reading this book. I will not slam an author especially on a review of another author's work so I won't be putting examples of poor character transitions.<br /><br />I will finish with this; Clearly Rowling is trying to show she is not just a writer of young Adult fiction. The language in this book is very heavily vulgar, and not what I was expecting. Now I am not offended by any of this, but if I was playing a drinking game for every vulgar word I would have been drunk a quarter of the way through. This is not a bad book, I was just bored. If you like character studies then I would recommend this for you. If you are like me and you need a deeper plot, or more action I would say give this a pass.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app was the first one I downloaded on my Christmas gift Kindle.  I have found it to be one of the most useful app I have.  I like how it estimates time remaining for any possible use. This app lives on my favorite bar and is both the first and the last thing I check on my tablet.
0553386794|2.0|Finally I am finished. I knew going into this book that it would be a long epic read. However,I was not prepared for it to feel so long. I knew little about this book from the start, I knew it was a popular series on HBO and so many people (including most of my friends here on goodreads)loved this book. I am not a huge fan of Sci-Fi but I loved the Lord of the Rings, and I really liked stories of knights and dragons so I thought I would give this a try. It was not for me.<br /><br />So I worry about writing this review with it only being 2 stars; because there are people very passionate about this series and I don't want to offend anyone. I really tried to like this book, I even started over twice to make sure I didn't miss anything when I was really lost a quarter of the way through. I just couldn't stay focused on this book. I really should have just wanted to stop reading it, but my stubbornness got the better of me.<br /><br />My issue with this was the fact there were way to many characters to keep track of. It had a few characters that I enjoyed following through the book but for the most part I just didn't care about the different story lines after awhile. To me there was way to much description/dialog and not enough action. Over halfway through I finally got to some jousting and evil plotting that pulled me in a bit but sadly it wasn't enough to keep me that interested. Towards the end the only reason I was reading it was to just finish. I didn't care how it ended or which characters lived or died.<br /><br />I must take time to give credit where it is due. George R.R. Martin is a great writer. He was very detailed (sometimes to a fault), and developed his characters well. I might not have liked them all but the characters I did enjoy following were very well thought out in my opinion. I can understand why people would get so wrapped up in this series because of the characters. I can say that after reading this book I will not be continuing on with the others.s.
B009GEEMLY|3.0|My friends raved.  I was mildly entertained at times. Just meh--didn't suck, didn't rock. It wasn't worth the $5 though.
0451197968|3.0|This was a nice change from the normal King book. I can see why he decided to write it under the name Richard Bachman because I think some fans would have been disappointed.<br /><br />This is a short book for King and it was very fast paced. The beginning establishes the characters and story. Shortly after that the chase begins and the book doesn't let up. I enjoyed it quite a bit, however, it wasn't my favorite book or my favorite from King. I did desire a change of pace from what I have been reading and thought I would give his Bachman novel a try. I'm glad I did.
B0076UXKDG|5.0|It is over priced but the 3rd party products look cheap and do not last.Search the reviews and you will see what I mean. Bite the bullet and get it. You will not be disappointed.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|WOW!  I just could not put this book down.  It drew me in right from the beginning.  I loved the unconventional little family.  The love. I'm just so glad that Mia decided to stay. For her, for Adam and all the people that loved her!  Thank you for a great read. LMK

B006OAB3ME|5.0|Not your usual McCartney but combined with all the great musicians on the CD I think it could become a classic.
1592402690|4.0|I would agree with most of the readers who say Emerick is a McCartney man,<br />and largely, in my view, with good reason:  despite some mistakes like the Magical<br />Mystery Tour film, it was Paul who kept the Beatles going (and working) after<br />Brian Epstein died.  And it's a myth that John alone was responsible for pushing The<br />Beatles into new creative territory.  John wrote and performed many timeless<br />songs, but he did his share of utter crap, too: the unlistenable \\"Revolution #9\\"<br />for instance. And like many geniuses, John was not always the best judge of what<br />was good and bad in his own work.  Overall, \\"Here, There & Everywhere\\" is a must<br />read for any fan of the greatest band ever.  I'd nick it for half a star because of some<br />factual errors:  Paul didn't want \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" to sound like Mantovani, not as<br />Emerick says:  \\"Mancini.\\"  Also, he leaves the impression that McCartney had no role<br />in the vocals on \\"Come Together.\\" Paul can be clearly heard harmonizing to John's<br />lead.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Absolutely love it! It was just so amazing I have no words to describe it<br />Definitely recommended to everyone and thanks Colleen Hoover for writting an amazing novel i definitely would have paid a lot more money for it thanks!
0316187216|5.0|I love this author. His books pull the reader into the world he has created. As a cliche, his books are page-turners.

B007HACDLK|4.0|This book was intriguing. The Mitch Rapp character is a bit on the dark side and he has become more hardened  over the years but he remains a true patriot.I enjoy the character and the missions he undertakes to keep the world safe.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This trilogy pack has the best value out there. The dark knight rises is a great movie. The set is packed with loads of extra features. Its definitely worth the money. Plus it's blu ray so the picture is perfect!
B007ZYABW6|2.0|I hadn't read any reviews of \\"The Long Walk\\" before finding it at a used bookstore.  The copy I read even had a positive quote on the front cover by my former History Professor Stephen Ambrose.  The first half of this relatively short book is similar to other WWII POW stories.  However, the second half is progressively unbelievable.  They may go months on very little food, but crossing the Gobi with almost no water! In fact, they go many days with NO WATER!  By the end of the trek they have two giant Yeti blocking the trail.  I then looked at some info about the author and found there is no evidence to prove his tale.  The evidence that does exist clearly contradicts Mr. Rawiez's story.  There is a lot of info online.  There are so many other true stories of human endurance, why waste your time on this fiction.  Shame on the people who were not skeptical enough in their reviews.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great app that helps me unwind or keeps me from being bored. I don't win very often, but that is my lack of focus more than anything else.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|One of the best Nicholas sparks books I've ever read. Couldn't put it down for days! Read this book now!
B0011UJMK2|5.0|This is a book about atrocities.....and that doesn't even begin with the murders.  I had very mixed feelings about reading this material, serial killing involving children!?  Totally went against my sensibility.  I would never have picked this book, except it was a book club read.  This is why I joined a book club...what a great story I would have missed!!  Stalin's regime sets the stage. It's so hard to believe such mind-control existed for an entire nation, so incredibly sad to know family turns against family, you do not know who you can trust.  In this years-spanning novel, the author writes with so much description, you feel the cold in your bones, the emptiness of your belly, even the distrust of your family and friends.  The first chapters, as he lays the groundwork, may be hard to get through, but the payoff towards the end are more than worth the effort!! I came to love and cheer for Leo and Raisa, they were their own trial to overcome!
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Funny, tight controls, good graphics, difficult, if you like top down space shooters, you will like this. Also: DISRUPTOR LASER!
1400069289|5.0|This book is excellent.  I think everyone should read this.  When I bought it I figured I'd learn about habits and how I could go about changing my bad ones....  This book takes an indepth look at the POWER of habits, and how it affects every area of our lives, from our own habits to the habits of corporations.  How misguided, unintentional habits can cause a business to fail, a marriage to fail etc., often without the people involved knowing exactly what hit them!  You really need to read this book for yourself.  IJS.  (I'm just saying).
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love a good love story and this book definitely did not let me down. The passionate romance mixed with heart-wrenching tragedy make for long nights and endless coffee trips.<br />I recommends to anyone looking for romance and a easy read
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Elizabeth<br /><br />I am thoroughly addicted to this series, and this book provided more ups and downs than a soup opera!
0545265355|5.0|My daughter loved this book series. This set was a great value for three hard covered books of a popular series.
B0065Y5P8C|5.0|I enjoy the depth of this album, there are many different varieties of songs on here, it doesn't sound like the same song 16 times as some artists have a knack of doing.  In addition, Jessie J simply has one of the best voices I have heard in a very long time.  Very talented lady, and a wonderful album.

B005LAIHXQ|5.0|Excellent prequel to the original, too bad back in the day the availability to the new special effects would have been really cool for the older film.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Mystery manor is a rather fun game that is pretty good for being free. If it wasn't then I'd probably be eating it a 4 star game instead. Luckily for the game though, it is. I find it a good picture find game that does manage to challenge you and keep your interest as well while most can only do one or the other. I do wish though that it had an end somewhere in the game so you could actually feel like you're working toward a goal and not an endless quest. Overall though it is a fairly good game and worth the get.

0765325950|5.0|The coming of the Last Battle and the roles that the many characters would play during the ultimate clash have been crafted over many years and many books. Usually when I read a series of such length and breadth, I find the ending somewhat disappointing, too quickly and neatly wrapped up. I didn't have that feeling after reading A Memory of Light. I'm trying to avoid spoilers here since I am writing this within a week of the book's release. Battle scenes dominate the book, but we knew the entire series was leading to the Last Battle and that is what we get. Within the battle, just about every character from the series is engaged and things that happened many books ago are revealed to have been more important than they seemed at the time. The pacing of the book is fast in many places, but that adds to the sense of the urgency of battle. Rand's understanding of the nature of the Dark One and how he must adapt his plans, his need to re-evaluate what it will take and what it means to win the battle complete the development of his character and lead us to an ending slightly different than the ending we might have expected.
0143120530|3.0|I was expecting a book on mnemonic techniques and memory building skills, but was left disappointed. Going back and rereading the book's description, I guess there's nothing that explicitly states it teaches any of these things, so I can't criticize it as such.<br /><br />My only complaint is the genre. As with any of its counterparts, books like Freakonomics, Wisdom of Crowds, or anything written by Malcolm Gladwell or Robert Greene, the book draws heavily on circumstantial evidence and theoretical reasoning to support its premise. As such, these types of books are almost void of anything providing educational or professional development, and good for little more than \\"entertainment value.\\"<br /><br />That said, I did find this book was fairly interesting to read, more interesting than the above mentioned titles/authors. I was just hoping for something more educational than entertaining.

B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This show is phenomenal. If you don't know the premise of the series and are hooked after season 1, beware that the stories between seasons are in no way connected. The actors carry through, but in different roles. Each season is a different type of horror. I love how this season reflects on the ideals and issues of the 1950s and 1960s.

B005COO1X6|4.0|I really liked this story! It was scary and out there as promised. The only thing I did'nt like was the length. I could have read on for quite a while. Definately worth a read.
B007B5EDEG|4.0|George Martin has a knack of keeping readers, well, reading. The story just never ends! Though, most chapters go slowly, and could have used a little more spice. I would reccomend this book to those who enjoy reading about mythical creatures and war. A strange combination, but undeniably intriguing.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Plays well and fast if you have a good eye. No ads if you are off Wi-Fi. Excellent game for concentration and building hand eye coordination and memory skills.  I play this quite a bit as a self challenge too, attempting to beat prior times.
B003T0G9XU|5.0|And I thought the story of Tiffany and her Nac Mac Feegle ended in Wintersmith! I have never been more wrong in my life! Terry Prachet keeps his readers engrossed (and laughing) in these magical, witty adventures. I loved every word of it! I would reccomend this book to those people who could really use a good laugh.
B005KELWJY|5.0|I like the feel and it makes it feel more like a book, with out a cover on my kindle it feels so thin and fragile , best product of the money.

B002H1J2AO|5.0|John Belushi at the beginning of a short meteoric career.  It does play a bit thin, but only because we've had the opportunity to see it many times.  The HD remake is a whole new movie.  If you haven't seen this, check it out.
B004P8JPS6|1.0|I have long been a fan of Lee Child and Jack Reacher. I have read and enjoyed all the JR books. However on re-reading The Persuader, I am troubled by what I read. I fully realize that this is a work of fiction. Just the same, I am now disturbed by what Reacher does in it. He becomes 'judge, jury and executioner' for at least 3 people in this book. (Sorry, I may have lost count.) There are the good guys and the bad guys. Child makes it clear who is in which category. If life were only so simple. If only there were simple answers to complex problems. If only the bad guys were all a part of complex, unlikely conspiracies.<br /><br />This book gives the illusion of justice. Forget due process, just kill them. I don't think we can afford this myth any longer. We see too many examples of individuals evidently using this it as justification for murder, even of 6-year old children. I am NOT suggesting any direct connection. But I begin to wonder if this culture of 'taking the law' doesn't promote this type of behavior. Are we willing to take that chance? I find myself unwilling to do so.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|It kept me wondering how everything that happened was connected. It was different from most other Grisham books. It was not your typical courtroom/lawyer Grisham book.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Honestly I was addicted to this app it is so fun there is so much to figure out it is eerie and creepy it is so much fun

B0052RDHTM|5.0|I had heard about this book for a long while but hesitated.  I have not found a book I loved since I finished the Outlander series.  It is a fantastic story with vivid writing.

B000KIPT30|5.0|After an attempt to use [[ASIN:B005INJ4ZG My Zone Wireless Headphones]] was a bust for me due to its terrible sound quality, my techie husband bought this amp for me as part of a setup that allows me to listen to TV as loud as I want without disturbing him or the neighbors.<br /><br />I directly hook up this amp to a head phone or earbuds when I am sitting close to the TV by using a special [[ASIN:B00009UVPN adapter]]. Head phones and earbuds have a 1/8 inch (3.5 mm) male jack (AKA male connector). Without an adapter, they can't be inserted into this amp, whose plug (AKA socket, female jack, or female connector) measures 1/4 inch (6.35 mm).<br /><br />Because I like to move around my living room when I am watching TV, my husband also bought me a special [[ASIN:B0010CX798 male-to-female, headphone adapter, extension cable]]. The 1/4-inch, male jack of this cable fits into the 1/4-inch plug of this amp, and it has a 1/8-inch plug on its other end into which the jack of a head phone or ear bud can fit.<br /><br />In order to use this setup, my husband also hooked into this amp a [[ASIN:B000068O3F male-to-male extension cable]]; one end is 1/8-inch and the other is 1/4-inch in diameter. The smaller end fits into a plug on the TV. When I want to use this external speaker source, I use the TV remote to access a menu that allows me to do that. Once this system is hooked up, I can no longer adjust the sound volume on the TV itself. I use the volume control on this amp.<br /><br />Note that there is no On/Off switch on this amp. If you want to turn it off, so that you are not wasting electricity when it is not in use, you unhook the power cord from the far-left side of the amp.<br /><br />This setup is a little complicated for the non-techie to figure out on their own, but if you have anyone techie in your family who can do it for you, it works really well.
0307749495|5.0|I like Jack Reacher. Lee Child is an very good writer. Any buddy who likes action will like this book.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|It's pretty fun. What u do is u start out with a few pets and then you upgrade those pets to prettier ones by washing them, feeding them, and simply playing with them. Overall, a great game.

B009CPJHY4|5.0|This film is about a group of  seniors who all find them selves on their way to India to retire and live because for one reason or another, they can no longer afford to retire in England, their home.  This is a timely, realistic story for today with some fun characters.  There are some wonderful Indian actors and fantastic dependable English ones too!  The cast is fantastic ( Maggie Smith & Judy Dench) and charming.  I really enjoyed this one!
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I liked the available translations & ease in moving around but the app on my Kindle doesn't keep up with the app on the cellphone. Good highlighting options. A little hard to go back & catch up

B00571F26Y|5.0|I also bought the cookbook and started on a wheat free regimen on the first of January.  I lost 12 pounds the first week.  More importantly, I no longer have the constant craving for food.  I now find myself satisfied with a lot less food.  I am also learning to cook the different recipes in the cookbook.  I totally recommend either book to anyone that wants to try a program that works.

1451648537|5.0|Forget about the number of pages.  The book is riddled with insightful tips for any startup or ongoing business.  The whole time I am reading, I am taking notes on how to have a more structured business.  Yes, Jobs was driven, however because of his drive, the world is blessed with products we would not have known otherwise.  He will be with us forever.

9992435135|5.0|I give this book as a gift to any family celebrating the birth of a second child.  It is fun and accessible, helpful and superior to others on this topic. The authors have the right information to take the family to the next level.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I like Grisham.  I love the legal thrillers and courtroom drama.  This time, he fooled  me.  So refreshing to read a longtime great author who manages to step outside his norm.  Cleverly done.
B004DM0UII|5.0|I got this for the free app of the day since it had Shoutcast capabillities. It's smooth, awesome and works well. I recommend it. There are free radio apps that are good, too, but this one seems to run more smoothly and you actually get Shoutcast stations, which are hard to find free like this on Android. Not that this is free now.<br /><br />I like how the search feature searches songs that the stations are playing instead of the station name, but it would be nice if I could search the station name, too.
B0062P332Y|3.0|Not what I have come to expect from Jason.  He normally leaves me wanting to come back for more.  I have watched this twice and still don't have that feel good felling I usually get from his movies.

B004CEUEWE|3.0|Checked this one out based on a number of favorable reviews. Was it as good as promised? Yes and no. Good acting and some interesting characters - but the story moved along at a sluggish pace and predictable path. Not a bad movie - just not a memorable one...

B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Sci-Fi lives!!! If (like me) you're expecting an &#34;Alien Prequel&#34;, initial viewings will be perplexing and disappointing. Once you get past that, and treat this movie as a new, stand-alone, story and film, you will quickly grow to appreciate it.  Interesting story with fantastic special effects, this one has become a personal favorite.  Highly recommend the four disk special edition with an outstanding 3 hour &#34;behind the scenes&#34; documentary.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This game is really fun and addictive! I really love  that it had a story and really made me think. I also really appreciate that I didn't have to pay for hints.  I find it really irritating when I pay money for a game and then I have to pay more basically just to play it. Thank you for that! This game was most definitely worth the 99&cent;.

B004WZ9N02|5.0|Ever since I read Gore Vidal's wonderful historical novel, Lincoln, which portrayed him as a person rather than an icon, I have wanted to find a scholarly treatment that would fill out the portrait with detail and corrections if necessary.  Over the last 25 years, I have read a number of biographies and histories from the period, and never felt satisfied with their depth of coverage - that I could get closer to the person who did the remarkable things that Lincoln did, combining high principle with machiavellian political tactics to perfect effect.<br /><br />Well, with this volume, my wait has at last ended.  This book is a masterpiece of historical investigation.  Not only are Lincoln's political skills explained with astonishing clarity in the context of America's greatest crisis, but who he was comes through with genuine warmth.  This is by far the best single volume I have read on the period and surpasses Kearns' previous books by an order of magnitude.  Every single page is utterly fascinating, beautifuly written, and densely informative.  I would give this six stars if that were possible.<br /><br />Kearns explains how Lincoln - apparently poorly qualified and seeming to appear from nowhere - engineered a political career that enabled him to save the Union.  He did so, we are informed, by an uncanny ability to find the right person for the right job, rising above any considerations for egoistic pride or personal slights from the past.  In addition, with the powerful actors he chose - they are described in the Amazon blurb already - Lincoln understood what political currents in the country they represented, forces that he would have to contend with as it were, and which he could ignore only at his political peril.  Apparently, none of his rivals understood this, and it is a key to his genius.  Finally, Lincoln pioneered new means of political communications, as exemplified by the simplicy of the Gettysburg address - reprinted verbatim in newspapers - and the timeless elegance of its sentiments.<br /><br />This brief description cannot do justice to the political complexity that Kearns distills, such as the way that Lincoln presented himself as \\"second best choice\\" at the nominating convention, so that when the obvious candidates failed - as he suspected they would due to factional divisions - he was the only one who appeared capable of satisfying all Whig constituencies in a balancing act.  But there are also the mechanics of his political maneuvering, such as the Cabinet crisis in which Chase tried to discredit him:  Lincoln eventually embarassed him into backing down by exposing his manipulations before his colleagues as well as Senator Sumner, Chase's secret ally.  (This was portrayed as a single instant in Vidal's book - the novelist's indulgence -  but in fact took an entire day of dicussion and machination.)  Thus, for the most devoted political junkie, this is the most delicious gourmet fare.<br /><br />The personal dimensions of Lincoln and his colleagues are also covered in sensuous detail.  The reader feels like he gets to know all of them in a near intimate way, which Kearns uses to explain their behavior and beliefs, as well as their wives and children.  Lincoln comes off as a warm man of great humor and capable of remarkable friendships, who suffered from depression in certain periods that were due to the issues in his life as well as his temperament.  She also interprets many current controversies in historical context, convincingly explaining and hence laying some rather anachronistic ones to rest, such as Lincoln's sexuality.  One of the most interesting, if least likeable, figures here is Salmon P. Chase, the abolitionist whose presidential ambitions were cold and implacable.  His popular daughter Kate sacrificed everything for him, ruining a life that had promised her own brilliant career.<br /><br />If there is one thing that I would criticise about Kearns' approach, it is her tendency to seek the goodin people.  This is rather sentimental in my view.  The reader knows whom she dislikes (Chase and McClellan) and likes (all the rest of the Cabinet) all too clearly.  Moreover, with the exception of Chase, she is unwilling to consider the darker side of their search for power and fame.  And so Mary Todd Lincoln is not portrayed as a shrew whose position corrupted and imbalanced her in a very public way - the more accepted view - but as a grief-stricken mother who feels neglected by the husband she loves.<br /><br />Nonetheless, this is one of the best history books I have ever read.  What is truly amazing is that Kearns has come up with something so fresh and new in a field that is so overcrowded.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.in people.  This is rather sentimental in my view.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|The puzzles start off very easy and gradually become more difficult giving the player a chance to see patterns and develop strategies. One may choose to play only a game or two as a diversion or to spend an hour trying to complete a whole set. It has no language requirements, so it can be fun for younger players, too.
B003F1WM2K|3.0|It was a good read. Patti Smith is a great writer. I highly recommend it to all Patti Smith fans who want to know how Patti Smith became the person that she is today. If you're not a fan though, I suggest trying out a sample.

This would be a great gift for them. The Chronicles of Downton Abbey is a beautifully constructed book with gorgeous photos of the cast members. It even included the newest cast member, Shirley MacLaine. The book not only has insightful character profiles, but also interesting historical facts. Don't worry about spoilers for season 3 though. This book only whets your appetite for the upcoming season. I can't wait to find out what happens between Bates and Anna, and Matthew and Mary. I love, love, love this book!  Read more at [...]

0062202081|4.0|This book is a tween's dream come true. It's full of photos of Bieber while on tour, vacation, in the studio, and just having fun. He also relates his rise to fame, and how he copes with it all. Throughout the book Justin Bieber distributes his words of advice to his fans. He also addresses some of the rumors circulating. I think this book is perfect for girls who are big fans of Bieber.

030746363X|4.0|In general I like Tim's attitude about experimentation. I do many of the same things with supplements.<br /><br />But he has a sample set of only one (him) and so what works for him and his weird body and lifestyle make not work for you or me.<br /><br />Two things in this book that did work for me were the slow carb diet. With those 5 rules I was able to lose 25+ pounds in just over 3 months. And also the &#34;boost your testosterone&#34; method with the fish and butter oil and vitamin D.<br /><br />Plus you can always read his website/blog to find the latest info and results from these experiments.<br /><br />I didn't give this book 5 stars because sometimes I just don't like his writing style, and as I said, his experiments are a sample size of one (him) and he acts like everything will work for everyone when in reality it might now. But overall I like Tim and what he does.

With a tablet touchscreen it truly gives you the most advanced control I've seen of any app.  A great app to save room on your device by not putting actual video files on it.  I use this to watch movies and tv shows in bed all the time.  The only thing that I would like to see improved would be a way to make the desktop screen fit perfectly on the tablet screen all the time.<br /><br />Easy 5/5 though.

B007THA4FI|5.0|At first the petty quick to judge mental dialogues of characters put me off.  Then going with the flow and allowing myself to perceive from adolescent perspective began make a significant and appreciative impact.  There are/were places within characters' developments when adult care and compassion might have made a difference in outcomes; but true to life adults too are absorbed in self, the esteem of the community and keeping up with the Jones-so-to-speak.  Ultimately the tale addresses the interior impulses of developing adolescents as well as the all-to-often casual vacancy of adult role models in the sometimes cruel dramas of teen angst.  If you are a parent, read this book and notice the cues we as adults give our teen age children who do notice the disparities between what we say and what we do.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|it was exactly how it was described, fast shipping, fairly priced. couldn't ask for more. can't wait to start watching it from the beginning.
0765325950|5.0|It's clunky and flawed but also beautiful. I won't say it's the perfect finale; only Robert Jordan could have given us that. But it's better than I thought it would be when Sanderson took over and it's far better than no ending at all. Many plots aren't resolved, the storytelling and words usage is jarring at times, and the characters we grew alongside feel hollow at times; however, the book pulls through. It's emotional and fast and you're left biting your nails till the end. I'm still terribly sad Mr. Jordan never lived long enough to see his story to conclusion, but I'm sure he's be satisfied with this great effort from both his wife and Sanderson.

B0019N95IK|1.0|This show was so bad it killed the franchise. I love Star Trek and this sad excuse ended the era. On the other series you liked the characters but not this bunch,with the exception of Jolene Blalock's character. The lead actor had the charisma of a paper cup. I remember hearing that he was cast in the lead role and I knew instantly it would be bad. I even hate the terrible theme music. BlueRay won't improve this disaster. I wouldn't buy this over-priced disaster for $10.00 let alone $84.00.
B004P4S4NM|4.0|Adele's sophomore effort is an excellent album with several seriously fun tunes. I love the way she melds soulful lyrics with her rich voice - brava!

B007SZ0E1K|5.0|This CPU is wonderful!  With four cores and eight threads, it has plenty of horsepower for multitasking and for my compute-intensive jobs (OCR, sound rendering, photo editing, etc.).<br /><br />I have been loyal to Intel for 27 years, and they have never disappointed me.  They have one of the best quality control programs in the industry (based on the fact that I've never seen a defective product from them).<br /><br />The fan works well enough to cool the CPU to a reasonable temperature in the 40 degree C range.
B00ADS90EQ|5.0|Great movie with good songs, a good story, and a good plot.  They do a great job taking a small movie and making it interesting and fun.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is beautifully done. I do wish there was a bit more of a tutorial for the &quot;snatchins&quot; but I did figure it out through trial and error. By banishing these things you May get a piece of a collection used to charge the collections you find in the rooms. Happy hunting.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I love this book. It's passionate and shows that a second chance at move could possibly be the best option.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved it! It was nail bitting worthy. I couldn't put it done. The whole book is suspenseful. It's a most read.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love the relationships in this series, both good and bad, very positive and hopeful about life. The historical setting makes it easy to relate to.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|Another great book!  I was lost in this story.  All hopeless romanticism should read this book.  You won't want to put it down!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I think this is a great book for everyone to read.  I loved this book. I can't wait for the next book.
B009NXV2RK|4.0|The formula is beginning to wear rather thin but an interesting read none-the-less.  A credible threat if one stands on one leg and squints a bit

0765325950|5.0|This book ends a series that has spanned my life.  I have read this my entire life.  I was moved.  Things do not play out as you expect, but they do play out the way they should.  I finished it in a day, and I am reading it again, to catch the details I missed in my devouring.  This book is amazing.  If you stopped reading at book 5 or 7 or 10, start reading again.  If you saw this pop up on the new books and never read any of it, start reading ([[ASIN:0812511816 The Eye of the World (The Wheel of Time, Book 1)]]).  So at the end of it all you can read this book, and experience the end of the gleeman's tale Robert Jordan so masterfully began, so long, long ago.
0828822875|4.0|Me, too.  I am reading the Petit Nicholas series to help my French, that is.  They are wonderful stories; I read one out loud every night to my wife and we fall asleep chuckling.  I give it only four stars, however, because of Amazon's prices.  I just returned to the U.S. from France where I bought several books in the series in shops at a high-profile ski resort where everything is expensive.  I paid between 6.30 and 7.90 euros for these books in France (January 2013), which is around 8-10 dollars.  The books contain pages of Monsieur Sempé's sketches interspersed amongst the stories.  They are delightful too, but there aren't really so many pages to read.  What I am saying is that $15-24 is a lot to pay for a paperback with about 75 pages of printing to read.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Loved it my favourite kids books growing up and I have seen the movie awesome work And great job t
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|It was a very enjoyable game over the holidays.  Trying to figure out just when to draw fire versus when to create a rainstorm through different puzzles kept me guessing.  I like the Facebook &#34;solution&#34; page too - I could read just enough when I was frustrated to get to the next puzzle, but there are also many ways to get to most puzzles.  My only regret is that it's over very quickly.  I was hoping that the book would include more lands but alas there aren't.
B00APUQH0W|3.0|If you are looking for a movie for a rainy afternoon, this will fit the bill.  Liked the characters in the movie.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Definitely my favorite if the series! Great, easy, fast read. Can't wait for the movie to come out. Enjoy it!
1451695195|5.0|This is a subject I am very interested in and have read much about.  Great to hear about it from a former doubter.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Just incredible, that is all I can say. Faultless. Fantastic cast and amazing song and storyline. Recommend on every level.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Very good book. I love everything about it. It was nice to have a book downloaded to my phone and that it was free. I loved how you didn't get bored through out the book.
B0066W1AZK|1.0|Played 5 games near begineer's level. Here's what I found -<br /><br />1) Called  \\"draw\\" on two games as I was about to win.<br />2) Continually called \\"check\\" when no one was in check.<br />3) Computer's pawn moved backwards to take one of my pieces.<br /><br />The only thing I'm left to believe is that it is simply bug ridden junk software, or the developer is having fun by programming the computer with the temperament of a inexperience, immature, child-like player at the lower playing levels (probably giving them too much credit here).<br /><br />I'd got this for my 7 year old grandson who is just starting out, but this app will only serve to confuse him. Good thing I tried it out first.
1451696191|4.0|[from my blog [...]]    Since one of my personal rules is to always read the book before watching the film, I finally got round to reading this, as I really want to watch the film. It's a short book and an easy read which (as I am currently on holiday) I finished in a day.  Ever since, there's been a battle going on in my mind. I'm still trying to make a firm and final decision regarding how I feel about this book. Right after I finished it I thought it was absolutely fantastic, and found myself wishing I had read it as a teenager as opposed to as a 31-year-old. I felt sure I would have loved it and totally related, much more so than The Catcher in the Rye, whose hype and universal popularity I never quite got (but that's for another review). However, as time went on and I thought about the book, I realised there were certain things that were a bit off for me.    Our protagonist is Charlie, a 15-year-old who is the wallflower of the title. The story is told in epistolary form via letters to his Dear Friend, whose identity is never revealed or even hinted at. One of the things I really enjoyed about this book is Charlie's narrative voice. The book covers a year of Charlies's life, namely his freshman year of High School, and his journey as he comes out of his shell and makes friends with Patrick and Sam, who are seniors but who nevertheless welcome him as a friend. He goes through all the rites of passage YA books usually depict; first love, parties, family issues etc.    First, let me share what I liked. I think Chbosky managed to beautifully capture the voice of an introverted, naive, but ultimately golden-hearted yet troubled teen. I found it easy to sympathise with Charlie as he seems so very understanding when circumstances and events around him are not particularly favourable. I also liked the portrayal of his teacher, Brian, who encourages his love of books and reading. We should all be so lucky to have a Brian in our lives as students! I was one of the luckyones- thanks Mr. Hubbuck & Mr. Livingstone! :)    However, the tug-of-war in my brain was caused by the  sheer amount of 'issues' in this novel. Charlie is painfully naive, even for a sheltered teenager. At a point I thought he might be autistic. At the very end of the book there's a revelation which might go some way towards explaining why Charlie is like he is. Yet after hearing about loneliness, not fitting in, depression and other mental health issues,  suicide, closeted homosexuality, drug use, abortion, implied sexual harassment, domestic abuse, etc., it began to feel a bit like the author had compiled a check-list of issues that might be faced by a teenager and went checking them off one by one. Yes, obviously these things happen in real life and as such should be written about.  I also acknowledge that many people are dealt the most awful possible cards in life and deal with all this and maybe even worse. My issue is that many of these things seemed to be mentioned in passing and never really addressed in enough depth.    On another completely separate issue, I then thought about the person receiving the letters. How fair is it to burden someone with such an intimate account of one's problems when they have not asked for it?    Nevertheless, I'm glad I read this book. Although I probably won't be rereading it, I can see why it's so popular with young adults. It also provides an excellent starting platform to debate a variety of issues, which is always a plus.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book!! Very interesting an exciting almost better than the first book. I didn't want it to end
B004J4WLB4|3.0|Nice beginning but too short to be called a story. It just ends like that! Disappointed mom and kid!  Too bad
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|It's exactly what you think it is! It has the challenge of getting your best score possible to be rated 3 stars.  My only gripe is that the tiles are too similar so it takes a while. And it's hard to distinguish between flowers and seasons.
0920668372|5.0|I received this book as a gift at my baby shower. I had never read it before then, but I love it so much that now I buy it as a gift for others at their baby showers. Such a meaningful story!
B003H4RDZQ|1.0|Did not like the language, found the &#34;humor&#34; unpleasant.  Only read the first story.  Do not recommend. Got it for a book club, but am not impressed
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Watching Star Wars right now and I gotta say I am amazed at the picture quality. I love the original Star Wars trilogy so when I bought my Blu-Ray player I knew I had to get this set of Blu-Ray discs. I am just blown away how good the picture quality is for a 35 year old movie. How they made it HD I don't know but it is. I would suggest you buy this set if you are a fan of the movies. It is well worth the money.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I had seen the movie first and the book answred a lot of questions for me ( books are always better) :) I really enjoyed it and bought the rest of the trilogy
B002HFP0QU|5.0|Great Bee Gees set!  Hits from the beginning  & hits from Saturday Night Fever.  This takes you back to the good old days.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|If you like Mahjong then this is the one for you! Great variety and nice pieces to look at! Mahjong is an awesome game for anyone and this one fits the bill.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|Really enjoyed the movie but hadn't realize it was a book. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and didn't feel like watching the movie first spoiled it.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Love it! This is a Great trilogy, and the Bluray makes it even better, not much else to say but awesome.
B007T9UIMA|5.0|This is the top group on the music group right now.If you have not purchased One Direction you do not know what you are missing.This is for all teens.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I bought this to keep my preschool-aged grandchildren involved in something unique when we are in need of creative quiet time.  I don't know who has more fun with it ... the kids or Granny!
B000FC2L1E|5.0|This is the second time reading this series to get ready for the next book which will be out next Fall.  I encourage anyone with a love of reading to read this series and the extra books, the Lord John series and novellas.  There is history, time travel, romance, romance, and mystery.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|This was a deep story... the ending drags a little but  overall great page turner. I don't regret reading it.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Makes me think on my feet and feeds my brain.  I use it all the time wherever I go.  Very convenient
1416955070|1.0|NOTE: I really wanted to love this book. I tried so hard, I really did. I'm sorry.<br /><br />Clare's writing style is a bit grey. It feels like she's just stared creative writing; she knows where to put words but hasn't got a clue how to explain the story. Some of the descriptions don't make sense. AND ALL THE SMILES. Horrifying. Just horrifying. And by the way: she took all the ideas found in most popular books/movies, and shoved them into her book. I'm just saying.<br /><br />The characters... sweet Jenny they were infuriating.<br />Clary was the Mother of All Marie Sue's. People! Be warned: she's worse than Bella. Oh, I hate to point the obvious but the name Clary? Clare? Clary and Clare. Mmmm.... I wonder if there's a connection...? Jace. I. Hate. YOU. Look at you. You're so cool, so slick, so funny/sarcastic, and so good at everything. What you are is evil in leather pants... and you love Clary - I quote - \\"because she's special.\\"<br />Oh, a lot of people have describes all the characters as \\"funny.\\" For that to work; they have to BE funny. Not once did I laugh. I didn't even smile. Nope, nothing.<br /><br />The love interest is as clich&eacute; as you can get. Jace is you typical `dark-bad-boy-yet-charming' but like I've said. He's an idiot. Clary's an idiot, too....Oh, wait. There perfect for each other. Nahhh. Cute.
B006YW6KX4|5.0|If you're wondering what the new Blu-ray version of PICNIC looks like, here's the good news.  If you're shocked at the high price, so was I.  But since it's one of my wife's favorite movies, I took the gamble.  Sections of the old DVD version, as you know, are in terrible condition.  Towards the end of the movie, the scene with Holden & Novak by the river when the police are chasing William Holden's character, is virtually unwatchable, it's so dark and grainy.  We were relieved to find this scene cleaned up for Blu-ray, along with the entire movie, it's completely restored, bright and clear.  So if you're a big fan of PICNIC, you'll receive your money's worth with the new Blu-ray version.
B000N8LWHE|5.0|many find this to be the best western movie ever made.  With a perfect cast and one of the best scripts ever for a film, this movie does not disapoint.  I would rank The Searchers and She Wore a Yellow Ribbon beside this one as best ever-still this movie is a must own.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I've really enjoyed this show, Clair Danes is awesome, also good to see Mandy Patinkin back in a great show.
0316228532|2.0|After Harry Potter, I was really looking forward to another book by J.K. Rowling but I really expected more.  This book had so many characters that didn't really amount anything and were nondescript.  The premise itself is really just insipid.  I'm sorry that I didn't like the novel more and am somewhat embarrassed to admit that I will probably read whatever she writes next but this one was very anti-climactic overall.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really like this Solitaire App.  Unfortunately, it has become very addictive for me since I waste much time playing it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love it. The author is amazing and really knows how to describe everything as if you were there. I would recommend to anyone.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was a amazing book. I never thought that prim would die. I'm glad she chose peeta. I've really felt bad for her.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|To me, Lonesome Dove is one of the four greatest American movies ever made.  It feels like life itself with characters that are just like the people of America today-good and bad.  Watching this is living their story, and our history.  It wii change your feeling about our forefathers.  A truly great movie experiance.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome.... This book was great from the beginning and it leaves me wanting more. It is very interesting and I can't stop.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|Blue Ray is definitely worth it to complete you collection.  This fills in the missing details from the 2nd and 3rd movies.
0062127241|5.0|Purchased as a Christmas gift.  The guy I got it for loved it.  He's a big who fan so I knew I wouldn't go wrong.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|The book has so much detail to it that the plot really comes alive in your mind. The only down side is the skipping from character to character... I get engrossed in the story of one just to be tossed some place else in an entirely different story in the next chapter.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|an excellent and thrilling continuation to the series this book will leave you in suspense right up to the end.
B001H4NXCK|5.0|This movie is based on the concept of the TV series Maverick from the late 1950s and early 1960s.  It is what I call a playfull western. Instead of being realistic, the film(and the TV series) entertains by showing a charming hero who is the winner in all situations in the show.  Mel Gibson does a fine job of playing the son of the first Maverick, James Garner, who costars in this film. Jodie Foster plays Maverick's love interest- also playing a woman with the same personality as Gibson.  The point of this film is strictly to entertain- and this film does a very good job of this.
B000068FWC|4.0|This was a CD from my past that I really wanted to own again.  Since my purchase, I now own an iphone, and will probably not be purchasing physical cd/albums any long.  Price was great tool
B009LDD5E0|5.0|This is 4th year I purchase the full season of Glee. It comes later and later, but we continue to enjoy the series and really look forward to viewing it without commercial interruptions.
B002M87V0A|5.0|Bought this because I live near the town that Meredith Wilson wrote it about. I have watched it so many time and even been to a couple plays.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|We've seen the play several times.  I've also read the abridged version of \\"Les Miserables\\", by Victor Hugo. (I recommend that, too.)  The movie presents this heart-wrenching story in a brilliant manner.  It is easy to follow.  All of the actors do outstanding work!  I can't recommend this movie enough!  I plan to purchase the DVD as soon as it is available.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Great book . I enjoyed the things left out of t by e movie. I'm ready for the next one.
B001NT0TF8|5.0|I originally heard this album years ago and really enjoyed it. I saw it available as a download and now get to enjoy the music all over again. Awesome!!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I got this book and read it and it was awesome.Great book for kids and adults too.everybody should rate this book 5 stars
0307352145|5.0|I've suggested many of my students read this book. I found this title through watching TED videos. Cain offers a scientific and compassionate analysis of what life is like as an introvert and how that can be a good thing. Very rewarding read that I have read twice already!
B009RI4FRU|4.0|I thought the plot was very novel and witty. I hesitate to call the film cute, but the characters were adorably precocious.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love it on laptop and desktop and am just getting used to it on my Kindle.<br />I have connected with old, old friends and am able to keep up with all my friends from Asia to Alaska to Australia!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|You can find reading plans for your style. I have mine set up to remind me daily so I don't forget my daily reading. You can tweet and facebook and even email verses to your friends and family. God Bless!!
B000MKD9P6|5.0|This movie really made me laugh. I wish I could have bought it outright because I love going back and watching it over and over. It's a feel good film with a  nice payoff at the end. Streep is fantastic as usual. I don't think this is a chick flick - but maybe.
B00ABKGG0C|1.0|I paid for a kindle edition of this book, but I have received a different one named \\"44\\". And I don't find a way to return a digital item (replace, exchange...).<br /><br />I am sure it is a good book but I can't rate amazon in other place.
B009G78EE2|5.0|Thanks to NPR for this gem! Heard Macklemore being interviewed by them. Heard few samples, and decided to give it a try. No regrets!
B007HGPBRC|5.0|Classic Hitchens, he details his last weeks and months while going through cancer treatments and doesn't put down the pen until the bitter end.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I loved all three books!!  Stayed up all night reading. I Definitely recommend reading this book & the other two!
0765325950|1.0|Harriet, I hope you're happy with your \\"top seller\\" status, I hope it was worth pandering to some idiotic list or ranking, instead of helping your 20yr loyal readers.  I hope you hold the plaque at night really tight, and it helps you sleep better knowing that, even though you screwed thousands of loyal readers, you ensured your dead husband got one more plaque to add to the dozens on a shelf somewhere.  He never would have allowed this, and you probably know that.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|A lot of controversy over this film. Much ado. I thought it was insightful and entertaining and had long discussions with my brother over where it fits in with the Aliens universe. However, I must say - we have a small screen and you really miss a lot of important detail in this film if you don't have a large screen TV. I know... we're luddites : )<br />Surround sound would be good too...<br />Oh, and this film is NOT for children!
B000QFQE4U|5.0|Stellar performance by Denzel Washington. His portrayal of Malcolm X was so convincing that I no longer saw Mr. Washington on screen, but instead, was transported back in time to witness Mr. X's journey. That Spike Lee's (\\"Malcolm X\\") and Mr. Washington were ignored for Oscars, speaks more about the Academy's fear of the subject matter (the incredible evolution/creation of Mr. X), than the performance of Mr. Washington and cast, under the direction of the inimitable Spike Lee. I HIGHLY recommend \\"Malcom X\\" as a premier lesson in the civil rights movement in America. Mr. X gave voice to the manifest that African Americans had (have) the right to be treated to the same rights/privileges enjoyed by the majority.
0765348780|1.0|One star, only because I can't give it less. This review is for both, Gardens and Deadhouse Gates - I decided to try Malazan, mostly based on the great reviews, length and comparisons with ASOIAF. After struggling to the end of the second book, I've simply abandoned the series and went online to see spoilers/timeline - I assure you I got the best of the series that way.<br /><br />I think if they had been around when I was a teenager and reading D&D and White Wolf Novels, then maybe I too would have foamed at the mouth for Erikson.<br /><br />I am certain that in the mind of the author, the story is vivid, and the prose explanatory. But in my opinion he fails dramatically to put it on paper. Many ascertain that he is an anthropologist first, and that is notable, fact I would instead say that he is a worldbuilder/anthropologist first, plotter second, but writer is not even on my list.<br /><br />Every character you meet in the story is special, magical, powerful. Every race you meet is secretive, ancient, powerful. Every enemy affiliation is sly, dangerous and powerful. That is till the next page when the protagonist(s) have killed 50 of them.<br /><br />The magic system is barely explained, and while that of itself is not bad, it has to be understood enough to the reader for it to foreshadow it's eventual uses. Indeed foreshadowing itself is sparsely well used, and while plot twists abound, they fail to surprise.<br /><br />There are some good ideas, some interesting images. I really wanted to understand more of how Warrens work, but two books in and these small hooks are not enough to sink me in for 10 books. Furthermore, I can say safely without spoilers that none of the endings in either book, NONE, were satisfactory. I simply did not care enough for 90% of the characters to give a damn what happened to them. And the one I did enjoy actually did die.<br /><br />Please, don't take my word for it, enough people have seemed to enjoy it, and I can imagine that somehow even this material has an audience. But sincerely, for the reviews, the money spent on advertising, even for the positive comments it has garnered on sites like amazon, it is a major disappointment. Oh, and please don't comment to say that I did not read far enough into the series to receive adequate payoff, I did not read over 450.000 words of this muck and mud expecting to 'maybe enjoy the later parts'. I've had more re-starts and second reads on these two books than on any of Dostoyevsky's books I've finished. And those I enjoyed, beginning to end.<br /><br />Erikson and company should have written plot and atlas, and gotten an actual writer to handle the words. While he obviously cares about the characters, that does not come out in the book. Plus, nobody seems to have made him understand Show, Don't Tell.<br /><br />Every. Character. Is. Awesome. At least till the next character, he's more awesome, his awesomeness overshadows that first fool. Over and over he writes about how incredible this one is, then that one. He reminds me of my nephew going on and on about this pokemon and that pokemon.<br /><br />But seriously, if you want to give Malazan a try, go ahead, but please, don't buy it till you've read and enjoyed it.
B00005JMCW|4.0|An excellent movie and entertaining.  It is a good reminder that parents and teenagers all have their issues.  A good movie for families.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Great read!!!!! This series was one of the best that I ever read. The suspense had me on edge. Definite page turner.
1452110581|2.0|I bought this for a friend at Christmas who is a big cat lover. I was disappointed to see that it is a small book.  Didnt think to look at the size when I bought.  One of the drawbacks about buying books online without seeing.  Some of the poems were ok but didnt personally meet up with my expectations
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|I liked this, but then I am a fan of this type of film. Good humor. I think the underlying message is a bit overstated. The witch is awesome!
B001DDBCUU|3.0|I was a huge fan of the show and was a bit disappointed because this first movie is not as great
B007HGPBRC|5.0|Only Hitchens could write so eloquently and, yes, so humorously about a subject so dire as death and dying from cancer.  Of course, this is a journey we will all make in one way or another.  But I doubt whether many of us could rouse the kind of effort and strength it must have taken Hitchens to turn the experience into a work of art.  There is no sentimentality in this book.  There is the sense throughout of Hitchens rising moment by moment to continue being Hitchens.  No small feat. Read Mortality as the book that it is, the last gift from a singular writer, the last chance to hear that voice in your head and marvel.
B00004TS0E|5.0|This is an excellent remaking of the movie.  Very wholesome and touching.  This is a great family movie that all can watch.
B003UESJF6|5.0|This is a great movie!  It is fun to watch for kids and adults.  I love the villan but there are other great characters too!
B001N1DPDE|4.0|I bought this knife for an all purpose outdoor utility tool. this knife is specifically built for outdoor survival. If you live in the outdoors I imagine you will be able to get years of service from this knife. Packaging was sound and came with all the parts. sheath is customizable. I have heard of people saying that it dulls the blade quickly but I have not seen this to be a problem. I lashed it to my chest rig upside down and removed the catch completely. If i have any complaint about it at all its that it holds the knife too securely as you have to use the thumb break to pull it out. Knife does not come sharp at all. working the blade for a few hours will put a nice edge on it but unless you convex it I wouldnt try to skin anything with it. I was able to get it shaving sharp but I had to work the blade over a leather strap for awhile to get it there. Overall opinion is that this blade will probably outlive me. The knife itself is easily still very user friendly even without the grips which I would suggest wrapping or getting them over molded if you plan to use them.
B002VXGW2E|5.0|This is a GREAT movie! If you are a 'foodie' it's even better, but it really is for everyone. It has everything - history from the forties & fifties & more recent 911 touchstones.<br />Plus Meryl and Amy rock this... I know reviews say Amy is whiney in this movie, but that's how the auther is! I went out & bought the book afterwards and this is one of the few times I say the movie is better.  Oh and Jane Lynch nails it too... and Stanley Tucci!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I thought this was a well written book.  Gave a view of a side of the German people most of us did not know.  I really enjoyed the story line and would recommend it as a good read to anyone.
B00B1E6FF8|1.0|(3/4/13, one star) From its racist overtones to its refusal to condemn torture unequivocally, Zero Dark Thirty has something to offend everyone. Senator McCain is right when he says that ZD30 gives all kinds of ammunition to the forces of radical Islam.<br /><br />Kathryn Bigelow portrays her fictional heroine, Maya, as a selfless patriot even though she could have walked away from torture at any time. Instead Maya stops torturing only under threat of prosecution. How heroic. How courageous. How selfless. Not.<br /><br />Real patriots don't torture. Torture is not only immoral but is prosecutable under both U.S. and international law for many of the same reasons that slavery and genocide are. It also causes irreparable harm to U.S. interests by radicalizing its victims and by undermining any claim we might make to moral leadership. Besides, if we didn't prosecute and condemn torturers, where would they stop? They always rationalize torture on grounds of public security, but historically have always used it as a weapon to terrorize the public and suppress political dissent.<br /><br />Oblivious to all these dangers and to the truth, Bigelow glorifies a fictional torturer with a broken moral compass and ignores all the very real patriotic U.S. officials who refused to torture and who were the real heroes responsible for finding bin Laden.
6305428387|4.0|I chose this rating because it is an entertaining film, it is funny, and clean.  It is a movie I can share with our children and grandchildren.
1451638450|3.0|I'm a huge fan of the Vorkosigan series, and with the exception of a few \\"side stories\\" (Winterfair, Ethan of Athos)I've loved every one. Of course the best Vorkosigan books have plenty of Miles in them, but the pre-Miles books were good, too. I've always found Ivan to be an interesting character, so I was kind of excited to see what Lois might do with him as the star of his own title. I wonder if she is still wondering what to do with him, because she did little or nothing with him in this book.<br /><br />It starts out with an interesting premise, and the \\"accidental\\" marriage could have been--should have been-- full of sparks, but when Bujold wrote Ivan like oatmeal and Tej, his new bride, like wall-paper paste, and then threw in a tedious family plot that went on forever with a climax that was hardly a climax at all, and then a \\"wrap up\\" that went down uninteresting side trails and probably the most boring epilogue ever written, I was left saying, \\"What the hell, Lois?\\"<br /><br />Is this a case of getting too famous to listen to an editor or did her editor go on vacation?<br /><br />Lois knows how to write Miles--maybe she better stick with him.
B00200K2UG|5.0|I was looking for a bag that would hold 2 cameras and accessories.  Works well.  The pockets located in the inside top cover are not easy access, but otherwise a great bag.  It is a monster bag to carry, do not under estimate the size.  Fills my needs.
B0011ZWMVS|5.0|great sounds and easily remind me of how much I enjoyed the movie itself. music is even good enough to work out to on some of the tracks while other track relax .Definitely a soundtrack I would recommend
B004JK61K0|4.0|After the Amazon stock mail program began failing to download my new emails I went in search of a new mail program and found K-9.  It was easy to set up my Gmail account--just a few quick screens where I entered my username and password.<br /><br />I like that it is simple and easy to understand.  I also like that it shows my Gmail emails individually rather than merging all emails in a thread into one.<br /><br />The only slight negative is that I have a couple times had to click reload to have my new emails download after opening the app.  Not a big deal, but prefer that the new emails be downloaded after opening the app.<br /><br />Overall, this is a nice app that is easy to understand and works well.
B00000IZOR|5.0|I brought this as a gift for my god baby, and she loved it! She couldn't stop playing with it! So that put a smile on my face, and the price I paid was very reasonable!
B0007LXPBI|4.0|This is a nice remake of the original.  The actors and actresses are very good in their parts.  It is entertaining and fun.
B005L38QK2|4.0|But I use my computer for a lot of things not gaming related. The mouse is fully configurable and if you're willing to spend the time and deal with the learning curve I could see it being amazing. I've been finding my accidental use of the extra buttons really annoying however. I'll be making additional profiles for the mouse so I don't have this issue, I just haven't found the time yet.
B004132HZS|5.0|Both Season One and Two seem to me to be works of love, as much as Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings movies were.  The writers know their Conan Doyle inside and out, and you  may need to watch the seasons more than once to catch all the references. Superb acting and dialogue, excellent rapport between the leads, and amazingly clever up-dating of Victorian stories. Cumberbatch's rapid-fire delivery when he's on a roll is incredible.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing read! I had a hard time putting it down! Now I'm excited to read the next book and see the movie!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Just played the free version and I'm hooked. Getting ready to order the full version. Awesome graphics.  The underwater scenes are beautiful. Interactive play is smooth and works great on my Kindle Fire. Thanks G5 keep the good games coming! I just finished playing this game AND I DIDN'T WANT IT TO END.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Delightful movie aimed at a mature audience but delightful for everyone.<br />Colourful and you will want to get a ticket to India after watching !
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|fun game good for older kids. I played for 2 days free and then bought it. graphics are really good.
B001PP9ALY|5.0|AWESOME MOVIE,WISH THEY WOULD HAVE A PART 2.SENT THE MOVIE PROMPT,IN GREAT CONDITION.WOULD SUGGEST THIS FOR ANYONE LIKING ACTION MOVIES.

B008IGP8QE|5.0|My 7 year old son really enjoys watching this show, and seeing Austin sing and dance.  So, this CD provides a great alternative to Justin Bieber.  Hopefully he will get a chance to do another CD sometime.  Seems like a good kid with a nice voice, and my son identifies with his dancing and especially the hair!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had been putting off reading this book because I just didn't want to get caught up in another series....but I'm glad I did. I loved it!
B005Q1W10A|4.0|Loved the show....The disc was not setup well and required some manipulating to get the right episode and get rid of subtitles.
B00ATDOVNK|1.0|ive tried 3 times and it will not download! it gets to 3% after about 15 minutes and then stops. its not my Internet connection either. I hate when this happens!!!
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|This is probably the best Christmas movie to come out in decades (and I'm old enough to say that).  Having no kids, I can't critique it as a parent, but personally, I completely enjoyed it as an adult. Put on your &#34;Scottish ears&#34; for the elf or put on the subtitles if you can't quite catch what she's saying.  I would use &#34;heart-warming,&#34; except that might scare off some people - the crotchety &#34;grandsanta&#34; nicely off-sets any saccharine tendencies.  Watch it twice, at least. You'll appreciate it more each time.
0307887448|5.0|Nobody else review this, so the review count stays at 1337. I hear this book is worthy of the honor. ;D
B0054JZC6E|3.0|It kind of makes me mad. I don't understand how to play some of these games because it doesn't give a good description..
B002QE3CTY|3.0|I have to admit that the overall concept is great. The execution however......  I have read the entire trilogy and I feel overall letdown. I really wanted to like the series and characters. But there is very little character development. Some things happen and I felt like I should care but just didn't. The writing could be better. I have read many books that are much better. If you are looking for books up to par with the Hunger Games.... pass and reread the Hunger Games. The series ending will just leave you annoyed and disappointed.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Excellent book! Chris shows the human side of being a warrior. His wife's perspective on the impacts of being a Seal wife really rounded out the story.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|My grandsons wished for these for Christmas. They are pricey but they are a big hit. They combined their two kits and made a bigger model. They don't always share things but in this case, two really was better than one. Don't be surprised, it is a small box because the tiles are small but the model looks like the game they play on the computer.
B005I6EU48|5.0|my wife is not a gadget kinda lady, but her new kindle fire in her prologue case go everywhere with her! she loves the leather cover and it looks like a book on the book shelf and in her hands when reading, I think this allowed her to transisition from paper to screen much easier. these are beautifully designed and made with quality and care in mind. you will be really happy if you can find one of these! Verso has many styles to choose from and really bring a look of class and elegance to your device.
B0086700CM|4.0|Nice graphics.  The game plays well.  4 stars because the sensitivity seems to be low at times when cornering.  I have a Vizio tablet
B00005JMCW|5.0|If you like Jamie Lee Curtis you will love this movie.  This is a must own DVD.  I don't have a lot of DVDs in my library but this one I could watch every couple of months.  Great Movie.  Even if you don't care for Lindsay Lohan, you will love her in this movie.
B009D0LBRO|5.0|This is a good game because:<br />-beautiful landscapes<br />-easy to play but still challenging<br />-doesn't stress me out<br />-No ads<br />Some cons:<br />-can't go back but I guess that eliminates the purpose of a running game<br />-not a lot of options<br />-No unlockable characters<br /><br />Overall this is a very solid side scroller. I highly recommend it.
0956010903|5.0|This was my first purchase in Amazon.<br />Since I'm a Harry Potter fan I had to have this Collector's Edition book and I'm really happy with my purchase. The quality was amazing and its something to treasure always.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I had a chance to read this series before AMC released their take on this story. The show was a tad disappointing when put side by side next to this novel. But as for the graphic novel of course, it was badass. It's just to bad Tony Moore didn't continue the artwork for the rest of the series.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  It has a little comedy, romance and drama.  Oh, and did I mention Great Actors!
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I just wish that it had gone a little farther. I would have enjoyed following along on the entire hike.
B000053GTF|5.0|Fantastic voice! Great songs! This CD is a great gift to be given to someone you love! A must buy!
052118939X|5.0|I need this book because I finished my English course and I need continue study in order to improve my English!
B003MC5N28|4.0|I first read this book in my 8th grade reading class, many years have passed since then but I still found it enjoyable. A true story of a hero, the ending leaves much wanting, so read the whole series!
B003LSTK8G|5.0|Brilliant. Some smart people actually made a killing during the crash. this book details the specifics of credit default swaps as well as explains the mortgage crisis/bubble and why it popped.
B009VB97EY|4.0|This was pretty funny!  I have to admit it.  The things they did in this movie was hillarious!  And Matthew M. was a trip!!!!
B000B2YQX4|5.0|I have loved this band since the 80&#34;s, and I still do. Great album. I especially liked the tracks Suffer Well, Nothing&#34;s Impossible, Prescious, and A Pain That I'm Used to.
B003MC5N28|5.0|It reminded me of matched by Ally Condie. I'm getting 50 points extra credit for reading this. My friend didn't like it and I can't understand why but I can't think she even likes reading
0553108034|5.0|Again and needless to say,I am fan of Geoge R.R. Martin and Song of Ice and Fire  and I'd rather read these book in English!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am in love with this app!  It has been extremely helpful when it comes to finding pictures of things I'd love to try, places I'd love to go, and with planning my wedding.  I love it!
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|Tim Burton doing what Tim B. does best! Funny, and loved the old school throwback references. The music was great!

B005HSL626|5.0|This game is great it's free.  It the best is you can play it all day long. Get the app free and fun for all
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I have been playing this game for a few weeks now and it is still just as fun as the first day I started playing it. Yes, it is a match 3 or more game but the elements involved in matching add a degree of fun and entertainment. In other words, it's very entertaining and fun to play, even for adults. :-)
1613832796|5.0|Needless to say,I am fan of Geoge R.R. Martin and Song of Ice and Fire  and I'd rather read these book in English!
B009ACK1AS|5.0|This is the best winter DVD ever. Even older children and adults love it.  There is no narration, simply a beautiful and effective musical score.  My grandchildren love it.  I recently took them to a screening of it with the San Francisco Symphony performing the music live, on stage.  It was a fabulous idea, and the fact that they, the SFSO, a major symphony orchestra globally, chose to play the score to the screening should be testimony enough to the beauty of the music and effectiveness of the DVD.  This is a beautiful story of a little boy's dream of a snowman coming to life, and their journey together first through the boy's home, and then to the North Pole and back home.  You'll love it!  Guaranteed!
B009SQOGZ2|5.0|Paranorman was awesome. I am 6 years old and my dad had read the book to me. I would recommend it to anyone.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|The movie was pretty good, overall, but the story line was a little underdeveloped.  The detective character needed more work as well.  Bane was a really good bad guy.
B001CDWFPC|4.0|Easy to read and understand like the New King James version. Written using the English we use daily. Like most study bibles, the commentary for scripture verses are often overly brief but they do give one help in understanding verses that have difficult meaning or passages that are confusing. Excellent resource for those who are seeking to know God's word at a deeper level.
B006L1TT8G|5.0|its perfect! got it quick and love it to death. amazing, Perrie, Jade, Jesy, and Leigh-Anne are the best girl band in the world. i wish it was in the USA but ordered it here and it is just amazayn

B007UXSPK2|5.0|Really enjoyed this story. It is my favorite so far of the many MI's with Tom Cruise. Seems to have more substantial story.
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|Was easy to find and very easy to download.  Was trying to find the CD in stores and couldn't find it anywhere so I went to Amazon.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Once I finished Bared to You and started reading this - I just couldn't put it down ~ extremely riveting series.  I cannot wait for the next one \\"Entwined With You\\" to be released!! Until then I will keep re-reading the first two!
1933633867|4.0|I read excerpts from this book on Delancy Place and I wanted to read more of it. Understanding 'debt&#34; while we grapple with it in the modern world is a pertinent topic today. We can all pray &#34;forgive us our debts&#34;.
0765325950|1.0|It should never have been three books - but it seems particularly fitting that this WAS drawn out just like the rest of this series.  If it had been 5 or 6 books Jordan would have lived to finish it and would have eliminated the fluff.  In the parallel universe (you know the one through the stones that was so interesting in The Great Hunt and then never showed up again) where that happened these books were among the all time great fantasy series, and people read them for many years to come...but in this world they were what you get when commercial interests trump artistic ambition.<br /><br />So this book could have been about 200 - 300 pages of genuine action, and combined with good editing of Towers of Midnight would have been a good book.  But as with everything else about Wheel of Time, it was stretched out to push sales.<br /><br />That's going to keep happening until readers stop buying into it...and even so I bought it on the first day it came out.
B00846REIS|5.0|OMG I couldn't put it down.... i totally loved it......  I can't wait for the 3rd book to come out.....
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I love all of Stephen King's book that aren't straight horror.  He took the old idea of time travel, and put his own unique spin on it.  Being the old softie that I am, I wanted the two main characters to get together in the end.
B00001QEE8|5.0|This movie is a good movie. It is a family movie. I bought this to finish my collection of Jungle Book. Highly recommend
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|The first 2 books were good, but the last one took forever to end. Could have ended chapters earlier. Still good though.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|It was good but it was boring and not really interesting. I did see lots of cool words and definitions
B005K17RU0|4.0|I found this app to be very useful and easy to load and navigate.  I only gave it 4 stars because this app continously runs in the background and adds to the load on the  memory
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I love all of the Jack Ryan Novels, I don't think that Tom Clancy can write them fast enough for me.....  I love the fact that he uses the same characters, it makes it more enjoyable to read.... It is like you know these people.... and so filled with suspense..... can't wait for the next book to come out...
B006AZZPCM|3.0|i wish the kindle fire supported flash :o( im not able to play certain games on it or view certain videos.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|It is a good movie. This platinum Edition movie was awesome. It is better than original movie. I am glad I waited to be on dvd.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|The Grandchildren have not seen these films and so through the holidays I was able to introduce them to Harrison Ford!<br />What a great way to bond with all of them!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Cleverly written with alternating chapters from the viewpoint of the main characters, husband, Nick, and wife, Amy, the story unfolds so gently that one would never suspect the anger and viciousness that increases in intensity with each page. The author has brilliantly constructed a complex tale that seems unbelievable and yet very believable all at the same time. Warning: You will not be able to put this book down once you start it.
B000ID37T0|5.0|Just watched this for the first time. How did I miss this in the 90s, a must-see. Al Pacino was magnificent. The three greatest scenes: the tango, the Ferrari, and the tribunal! Enjoy.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|What can i say, the book like the first one is awesome... I can not wait for the 3rd book to come out, I have all ready pre ordered it and I am telling you that May can not come fast enough for me..... i think she should release it sooner.......  all of my co workers would be happy too.... they are also waiting for book number 3 to come out...
B004O3YGMC|4.0|just two comments...<br /><br />running  Splashtop on my Android tablet is fairly demanding ... using this will either calm you down, if you go with the flow, or annoy you, if you don't submit to its environment.... however, once you get a bit settled with the GUI, you can be productive... I felt better about it the second day I used it....<br /><br />running (Win 7) Splashtop Streamer  on the PC (required PC server module for Splashtop functionality on your mobile device)changes video resolution.. I wish it wouldn't do that.... perhaps I haven't tickled the applicable setup option yet? I like to pop onto the desktop in the office a bit while the tablet is in a Splashtop session elsewhere.... anyway, once the Streamer is unloaded (exit selected in system tray) the video is corrected instantly....<br /><br />I have a feeling that I'll get to love and depend on this software in a short amount of time.... seems rock solid and very well crafted.... only minor issues observed and suspected....

B007FJFDXS|4.0|I love this game. It's basically a 3-d maze that you also have to watch out for traps and the literal edge of the maze or you fall of to oblivion. I only gave it 4 stars b/c my husband also tried it and he said he didn't like it, but yet, he couldn't stop playing it.

B007EDYN36|3.0|Let's face it, we all edit our own pasts in one way or another. We might believe we're being utterly truthful, we might even work very hard to \\"tell it like it was.\\" But memories are selective critters. Spend a single afternoon listening to \\"eye witness\\" testimony at a trial and you will immediately see that even after a relatively short time each person's account of what happened will be unique and different. Many years ago I saw a tv movie (maybe a pilot for a show called, \\"The Rookies?) that showed the classroom and field training at a police academy. During one lecture, a man burst through the classroom door, fired several shots at the teacher, and then ran out. As the cadets jumped up to react, the professor popped up from behind his desk and told everyone to relax. It had all been pre-planned and staged. He then started asking questions about what color shirt the man had on, what color hair he had, how much he weighed, etc. No two police cadets gave the same description although the event had occured just moments before. Is Peter Criss telling the truth in this book? Yes, as far as he knows. But there are so many inconsistencies and just plain impossibilities as it all unfolds that it quickly becomes clear that some things are jaded, others are amalgams of several events blended together, and so forth. That isn't meant to imply dishonesty or duplicity on Peter's part. As I said, each and every one of us edits his or her own past to some extent. It's human nature. So what we have here is the most honest accounting according to Peter Criss, eyewitness to the (pardon the pun) lion's share of the life of the band Kiss. I was a witness to a very small part of it... a view from the cheaps, if you will.<br /><br />I first saw the band at their very first concert outside of the NY/NJ metro area. It was in May of 1973, as best MY memory can recall. What I AM certain of are the following facts:<br /><br />1. I had purchased tickets to see Ian Hunter and Mick Ronson who were trying out songs for what would eventually become Ian's first non-Mott the Hoople album. He opened with \\"Once Bitten Twice Shy\\" and people booed and threw stuff at the stage. Kiss was the reason.<br /><br />2. The show was at either the Orpheum Theater (80% certain) or the Boston Music Hall (20%). The confusion is because the venues were within a couple of blocks from each other in the Boston Theater district.<br /><br />3. No opening act was listed on the ticket.<br /><br />4. The lights went down and this maniac in what looked like kabuki face paint ran out from stage left, grabbed the mic at center stage and screamed at the top of his lungs. He then yelled, \\"We're KISS and we're gonna take you away with us! You got nothin' to loose!\\" Seconds later the band kicked into what I later learned was \\"Deuce.\\" I asked an usher what was going on and was told that the band was indeed named Kiss and they were doing their first show outside of NY. They were just signed to some new label. They did their entire first album (the REAL first album, not the one with \\"Kissin' Time\\" on it that was actually a reissue when the first pressing went out of print and \\"Alive\\" was saving both the band and Casablanca Records.<br /><br />5. After playing \\"Deuce\\" and \\"Strutter\\" Gene took the mike and apologized to the crowd. He was very hard to understand because he had the mic too close to his mouth. He said that they usually had a much bigger stage show with fire stunts but the Boston Fire Marshall had said the venue was too small. He promised that when they came back to Boston they'd do their whole show. To put it bluntly, without their pyros to rely on (the only real stunt they did was Gene vomiting blood during the into to \\"100,000 Years.\\" the guys were forced to win the house over with musicianship.<br /><br />6. They closed with \\"Black Diamond\\" and \\"Let Me Go, Rock & Roll\\" and the house went freaking insane. Roughly 30 minutes later, when Hunter and company took the stage and beganthe anemic intro to \\"Once Bitten\\" the house started screaming, \\"we want KISS! WE WANT KISS!\\"<br /><br />Within weeks I had not only bought the debut album, but every other record I could find on the Casablanca label, including \\"Light of Love\\" by T-Rex and \\"Rock & Roll Survivors\\" by Fanny. If you can find the Fanny album, get it. It kicks bigtime.<br /><br />I went to see KISS perform again just after \\"Dressed to Kill\\" was released. The album was a moderate hit and this was the same tour that rolled through Cobo Hall in Detroit for several nights where \\"Alive\\" was recorded. Once again, they were incredible.<br /><br />The third time was just after \\"Destroyer\\" came out. The tickets cost 3X as much, the band played for less than 40 minutes INCLUDING encores, and Gene & Peter were yelling at each other constantly by the middle of the gig.

The band came out, played some truncated mess version of \\"Rock & Roll All Nite,\\" and then Paul yelled, \\"GOOD NIGHT NEW YORK! WE LOVE YOU!\\" Again, I was in Boston. I'm almost certain Peter references this exact gig in the book because I know several of the members of Aerosmith and both Joe Perry and Joey Kramer were there, as was, I believe, Seth Justman from the J.

Gene's book is whitewashed with several coatings of ego-driven varnish and most true fans of the band (or people that ever met Neal Bogart (I worked at a radio station in Boston and spoke with both him and Aucoin several times) know that Gene sold his soul to greenbacks and bootie early on. Almost everything Gene says is motivated to ensure that a steady stream of both continues to flow in his direction. I don't for one second believe that Peter's take on things is 100% accurate, but it's probably as close as we're ever going to get. (To be fair, I've purchased, but not yet read Ace's book.)<br /><br />One problem that Peter has is an almost laughable gift for finding a way to blame anyone and anything for his troubles and woes. Even when begins by accepting his own role in a situation, within a paragraph or two he's found a way to shift it to another person.<br /><br />The other biggee is the frequency with which he contradicts himself. He constantly holds Gene's feet to the fire for being money motivated and insisting that KISS is a \\"brand\\" and not a \\"band.\\" Peter will swear that for him it was all about the music and that Gene's avarice destroyed the band while at the same time talking about how he threatened to quit because he found out Ace was getting XX more dollars per gig and so on.<br /><br />As I said, I don't believe that Peter's being deliberately deceptive or hypocritical, nor is he lying. He's laying out the truth as he remembers it. What actually occurred is most likely somewhere in the midst of the memories of all concerned - including the band members that came later. By NO means should that fact hinder you from picking up this book. It's more articulate than many celebrity \\"tell all\\" tomes. It's fairly obvious that Peter is trying to tell \\"his side\\" of Kisstory. If you are, or were ever, a fan of the band or the man, this is a must-read. If you've ever been curious or just enjoy autobiographies, this is among the better to come out in recent years.<br /><br />I've attempted to keep major spoilers out of this so as not to detract from the experience of reading for oneself while making potential customers aware of the shortcomings they may find.

B002VPE1AW|5.0|I love thnis movie. Well done. Things they can do nowsdays are amazing. I hope there will be other avatar movie.
B00846REIS|4.0|I liked this better than 50 Shades of Grey! It was very well written. I am looking forward to continuing this journey with Eva and Gideon.
B005KELQEU|4.0|This was the cheapest cover I could get for my kindle. It is a lot of money for an item that cost 50 cents to produce but it does what I bought it for and I suppose that you can't ask for more than that anymore.
B005UBNL0A|5.0|I recently upgraded my desktop and chose this CPU.  I went from an AMD Athlon 64 x2 to this. I very seriously considered switching to an Intel but in the end AMD is still a leader on price point.  Simply put why would I pay more for the same capability?<br /><br />I installed this CPU with the stock cooler on a GIGABYTE GA-970A-UD3 MoBo, 16Gb of RAM and Windows 7 64 Bit. The Graphics card is a Vision Tek Radeon 7850 with 2GB. I re-used my old Seagate 320GB HDD (SATA) and the Power Supply (450W).<br /><br />I have been running it over-clocked to 4200MHz for the past 2 weeks and been playing BF3 (Video Options set to High) on it frequently.  I did a clean wipe and install of my HDD when I re-built the system.  Everything is running beautifully.<br /><br />I have no complaints especially since I bought it here when it was at $94!<br /><br />UPDATE: It is now November, I have been running this overclocked at 4200MHz and still have not had a blip.  No special cooler or anything.  Hours of Battlefield 3 maxed out and the BF4 beta last month without a single issue.
B002WY65VU|5.0|Well let's start by saying this movie is NOT going to win any awards, unless it's a Razzie, but it is my kind of movie.  The Zombie's are &#34;realistic&#34; and if you shoot one it STAYS dead, well sometimes it may require a &#34;double tap&#34; but none of this blow 'em in half and they just keep coming.  I don't like any movie that defies physics.  Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin do a fantastic job holding my interest through out the entire movie and don't even get me started on the &#34;cameo&#34; by Bill Murry.  Be sure to watch the special features to learn that this California setting was really shot in Georgia and it was C-O-L-D in spite of the girls running around in summer clothes.  Like I started, this is no Academy Award Winner but I learned a long time ago that anything that wins one of those is usually a piece of crap to start with so I stay away.
B00A757EFW|3.0|It is what you would expect from a Pac Man game.  It is traditional and fairly true to the original without adding anything new or inventive.
B000001ESN|5.0|I didnt hear the band Rush before until two years ago. I love the band. The band is awesome. It is different than other music I have been listen to. I will buy more music from Rush.
B005YVTHT0|5.0|I wanted to try an online game called Simraceway.  I tried to use a mouse, and the keypad but didn't get the performance I wanted.  In just 15 minutes, I had the SRW-S1 dialed in, and was racing at Watkins Glenn and Indy!  Also came with $10 of Simraceway cash, and I was able to purchase a 2012 Dallara chassis with change left over.  I recommend it highly.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Have only used the calculator once but  I wanted one on my tablet because I carry is around with me
B003Y5H54W|4.0|Not sure I even understand a lot of it but it held my attention for the entire movie.  Kind of left me with more questions than satisfying results.  How come these people could walk around with snow falling all over the place like they were spending a day at the beach.  And what was going on with the red cape in the final few frames, it just kept getting longer and longer and longer. Did I miss something during the movie, where Grandma indicated the cape was magic?  Glad to see the religious fanatic get his just deserts. Pretty good movie.  I think I will have to watch it again now that I know more about what is going on so maybe I can figure more of it out.
B00884GR0W|2.0|I'm not a fan of Minecraft, but love RPGs and this game is sort of a mix of the two.  It didn't really draw me in and felt tedious after a while.
B000001ES9|5.0|I didnt hear the band Rush before until two years ago. I love the band. The band is awesome. It is different than other music I have been listen to. I will buy more music from Rush.
1451688091|5.0|Another Christmas gift that arrived in record time!  It was exactly what my daughter asked for and she was very happy.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I teach 7th grade so of course my kids have been into this series, I just never had a chance to read it but my husband got the movie, which I loved, so I wanted to read the book and wasn't disappointed. Can't wait to read the others!
B0092MEKJE|2.0|I've been a fan of this project since I first heard of it. I bought the first episode in disc format for 0.99 cents because of the immense talent associated with the project (winter, scorcese, buscemi, Etc) and have religiously followed it ever since. Despite HBO's obsession with pop psychology, and the show's many tangents regarding less than interesting characters, its historical accuracy and depth of development have kept me coming back for more... until now. A former U.S. Army man of Irish extraction myself, I have consistently found the episodes which most heavily feature James Darmody to be the best part of the series. Killing first his wife, and then Jimmy himself in the finale was a terrible mistake. Nucky, a previously tolerable lead, has now surpassed unlikable to the point that I'll never watch another episode. That his spineless nature has suddenly changed, evidenced by his willingness to pull a real live trigger when he was previously unwilling to order another man to do so, has left the show with nowhere to go and no one to root for.  I gave this episode two stars out of respect for its writing and the dedication with which the cast honors their respective characters. That said, I believe this episode marked the final chapter in Boardwalk Empire's turning to s*** before our eyes and I bid a fond farewell to a once valued program.
0756655730|5.0|This was a present and it was most enjoyed.  The pictures are great as well as the prehistoric life of creatures before the humans.
B00A4YVHXQ|4.0|From my kid's perspective: she can't put the game down.  She has been teaching herself piano and this app does an excellent job of reinforcing what she knows already.<br /><br />From my perspective:  I'm a decent piano player and thought I'd do well, but it took a few turns before I really got the hang of it.  It was fun and challenging at the same time.
B000001ESF|5.0|I didnt hear the band Rush before until two years ago. I love the band. The band is awesome. It is different than other music I have been listen to. I will buy more music from Rush.
1455519006|5.0|Thanks for the great service.  This was a Christmas gift for my daughter and she loved it.  It was also received in time.
0525953728|4.0|This is a good book explaining the details behind the UBL raid.  My favorite part is that which addresses all of the numb skulls who accused the author of treason by revealing too much sensitive information.  People who made such a charge and rallied against the book obviously never even read it.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|love this game! great puzzles. graphics are awesome...even startling sometimes! I love the storyline too. very imaginative. keep up the good work!
B008YWY0HK|4.0|Bought this for my 3 year old granddaughter. Movie a little above her. Scared her.  Cute. Had all the Disney stuff. Just. Missing something
1595825045|5.0|The art in this book is so amazing.  It really helps you see where the story came from and gave me an even greater appreciation for the series!
B000059XUT|5.0|This movie is awesome. It is a family movie. I bought this to finish my collection of Toy Story. Highly recommend
B00992CF6W|4.0|Well I think this game is awesome but there needs to be wolves and bigger maps but otherwise this game is on  of the best games I have ever come by
0307730697|5.0|This is one of the greatest books that I have ever read.  There's not much more to it than that.  If you like reading about SOF and stories of real life experiences in success, failure, and faith and belief in God you will find no greater book than this one.
B007HOOAH6|4.0|My grandson tried out the potty right after we read this.  I recommend it for those youngsters in training.<br /><br />Jackie
B0012DP8A6|5.0|I have always loved Little Shop of Horrors.  Now I can watch and listen to the music all the time.  My DVD was delivered very quickly, and the cost was very reasonable.
B005K17RU0|4.0|...no landscape on my Kindle 8.9.<br /><br />Add that &amp; 5 stars.<br /><br />I like the sun rise/set times.<br /><br />This form is difficult to use.
B0002NRQTI|5.0|I know Yes have been around for a long time. I love this band. Their music are different thanother music I listen to. I will buy more music from Yes.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I love YA, even if I am getting close to just being the 'A' part.  I like this series and the twists and turns and I enjoy the ride.  At times, it gets a bit verbose, but if I lived in the world of her imagination I am sure I would do the same.  It is always sad when a great story ends.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|I read this book quickly because it was so interesting. I love Nicholas Sparks books and thouroughly enjoyed this one.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved this book. Read it in a day!<br />Anyone who likes sparks will be overjoyed with this one, cannot wait for the movie!
B007M45PMU|5.0|I tried this album because it was recommended based on other purchases I had made and was on sale. Great choice. I really like the sound of this band.
B005LAII80|4.0|This was a great film for fans of Dredd, and a good action film in general. They obviously read the comics, as anyone who knows the series will see plenty of references to various storylines and in-universe products.<br /><br />The Dredd comics were usually a slice-of-life, just-another-day-in-the-work-of-Dredd, and the film captured that feeling perfectly. The entire incident was just another day to Dredd.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone interested in comic adaptations.
B000059Z8M|5.0|This movie is awesome. It is a family movie. I bought this to finish my collection of Toy Story 2. Highly recommend
B003WJQ74E|5.0|Though I could somewhat foresee the possibility of an unhappy ending, I loved the story, the writing and the fact that life does not always have happy endings.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|For years I seemed too busy to read recreationally. A year ago while I was waiting for a plane from Palm Springs and a kind lady asked me if I have read any of Lee Childs books. I said that I hadn't and she said that she loves them. I purchased the Book One Shot and quite liked the simplistic plot, predictability and the character Jack Reacher. I just finished The Killing Floor and I could tell it was an earlier novel. All the plots have this ex MP(or MP) get into something quite serious by coincidence. He is one tough SOB!<br />With 14 victims in this first novel, all beaten or shot, by Reacher I thought he might be going a bit overboard ,however, they are all justified within  the plot. The part I did not like however was some of the presearch on the weapons used in the story. It was quite inaccurate but at least non gun people wouldn't know the difference. It just bothered me that he wouldn't have had someone read it in America who has some background in the area. Partly could be that in Great Britain guns are very restricted. Overall, they are easy reads with a few thesaurus upgrades in vocabulary. There is continual action from the beginning to the end. The events fall in order and predictability for the reader should not be a problem. Now I'n not sure how old Jack is in the last novel but how can he stay 6\\"5\\" 250...Im jealous!
B004SOR4H6|2.0|Must be to old for this.  Just don't get the need for this.  I can get all the info I want with better information by looking at the headlines and other news sources.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|good stuff a little less description would have been nice found myself skimming thru several paragraphs or senteces of descriptive material
B002RI9UBS|4.0|I initially decided to read this story as the movie was about to be released. Whilst it is an interesting book about a boy and his tiger; I enjoyed the first part of the story more when Pi was in his home country.
B00001QEE7|5.0|This movie is a good. It is a family movie. I bought this to finish my collection of Little Mermaid. Highly recommend
B00ANT9MZW|2.0|Just finished looking at this movie in theater. the story well written the camera well used in all its angles that draws you into the subject matter.. The main actress as with the rest of the actors in my mind were excellent.. did not give it a four or five stars only because of the low voice volume dialogue among the actors during crucial information being exchanged either they talked to quickly and in a low voice either under noisy sequenses or normal conditions of the film.. at times I got lost in the dialogue trying hard to make out what actors were saying and i have excellent hearing... I do give credits how the movie rolled along including dates and flashbacks of OBL's previous other terrorists missions seemed accurate, and the action leading up to Zero Dark Thirty. Would have loved it if they had shot the Seal Team Six training for the mission but that was not included, as with the President and his staff in the situation room...Would buy this DVD in bargain bin just to have.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|This season picked up right where season one left off.  There was a seamless transition even though the series lost Andy Whitfield, spartacus season one, it was still action packed and all around awesome.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Nice layout. Easy to understand and read.  Was easy to load and setup. Just what I was looking for on my Kindle.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I say this is the best book yet.  In this book Percy Jackson is sent to Camp Jupiter, the Roman camp
B0043VDIAG|5.0|I seem to always fly through novels written by Nicholas Spark. The magic a small town has on someone is beautifully presented in this story.
B005D0RDIE|5.0|I know Rush have been around for a long time. I love this band. Their music are different thanother music I listen to. I will buy more music from Rush.
0345525558|5.0|Bought this for my mom and she absolutely loved it and couldn't put it down. Great choice for her b-day.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|these books are awesome.  I can see why hbo decided to make a show from them.  cant wait for season three to start.
B007UXT6T6|4.0|At times this next &#34;mission&#34; of the franchise leaves me breathless and heart pounding. I have never base-jumped, and can only imagine the blended terror and thrill; but the long, action filled scenes and split-second timing works as all of us have come to expect from Ethan and his team. As the action unfolds, the plot reveals itself grudgingly. Every time I anticipated the next factoid to zoom into focus, a twist of fate intervened. Great entertainment!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|A nice love story. Maybe too much sex -^in book one especially - but the love story itself is so special and the suspense is so great that could not stop ready it. Enjoyed it very much.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|this is a good game. I like the detail in it. the animals are so cute. and it is free!
B00005JXY3|5.0|I bought this movie to finish my karate kid collection. It is fun to watch. The price was very good
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Love this movie! Hilarious, it had both myself and boyfriend entertained! Would definitely recommend watching this movie! LOVE LOVE LOVE
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|it is non-functional worst app i've seen. would not recommend to anyone. should not be put out there for an app.
B000I9TY4G|5.0|Strong continuity of storyline. Action packed. Full character development. I found myself thinking &#34;so this is what happens around the next bend in the plot.&#34; I watched every episode of the Firefly seasons and enjoyed each one. I was seeking the next season when I found the movie &#34;Serenity&#34; named after the Firefly model of star-ship from the seasons. The core actors move with the ample story from TV to the movies in seamless characters and plot. I am on the lookout for more Firefly. I am transported into their world and find the experience refreshing whether spending an evening at home, or from the road as a break from the workday.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Thought i was getting a good deal, this is not a real lifeproof case. The buttons are stiff, the sound is muffled, and the overall workmanship of the case is very poor. Very dissatisfied
B00AN93Q0O|5.0|Itunes recommended this CD to me. I would usually be like, eh Itunes doesnt really know what i like, and brush it off, but then i hear the first single \\"Holding On To You\\" and was confused. Is this the same thing Itunes suggested? No way. It's too good. It's originality and creative aggresive/peaceful sound dumbfounded me and i simply was at a loss for words. THEN i found out how old these two were. They are either seniors in high school, or fresh out of that hell, and this amazed the hell out of me. i am older than these magicians, and i could never achieve anything of this magnitude. so after all of my surprise, i went onto spotify and the whole CD has been on repeat since Wed. and that leaves me feeling so content. Now here is a track by track review. i'll keep it short, and it is my opinion so dont hate:<br /><br />1. Ode To Sleep: Amazing song to open the album with. the synth work that leads into this very unique, almost futuristic percussion, is outstanding, and then in comes the rap. and the maturity of the lyrical content is insane. i have no critique for this song at all (lets be real now by the way, ill have no critiques for any song. each one is great in their own way. 10/10<br /><br />2. Holding On To You: perfect single. poppy, but holds onto their sound very well. i hope to hear this on all the radio stations (since it is an example of almost all genres.) 9/10<br /><br />3. Migraine: My favorite song on the album. the flow of the rap, the lyrical content, the hook of the chorus... it is perfection. absolutly amazing. 11/10 ;)<br /><br />4. House of Gold: the lyrics of this song seem a lot more personal than the others, and it is a bit slowed down with a really cool acoustic strumming throughout, with some rad piano work about a quater of the way through. 8/10<br /><br />5. Car Radio: OH MY GOD. the agression at the end of this song sends chills down my spine, and i feel like there is a metaphor with the \\"car radio\\" aspect of the song which i am eitherto dumb to figure out, or am simply over thinking. but when he screams at the end it makes your heart stop. i would hate to have MY car radio stolen, cuz then i couldnt listen to TOP :p sorry i had to 10/10<br /><br />6. Semi-Automatic: at times reminds me of MGMT or a really old (back when they were good) 3OH!3... great track. good to dance to. 9/10<br /><br />7. Screen: another emotional one. you can tell in his voice. it sounds so pained, and you can really feel that in this song. the singing at the begining is great, and the chorus is another catchy diddy. (an i think everyone can relate to its message) 9.5/10<br /><br />8. The Run & Go: another MGMT sounding song. the \\"do-do-do\\" part is wicked fun to listen to, and it makes the whole song a good listen (not as much rapping in this one, and i must say i miss it. his flow is very powerful and unique... and it really ties the songs together.. not that this one is bad without it... you know what i mean) 8/10<br /><br />9. Fake You Out: another powerful chorus. great beat throughout. good song. 8/10<br /><br />10. Guns For Hands: another lack of rapping. cool metaphor, and very arena rock sound to the chorus, but what really rocks this song is the music aspect to it. the instrumental part is SO AWESOME. it just loops you in, and is very trancy and trippy... but that makes it really cool to veg out to 9/10<br /><br />11. Trees: its a slow one folks. but it seems liek a love song, of sorts. i feel like it would be great to slow dance to, and also would be very beaufitul acoustic. he could really belt out those meaningful words and it would be fantastic i am sure. it picks up about halfway through into a swing kind of feel (if you were slow dancing to it, i could picture people spinning around and sh!t... haha) but nevertheless its another awesome song 9.5/10<br /><br />12. Truce: slowest of the slow. but it is fitting since \\"Trees\\" ended moderatly fast. but again a lack of rapping. it seems the rapping was ditched about halfway through the album, but its okay. it has a progression from this fast paced angry rap/rock sound to a very mature and lyrically powerful sound. the melody in this one remind me of a \\"Mumford and Sons\\" song. but that is a good thing, trust me. anyway, its a great ender, and it leaves you thinking for sure 10/10<br /><br />SO overall i give Vessel a 9.9/10 (and that is only because i love his rapping so much i wanted MOREEEEE) but anyway it is hands down the most unique and game-changer esque sounding album i have had the pleasure to rockout to in years. well done boys, and if you are reading this, thank you so damn much for gracing us with this fantastic piece of art<br /><br />im out *drops mic*<br /><br />oh and another thing, they prove you dont have to swear to be cool in a band. they prove you can be yourself and itll pay off. amazing freaking album. :D
B00004R99J|5.0|It is a great movie. I bought this to finish my collection of Pocahntas. I highly recommend to anyone who likes family movies.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is so heart touching. I have to get the second one!<br />It has everything someone could want in a book.....romance, action, survival, and mystery. Love it!!
B004SUWR2C|5.0|another excellent card game on the kindle HD. highly recommend to all the card players.  an older game that keeps coming back for more.
B005Y423ZC|1.0|It's too bad the directing is so awful, because this is a great concert. However, the director/editor must have a huge ego, as there are so many quick cuts that it is very hard to watch. The video never lingers on anything for more than 4 seconds, and the view jumps around about 40 times per minute. Very lame and distracting from the music!
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I bought this movie for my wife and she absolutely loves it. It's one of the few movies I've seen her watch multiple times. I watched it with her and it has good music, a good story and a great ending.

B001ANSS5K|4.0|This book, unlike most John Green books, (the ones I've read so far at least) did not leave me weeping I  the fetal position, which is why this book has 4 stars instead of 5. His words were just as powerful and the characters were just as lovable (especially Radar), but I wanted to feel heartache. High praise for the plot and character development though.
0345803485|5.0|good low price compared to other retailers. good reading and suggested to others to buy it. cant wait to read the other editions.
B003TGMFG4|4.0|While reading this book I couldn't help but ask myself if I would ever be anything like Chris McCandless in a few years.  Maybe being a teen female reader has something to do with my answer, but I can't imagine that I could be.  It's not the journey that McCanless takes that made me feel this way; it's the foolish manner in which he went about the journey.  The book was a page turner because I wanted to see how every new escapade that Chris encountered was going to turn out but the ending, in many ways, is predictable.  Remember as you read the book, that it is non-fiction.  Happy endings aren't always the case in real life.  I couldn't wrap my head around Chris' overly trusting and naïve nature.  He was an educated and well versed young man when he decided to venture off.  Chris McCandless was naïve in thinking he had the answer to his problems and was reckless and immature to do what he did.<br /> The book is well written by Jon Krakauer who clearly identifies with Chris McCandless.  The book reverts to personal experiences and feelings that Krakauer himself experiences at Chris' age and his own explosive relationship with his father.  I do feel that Krakauer is objective and tells the story fairly.  At times it is hard to decipher if Krakauer is speaking about McCandless or himself.<br /> It is the true story of a young upper middle class man who should be getting ready to conquer the world after graduating from Emory University with honors but instead decides to give away his car, his money and at times his own name, to venture off to the Alaskan wilderness alone without telling anyone what he was doing or where he was going.  This is Chris's way of showing his parents, specifically his father that he doesn't need his money, his advice or his guidance on what the \\"right thing\\" to do is.  Chris wants to prove he can make it on his own and that he didn't need possessions to prove his worth.<br />This book is frustrating to read if you disagree with Chris's decision to make the journey the way he did.  He could have made the very same journey safely and still proved to himself that he could be independent, without placing himself in as much danger.  Backpacking across the United States is done every day.  Young people should not be discouraged from climbing mountains, visiting new places and meeting new people with very different lifestyles than we know.  Chris McCandless's decision to do it the way he did was what made him foolish.<br /> Anyone 14 and up would enjoy reading the book.  Young male readers may identify with Chris' character a bit more than most, but no one should read the book without understanding that it didn't have to end the way it did.  This book is a great example to young people that making rash decisions can be dangerous.  All readers who are close to college age or can remember back to that time in their life have or will feel like Chris McCandless at some point in some way, but luckily not everyone is as impulsive or has the luxury to be.<br />This book would be extremely frustrating to read for someone struggling with tuition payments, struggling to pay rent and really wishing they had half of the wealth and opportunity that McCandless so recklessly throws away.

B001GCUO5W|3.0|For whatever reason I didn't get around to seeing this movie when it was new, but I remembered the creepy previews and given the Scorcese/DiCaprio pedigree I always wanted to check it out.  I love Martin Scorcese and really do concur that he is probably the greatest film maker of his generation.  However, after finally getting around to checking out this one, I was really expecting something a little more memorable.  Maybe I got my hopes up, or maybe I read too much into the eerie previews and assumed a more supernatural tone, or maybe it's that Scorcese does what he can adapting this from the novel.  Either way the final product was a better than average mystery that left me underwhelmed.  I also remember reviews claiming it had a great &#34;twist&#34; involved in the finale.  It might have been a surprising twist 30yrs ago, but in todays world where every movie seems to have a twist of some sort I was able to peg the twist well before it occurred about 10-20 minutes into the film.  It was so simple and obvious that I actually kept wondering if I was wrong or if there would be some sort of double twist, but sadly there wasn't.  The acting is great.  DiCaprio has steadily morphed into someone who can't have a bad performance and the always great Mark Ruffalo and Ben Kingsley are wonderful in supporting roles.  The movie is well made and you can tell the quality that went into it all around.  This elevates it slightly from other general popcorn fare, but only so much.  In the end I just really was hoping for not just an OK mystery, but a great Scorcese film.

B0055IU4GM|5.0|this was a gift for my husband who liked it very much. i also enjoy a fair amount of Mr. Hiatt's music, but though he wrote the song Train to Birmingham for which he deserves much credit it almost hurt my ears to hear it on this disc after hearing Kevin Welch sing it in such a beautiful and haunting manner.

1884822312|5.0|I love chess or I wouldn't have bought this book.  I'm glad I did.  It looks kind of cheap as far as the paper used in the pages but it's what's inside that's really great in my opinion.  The problems are fun for a chess player to work out and it started me looking at positional problems more simply.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I found this book to be one of my favorite by Stephen King. I used to read all his books but then some got to be too off-the-wall and complicated.<br /><br />I loved the background information and was remember exactly where I was when the Cuban missile crisis and the assassination of JFK occurred. the characters were quirky and lovable.<br /><br />I absolutely could not put it down and read it in 2 days!!! And lately, the ending was sooooooo good.<br /><br />I rank this up there with Under the Dome which was great.<br /><br />Great read, you will not be disappointed.

B00A3AUGEW|5.0|And on this album, you get it. Usually on an album there are tracks you just love, maybe some tracks you hate, and several tracks that are just okay. Not on this one! All of the tracks were, IMHO, top quality on all levels. Lyrics, music, arrangement, everything clicks and hums along like a well oiled and happy machine. LOVED IT!

0393334988|4.0|I read this many years ago and it has stayed in my mind ever since as one of the most moving books I've ever read.<br /><br />Eric Lomax was a prisoner of war, captured in Singapore in 1942.<br /><br />He was sent to work on the `death railway' - on the River Kwai in Thailand. He tells of his terrible ordeal of torture and punishment with a quiet dignity.<br /><br />And along the way, he manages to find a way to forgive his past.<br /><br />I don't know why I picked up this book as war memoria are not usually in my reading repertoire. But I'm so glad I did.<br /><br />So shocking, so moving, I cried many tears. His fortitude and acceptance, a sense of distance, with great quietness, is what touched me most.<br /><br />Eric died recently and sadly will not live to see the film currently being made of his words.<br /><br />An amazing story and a great read.

B00AFROVQC|5.0|this is the first book i have read by morgan rice.  i am a little old fashioned and like the hero to stay alive get the girl and live happily ever after.  this series so far stays with those guidelines.  i hope the next book is as good as this one was.
0765325950|5.0|I'm not going to get into the whole debate about eBooks or any of that stuff.  I just wanted to say that the long wait is finally over, and that the book was a good end to the series.  It wrapped up all the open threads that I was still curious about, and with Sanderson thankfully he didn't open any new characters, (ok, one exception, but that was a loose thread already).<br /><br />If you have read the first 13, you really do need to read this one.  Even if you didn't care for Jordan's last couple books, this one is worth it.<br /><br />I think if anything else I like Sanderson's way of writing better than Jordan's.<br /><br />I think I'm going to wait about 6 months or so then I'll read the entire series again from start to finish.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Pretty fun to help pass time and to build points to do other things. Can be challenging at times which makes it addictive to play.
B00AFEXRME|2.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0<br /><br />'Flight', Robert Zemeckis' first live-action film in twelve years, starts off with one of the most spine-tingling, harrowing plane crash disaster scenes in cinematic history. Denzel Washington as the plane's alcoholic pilot, Captain William \\"Whip\\" Whittaker, crash lands his jet into a field after a broken jackscrew causes a catastrophic loss of control. Loosely based on a fatal Air Alaska crash in 2000, Whip successfully saves 96 out of 102 lives, by inverting the aircraft, right before it goes down.<br /><br />Whip winds up in the hospital and soon recovers from minor injuries. Despite being hailed as a hero (a la the real-life Captain \\"Sully\\" Sullenberger), Whip was drunk during the flight and the National Transportation Safety Board now has a toxicology test taken when he first arrives at the hospital, that proves it. Fortunately for him, his tough as nails attorney, Hugh Lang (played by Don Cheadle), is able to quash the report due to irregularities in the blood test.<br /><br />While the aforementioned plane crash is riveting, the bulk of 'Flight' is unfortunately just another tale of a sad sack alcoholic wrestling with his demons. Some may be impressed by the ambiguity of a man who can be both a hero and an angry, aggressive, self-destructive alcoholic at the same time--but most of 'Flight' is a story we've seen before.<br /><br />While in the hospital, Whip meets Nicole who is recovering from a heroin overdose. Earlier, we see Nicole before she meets Whip and it's quite clear that her addiction is extensive. It seems rather odd that Whip would take Nicole under his wings at this juncture especially with the possibility of extensive media scrutiny, but he decides anyway to bring her back to his (now) deceased father's farm (why it takes the media a few days before they actually go out and confront Whip at the farm, doesn't ring true at all).<br /><br />Nicole is there to contrast her quick transcendence over her addiction as opposed to Whip's continuing denial (it seems awfully convenient that such a severe addict as Nicole, is able to see the light, so quickly!). Still, Denzel Washington does a fine job in conveying just how hard it is to deal with someone who is an alcoholic (some of the best later scenes are Whip's confrontations with Nicole).<br /><br />The rest of 'Flight' chronicles Whips' continuing downward spiral. There is Whip's visit to his ex-wife and son which ends quite badly and Charlie Anderson (the union rep) along with his attorney's attempt to sober him up before the big NTSB hearing. That whole scene is perhaps the least convincing in the film. You'll recall that Whip is placed in a hotel room where he has no access to alcohol. Even though they hire a bodyguard to watch the room, they don't bother to check to see if the adjoining room is stocked with alcohol. Furthermore, why would the door to the adjoining room be unlocked?--unless you've paid for the other room, a hotel would not leave such a door open.<br /><br />In the end, Zemeckis must opt for the 'Hollywood' ending. At the crucial moment, Whip suddenly has a change of heart, and admits 'everything' at the NTSB hearing. In this case, he won't let the flight attendant he was sleeping with before the ill-fated flight, be blamed for 'drinking while on duty' (Whip won't impugn her reputation since she was responsible for saving a child during the crash). Is this enough for a man so in denial as Whip is, to suddenly 'come clean'? Unlikely. It would have been a lot more troubling if Zemeckis showed Whip staying in denial and is cleared at the hearing--but Zemeckis needs a feel good ending. Whip does go to prison afterward but is on his way to reconciliation with his son (who visits him in prison) and presumably with the ex-wife. There's also a rather obvious moral tale here--Whip articulates it when he states at the film's conclusion that he finally feels 'free' in prison, as he is no longer hitting the bottle.<br /><br />Despite a pretty positive critical reception, there were a number of critics who refused to jump on the bandwagon--recognizing that the story surrounding Denzel's performance, in the words of LA Times critic Kenneth Turan, \\"is not as subtle or involving as his performance.\\" Turan feels that 'Flight\\" \\"plays at times like a feature-length infomercial for the powers of AA.\\" David Fear agrees: \\"Take out the opening jaw-dropper, and you've essentially got The Lost Weekend Redux. Despite Washington going the full nine yards ugly-drunk-wise, there's little to distinguish this from every other entry in the cinema du addiction genre: You'll get the requisite denial, hitting rock bottom and then rockier bottom, relapse and, finally, a moment of clarity.\\"<br /><br />Stan Hall in the Portland Oregonian feels that Zemeckis' \\"best-known work has a tendency to go for grand gestures, old-fashioned moralizing and outcomes that can often be spotted from miles away.\\" And he finds that, \\"there's not much real value to this oddly slick stab at popcorn entertainment about a person's debilitating alcoholism.\\" Andrew O'Hehir in Salon concurs that Zemeckis is a \\"technical wizard\\" but \\"drama just isn't his instrument\\": \\"Slowly but surely, \\"Flight\\" degenerates from a tale of moral paradox and wounded romance into a mid-1990s after-school special about addiction and recovery. You get the feeling the filmmakers are aiming for a star-driven combo of the Sully saga and \\"Crime and Punishment.\\"<br /><br />I quote these critics to point out that I'm not the only one who has reservations about this film. I think most of us will agree that the plane crash scene and Denzel's excellent performance are the highlights of the film. I'm not sure how many will agree with me and these other discerning critics, that Flight's narrative is nothing special, with its pedestrian emphasis on one man's quest to purge his alcoholic demons and the obvious exhortation to embrace sobriety.rison, as he is no longer hitting the bottle.<br /><br />Despite a pretty positive critical reception, there were a number of critics who refused to jump on the bandwagon--recognizing that the story surrounding Denzel's performance, in the words of LA Times critic Kenneth Turan, \\"is not as subtle or involving as his performance.\\" Turan feels that 'Flight\\" \\"plays at times like a feature-length infomercial for the powers of AA.\\" David Fear agrees: \\"Take out the opening jaw-dropper, and you've essentially got The Lost Weekend Redux.

B00199B2Z8|4.0|Great book. A collection of his columns, it takes a humorous look at American culture and all it's ridiculousness. Not as awesome as his single-event stories (like A Walk In The Woods), but still made me laugh out loud many times.

B008B68J2G|5.0|My daughter loved all of the accessories that come with it.  You do have to be careful that small children are close to get the small pieces, but other than that a great toy for girls especially if they love monster high.
B0000029D1|5.0|Great live CD. The &#34;All Blues&#34; cut is one of the best non Miles versions I 've heard. True jazz listeners will love it.

B009JBZH54|5.0|This is a great boxset and a must have for any fan of the new Batman movies.  I'm not a big fan of extras, but the ones in this set were of high quality and interesting.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Never heard or played this game before but it seems pretty cool. Plays the way its suppose to on my kindle fire.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|This is a fun game but if you choose not to connect to a social network and bother your friends with constant game requests you will not be able to earn any hearts.  Without hearts 30% of the game cannot be unlocked.
B00479SVBU|4.0|EDIT, UPDATE.<br />I was contacted by Satechi and they offered to send a free replacement. Impressed, I accepted the offer and I received the replacement yesterday. It even came with a pre-paid shipping label should it not work again!<br />Turns out it works great so far. I have about 450 songs in 1 folder and it does a good job at shuffle, unlike getting stuck in a shuffle pattern like many other electronic devices. The remote works, but not while holding it at the steering wheel, have to point it directly at the device. The sound is clear, as best as it will be through FM. Construction seems fine to me. Overall a good product. Though I cant give it 5 stars because of the original DOA one and remote issue. I would reccomend this.<br /><br />-ORIGINAL-<br />Not much to say. Does not work at all, will not turn on. Awaiting refund. I thought I was making a good decision buying this, being the cheap $20 one from K-Mart did not work either. I think this is the last time I purchase any FM transmitting equipement that is supposed to play music. Just because its more expensive does not mean better...
B003JTHXOK|5.0|beautiful story I would wish to think if I fall sick I would have the same courage as jo in the story .
B009MCRHH6|1.0|Just couldn't get into the game.  Just not my kind of game to begin with.  Don't know what else I can say.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thought it was a great book and it was very exciting and it was a very very romantic book
B004SBS8LA|5.0|My son loves this game. Lots of new levels and fun things to see. Plenty of add on play and I like that it's ad free. Another great Angry Birds product.
B00AES0AZI|3.0|Perhaps I was expecting too much after having read so much effusive praise from reviewers and the author's own comments but I must admit I only liked this book I enjoyed the themes and found many nice turns of phrase,however, I found the plot to be fairly predictable and the characters to be one dimensional good/bad guys It wasn't an unpleasant way to spend a few hours, just not as memorable an experience as I had been expecting
0143116177|1.0|Happens about one third into the book. Not content in praising the dictator's economic acumen, he gives a completely lopsided and FACTUALLY WRONG account of Pinochet's bloody coup d'êtat. Reads like the old Pravda singing the \\"Glorious Revolution.\\"<br /><br />Don't make the same mistake I did. Don't give this person money. If you're morbidly curious about this book's contents, please go to a public library.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|This is great to fine the name and who did it when you need to fine a music sheet, then play a long with it.
B009CG29RK|5.0|excellent movie. clean for children and humor for adults as well. can't wait for part 2 to come out !!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I read a lot - as in I probably go through 200 books in the average year but I'm not normally someone who rereads books other than say Harry Potter or the Hunger Games. I've read Beautiful Disaster at least 3 times. Something about Abby and Travis's relationship and Jamie McGuire's writing just really draws me in. Definitely my favorite book this year.
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|Interesting conspiracy theory, as all the Bourne stories, with an exciting, if unbelievable chase scene. Great scenery and special effects.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Absolutely amazing and wow I'm at a loss of words. My new favorite book for sure. Can pick up and start from the beginning again. Wow.
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|Great game I just wish it didn't take so long to find a game.  I have had the game for four days and have been able to play about three online games.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is so addicting, but I love it! My sister got me hooked on it on her ipad. i was so happy that Amazon had it for my Kindle Fire. Download it if you have the chance!
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|Great &#34;shoot'em up movie&#34;, you can never go wrong with the AA12. Also loved the cross over quotes from the movies those actors are notorious for. Yippee-ki-yay....
B005HSG3TC|5.0|great fit and the protection is good . This units doesn't get abused but is used. I would buy another one for my family.
B003ES5ZPK|3.0|I chose this rating due to the fact that I was hoping that it would work for my TV and wall mount. My input/outputs come STRAIGHT out the ack of my LG 47LS4500, and I got the Cheta wall mount. Due to the way that my input/outputs are and the slim design of the mount, it was if I was stll trying to plug a regular cable ito the TV. This made the TV want to rest away from the wall and resting on the cable. I am sure that this would work in other situations, but not in my case.<br /><br />I think that if you are wall mounting your TV, and your input/outputs/ come straight out the back, this will probibly not work.<br /><br />I was overall impressed with it, but due to the fact that it didn't work for me, I must down grade it.<br /><br />What I did buy was a plain 90 (no adjusting) that did the job.
B0078XGEK2|2.0|Had I known it was a psyhco babble book I wouldn't have ordered it.  It goes on and on and on and on.....
B001U3Y5XE|4.0|This is a great family game.  The only issue I have is that it cost me too much money to get it.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I'm still learning how to get to some passages.  Find it difficult sometimes.  It's not as easy as I thought to go to different books of the Bible.
B002MU4NL8|5.0|Every once in a while I just have to watch this movie. Hilarious and some good one-liners. You will like!
B0086700CM|5.0|if I was Indiana Jones I'd find my way out with the idol and leave behind the maniacal chimps and not miss a beat I'd be one happy dude.<br />Unfortunately that's not going to happen cause this game is not only addictive but very fast paced and the graphics looks great on my kindle.<br />Also this game is great for improving my eye/hand coordination which helps my brain stay sharp and active.<br />Anyone can play this. Try it ....but heed my warning it's very addicting.
B004QX07G4|5.0|Very light, funny read. If you love Ellen you'll definitely love the book. I almost felt as if she was reading it to me. Made me laugh out loud a lot.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|AGAIN, the musical of a decade. This is the Les Mis cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me. It has revolutionary action; heart felt romance; faith-forgiveness-retribution; aesthetic musical. Hugh Jackman as John Valjean, convict 24601, looks the ferocious revolutionary facially; sings fiercefully, romantically, and beautifully; and deserves his Oscar nomination. As does this film. My vote has changed from Spielberg's \\"Lincoln\\" to \\"Les Mis\\" after one viewing. I WILL go back, I will buy the DVD.<br /><br />Les Mis is a musical, it's about music, arguably the best ever written for the stage. This film version of the 18th century French chronicle has raised the bar for film musicals. This well known story and theatre hit has been upgraded via film. It takes the best of what theatre has to offer and adds close-up, a mega cast, and music perfection that makes this film-musical ever more magical.<br />Close-ups allow the stunning singers to add powerful facial emotion to the well-known Les Mis lyrics, right down to nasal hairs, warts, moles, freckles on a comrade, tears flowing into snot, and the sweat of love. Fantine (Oscar nominated Anne Hathaway) is stellar in song, but I'd give an Oscar to her daughter Cosette (Amanda Seyfried- `Mama Mia!') with her voice, body, face, and acting performance.<br />I didn't know Russell Crowe [Javert] could sing, and do it well, too.<br />The young lad on the barricade, Gavroch, was Daniel Huttlestone in his first film role, but surely not his last. He also played Gavroch in Queen's Theatre performances. What a voice.<br />Costumes & sets are spectacles all their own. You almost smell the 1700s.<br />Les Mis theme comes from one of it's songs, \\"To love another person is to see the face of God.\\"<br /><br />But the film ended and I had to leave, c'est la vie.<br />IT'S THE FIRST TIME I HAVE EVER GIVEN ROLLING CREDITS ON A SCREEN A STANDING OVATION.<br />The film was as alive as the theatre stage. A tour de force. C'est magnifique!
B0083EM24C|5.0|Should be record of the year 2012. I love this album and Passion Pit. Now listening to their previous album Manners. You will not be disappointed!
B00062IDCO|5.0|The movies were GREAT.  If you are a  Trekkie  I would by this to either start or finish my collection of Star Trek.
1419705849|5.0|This was the only Christmas present my grandson took to bed with him. He reads.I love it. I recommend the series.
1594484805|5.0|This is the first book I've read by Daniel Pink and the \\"book\\" is much shorter than it looks.  The first half establishes that motivation is different than most business people might suppose.  The latter portion is devoted to new ideas, some reiterated, about how to achieve a higher motivation.<br /><br />The writing is fluid and gets to the point fairly quickly with interesting anecdotes and research studies from experts.  Pink's argument is based on the idea that human motivation is like a computer program that throughout human history has received minor upgrades and some not-so-minor ones.  Motivation 1.0, as he calls it, was a primitive survival instinct type of motivation, suitable only for cavemen neighboring saber-toothed tigers and relying on the protection of small communities of early humans.  Motivation 2.0 is a much more recent kind of motivation used in the traditional workplace.  This incentive structure is based on the idea that people will do more of the things they are rewarded for and less of the things that they are punished for.  Science demonstrates not only that this is false, but that the opposite is true.  People who are told they will be rewarded with something if they complete a specific task or are asked to meet a certain goal within a time frame will focus on the reward itself more than the task at hand, leading to lower quality work at best and gaming the system or cheating at worst.<br /><br />A much more advanced upgrade is needed to this part of our psychological software, Pink argues.  This upgrade is Motivation 3.0, based on the idea that the intrinsic motivators of autonomy, mastery, and purpose are the stuff that really deep down propels our actions.  The details of this new theory are of great importance in the business field and no thinker about human motivation should go without them.
B00AEFVRB2|1.0|&#34;GD&#34; this and &#34;GD&#34; that .. on and on and on.... the T&A scenes were pathetic.  Lack of overall engagement.  I really felt like trash for watching it...
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey Season 3 is a Great series!!!  No other show like it is currently in the making.  A must see.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|There's more involved in it than just letting them fly--you have to try and think it through, to hit the right point, to get the best results. I like it, but my grandsons-Love IT!
B00004Y3OU|4.0|This version is considerably longer than the theatrical version seen in the USA in the late 80's. If you really liked the theatrical version (which I do) the director's cut may be something you can embrace as a device for closure. The theatrical version has some scenes which end by leaving the viewer somewhat puzzled due cuts to the original film that interupt continuity and leave you with some unanswered questions. My understanding is the long version was not well received in Italy due to its length. When it was recut for international consumption the shortened version was welcomed and is now considered a classic. The potent team of Guiseppe Tornatore (director and writer) and Ennio Morricone (music) have created a beautiful film. I would recommend the director's cut to people who love this film, students of film and people that need full closure in their movie viewing. The ending to this film is poignant and touching in either version (they are essentially the same).
0307592731|5.0|This was one of the best memoirs I have read in recent years.  Strayed does a particularly good job of fitting her memories into the ongoing narrative of her time on the Pacific Crest Trail.  The book is beautifully written and emotionally evocative.
B008K6DU4Y|5.0|Plays formats that most phones /tablets will not. It can play AVI, MP4 formats among others. Flawless operation and playback. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
1594744769|5.0|This book was really cute and a good read!  It kept you interested the whole way through.  It was mysterious and adventurous.  I think anyone from about 11 to 50 years of age would like it!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book was not what I thought it would be , but it grabbed me and keeled me reading till the end. It was really good a nice change.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My wife wanted this game and is now addicted to it.  I have enjoyed it also (on the rare occasion that I can get it away from her or our sons).
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Easily picks up your library of music on your phone and syncs up with Amazons cloud player.  Especially loving this with the addition of the new Auto Rip feature!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I have played BTD4, own BTD5 Delux on p.c. and BTD5 on my kindle. Payed $12 for the delux version and $3 for kindle version and kindle version is by far just the best TD game I shaved played.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|This little amp works better than I could have imagined. The size, the price and the quality way above my expectation. Buy it and be susprised like I was.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this even more than the first one, can't wait to read mockingjay. Love this series, it's my favorite!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Was a great book and can't wait to finish reading the last 2 books. I love it and expect the other 2 to be great also.
0374214913|3.0|The things I liked about this book: exploring intersection of technology at its best (graphic design, e.books, cyber community of DIY-ers, virtual libraries, ruby, google, etc.) and older world of books, fonts, cryptography, secret societies, old libraries and bookstores.<br />The things I did not like:<br />The book is very naïve and it fails to explore in any depth topics of censorship, companies which claim not to be evil, true nature of good and evil, and some kind of battle between the two.<br />The characters are one dimensional and cartoonish.<br />The \\"do-good-ers\\" neatly fall in line and are all doing \\"Good For A Goodness Sake\\".  Young Apprentice and Wise Master... Cute and bubbly girlfriend.. Reliable childhood friend. Somewhat weird roommates, but also nice and reliable, with just hint of strangeness which brings them to that hipster cool... And throughout the book they will stay plane, clean cut and vanilla nice.<br />The villain's character lacks basic evilness, and he is rather portrayed  as a misguided man who did not live to his full potential. The fight between \\"do-gooders\\" and the villain is boring and villain's defeat is anticlimactic, and unsatisfactory.<br />It is fun to read, but its inherited naivet&eacute;, leaves you wanting for something with a bit of a twist.
B004UJCYYW|5.0|I am still amazed that we can download instantly at a no charge on a Kindle a large amount of classic literature like Victor Hugo's Les Miserables. This is a great read if you are a native French speaker. Get the free English version otherwise.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I read this book twice already, and I still can't get over how great it is. John green is an amazing writer and I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys John Green. Anyone who hasn't read any of his books should still read this, it's truly wonderful.
B006O6F932|5.0|Like a lot of kids Christmas morning, our grandchildren were inundated with toys.  The monster high playset was the biggest success of them all and still is.  Between the dolls, purchased seperately, and this well designed &#34;school&#34; our granddaughter has yet to grow tired of it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I thought it w.as a sweet love story but the plot explodes!  Many twist and turns. Great read, very enjoyable.
1439170916|4.0|I found this book really interesting, most of my family has died of one kind of cancer of another so I have always been fascinated by it. I am in now way a scientist or doctor, and I had no problem following the terminology. The end does get a little slow, but there is so much information to disseminate I'm not sure how it could have been done any more interestingly.
B0086700CM|4.0|This I  one of the games that get really boring after a while then You delete after a while so I recommended
B005LAIHZY|5.0|The whole family loved this movie. We have watched it at the theater multiple times and once it came out on DVD have watched it some more.  The quality of the script and story line combined with the beautiful animation make it a must have.
B00A135YUW|5.0|Paradise is an very good album. I love Lana del Rey and love her music. It takes a couple of listens to get accustomed to some non-tradtional songs, but you will love them afterwards. My favourite songs include: &#34;Ride&#34;, &#34;American&#34;, and &#34;Yayo&#34;.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Clint just keeps getting better and better with every new movie he makes. Hope he makes another one soon. T
B005SCSL56|5.0|This book was an adventure from start to finish. Chris Colfer is a very talented author. He weaves magic into his writing that delights the mind and inspires the soul.
B008V0OLOW|5.0|Love the music and lyrics; even though many of the words written during RagTime, these songs would not be appropriate in the salon. Introspective, a little dark, with a touch of the blues. My favorite is Glad Rag Doll and You're not worth the salt of my tears.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Scarpetta at her best! Great action and more interpersonal twists than in any of the recent books of this series. I can't wait for the next book.
B00AB0AR2U|4.0|Much better than the animie they tried to make prior to this. The animie was good but not like seeing Milla kick but on the zombies.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|Completely useless!  The one thing I think Amazon needs to work on is the camera.  This app was a useless attempt to do so.
0425252868|4.0|was  excepoinally well written a real page turner gave new inside look at German army aqnd air force tactics and horror of third reich

B00ABGEFWC|5.0|So much fun!  They even have me checking on their pets when they are in bed.  One of the best games I have downloaded.
0345803507|4.0|I almost didn't finish the first book in the series as I thought it was poorly written and definitely unbelievable. I decided to stick with it keeping in mind that it is FICTION. Once I did that, I was able to enjoy all 3 books. For me it was a fun escape and I wanted to find out what happened to Ana and Christian. So for anyone who decides not read any of the books based on the negative reviews - just remember this is FICTION and very light reading. We don't need analyze or judge the relationships. It could be that these books are on the best seller list because this is what people want to read  ---  something fun that let's them escape from the horrible news headlines!
B004T4KQJS|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone, especially if they are interested in the origins (and inner-workings) of the universe. I enjoyed it extensively, and I believe primarily, because Lawrence didn't presuppose any knowledge on the reader's part. Everything was explained, detailed but simply, and sometimes with very clever, and beautiful analogies. It felt as though I was reading a Sagan or Feynman piece, not in an unoriginal way, but in an eloquent way; five stars for sure.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|Good follow up to first movie. Hope they make another one. Great cast. Love to see the over the gang get together with some of the new guys.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My daughters and I are completely addicted.  They have gotten really good.  Definetely worth the download.  I never get to see my kindle anymore.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This books shows the war from a different angle, and was very thought provoking. I would definately want to reccomend it to anyone who loves history.

1416550550|5.0|Enjoyed reading this book and would highly recommend this to anyone.  It kept my interest the whole time.  Once you pick it up, you just can put it down.
B007L6VR12|5.0|This was a sleeper of a movie at the theaters but my family loved it.  It was quirky but the acting was terrific!
B0007OCG56|5.0|Previews and ads for Adam Sandler films always convince me to NOT see the film -- but I decided to give &#34;Spanglish&#34; a try when I saw it was directed by the same guy who directed &#34;As Good As It Gets&#34; -- James Brooks. I'm so glad I did. For me, the plot moves forward non-stop and is full of surprises. The casting of major and minor characters is excellent -- yes, including Adam Sandler.
B007SGM084|4.0|i can't believe how captivating as much of it as i've had time to read is. it embarrasses me honestly in wanting to be submissive and just find a strong confident man i can trust but not too much, if you know the feeling. otherwise, this might not be your cup of tea. that is why i gave it only 4 stars. i adore it, but i don't think it's everyone's cup of tea. i adore it so much, i sometimes spook myself out and forget i even own it.
0345803493|5.0|Enjoyed this book even more than the first one.  It was an easy read and was hard to put down once you start it.  I would highly recommend this book.
B00846REIS|5.0|Great read..  A page turner.  Liked the ending.  This book addressed some issues we face in our lives, and gives us insight.  I loved it.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|Well it's different.....I have only played it a few times, I like the fire touch screen for playing games, and the backlight for nite reading.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|i've followed danes resurrection since hours with such fascination and amazement at what a strong and intelligent women she turned out compared to lindsey lohan, say. she is the avatar i would say of jodie foster, who was not as subtle and gracious as dane, but it was a rougher environment which she changed and made dane possible. dane is a jewel. i don't even worry that success will distract her.
0345803507|3.0|Enjoyed this book but not as much as the first 2 books.  Again, it was an easy read and was hard to put down once you started it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|What a story line! Clever and psychotic. I could not put my kindle down! Marriage is a strange situation for most people but this one had all kinds of dedication.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Fun - fast game, you get more level games to choose from and I can share it with my facebook friends !! AND IT'S FREE !!!
B001TXQN44|5.0|this was the music that drove me as a young man. i adored neal young. i was never the dylan type. neal didn't choose to do that and i choose to do what neal did back then anyway. there is no rational way to explain why a teenager would do that, but i had no future in the world i grew up in. i was queer. i was on the fringe anyway, so why not just exaggerate and confuse them and stop listening to how they characterized as worthless, kick sand in your face, blah blah blah. i'm not saying any of that is true in the world, but i forgot how strong back then i really felt that however embarrassing i might have found it as an adult except i never really became one because i knew thanks to that song that i would always be a child despite the danger. go figure. so i was happy to have this music back. it's always like a grace note.
B00866JL96|5.0|This was a great movie and very close to the book by Nicolas Sparks.  Great date night movie!  Highly recommend this movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Holder and sky had me at \\"hello\\" or sort to speak. I mean they r just perfect for each other. Sky is the feisty confident girl we all want to be and holder that is a man right there. Reading this story made me dream and anticipate when my Prince charming will come along and seriously wonder where the hell he is? Colleen Hoover is a genius and knows how to write a first kiss, a first time and all the other firsts!!! This is a book for any romantic at heart

B00003CXA2|5.0|This movie is great and is almost considered a classic!  I would highly recommend owning this movie.  I never get tired of watching it over and over again.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This is a great little game where you run your own zoo. You bring back injured animals from different environments and take care of them in your zoo. The game where you catch the animal took me a while to figure out. But it eventually became very enjoyable.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|The second year of AHS is a completely new world, but everyone from the first season makes an appearance as completely different characters. Both narrative and horror have never gotten this kind of treatment on TV and this most certainly is a groundbreaking series that will no doubt spur a host of imitators.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This is an exceptional story of how someone can struggle with addiction and yet still make a difference in the world
1400052181|4.0|This book was a great read.  I was intrigued by this woman and her story.  I am also amazed by the writer.  Highly recommend this book.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a very fun game and I highly recommend it. It would be a good game for all ages. Once you have enough coins, you can get upgrades and get new characters. It also gives you lesson on how to play when you open this the first time.
B009VB7P6G|3.0|I'm a fan of faeries, after all they're bothersome and have excessive gas. But this is a watchable flick for all you adults out there forced to relinquish the remote to the short, loud beings that share your home. The tale itself is an interesting discussion about 'separate but equal' and how rules created to protect may also be harmful.
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|I wasn't sure about this movie when I heard a remake was on the cards. I loved the original, but I have to say, this film is really entertaining. The visuals are stunning, the action is great and the acting is top notch. This is probably Colin Farrell's best movie in a long time, but Kate Beckinsale's ass is the real star of the film. What's not to like.
0345803485|5.0|Enjoyed this book.  It was an easy read and was hard to put down once you start it.  I would highly recommend this book.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Thanos to be featured in Avengers 2! 'Nuff said there, but definitely loved 'The Avengers' movie, great special effects, banter, storyline, characters, just great stuff all around!
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I was looking forward to the prequel to Alien. But like Scott said in an interview, it isn't quite a prequel, but it isn't entirely unrelated either. This also has an interesting deleted scene at the end. If you're a sci fi buff or are interested in the Alien series, you don't want to miss this.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|A fun and fun and great really  great game.  I was challenged by this and i cant believe i could not figure out some of it without the hints. So if I say its fun&hellip;its FUN. Get it.Got it.Good
B005HSL626|5.0|my game is so cool and fun my 2 and 1/2 year old granddaughter sits beside me and can ware this game out, it's great
B008TMA1LY|3.0|Played this game for a whole two weeks , even got sucked into buying some coins. Then it was accidentally deleted and all my stuff was gone and unretrievable. But it was fun and addicting.
B009RI4FRU|3.0|Of the alternate worlds in Wes Anderson's brain that he so generously shares with us. Perhaps not as jarring or worldly as his previous works, this film will stand the test of time as a classic Anderson flick.
B0076DELIG|4.0|It's so great to read another Bosch book that even the long exposition toward the end and the sometimes paraphased scenes do not diminish the pleasure. Well-plotted story based on an old case of a murdered photographer during the L.A. riots 20 years before. Bosch is determined to find out who killed &#34;Snow White,&#34; and his boss is determined to stop him. Add to that his daughter who wants to follow in his footsteps and his girlfriend who wants more, and THE BLACK BOX is a satisfying read. Connelly is fair about planting clues to the true killer early on, but it was still a surprise. A must-read for Bosch fans.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|This season goes in a different direction in terms of storyline. Not the same concept but each week I still have to see what's going to happen give it a shot
B009POCG2C|5.0|If your a Clint Eastwood fan and even if you are not, this is a fun flick! Great story!<br />If you missed it at the theater, get it home for your collection.
B00APUQT7I|4.0|about the lifetimes in conjunction with the ice age, and how they get around so much and where's all the land? But it's a funny crew and script, so it's not a bad way to waste an hour or so. Also, Queen Latifah.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is a great game but this doesn't contain all the things you would find on the Pc version but that's my only complaint GREAT GAME U MUST GET IT
B007SGLZP8|5.0|It never gets old.  A twisty story, the underdog comes out on top, and I'm not even done reading the book.
B004SEUJK0|5.0|One of my favorite movies. Perfect choice for the hopeless romantic. It will also make you laugh, but it does involve a love story.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|are always interesting, and the changes to this compared to the original are compelling. But the flick itself feels almost like a B-movie. But that's OK. As long as they're making films from Philip K. Dick books I'm happy.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|This is a very absorbing film. Though based on fact, I do wonder the accuracy of the film's events. Yet, the basic story is excellently presented in a very moving and dynamic narrative that is incredibly captivating and humorous as well. The cast is superb.<br /><br />Affleck, Arkin, Cranston and Goodman give brilliant performances and make this a very credible and dramatic piece of storytelling. Arkin, for me, was a standout and Cranston gives a very credible performance. The story is told in almost semi-documentary form and the suspense aspects are played down. Yet, the film is captivating given the strength of the performances, editing and the deliberate pace of the narrative.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|My 6th grade daughter has read the entire series now.  She loves these books and the movies!  She is ready for them to write more!!!
B00AHSINKO|3.0|These are two of my all time favorite actors.  Their performances were great---solid, believeable;  but the story line in the first hour was more like a documentary than a movie.  It had its cute moments but I was a little let down on the overall movie.  Ending was good.
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|never disappoints. A true visionary, Burton re-makes this lovably macabre world in which love and loyalty shine through the veil between life and death.
B0072OFM28|5.0|Terrific series. The new guy is just as good as the actor that died. Maybe not as good as the first season but still excoriating and worth every minute. Buy it!

B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a fun game. I like the challenge of the different levels and being able to replay the ones you like to get more coins.
B009VB97EY|3.0|It was a good movie, fine. But I was promised genitals and I was gravely disappointed. There will be no showing of Tatum's taint here.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|...then you understand how difficult it is, how many you have to trudge through to find another one to fall into. Delirium is the book you've been waiting for. These characters are so beautiful, so real that you won't want to say goodbye. Lauren Oliver is a genius for creating a world you can escape to but can't escape from.
B003L77FYS|5.0|You can never go wrong with Castle!!  Had the 3rd and 4th season pre-ordered on Amazon and got both quickly and the price was great.
B0063IH60K|4.0|If you like traditional solitare, it is a fun way to pass the time. I would recommend it since it is eaasy to play.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|your sci-fi favorites. Sure, it's no Bladerunner, but it offers some new ideas about time travel that, if you are as much of a sci-fi nerd as me, will keep you fretting over the temporal integrity this story presents.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Love the show, great way to catch up to the series. I would reccommend to anyone who loves the show
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|My 6th grade daughter has read the entire series now.  She loves these books and the movies!  She is ready for them to write more!!!
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|this is a great game for children. it has many different colorful animals and is entertaining to play. you should try it.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|In this 3rd installment of this documentary series about aliens and the humans who corral them, we get a glimpse of how it all began.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Loved this movie for my son who is into football. great inspirational movie for all but especially those who love football
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|My 6th grade daughter has read the entire series now.  She loves these books and the movies!  She is ready for them to write more!!!
B00ANT6OK8|5.0|I confess, I went to see this film because of the hype, and because the trailer hinted at an expose of the back story that went into the killing of UBL. I am happy to report that this movie exceeded my hopes and expectations. If you want to get a close, documentary, indie-style look at what happened, this movie will probably meet or exceed your expectations as well.<br /><br />That said, the first half hour of the film is not for those who do not like to see their real-world violence up-close and personal. However, if you seem well-suited to the film and its genre in every other respect, then my advice is to see it, and use your eyelids early and often as you see fit... and know that there isn't anything gory or gruesome that jumps into your face without warning.<br /><br />The only (very minor) shortcoming is that I would have liked to know why the CIA recruited Maya (the lead around which Hollywood got the focal point needed to tell this story) OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL. The movie makes that point clear, but goes out of its way to avoid answering the question. In the film, she is bright and tenacious without being portrayed as a savant. Leaving why she was picked up just out of H.S. in question is irrelevant to the overall tale while including it would have added a small amount of depth to a character that is otherwise not overly developed.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't stop reading!  This book was amazing and I didn't know what to expect.  Can't wait to start book 3.
1400049628|5.0|Got this for my son who is into the Zombie thing. A way to maybe have him read more and enjoy it
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks books are amazing! So far every book I have read by him I was never disappointed! His stories are so real!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I busily don't play games often and if I do not for very long, but this game has got me hooked I love it!!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I'm 64 years old and loved this book.  This book is great reading for any young or was once young.
B006AN78XS|4.0|Never wanted to go to Paris until I saw this movie. Owen Wilson was wonderful. Classic Woody Allen.  Must see.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was very interesting and an amazing book I loved it I highly recommend it .it was one of the best books I have ever read
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Finally a female character I can stand behind.  She's athletic, smart, and is a woman of means.  She's less of a damsel in distress than other fenale characters in the same genre.  I don't feel like Gideon Cross isn't as likeable as Christian Grey, but my opinion may change after the next novel. I'm hoping he'll go through some personal growth that will make him more endearing.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|A inside look at relationships and how life's traumas effect them.  We all learn lessons on our own pilgrimages through life.
B00070DK1E|5.0|great cd  great for them men you who like this cd  great stooking stuffer to  thankyou for the cd it sounded great
B009YP9L7U|3.0|This was the first time I have ever read a  book like this,I enjoyed the characters but at time the author made it kind of difficult  to understand who was talking
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|As always, Tom Clancy delivers.  I just love his cast of characters & how he uses real life situations throughout .
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It's a cool book. I would love to read the third wheel again. and I give this book a 5star review
B0095WNNK8|5.0|I was intrigued with the group's name. Listened to a few samples; and the more I listened the more I liked them.
B008CJ0KBU|5.0|Having SYFY run both seasons from start to finish was a wonderful treat. Now that I have the DVD I can clear out space on the DVR for next season.
B0085A9J18|5.0|Buy this movie, Buy this movie, Buy this movie, and if you dont you are missing a kick A$$ action film.
B008220AVW|5.0|My daughter (and I) enjoyed this movie.  Any content that was questionable for her age (9) went over her head.  Cute movie.
0684824906|5.0|Read  originally when it published, gave copy to niece in Kansas, she is now majoring in history: connection?<br />Dr Goodwin is simply the best, factual, readable, and balanced.
B005KMX866|3.0|I've always found that the original songs are never surpassed by remakes, and that's certainly the case here. Even a musician as tasteful, sensitive and enamored of the famous Sun sound as Chris Isaak could only come up with his take on the many classics that emerged from that little studio. Chris' original songs are consistently good. That's what he should stick to.
1471305015|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey Large Print<br />E.L. James<br /><br />Great Christmas gift for the 20 something. She loves it is enjoying reading it.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Loved the twist and characters of this book. Always loved Stephen King. Cannot wait to read another book by him.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Long download to my kindle fire. Great graphics and smooth play. It appears to be true you can play for free if you want to wait for things to happen. Wait is the key word. This is a great game if you have no other games or life and can play 24/7.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I've loved watching the different depictions of this story since I was a kid, and I really enjoyed reading the full story for the first time. My older children have been enjoying it, as well. Readers will not be disappointed!
B009CV3DY8|5.0|The Time Keeper - Street Smart [ THE TIME KEEPER - STREET SMART BY...<br />Mitch Albom<br /><br />Great Christmas gift for family.
B004SEUJ82|5.0|This is such an EXCELLENT movie.  The storyline and acting are wonderful and the effect will stay with you for a lifetime.
B0089XH38M|1.0|Totally bogged down my Kindle so that I couldn't use.  Had to uninstall it.  Then my Kindle worked normal again.  It also ran a scan and found a threat.  When I tried to address the issue like it suggested, the program froze.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|I am a huge M&S fan, but at first listen I wasn't in love with the new album. But a couple listens in and now there is not a track I skip. Haven't taken it out of my rotation since. I find myself singing along with songs like Babel and I Will Wait, and wait for the picking in Hopeless Wanderer. The Deluxe edition includes a solid cover of the Boxer, as well as two other songs.
B004HZ76FQ|3.0|It served its purpose for a couple of days...maybe even weeks, but eventually it just was wasting space. It did not make it to my new phone.
B004SIP8W0|5.0|At first, we thought it was going to be really corny.  But it came together beautifully and it has become one of our favorites.  So well done!
B007BVOEPI|4.0|I really liked the show, but sometimes all the nudity was a but much. Also the streaming from Amazon was sometimes horribly slow. It would stop and back up every 2 or 3 minutes...VERY FRUSTRATING!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I bought the Kindle Fire for my 9-year old daughter and wanted a case that would be durable. This one is perfect!
B001FB4W02|5.0|I'm glad the show is coming to an end because I am definitely getting too old for these types of shows.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|The author's detailed writing style and loyalty to history draws the reader in from start to finish. I am already looking forward to the next book in the series.
1416594795|5.0|I found the book to be very informative and in a language I could comprehend it is a must read for anyone willing to accept<br />facts rather than fiction.<br />Glenn Houser
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I chose, as I choose many books, by author preference. Hadn't read Grisham in a while and was in a page turning mood. The premise was unusual and kept me pleasantly  involved in the story. Early on I became suspicious of the main character being somehow being involved in plotting the whole caper.(having read  similar plot lines in a couple of other Grishams). I dismissed the idea as I read, being totally caught up in the unbelievably complicated predicament of the main character.  Spoiler alert! ..Of course near the end, my early suspicion became obvious and the wonderfully clever development of this particular story was pleasantly accepted. Thank you Mr Grisham you won my heart and readership once again.
B002ZCY7TG|5.0|One of the best shows you will ever see on TV. I did not think broadcast channels still made good shows. I only imagine how much better this would have been on HBO.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I liked the story but felt a lot of parts dragged on for many pages. There were long explanations of things that could easily be summarized in a page or two.  Otherwise another good Brennan adventure.
1882723007|5.0|Straightforward and written in a way that is easy to understand and follow.  Takes an esoteric subject like near-death and distills it in everyday language that can benefit anyone reading it.
B004M5HUXE|5.0|This book was taboo as a youngster.  The whole point of the story was totally missed back then and turned into a moral witch hunt.  I'm happy I finally had the opportunity to read and enjoy it.
B009G78EE2|5.0|Nice mix of fun and deep tracks. Pretty sure if you like the Seattle rap scene (Blue Scholars, Common Market, etc.), you'll like Macklemore and Ryan Lewis.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I am only a third of the way through the book; as you know Victor Hugo is a hard read.  I read this book many years ago and remembered very little; I wanted to see the movie, so I want to read the book again. If you want to see the play or the new movie, you may want to read the book.  It gives you a greater understanding of the movie/play.
0812550706|5.0|I read this book multiple times as a kid. Not to big on the rest of the series but love this book and Ender's shadow. Highly recommend.
1451695195|5.0|This was a great book and inspirational.  I have suggested it to several of my family members and friends. I noted some of the critiques were from the religious sector.  Each reader will have to take from it what is comfortable for them to accept.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Book was downloaded to both my laptop and my cellphone. Excellent read. Loved the story. It kept me interested and was hard for me to put down. Very much admired the author.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|I saw the movie first so the book had more daring subjects in it esp for a freshmen in high school like Charlie is.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I use it for myself and my grandchildren. It drowns out everything with some very soothing sounds. The timer is a nice feature.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|So far so good. I can play it and don't have to pay extra.  The graphics are high quality and it runs well on my kindle fire.
0316228532|4.0|This was a gift for my daughter. The best price I could find it for at this time. Arrived quickly and in good condition.
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|A useless product.  It has absolutely no effect on improving recording quality or picking up minor nuances in decibels.  The built in mic in your own camera is far superior.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The story line and quality of the acting is top notch.  My wife and I have enjoyed the series thourghly.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I love reading John Grisham's books.  The suspense leads you to thinking one way when it is always something else.  The detail is amazing.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|Everything was fine until I tried to put a picture in a powerpoint. I was so upset, and it was also a lot of money. The app wasn't so bad, but if you want pictures in powerpoints... DON'T GET IT!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Nice job.  I bought another book by Flynn as soon as I finished this one.  My son put me on to it and<br />I couldn't put the book away.  Read it in three days which is fast for me.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|With all the resources and options this free APP offers, every Christian with a smartphone must see this as a MUST download!
B002QE3CTY|5.0|The Maze Runner is my favorite book of all time ever since I started the first chapter. James Dashner has a fascinating way of using imagery in his books. I can't wait until I can get to the next book to the series. If you like action, comedy, and a bit of romance, then this will be the book for you. Peace!!! (P.S. Watch out for the Grievers! They're  EVERYWHERE!!!)
B009S8PEHY|4.0|I was glad I downloaded this album.  It's really good and Rod Stewart does a nice job with the classics.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|This is a very good CD, have played it about a hundred times, I was a beach boys fan from the old days and I really enjoyed this cd. I would love to get a sound track from their 50th anniversary concert.<br />I have the DVD but a CD would complete the set.<br />Thanks.
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|We really enjoyed &#34;Expendables 2&#34;.  As we watched the first &#34;Expendables&#34; prior to the second, I believe the second story had more substance.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire calms me when needed.  I chose this one for its complex opportunities in solving for full counts.  I recommend solitaire to all friends and family who have computers or laptops.
0143118706|5.0|I am very impressed by the speedy arrival of this book. It's so exciting to have a great new book to read, &#34;Comitted: ALove Story&#34;
B009KKLQKO|5.0|I went to the concert in Saratoga NY over the summer and it was one of the best concerts ever and the DVD was exceptonal !  I would like to get my hands on a cd of the same concert so please advise if and when that comes avaiiable.
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|&#34;Looper&#34; was just okay for me.  By the end of the movie, my family was just ready for it to end.  It was fast paced but the story lacked depth.  The acting was good.
B004HO6HWA|5.0|Being a re-make of the 1972 Bronson/Jan Michael Vincent classic; it follows the plot and the ending is almost the same.  Donald Sutherland brings in a brief performance as Stathem's boss. Lots of action and fight scenes to make this worth the price.  Yes, I'd watch it again just to see the stunts.  For Statham fans it's a keeper. As a hitman for hire, Statham turns good when he sees his employer used him.  In any re-make, what can be shown to a modern audience has changed radically since 1972.  The violence isn't too over the top. However it's very much like all of Stanthem's films.
B004L35GAQ|5.0|This is the best band. i bought the CD for the song Sail and ended up loving the whole CD good music for the car
B008HTQ28K|4.0|The plot is just incredible!! A very good read as with most Grisham books. With the utmost respect i would like to say that i do feel at times that the author rushed trough some &#34;scenes&#34; and this detracts from an otherwise incredible read.<br /><br />If you like crime novels - read this one!!
B0026P3G12|5.0|This is a wonderful disc.  I had wanted something by her and this is a good addition to my collection.
6301971272|5.0|Always a good view, and glad to have it in my collection. Quality is fine .Look for a deal and get it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|loved it, cant wait to see more. very interesting to see how people lived in that time period. loved the house.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I purchased this book after a friend of mine recommended it to me. He sparked my curiosity by saying it was a self published book that was number 1 on Amazon's best rated books.  I thoroughly enjoy sci-fi books and this one did not disappoint. From the first paragraph to the last I was entertained and entrapped in discovering more about  the plight of the characters. It's a creatively written and  imaginative piece that's sure to spark the imagination. Purchase and enjoy.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I like  this book, but not as much as others I've read. It's just too sad for me. Also, it gets boring after you've read it three times.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|I was skeptical at first, but am now in love with this!!!  Not only can I link this with my Kindle, but also my smartphone and my boyfriends.  We can keep up with our busy schedules on all of our devices.  Absolutely wonderful!!!!
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I love Supernatural! I've watched this show since it's pilot episode and have never missed an episode on TV.  I love the show so much that when the dvd set comes out, I buy it so I can watch it whenever I want and see the extras. I find the mix of humor, drama, and horror to be  entertaining and though the series doesn't take itself terribly serious (a lot is tongue in cheek), the series manages to keep the story line entertaining and fresh.  The main actors, Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki, are not just pretty faces; they're great in the roles of Sam and Dean Winchester.  They breathe life into characters who could easily become charicatures of themselves.  Plus, Jim Beaver as Bobby Singer and Misha Collins as Castiel are always a treat!  I'm not going to spoil it for anyone and some people have said that Supernatural is stale but I'm not one of them. I hope they continue making the quality show for as long as possible!  If you're a fan of the show and you want to see some extras not seen on TV, then owning the series on dvd is a must! I own them all and I've never regretted purchasing them.
006016848X|3.0|I think that anyone who reads this book can get something out of it, but it does categorize men and women in different stereotypical categories.  For example, the book drones on and on about how women express their feeling by vocalizing them and men withdraw.  This is very good for a marriage that is typical but there are many more complexities to marriage and family than this book presents.<br /><br />When I first read this book i thought \\"wow, it is pretty good\\" but then I decided to take a masters program in Marriage and Family Therapy and realized that this book may not be helpful in a lot of situations.  Not all women think the same and not all men thing the same.  Personally, I'm a man and i liked to vocalize my problems, not withdraw into some \\"cave.\\"<br /><br />The second issue I have with this book is it is so repetitive.  This book could have been at least a third as long if he took away some of the repetitiveness and added more content.  If you feel you are in a so called stereotypical relationship this book may be helpful, but if you have children of your own which adds to the complexity of the relationship, this book may not be much help.
B009K0P10K|5.0|One of the best shows on tv right now. Love the acting and storylines. Good suspense and acting from all
0316227706|5.0|I bought this book as a gift, and everyone at the party checked it out, and loved it! Very entertaining.
1400062756|5.0|If you are even considering getting this book do yourself a favor and go ahead and get it.<br /><br />I haven't been able to put it down since I recently gotten it and I have seen that currently I do fit the mold for a fixed mind set which explains a lot.<br /><br />One of the best buys I have EVER made - GET IT.<br /><br />I am probably going to send out a few copies to friends and family as well.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved all the love and compassion that came from so much hurt. It really made you believe that love really does concur all!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Makes you think and keeps your interest.  Drives you crazy when you can't figure out solution.  Good way to pass time.
B00AEJM6H2|1.0|Hi I bought this item but it never came to my iPhone. A waste right ??? Buy and never Rex's ....
B0054R6BFM|1.0|WARNING: this review contains spoilers!<br /><br />When I read the description of this book, I got excited. The premise is intriguing, a girl kills herself but leaves cassette tapes for all the people who pushed her over the edge to listen to? awesome! This HAD to be good!<br /><br />Well, it wasn't. Not only did nothing exciting ever happen (big climax was probably a quick uneventful rape that Hannah witnessed from a closet at the very end of the book) and sorry but Hannah did not seem depressed to me. I have depression and I know what it's like to be there, and she just wasn't. Her reasons for being sad were dumb things that happen to everyone in their life. Some jerk hitting on her, smacking her butt or being labeled nicest ass in the freshman class would never constitute someone wanting to die. I kept waiting for people to really treat her bad, or to find out she had a horrible home life (which i don't really get why the author didnt give her one, it really would have helped me believe she had a reason), or to find out maybe she had been the one to be raped. Nah, she just wished she had stopped it.<br /><br />At one point the narrator is listening to the tapes and his friend leaves the cafe they are in, pulls his car up close to the door just outside of view, and turns his headlights off. He waits until the cafe closes and Clay has to leave. At this point I am thinking, o s***, something is about to go down!! Clay's friend tells him to hop in and begins driving. At this point Clay wants to know where they are going. No response. His friend just continues on eerily. Things get creepy and I could have SWORN his friend was going to try something. A murder? I hoped so!! It sure would liven up this boring book. But just when i thought the book was about to climax, Clay's friend informs him he JUST WANTED TO BE THERE FOR HIM WHILE HE LISTENED TO HIS TAPE! He wanted to be a GOOD FRIEND. Really? No, REALLY? He just wanted to be able to comfort him?? GIVE ME A BREAK!!! At that point, I knew this was one of the lamest books I had ever read.<br /><br />At the end of the book, Clay spots a girl with no friends and calls her name and runs to her, saving her from assured depression and suicide, right? Give me a God damn break. Is this an episode of Full House?<br /><br />If you know nothing about high school or depression, you might like this book by believing it truthful. However, this book was so unbelievable I had to FORCE myself to finish it. I would never recommend this book, I didn't even like the writing let alone the story. Good idea, bad everything else. I didn't even care about the characters, they weren't interesting and I didn't feel any sympathy for them. This was an insult to YA readers, almost making them look like a bunch of idiots.s was one of the lamest books I had ever read.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Game is fun and frustrating!  You really have to figure out all the little tricks the birds can do, then you will have a bit of an advantage over the pigs.  My hubby is addicted!  Great game!
B00846F1YW|5.0|I really enjoy Nevosoft games so I downloaded Mysteryville 2 in late December. Like everyone else, I got thrown out of the game after completing level 13-1. I sent an email to the developer and received a response that they would fix it after the holidays. I don't know when it was updated but I started playing it again today and it picked up right where I left off. I got through 13-1 and continued the game. I like Mysteryville and I appreciate the update.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is the best in the series. It's so exciting you won't be able to pit it down. Highly recommended.
0307346617|5.0|Awesome book not your typical zombie stuff you get a first person description of the events that unfolded. I loved the fact that the political side of the zombie outbreak got told, we usually never get that story in other zombie stories. Can't wait till the movie gets out, even though i think the story would have been better off as a TV series, so each personal account at least got an hour to be explained and showed to us.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is awesome!  Every time I pick up my Kindle, I have to try to beat my score!  This game is totally addictive!  LOVE IT!!!

B004UJTG6Q|5.0|What a great story , one that can be enjoyed time and time again. Samuel Clemens is an American treasure.
B0063IH60K|5.0|LOVE this game!!  Just a really fun game that makes you think, but does not strain your brain! It is great!
B008OOYALE|4.0|When I first downloaded this app, I honestly didn't know what to except. The only reason I did get it was because of the cute red dragon. ^_^;<br />After I played it for a little bit, it reminded me of a dragon version of 'Viva Pi&ntilde;ata' for the X-box 360. breeding the dragons together and getting new ones is my favorite part.
006197806X|4.0|But it's a dream. Alex is gone. This is the sequel to Delirium, a book which I really loved. The final book, Requiem, is coming out this winter. Pandemonium is divided into two \\"sections\\", \\"Now\\" and \\"Then\\". \\"Now\\" is set in New York City, \\"Then\\" is in the Wilds, with the uncured people. Just to backtrack, Lena lived in a society who believes that love is a disease. You get an operation when you turn eighteen, but Lena fell in love with this boy named Alex. They tried to escape, but only she got away.<br /><br />The way the book is organized is a bit confusing; I wasn't quite sure what was going on, though it gets clearer as you read. On page 52, it all became clear: Lena is spying for the resistance in New York City, which was what I thought in the first place.<br /><br />Lena as a character gets developed a lot more, though Pandemonium is way grimmer than the first book. For example \\"'You might as well get used to it now,' she says with quiet intensity. 'Everything you were, the life you had, the people you knew...dust.' She shakes her head and says, a little more firmly, 'There is no before. There is only now, and what comes next.'\\" Or, \\"I'm pushing aside the memory of my nightmare, pushing aside thoughts of Alex, pushing aside thoughts of Hana and my old school. Push, push, push, like Raven taught me to do. The old life is dead. But the old Lena is dead too. I buried her. I left her beyond a fence, behind a wall of smoke and flame.\\" (From the back cover and the front flap, respectively). Phew. That is really intense, though I don't know if I would call it deep, stuff. I know it may appeal to some teenage girls, but it kind of annoyed me. I know Lena's gone through a lot, but that doesn't mean she has to get all sappy and over-dramatized.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Pandemonium is a gripping second book in this trilogy that kept me on my toes and wanting to read more. Some interesting new characters are introduced, and I look forward to reading Requiem, especially since Pandemonium ends on a cliff-hanger, with the inevitable love triangle introduced.<br /><br />All of my reviews can be read at my blog, novareviews.blogspot.com.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Nelson DeMille has done it again! The Panther kept me on the edge of my seat. The story line was great, the characters loveable and very realistic, and while it is a work of fiction, Mr. DeMille does an excellent job of weaving in facts that enlighten the reader. I am a true fan of all his writings. I look forward to his next work!
B00A9V2JSG|3.0|The book was really good, but the descriptions in the book made me want to rip my hair out. By the end I was skipping whole paragraphs just to get through the book. The  language in the book was beautiful . I wish the ending let you at least hope that the main character was still alive, but I don't even want to read the next book now.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|This game as it all: Monsters you care for, battling opponents, using strategies when choiceing your monsters to battle for you, training other monsters that come to your farm for help and expanding your own island.<br />Over all a game I would recommend to someone looking for a cute and hearty time. ^_^

B009ZZDNT6|2.0|I do not like this app. even when I turn the sound on and keep the app running, the alarm doesn't make any noise of vibrate. there's no point to buying this app, for an alarm clock, if the alarm doesn't even work.

B007SGM084|5.0|While this book has received a bad reputation for its explicit scenes, the actual story line and twists in the plot kept me reading all the way to the end. I will admit, the scenes between Christian and Anastasia were quite explicit, I enjoyed watching the relationship develop and blossom with each turn of the page. Definitely a good read (if you can handle the explicitness).
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Read book 1 after viewing the movie and found that the movie was a good portrail of the book. Can't wait for the release of the films for books two and three. Suzanne Collins ahs found a new fan in a 69 year old retired engineer.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|game is fun to play to pass time.  Love the sound tracktrack.  this game can be addicting, so do not start playing if you do not have lots of time.

B009AZZEU2|2.0|I, like many of you, am a true fan of Soundgarden and Chris Cornell.  I grew up with Louder Than Love, BMF, Superunknown, & DOTUS, and then followed Chris through his solo projects and Audioslave days.  I always found good material in each of these projects and still enjoy them for different reasons.  However, I cannot agree that this is a good record, whether it is judged alongside previous SG material or not.  The guitar riffs are flat and dull, the vocals whine without a sense of direction, and the music just does not take me anywhere.  I find myself praying for each song to end, hoping that the next will get this bad taste out of my mouth.<br /><br />No one expects this to be the same material that was released 20 years ago, and I personally would not have bought the CD if it were.  Reviews that say this should be ignored because artists are expected to grow and mature with each subsequent release.  However, Cornell is past his prime.  Years of screaming at the top of his lungs have taken their toll and left him with a weak, trembling, powerless voice that is not entertaining or uplifting.  In the past he was still able to effectively use his limited vocal range in CDs such as Euphoria Morning and Out of Exile, but not here.  (BTW - Audioslave's first CD did rock!)<br /><br />For those who say, \\"You're not listening hard enough\\" or \\"Give it 15 times to get to like it\\" I say \\"That's rediculous!\\"  As an avid fan who owns all of the material listed above and can recite most songs by heart, I do listen closely.  I have never had to listen to a CD 15 times to convince myself that it is even semi-decent and I won't do so now.  Good music is good on its own merit.  I agree with many other posts that perhaps people are \\"wanting\\" this to be better than it is, just a little too much.  Perhaps it's SG nostalgia (which I understand).  Perhaps it's the lack of good rock music these days (which I definitely understand).  I won't write off SG though, I'll just wait for their next release and hope that it heads in another direction.
B006GHA9QQ|4.0|Having read several of the most recent reviews, I find myself agreeing with many of them.  Personally, I thought the production and costumes were fantastic and the music and singing both melodic and memorable.  My only issue is with the ending.  It needs to be \\"tidied up\\" a bit.  After the shocking climax, it takes just a little too long to actually end.  At the risk of giving anything away, I will just leave it at that.  If you are at all thinking about getting this DVD, you will not be disappointed if you do.
067144901X|5.0|Love all Sandra Boynton's books.  Love this one, too.  Fun to read and even more fun to sing.  Don't mind reading it over and over.
0765325950|5.0|I think this may be my first review I've ever written for a book.  Being 34 and having read these books since I was 14, I think that they have been a huge nail biting part of my life.<br /><br />This book, the way Sanderson captures the characters at certain points (I laughed out loud at an exchange between Mat and Rand, and got kind of choked up later on in the book at another exchange), is amazing.  This is SOOO unlike some of those boring middle books that we kicked ourselves that we waited 2 -4 years to read.  This books starts and doesn't stop until the end.  I find myself wanting a short story about what happens after the last pages - a LONG epilogue if you will.<br /><br />All in all - I love Sanderson (and his books), LOVE RJ and have since i picked up The Eye of the World and could not have asked for a better ending to these books.  Great read - very hard to put down!

After watching roughly 9 hours straight of American Horror Story Season 2, I instantly fell asleep thinking about it, dreaming about it, and waking up..still thinking about it. Was that perhaps Sister Jude's plan?<br /><br />Haha. Watch it 0_o

B004T2QZL8|1.0|I downloaded this and was unhappy with it. So i removed the app. Not saying this is not a good app for others, it just wasn't for me
B0067TQQI8|5.0|As other reviewers have said, this is a good overall backup battery. I'll just mention a few quirks that I told my girlfriend when I gave this to her:<br /><br />* When you plug in the battery to charge it, the outputs turn off. The previous version used to keep the outputs on as you'd expect, but most chargers can't supply enough current to charge both the battery pack and a phone at the same time, so I'm not surprised that they changed it for this version. Definitely should have been documented, though.<br /><br />* I'm not sure if there's any difference in the data pin wiring between the two USB ports, so if something doesn't work on one of the ports, try the other. The supplied adapter cables should work equally well on either port, though, since they only deal with the power pins.<br /><br />* Push the button to turn it on; it'll turn off automatically when the output stops drawing power.<br /><br />* The battery indicators are different for charging vs discharging. It can show full capacity when discharging but half capacity when charging. This may be a feature.<br /><br />* Push and hold the button to turn on or off the light. I did find it turned itself on in my backpack once, though -- I think the old double-press design was better.<br /><br />Also, if you're uncertain what size to get, I'd say go for this one only if you have a tablet or multiple devices, or you're regularly away from AC for more than a day or two. It's nice to have this much power, but for just a phone you'll find a smaller capacity more portable and practical.

B0092MKFIY|5.0|I saw these guys on Conan a few nights ago and bought the album immediately.  These guys have a great feel, one part 90's synth, one part Lumineers, and all parts awesome.  The songs all sound different, but they have enough in common that you know you are listening to the same group.  I listen to 95% electronic music these days, and these guys just have that &#34;it&#34; that will get you.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This transaction was great. I ordered it and was able to download it immediately, Thank You! This is a great game to pass time away, like at the doctors office!
030758836X|4.0|I will be very surprised if this is not made into a movie.  It has all the plots and subplots and keep-you-guessing that makes a good movie.  The author has written it in a way that even keeps a mystery expert wondering.  The way the days and the speaker are intertwined makes for great reading and keeps the pages turning.  The only reason I gave it a 4 is the ending.  It disappointed me, and yet, if I stopped to think about it, it is just the way a Hitchcock might end.  It certainly was a fantastic read, and I can see why it ended up on so many Top Ten lists for 2012.

B0081HLM2E|3.0|Overall this is an enjoyable little film. It suffers from not making it clear that the central character of the burglar is quick thinking and imaginative. The chase scenes are fairly exciting but at some point it becomes unbelievable. It is heartless assassin stuff.<br /><br />Where the King of this genre is [[ASIN:B008RKLRZM The Day of the Jackal]] as well as the connection with real life events in France at that time, that film is also beautifully paced. Plenty of room for the viewer to get to know the assassin. Can we really condemn this professional man for his killings? He only kills when he is threatened, after all. The rich woman in bed is a masterpiece of dueling sympathies. A film I watch many times.<br /><br />The Headhunters is nowhere near this level. The film propels itself from one chase scene to another. They are often ingenious action sequences but ultimately the film is perilously close to comic book with some unbelievable twists. A one shot film.
B000AYEL6U|4.0|The 4-part film adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's novel, North & South, is like Pride & Prejudice meets Hard Times and done almost effortlessly. In the same tradition of Jane Austen and the Bronte Sisters come John Thornton and Margaret Hale. Two different people from two different worlds who collide in industrial 1850s Milton, Manchester, England in the gritty, fast paced north versus Margaret's slower, insulated and utopian way of life in the south. Where first impressions are lasting but not forever.<br /><br />John (brilliantly, wonderfully, acted by Richard Armitage) has come up from the dregs to build his cotton business in Milton but at the cost of being purely business minded and nothing else. He knows nothing else and because of it, is hard and harsh but bluntly honest and is as he appears. There is no artifice, no ego, only a will and his way--and to Margaret, at times unforgivable, especially his brutal treatment of his mill workers, who some she befriends. Margaret, though not rich by any means, is perceived as spoiled and haughty but in reality, she is just a young woman trying to accept her new lot in smog-tinged Milton and trying not to lose herself in the process. As a strike threatens the livelihood of John's business and family, so too does grim strife and struggles hit Margaret. Through interactions that color their understanding of each other, they battle in words and actions, and as a result, begin to truly learn more about each other and who each really is. And that they may have more in common than not.<br /><br />What I loved about this eloquent BBC mini-series is the intoxicating, electric and smoldering tension between the leads, Richard Armitage and Daniela Denby-Ashe, as well as the supporting cast who lend exegetic information about our leads as well as give depth and richness to the overall story. Armitage is simply sublime in his nuanced rendering of a commanding, driven, secretly terrified but passionate John Thornton. His intense and brooding acting makes John Thornton a class in his own, as most want to compare him or declare him the 'New Mr. Darcy', when he is in fact a fantastic John Thornton. In Denby-Ashe, we have a Margaret who is both spirited, independent, vocal yet naive and just as terrified, but an equal match to John. While Denby-Ashe did a marvelous job, hands down, Armitage is clearly the one everyone will talk about.<br /><br />Now, I have not read the novel (YET) and I prefer to read the book before seeing the adaptation, especially in classic novels though most productions tend to stay more true to the storyline than not. Because of that, reading the novel FIRST tends to enhance the experience of watching the movie because you know the little things that were left out and fill them in yourself as you watch. Also, seeing how actors play these characters, how production meets up to standards and how the director holds up his/her end of the bargain and doing the book justice is fun. The only issue I have with this adaptation is that the subcontext that exists in the book that wasn't present in the film. It seemed, at times, that the director and screen writer were relying more on us the audience to be familiar with the style (i.e. ala Austen) and romantic plot rather than fully showing us the development of their romance. The romance is predictable--that's the whole point. We know how it'll end, that's not the point, the point is how they get there and all the subtle ways they reveal their emotions toward each other. That said, the directing and editing was somewhat abrupt, especially in last two episodes, showing not enough but 'almost there' of their romance. I felt like I'd missed some key moments between John and Margaret that I should have seen, that is, their growing affections toward each other and WHY they begin to relate to each other and what bonds knit them closer to each other. We don't really see that. In some respects,  John's affections were much more clearly conveyed, developed and explained, and shown, than Margaret's, which sort of 'happens' for her in the last forty or so minutes of the fourth episode. The secondary plot about Margaret's brother wasn't neatly woven into the rest of the story and was sort of obvious, and as a result, rendered a bit useless and ineffective.<br /><br />Am I being too picky? Maybe but I still LOVED this movie and it has become one of new favorites and must see/must haves. In terms of the social and industrial changes represented in the novel/film, it was fascinating and was a character in and of itself as well as part of John's personae too. However, I know very little of those times, especially the social aspect, but felt there was enough about it without overpowering the rest of the story. Don't judge this to Pride & Prejudice. North & South deserves its own cult following purely for the fact of a great movie and wonderful actors who brought rich, multi-layered characters to life. It was worth every penny, and the extras, including commentaries and interviews, were a delight. I will now be reading the book, then watching the movie again and seeing it in a whole other light...sigh.ed, developed and explained, and shown, than Margaret's, which sort of 'happens' for her in the last forty or so minutes of the fourth episode.

B008CP6RWU|5.0|This game was unknown until some website mentioned that it was the game of the year (either for the website, or for the gaming community) and had won multiple awards.  Having read some of the descriptions of the game, it sounded interesting enough, and the price was relatively cheap.  Plus, it came with two \\"side\\" games also developed by That Game Company.<br /><br />One side game, Flower, is deceptively simple.  Just fly around using the six-axis controller and collect the petals of other flowers as you come into contact with them.  That's it.  That's the game.  For something so simple, it is oddly fun.  Who'd have thought that flying a petal to collect and \\"lead\\" other petals would be so fun?<br /><br />The other side game, flOw, is similar in control scheme, that is, using the six-axis controller.  This time, the gaming system is more complex.  Imagine a 2D world, that has three dimensions.  By this it is meant that the player moves along a 2D plane and eats orbs or eats the orbs of other floating critters.  However, it is possible to move to another 2D plane three dimensionaly by moving either towards or away from the camera, either coming towards the surface, or going deeper down into the underwater world.  The mechanics take a little to get used to, but the reward is great.  This is also a multi-player game so friends can join in.<br /><br />  Then the belly of the beast.  The actual game Journey itself is a masterpiece.  It is a shock that all three of these games are made in conjunction with Santa Monica Studio, the very same that made the God of War series, yet there is no killing.  There is only one \\"bad guy\\" (multiple of them at times, but still the same basic character).  The game style is basic.  Look, move, fly, and \\"call\\".  That's it.  Two joysticks (or one joystick and the six-axis) and two buttons.  So that is easy to master.  Even a 68 year old father who doesn't play video games mastered it quickly.<br />  The graphics are great, perfect for the artistic style of the game, which is very unique.  All the concepts are so unique, from the character design, to the populating critters that fly around, to the point of the game (enlightenment and rebirth).  Even the lighting on the sand is so on point, it makes backs tingle with electricity.  It is a tranquil game that shouldn't be as fun as it is because there is no blood, no guns, no explosions, no naked babes; all of which can be found to be very much a relief from the onslaught of destruction pervasive in gaming today.<br />  Overall this is a stupendous game that will be played over and over.  Try it and see.

Grissom shows the complexities and the drama that goes on at a plantation, and how even more complex it gets when a white indentured servant grows up and marries the master's son.<br /><br />Seriously, I could not put this book down.

0545265355|5.0|Shipped out fast. Recieced it when they said it would. Had no problems. Was as described. Looked like pictured. love it.
B000BYRCGU|4.0|I like this movie a lot. glad I bought it.  was a good deal. good story line. wish i lived there..
B004UID2LC|1.0|MALWARE! as soon as I tried to install i had a TON of malware popups! its sad, it looked like a good app
B00632HWOG|1.0|I have AT&T and my email is powered by Yahoo and I hate.  I don't know if it is yahoo or something else, but I constantly have problems and I don't like that it will not send you confirmation when someone opens an email.  Before Yahoo started servicing my email, I could get that feature.
B001KZG99A|4.0|it's a good movie.  Gives you a nice glance at why Ironman is who he is. Robert Downey Jr. has another hit under his movie belt.
B001JRB16U|5.0|Mary Poppins is a classic Disney movie.  This particular edition has some nice bonus features (nothing extraordinary), but for those who are interested in a regular DVD edition of a classic movie, you can't go wrong.
B00APUQT7I|4.0|The best Ice Age movie yet!  Love the additional characters ~ the pirates were well developed, funny and added immensely to the storyline.  I recommend this for the whole family.
B001JIES4Q|5.0|best show about love We have ever seen.  My wife watches it regularly.  Funny and lovable characters and great acting.
B007FJFDXS|3.0|It was fun for a few rounds but after that, I lost interest.  Also the touch screen was harder to control on a Android Phone (Razr Max).
B003LL3LHO|5.0|This book was wonderful. It was exactly what I wanted out of a guild wars book :D. I would highly recommend to a fan of the game.
0486414124|5.0|Jane Austen is at her finest in this historic look at middle-class England.  Engaging dialogue, realistic character development and interesting family dynamics are at plan throughout Bath and onto the Abbey.  If you are a Jane Austen fan, you will not be disappointed.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|They tried to compact too much in one movie. the character build up is good but then there is maybe 2 really good action scenes . I enjoyed it for sure, but it wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be.
B002KKBV8I|5.0|I am really pleased with this toy. My 9 yo son has played with it several times since receiving it for Christmas and will play with it for hours, no exaggeration. He likes to make different shapes with it and unfold them then ask me what shape it becomes when put back to 3D. And yes he is a normal child who enjoys video games more than I care to have him play. I was also very happy that they arrived much earlier than promised. I was told it would be early January (they were shipped from the UK) but we got them before Christmas! I believe I will be ordering more so he can build on this set. His birthday is right around the corner.....
B005QUQP76|5.0|i would recomend this mouse to anyone in the pc fps world. it improved my gaming and i love the programmable  macro buttons
B009SQRL4U|4.0|Wonderful dichotomy of how the Christmas story and modern day technology combine to create a fascinating tale of Christmas around the World.  The Everyman, Arthur, wants to ensure the spirit of Santa lives in every child.  Great message for kids, amazing special effects, sometimes a little too much, and engaging dialogue.  Recommend it for the whole family.
0694524441|5.0|I loved this story! It reminds me that life truly is about the journey and that the value of each experience can be whatever we decide it to be.
0063120046|5.0|I enjoyed the series when it first aired on TV.  I always wanted to read the book to see how it compares to the series.  I'm not finished with the book yet but I'm not disappointed so far.
B00009R6H2|5.0|The picture is just showing you the top and bottom of the plate.  It is not trying to indicate that there is two top plates in a package.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|This is an interesting story with logical characters who fall in love after getting married. The characters were fun to read about.
B008K3HRF0|5.0|Great for Dr Seuss fans! my Daughter loves the music also. Teaches the importance of &#34;being green&#34; Which is important for little ones to know.
B005H29GSI|1.0|My boys received this for Christmas and I sure am I glad I didn't waste my money on this.  As a game it is simply awful.<br /><br />1. The pieces are slippery and the castles on most of the cards require a very steady hand to build.  We tried building on carpet and they fell down, we tried the dining table but that was too slippery and they fell down.  We actually have the best luck with them on our stone hearth however, it still takes my 6 and 8 year olds 5-10 minutes to build level 3 castles because they are so slippery the lightest touch will make it fall over.  Also, the snapable girders do not stay together and when building an archway with a pig on top they break when we put the pig on it. I would compare it to building a house of cards.<br /><br />2. The slingshot is a piece of junk!  The instructions say to shoot from at least 1 foot from the castles.  We are lucky if the slingshot laucnches the birds 3 inches.  The red bird usually ends up right in front of the slingshot.<br /><br />If you want an Angry Birds playset for your kids this is it, but if you actually want to play a game plan on spending your afternoon in frustration.  We also received the Angry Birds indoor/outdoor 3D Action Game and that has been much more fun and easy to play.
1439190275|5.0|Fast ship, good quality and great price for this book, it helped me follow the program and guide perfectly. thanks.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I thougjtbthe book would be more mission oriented but was a bit rushed imo. Why there was so much fuss about JSOC tactics and secrets I have no idea. I read Chris Kyles book and it was way more informative then this one on seal tactics. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has an interest in what our elite warriors do for a living.
B007SGM084|4.0|I did get a little tired of SO much sex in the books but it did get better toward the end.  A lot of that was important &#34;growth-sex&#34; for the plot, so... I love her style of writing and humor... it's awesome!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this app, and love having Pinterest on the go! the only thing is that I wish I had a pin it button on my browser
B00846REIS|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book a lot, it has a compelling story line. Although is missing some suspense in the story, it's a very good read after 50 shades of grey.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I had no idea about the last twist in the book... It tied everything together. Brilliant writing!!! A must read!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Great price on an absolutely great movie!  If you're a fan of Batman movies, this one is a must for you!
0937381888|5.0|awesome book a lot of information<br />I have brewed six batches now and still look back some times to review
1611134226|5.0|If you are a Pendergast fan, you have, by now, finished listening to Two Graves.  I will eventually listen to 2G several times.  I have all the other books in the series.  Great price.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is everything all the reviews say it is. I started this on my lunch break yesterday at work and was barely able to put it down for my remaining four hours of my shift.(thanks to the kindle app on my phone, I didn't have to go the entire four hours without reading this AMAZING book but.....shhhhhhh!) It was breathtaking from humorous start to tear jerking end. Definitely a must-read.
0811826848|5.0|Beautifully presented--you can get lost in all the stories and anecdotes-- a gorgeous tabletop book!-Looks way more expensive than what it was!
B000FCK65W|5.0|This was my favorite book as a young girl and it certainly brought back memories and I thoroughly enjoyed it again!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|The gane is great, but it is set up to require a purchase at almost turn of the game.  The Game is fun.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|this was an awesome finish to a great story of unconditional love. the sex was descriptive but not too much. this is a great love story and shows that when love  is true a relationship can go anywhere
B007C4ZJ0S|1.0|Well that was two hours I'll never get back. Plot never came together and Michael Douglas & Bill Paxton seem to just be thrown into plot for star power. Action scenes were lame. Yeah she can kick box but her acting was forced. Funny there's a photo of her on cover shooting tow guns at once. I think I saw her shoot one gun maybe one time during movie. Don't waste your time and I can't believe anyone said this was a good movie. It belongs in the garbage.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I almost did not read this trilogy because of things I had heard about the subject matter ( using teens to play in games in order to feed people for the year). There is more to it than that though and I was very quickly engrossed in how things would turn out. I was glad I bought the trilogy so I could go right to the next book after finishing each segment.
B0091REZMW|1.0|This app has print that is too small to read. I didnLt like the game so it's already deleted from my kindle.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|this was awesome read. it kept my I.interest and intrigued me. not sure I can use this information but it sure did peak my interest.I did not find it too trashed very well written.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I think it was not the best book out of the series.<br />You could at least put more than chicken pox and Valentine's dance.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|It was really interesting to read the original text after seeing various adaptations in film for so many years. Dickens definately had it all together.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|It was new and well packaged.  Arrived on time too.  You require too many words, that is all I have to say.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|It worked great for the first few days then MAYOR LAG so I was looking up a liyrc video for another world then I just sat there waiting for like what seemed like 2 hours so I deleted it but the lag is still on my kindle  I went to go listen to the album's I had down loaded it said they were playing but no sound came out and the sound was up all the way then when I downloaded it again It just shut down my kindle but now it says I have the app but it's not in cloud device or my home screen I don't know what to do
0425263908|5.0|It is true that Bared to You is an almost exact replica of Fifty Shades of Grey.  I do not understand how two different authors both could publish two series that are so shockingly similar without causing alarm about plagarism.  On the other hand, out of the two series, Bared to You is by far the best.  I bought Bared to You on a whim one day because I needed something to read.  When I got home, I cracked the book open to read the first chapter and I could not put it down!! Needless to say, I finished the book by the next morning! Sylvia Day does an excellent job with her writing style and her representations of Gabriel and Eva.  I was intwined within the words wondering what could possibly happen next! As I said before, it did catch me off guard when I realized how similar it was to Fifty Shades.  The difference is that I could hardly get through Fifty Shades.  It bored me and sometimes the scenes about dominance rubbed me the wrong way.  While there is a hint of the dominant/submissive partners in Bared to You, it comes off in a natural relationship between two people who were abused as a child and are learning together how to love and trust somebody other than themselves.  This book was amazing and one that you wish never ended and after you faced the reality that it has ended, you cannot help sitting and thinking about the book long afterwards.  I cannot wait to finish the rest of the series!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Good character development. Smart and funny while not being patronizing or condescending. Unexpected twists and turns. Fun read! Recommend this one.
B00AL1ONN8|5.0|TI is truly on of the best mc's left. I listen to old school hip hop, but not that far back for those who remember and still listen to the guys who pioneered hip hop, I mean old school such as Tupac Biggie Master P Boss Mia X, I'm a huge fan of No Limit so pretty much all those guys excluding the few very bad ones. TI has delivered time and time again his rhymes are genius and hard to top. Again I'm 35 and don't listen to any of this new school hip hop, but I will give respect to one that I think could have and would have been great regardless of era and that mc is Wiz Khalifa.
B0038AUY96|4.0|Fast moving, kept you guessing. Bit stereotypical about women. Enjoyed it. First jo nesbo book, will definitely read more by same author.
B0086700CM|1.0|Claims compatibilty with Android 2.1 but doesnt work on it.<br />Not sure if it works with a later version of andriod.
B004JK61K0|5.0|When trying to set up my email on my smart phone it would not find or accept<br />my stmp etc servers and K-9 found the correct ones right off! Great program!
B0000VCZKM|5.0|This classic movie was a big hit with my 6 year old granddaughter. She watches it at least once a day. She was annie for Halloween. The first time she watched it she said I Loved this movie so so much I cried. Priceless!
B007G5K066|5.0|Good movie on blu-ray.  It is a great value package to receive the movie in all three types of processing.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Good cast /acting, storyline a little difficult to follow. All in all, time spent watching this movie was worth it.
B001KP2J3U|5.0|i loved all the actors in the move. i loved  the cruise down the nile, for i did that trip myself. i have lent out death on the nile to my friends & they loveit too.
0803730470|5.0|A very cute story for little kids.  It is one of my favorite books to read to my little one.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I got caught up in the show and figured I should read the books. I am excited to read more, it's a good mystery book.
