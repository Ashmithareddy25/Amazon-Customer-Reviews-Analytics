B0002KQNJU|4.0|A quirky old Vampyre comedy . Some of the comedy is dated , but it's a hoot anyhow .
0671646788|5.0|This book was a college sales class assignment 20 years ago. I loved it then and love it today.
B000002GQE|5.0|What a gem!!! If you want something to put on and just kick-back and listen to, then this is it. This is a masterpiece of the past (1967) that should have a special place in your 2009 Ipod. I highly recommend The Days of The Future Passed......and The Nights in White Satin.
B00003CWL6|5.0|American Beauty is a film for which \\"extraordinary\\" is a weak description. It deals with so many issues of life for people of many ages.<br /><br />It teaches us that life is full of beauty in so many forms, even the sexually repressed gay, yet homophobic, U.S. Marine Colonel, who in his rage somehow seems beautiful, too. It is so because he is so much alive. Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) must become alive to see that there is \\"so much beauty in the world,\\" and, once Lester is alive again, he dies.<br /><br />Annette Bening's character is still becoming alive, but not completely yet, when the film ends.<br /><br />The young man who is always filming people leaves his family which he must, yet still loving his angry father. Will the young man's mother be the next person to become alive again?<br /><br />We most likely will never know the answer to that question.
B001EO2UJK|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift for my Father and he loves it.  A great full compliment of original Genesis music for their fans.
0425223523|5.0|If you are a fan of Jane Austen and [[ASIN:0192802631 Persuasion (Oxford World's Classics)]] I am sure you have wondered about how Captain Wentworth and Anne met, how they fell in love, what happened eight years ago and how does what happened eight years ago affect them later on. I have read Persuasion by Jane Austen and I admire it very much, but I have always felt unsatisfied not knowing how the story began. Of course we may never know what Jane Austen had in mind for Wentworth and Anne, but Amanda Grange makes a bold attempt at how the first meeting between the two went.<br /><br />This is my third book by Amanda Grange and by far my favorite. I like this book the most because it gives such new insight into the character of Captain Wentworth. The story starts in the year 1806 just before he meets Anne for the first time. This was a pleasant surprise because I was expecting it to start like \\"Persuasion\\" did with Kellynch hall being rented by the Croft's. The first 100 or so pages were like a \\"prequel\\" to \\"Persuasion.\\"<br /><br />My favorite thing about this book is how well we got to know Captain Wentworth, we got to see other sides of him. In \\"Persuasion\\" he is mostly angry, proud, resentful. Now we see his character develop. We see more history, depth, passion. He is a more well-rounded character.<br /><br />Of course the writing is not in the style of Jane Austen, Captain Wentworth is our narrator, and I don't think anyone will argue with me when I say he does not have Jane Austen's wit and language! The author does a great job portraying Wentworth's thoughts and feelings and the story (when it resumes in the year 1814) follows very closely the timing and events taking place in Jane Austen's \\"Persuasion.\\"<br /><br />I highly recommend this to any Jane Austen, \\"Persuasion,\\" or Captain Wentworth fan!
B0017R1EAA|2.0|I think I saw this during summer break, and it was extremely boring! There were a few action scenes, but I remember falling asleep a few times! There was a nice little sex scene. I would not recommend MIAMI VICE!!!
B001E1DJD4|5.0|Get this CD and a great CD player.  Wow.  What great music and what an amazing recording.
0060853972|3.0|I didn't really expect much coming in to this one.  I knew it would be humorous, but I figured that there would be a somewhat more serious approach to the story itself, similar to Gaiman's humorous yet serious American Gods.  What I got was what Gaiman and Pratchett said in the \\"interview\\" at the end of the book: a venue for the two authors to try and make each other laugh.    This approach has some benefits since invariably what they think will make each other laugh will certainly tickle us as well.  Some of the characters, such as Shadwell, or Dog, Agnes Nutter and so on were humorous and did get a chuckle.  Seeing the outrageous exploits of the \\"Antichrist\\", outrageous because of the dichotomy of what he represents to what he was, were amazing.      But what it came down to it for me is that regardless of whether a book is a humorous book or not, I still want the book to have some serious aspect to it, one that the reader can get their teeth in to and become involved.  Instead we read a very light hearted, frivolous story meant to make the coauthor laugh.  I commend their intent and their passion, but as a book I was hoping for a whole lot more.  Recommend only if you enjoy humorous books more than others.    2.5 stars.
B00192KCQ0|2.0|Metallica's latest creation should get a better rating, but the production quality does a disservice to the music by sacrificing clarity and range for a wall of noise. Imagine trying to read a book if it were all in caps. No peaks and valleys, no nuances - that's what it's like listening to this album.
B00006879E|5.0|I love this cd. It's got some very funky tracks that are awesome.  Only bought the cd for the song \\"Sunday Morning\\" and didn't know I would enjoy the rest of the cd as well as I do which makes it a bonus. Maroon 5 rocks.
B0014DBZT2|4.0|Dig Lazarus Dig is a great addition to any Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds collection. It is a little more up tempo than earlier releases but awesome non the less. So far for me *lay down here and be my girl & *more news from nowhere are my favorite. They both have good riffs without the pop music feel. I was introduced with the best of album as a gift and have been in love ever since (if you are new to nick try that cd 1st it's a great intro). Nick does have too much to say and over does it sometimes. However that is the beauty of their work. They are talented odd people with music that makes me smile, scares me, and touches me. Keep the tunes a coming.
B001L5SXQG|5.0|I have been a huge fan of Bruce's for years and like most older musicians, Bruce's music is startng to mellow BUT I really like this album. There are a few songs on here I can do without but there are some on here that I really like and can listen to over and over again. Listen to Outlaw Pete more than once. The first time I was like ok...thats not bad..then I heard it again and was like...thats a great song.  Its not Born to Run but its still really good. Mellower but very good.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|After purchasing a Blu-ray player there was little debate as to which collection my family wanted to own to maximize the superior viewing quality of the player. The spectacular Planet Earth is so jam packed with breathtaking imagery it is hard to say which episode is best. Mountains, Caves, Ice World or the rest. It is unbelievable that any human was able to capture these images but they did and we are the beneficiaries.
B0012E2HRC|5.0|This version of 'Bridges' is widescreen and includes a feature on how the film was made which gives insights by the actors, producer and technical people. This is a wonderful love story told in a special way under Clint Eastwood's direction. It focuses on sounds, expression and mood rather than dialogue. Bridges is a very powerful movie for anyone who has had a 'once in a lifetime' lovematch which did not result in an on-going relationship. Beautifully acted by Streep and Eastwood. The additional information provided, including interviews with Sreep and Eastwood, adds to a very emotional and enjoyable experience.

B000JJS8TM|5.0|I have always loved The Beatles. I heard the DVD version at a friends place for the first time (Jan 09) and was completely blown away with the fresh quality of the vocals, instrumentation and remix. Had to have a copy and Amazon delivered.
B0013FYTA8|5.0|I was just looking over the reviews just to see what everyone said about it after listening to the album, and all i seem to see is everyone talking about TOADM ripping off The Cult, which they actually did not the lyrics arent even the same all they did was sample their music, in which almost every hip-hop record does.  But they made the sound more to our time. All they did was made it a harder music track sound its not a bad thing. the album is very good if you are a fan go on get this its worth it.

B00009NHC5|5.0|Before I married my wife, I was not a big Audrey Hepburn fan at all.  I had not seen any of her movies, and had only heard her name come up when Jennifer Love Hewitt did the TV movie about her several years ago.  HOWEVER, my life changed (in more ways than one) when I married one of the biggest Audrey Hepburn fans of all time!! Before I knew it, I was singing along with \\"Just You Wait, Henry Higgins\\" with \\"My Fair Lady\\" and \\"Blue River\\" with \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" and going crazy every single time I saw good AH movie that was not in my collection.  When my wife told me about \\"Wait Until Dark\\", the fact that Audrey plays a blind woman sparked my curiosity and I bought it almost right away.  BUT NOTHING COULD HAVE PREPARED ME FOR THIS MASTERPIECE!!!  The movie is AMAZING, and I wish I was alive back when it was first released in theaters because that would have definitely been a wild experience.  Scary movies these days are too unrealistic; directors seem to feel as if you have to have a lot of special effects, screaming, and bloody scenes to be effective.  However, \\"Wait Until Dark\\" proves that sometimes it's not what you see that is scary, but rather what you do not.  CLASSIC, CLASSIC, CLASSIC!!
B000W91RUG|4.0|I recently have just gotten into watching the series of the Big Bang and I love it! It's one of those series you can watch over and over again and never get tired of it. I can't wait until Season 2 comes out!
B00003CXRM|5.0|It had been on my list, for a long time, of movies I wanted to see.  Went to several Blockbusters, they didn't have it but every clerk I ask about it said it was one of their favorite movies.  So, I bought it, watched it, loved it.
B0017R5UAA|3.0|Most of the tracks in this CD are enjoyable. It has a folksy, country tune with a new twist. I bought it as an experimental purchase. The fusion music is very pleasing to hear but the vocals fall sort.

B001ILFUDC|5.0|Pinocchio is the cutest Disney film of all-time. This delighful tale was a childhood favorite of mine and still is! Glad to see Disney is re-releasing this beloved classic. I highly recommend it, enjoy.
B000RG1FMO|2.0|I'll agree on some of the production, but even that's as edgy as Britney Spears.    They way this album was hyped, I expected so much more. eh *shrug*
B001P5Q6F2|5.0|For the past month I've been reading early reviews of this album, and it has been getting a mixed reception.  To be honest, I place this album in between Sacrament and Ashes of the Wake.  It's still got a raw sound (nothing like their earlier stuff) and it has the \\"radio-friendly\\" sound of Sacrament.  I know this is going to dissappoint die-hard fans of their earlier albums.  I classify myself as one of those fans, but I'm not dissappointed at all.  The sad fact is that bands evolve.  This is far less of a dissappointment like The Haunted's latest effort..... ugh.  We live in a terrible time where bands just can't seem to hold on to what made them amazing, and they lose their overall brutal sound.  Wrath holds onto that quality well enough.  As far as I'm concerned, nothing will ever be as great as Ashes of the Wake, or As the Palaces Burns (which would be their best album if the recording quality was up to par with Ashes), but Wrath will definately stay in my cd player for the next month or so.  It's a solid album and worth a chance.  I can tell it's one of those albums that needs to grow on you. I will always support LOG and in my eyes, they are one of the most consistent metal bands out there.
B0018RWMNM|2.0|Wonderful book, a good made for tv mini-series, a badly made blu-ray.  The nighttime shots have so much video noise in them that those scenes make the blu-ray nearly unwatchable at times.  There was also quite a bit of edge blurriness which completely takes away from the beautiful vistas and grand landscapes.  Truly a shame that the company made such a poor transfer and didn't bother cleaning up the material afterwords.  Wait until they re-release it if you care at all how the transfer looks.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|Reliable seller, I have done business with this seller before and would highly recommend.  Fast shipping and the items are always exactly as described.

Well Done.

B000AGTPUK|5.0|I saw several people give not so great reviews for this movie but I think most were for the 3D version. The regular widescreen version of this movie is great. It's a KIDs movie, not a movie for adults. I bought this for my almost 4 year old after several break downs from him because Daddy kept deleting it off of the DVR. It's one of his favorite movies and he watched it for days after we got it, even though it was a month after Christmas. I think it's a very good movie for children between 3 and 6 depending on what kind of movies your child likes. It's not some silly cartoon with absolutely no meaning. It has Lots of meaning, a good story line, good songs, and a lot of action. \\"Believe.\\"
B00129H7VS|5.0|Very impressive video quality combined with all of the extras thrown in with Blu-Ray makes this a remarkable addition to anyone's collection.
1416511946|5.0|This book is amazing.  I love the commentary on the various journal entries.  If people still want to ty drugs aftr this book then Darwin surely had it right.  Survival of the fittest!
B000FP2OPY|5.0|This series is a well written and well acted out series.  The only caution that I would give to anyone purchasing this is that it is addictive to watch.  Once you start you don't want to stop watching it, so my advice is to purchase all of the seasons at one time, so that you are not waiting forever for the next season to come out.    This is a story about two brothers who through an event which occurred 22 years before are out hunting for the supernatural and trying to eliminate all bad spirits, ghosts, demons, etc.      The plot in this series, is a 2 or 3 part plot.  One part gets solved within each episode, while there is another underlying plots that continue throughout the season and a third plot that continues throughout all of the seasons.
B000654YRY|2.0|Ok, i have to start by saying I really love Dire Straits and a few few of their songs are in my all time top 10 favourites.  I recently received a couple of Pink Floyd DVDs and wanted the same with Dire Straits...  What a disappointment! The sound quality is awful. It is not regular and volume changes several times in the same song, as if the sound was sometimes \\"muffled\\"... And this is with very very good video and sound equipment. I would say 5 stars for the music and between 0 and 1 star for the DVD.  My advice: Buy the CD instead. The DVD only brings frustration and anger about such fantastic music being wasted.  Oh, how much I wish we had something from them in Blu Ray...
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|It is what it is, the darkest Batman movie to date. Gotta love the way Heath Ledger portrays the Joker, he totally nailed it! This maniac killer totally creeps you out, well deserved Oscar for Heath.....
B00003CXRM|5.0|This goofy movie had us laughing from the start to the end. It's the kind of movie you can watch over and over and catch something new each time. The Bluegrass soundtrack is great. My only caveat is to avoid eating popcorn while watching. You may choke to death!
B000AP04L0|5.0|What does it say about us all, that we are willing to be cubicle slaves for a regular paycheck and (sometimes) benefits? Human beings were NOT meant to sit in a cubicle for 8+ hours/day, under fluorescent lights,  suffering through pointless meetings, and singing halfhearted birthday greetings to coworkers who you secretly wish would just drop dead.    Too cowardly to quit, we sit in our cubes and become obese and depressed. Then we get laid off and sit at home being obese and depressed.     Decades from now, this film will be remembered as a symbol of late 20th-century life, and of our general willingness to sell out. As a cubicle slave myself, I'm not sure whether to be disgusted or amused. Certainly I am not proud of this life.
B001PPGAIA|4.0|What is this? An action/adventure/romance/war story? Why yes . .Yes it is . .And I love every bit of it . . . While watching this rather long movie, it occured to me that it was as if I was watching a double feature for it seemed like it was going to end at least once if not twice before it actually did though I liked the movie enough that I can't really complain (though it did through my bladder for a loop at the theaters... haha). The first story is a western-esque love story involving English aristocrat Lady Sarah Ashley (played by Nicole Kidman) and \\"the Drover\\" played by Hugh Jackman. Lady Ashley originally went to Australia because her husband's (who was recently murdered)ranch was in trouble due to connving greedy English cattle barons trying to take it over. The two, along with a few friends, are forced to attempt to heard 2000 cattle across treachrous Australian outback in order to supply beef to the army (I can't remember if it's the american army or British or whatever . . .)before the greed cattle barons can get there force. Who gets there first you may ask? Well . . .You'll have to watch to find out! And even after all that action and romance, there's even more - a war story! The crew witnesses the attack on Darwin (just months after Pearl Harbour) and we get to see how it affects all their lives (the good and bad).<br /><br />Good Points about the movie:<br />*The acting especially extraordinary if you ask me . .Nothing can ruin a movie like poor acting and there was certainly none of that in this stellar movie<br />*It was educational - I learned a lot about Australian and Aborigional history - the good and bad (I feel real bad for the Aborigionies (sp?) . . .they were abused so much . . .)<br />*The special effects were pretty nice~<br /><br />I would list bad points but I don't want to influence anyone to dislike it (which I don't think I have to power to do anyways, but still . . .)<br /><br />Do yourself a favour though and don't just read reviews and judge if you'll like a movie by other peoples' opinions and see it for yourself . ..Most likely you won't be sorry~ [sorry if I sounded harsh by the way . . .]y other peoples' opinions and see it for yourself . ..Most likely you won't be sorry~ [sorry if I sounded harsh by the way . . .]
B001KPK6Q2|5.0|Taylor manages to outdo her first album with \\"Fearless.\\" This album is full of toe-tapping beats, hooks that stick with you all day long, and her charming, down-to-earth style of songwriting.<br /><br />The stories she tells in her songs are easy to relate for anyone that loves their mother (\\"The Best Day\\"), has been hurt (\\"You're Not Sorry\\" & \\"Forever & Always\\"), or has been a naive high school student(\\"Fifteen\\").<br /><br />No matter how old you are, you'll find yourself singing along.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I did NOT buy this DVD for weightloss -- I'm tiny, actually, and just want to build muscle.  I believe I made a great choice with this video.  I love being able to do the QUICK workouts at home.  There's no down-time between exercises so it's pretty intense, but the time flies by quickly.  I'm anxious to try the more advanced workouts on the DVD (there are 3 total) - it's nice to start out at a \\"beginner\\" level and work on up!

B000067CPX|5.0|This album is a change from the funky beats of the other RHCP albums, but I like it! The songs are more melodic and fit Frusciante's emotional playing well. What really got me into this album was seeing their DVD of the By The Way tour live at Slane Castle - it's insane. If you haven't seen it, Google it now! My faves: 'Minor Thing', 'Dosed', 'By the Way' and 'I Could Die For You'
B000H5TVO4|5.0|A great collection of rock & pop songs from the past decade of the 90s.  Two great singers that have been going strong since the 80s, get this collection if you're a past decade fan.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Usually 2 disc albums can be disappointing, but there are very few tracks on this that I dislike. There is a good amount of variety on the album and it's great fun to listen to. My favorites include 'Hey', 'Stadium Arcadium' and 'Charlie'. Must buy for any RHCP fans.
B000002J6F|5.0|There are some albums that leave you pining for more, such as the Derek and the Dominos \\"Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs\\" recordings. This is that type of CD. You want more and more and more............. Stephen Stills was at his peak, the Manassas band was awesome. Guess we have to settle for what we have but -- I can't stop thinking about what could have been. This CD is absolutely PERFECT and absolutely ESSENTIAL. Grab it!
B001GKYBXA|4.0|Album starts off rauncy to me for the first couple tracks.<br />But then it excels to awesome music !.<br />Heard shades of several music groups and or Albums from my past.<br />As a person from the 60's it was very cosmic, especially when<br />loud or w/headphones !
B000002J6H|5.0|This has to be one of the greatest albums ever! I am addicted to this CD and am a devoted Stephen Stills fan. (It only took me 40 years to catch up with this very talented artist.) David Crosby is a lovely singer, Graham Nash is nice, Neil Young is okay is you like nasal, whiney warbling. Stephen Stills is the MASTER! His solo catalog is much too sparse. Hope he has a few more up his sleeve. Check out his Man Alive! CD.

B000002UB3|5.0|The White Album was what got me started, A Hard Day's Night is the best with single accessible songs, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is the big classic according to most people, but Abbey Road, in my personal opinion, is their best.<br /><br />I feel that it was what really shaped the progressive rock genre.  Pink Floyd, Yes, and Genesis had formed and were moving into a direction, but this was the album that really created that direction.  The harmonies, and the long medley of short songs, along with the mix of dynamics is what makes this album such a classic.<br /><br />This album might have been the final album for the Beatles, but bands like Pink Floyd and Yes continued from where this album left off.  I feel that albums like Dark Side of the Moon and Tales From Topographic Oceans continued from where Abbey Road left off.  Abbey Road was probably the first real progressive rock album, and although Brian Wilson's Smile had the same concept, Abbey Road had much more contrast between tunes.

0316010669|3.0|The case studies are what make this book. Who wouldn't want the inside scoop on art dealings, marital discord, cop stories and what happens when someone with autism watches Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?<br /><br />I like the way the author dissects these stories -- some of which we're familiar with, like Amadou Diallo's death or the assassination attempt on President Reagan's life -- and then ties them together in the neat little concept of \\"thin-slicing,\\" or making decisions based on very minute pieces of visual or tactile information.<br /><br />But Gladwell's overarching idea, that the unconscious decisions we arrive at in the first few milliseconds of a situation can be better than thoughtfully considered ones, seems woefully optimistic to me. After all, many of the instances Gladwell analyzes are ones in which the snap decision was wrong.<br /><br />Take the death of Amadou Diallo. Gladwell's treatment of it is part of a section on how reading facial cues can help you \\"mind-read,\\" or intuit someone's true intentions. Even if the cops in this situation had years of practice in the arcane study of facial movements and could more accurately read Mr. Diallo's face, what could they have seen in this particular situation? It was the middle of the night on a dark street!<br /><br />The only real lesson I took away from this book is that, yes, \\"thin-slicing\\" can provide a good answer, but only after a lifetime of experience in some particular field. Gladwell's examples attest to that fact -- art forgery, police actions, music appreciation, food tasting. Unless you've honed your instincts with years of instruction and experience, I'd say you're better off taking your time making decisions.

B001DJLCRC|5.0|ince Gilligan, the X-Files veteran who created Breaking Bad, has made it clear that he dreamed up his series idea \\"several years before Weeds\\"--and therefore any resemblance between the two shows is purely coincidental. While both ask us to identify with aggrieved suburbanites reduced to dealing drugs to make ends meet, I see no reason not to believe him. Bryan Cranston, whose Walter White in Breaking Bad is a high-school chemistry teacher cooking up crystal meth in a used RV in the New Mexican desert, shouldn't remind anybody of Mary-Louise Parker, whose Nancy Botwin in Weeds is a soccer mom selling pot in pastries and popcorn to the whiter part of a Southern California town, unless you're dumb, numb, and weird. Weeds, moreover, required half a dozen episodes before turning semigothic, whereas Breaking Bad can't even get through its pilot hour without gunplay, sirens, and poison gas.<br /><br />Not that there's anything wrong with that. Even before he gets bad medical news from the hospital, Walter is already moonlighting as a cashier in a car wash to help pay for his Albuquerque house with the desolate patio and leaf-filled swimming pool, his stay-at-home wife (Anna Gunn) who writes short stories and is pregnant again, and a teenage son (RJ Mitte) with cerebral palsy. Now this lifelong nonsmoker with \\"a brain the size of Wisconsin\\" is informed that he has inoperable lung cancer, with a year or two left to live if he's lucky. Well, what is he always telling his apathetic students about chemistry as a metaphor for transformation? Staring into a breakfast plate of \\"veggie bacon\\" that smells like Band-Aids, Walter is in desperate need of some risk-taking changes in his anal-retentive life. If Takashi Shimura's Everyman in Ikiru doesn't come immediately to mind, maybe William H. Macy's car salesman in Fargo will substitute.<br /><br />But never mind Kurosawa and the Coen brothers. Follow Walter from a drug-bust ride-along with his brother-in-law, the DEA agent (Dean Norris), to the garage of an ex-student (Aaron Paul) whose previous partner in the methamphetamine biz has just been arrested to the cubbyhole kitchen of a Winnebago, where Walter proves to be an \\"artist\\" at the batching of magic crystals. This mild-mannered high-school teacher is now spending an inordinate amount of time on the road, in a gas mask and his underwear, dodging bullets and (literally) laundering money. In fact, from a chemical reaction peculiar to the cinematography of the Southwest desert, the very colors of Breaking Bad seem to have been laundered: As Walter moves from Mister Peepers to Sunbelt drug lord, the picture shifts from earth-tone beige to livid blue, asparagus green, and piss yellow.<br /><br />Further to confound anybody still hoping for Weeds-type sight gags (the stolen goat, the sauna sex, the teddy-bear nanny cam), there will be prescribed courses not just in chemistry but also in chemotherapy. From chemotherapy, one shouldn't expect a lot of laughs. We are being slipped instead something metaphorical about wayward leukocytes and cells gone wrong. It must be said that Cranston, a sitcom stalwart perhaps best known as hairy Hal on Malcolm in the Middle, embodies all these transformations as if he were himself a lost city of the plains--a toppled tower, a ruined wall, a bundle of whispering bones. Not enough of Breaking Bad was available for preview to decide whether the supporting cast will eventually satisfy as much as Weeds regulars like Elizabeth Perkins, Kevin Nealon, Tonye Patano, and Justin Kirk, but Cranston's Walter is already a winner. He reminds me of Robin Williams's Tommy Wilhelm in the film version of Saul Bellow's Seize the Day, back in 1986, when Robin Williams was still wonderful to watch. Which in turn makes me wonder at the number of Walters there are in our literature, from Melville and Twain to Saul Bellow, William Kennedy, and E.L. Doctorow, deracinated walkers on the wild side, urban outlaws as pop icons, on the lam from farm chores, doctors, cops, and schoolmarmsrom farm chores, doctors, cops, and schoolmarms
1433502399|5.0|Excellent Bible with outstanding contributors for a Reformed perspective. I find the notes valuable and informative and helpful for everyone as a new believer, teacher, student or Pastor.
B001MW0J2O|3.0|This was really well-reviewed in our local paper and I got it for my husband who has eclectic musical tastes, running from hi-brow jazz to punk.  This album was said to \\"evoke the Beatles\\" with \\"lush melodies\\" etc.  Haven't found any of that yet.  It isn't awful, but I don't recommend, unless you are already a fan.
B000E9910W|5.0|Do you want every single track ever recorded by the Doobies?  It would be nice - it would even be nice for the average Doobie fan to be able to afford the 4 disc box set \\"Long Train Runnin'\\", but if I have a choice between this 33 track collection and the more than twice as expensive box set.... well, this isn't a bad way to go.<br /><br />The Doobie Brothers were originally a guitar-driven rock and roll band, with groovin' tunes like \\"Listen to the Music\\", \\"China Grove\\" and \\"Long Train Runnin\\", with tunes by Tom Johnston and Pat Simmons (who wrote and sang lead vocals on their first #1 hit \\"Black Water\\").  Jeff \\"Skunk\\" Baxter joined the band when Steely Dan colleagues decided to get off the road and become studio musicians.  At about the same time Tom Johnston's health deteriorated, with a hospitalization for a bleeding ulcer.  Baxter suggested bringing over one of his Steely Dan mates, Michael McDonald, and almost overnight the Doobies gained a signature voice and a funkier, jazzier style.  McDonald has since left the band, which still performs some of his signature tunes, but his soulful tenor powered one hit after another with \\"Takin' it to the Streets\\", \\"What A Fool Believes\\", and \\"Minute by Minute\\".<br /><br />You could spend thrice as much and have a more complete Doobie collection, but for less than $15 you can have 33 tracks that include all of their charted hits plus a few extra's like Rockin' Down the Highway.<br /><br />For Rock and Roll fans, this is a good use of fifteen bucks if you don't have any/enough Doobie Brothers.

B001KZVQJI|5.0|This Blu-ray release of King Kong sounds like what I had hoped the original DVD release would sound like.  The soundtrack of a movie makes such a difference in becoming a part of the movie.  Thanks for the upgrade of the sound in this version of release.  But why did we have to wait?
B00007BH5C|5.0|I love listening to the LoTR soundtracks. Howard Shore is a masterful composer and this CD is great. If my LoTR music wasn't on my MP3 player, I'd probably would have damaged the CDs by now with how frequently I listen to this music.
B0000028M7|4.0|I was always a JOF man myself, though it is obvious why Dirt is cited as the great grunger's finest moment. Capturing their rock at its melodically darkest with a well proportioned mixture, production work doesn't exactly elevate the album almost twenty years later, but the material itself for the most part is so tightly provocative in its alternative-rock context that it feels preserved in time and will never loose relevance.
1401203078|5.0|Unlike the previous two books in the series, the actual plot in this one takes a back seat to the contents of the titular dossier, which records the history of the League in its several incarnations.  The joy really comes from seeing how the vast history of fictional characters from ancient Greece to modern beatnik America is woven together to form a world where all of these stories are true. Every page is filled with references that you will recognize, and more that you won't but will be inspired to look up.  The plot itself is not particularly interesting, but watching Moore construct this world in which all of Shakespeare is history, Big Brother really did rule England, and Orlando is Roland and carries Excaliber will bring you back again and again to find more and more of the little Easter eggs that abound.  If you enjoyed the first two in the series, this is a slightly different ride, but just as enjoyable.

Though at least half of the album has likely grown numb from repeated airplay, try extracting any under-researched magic, because it likely is there, and if anything, remains at the top for undeniable consistency.
0679721037|5.0|A small but mighty book (154 pages) that tells the story of Hiroshima before, during and after the atom bomb.  Told in a matter-of-fact manner, it follows 6 survivors from beginning to present day.  The book also chronicles the city's rebuilding and the rebuilding of the relationship between the US and Japan.  Pros:  cheep, small, easy to read in pieces and impactfull!
B00009Z576|4.0|A truly underrated and forgotten album, it has been given the new life it deserves with this remaster. Sounds better than I ever remember. I don't care much for the first two tracks, but 3-6 are among my fave Yes songs. And the instrumental \\"Do We Have To....\\" is HOT! Price and music are both great!
0887307280|5.0|This book was recommended to me by my SCORE (Service Corps Of Retired Executives) counselor when I decided that I wanted to start a small business. I bought the book but I didn't expect to enjoy it. I thought it would be very dry with a lot of charts, graphs, book keeping and how to write a Business Plan. I was quite pleased to be wrong. The book was very interesting and inspirational. It teaches you how to work on your business and not in your business. I know that doesn't make any sense but let's just say it teaches you what you need to do to start a business, keep your business from going under, grow your business and not go insane while you're doing all of the above. If you're even thinking about starting a small business, save yourself a lot of grief and aggrevation and buy this book. You'll thank me later!
B000002GYR|5.0|Can't believe any of you fools could give this album anything but a 5 star rating. Tom Waits will one day be known as \\"one of the greatest song writers ever\\"! Just remember you heard it hear. Once you hear this cd you will find appreciation for the man and the artist he is. I would then continue to follow his career from there and learn what so many of us already know. If you have been looking to be moved by new music in your life, you came to the right place!
1401219268|3.0|The story is good, but very dark.  The movie will deserve its R rating.  The art is fine and has value.<br />  Were I to criticize the story, I would have to say the following: the parts of the story that leave you in wonder don't have much to do with the plot.  The plot, in and of itself, is merely adequate.  What I've noticed personally, is that, apparently, the main appeal of the book involves the writer and artist's depiction of immense evil...evil that I for one had never before seen in comics.<br /><br />  Examples:<br />  1  A mother, who happens to be a prostitute, screams at her child telling him that she wishes she had had an abortion.  This occurs as the child walks in on his mother as she is having sex with a customer.<br /><br />  2  One superhero enters into a home looking for a 7 year old girl who has been kidnapped, instead finds that the kidnapper has cut the child apart and fed her to his dogs.<br /><br />  3  A superhero walks into a bar looking for information.  He chooses one patron and gets information by breaking his fingers one by one until another patron begins to speak.<br /><br />  This book changed the comic world.  I just don't know if I like how it changed it.  I'm not one for the old super-cheesy comics of the 50s and 60s, but I don't think I'm one for prostitute mothers in the middle of a trick telling their children that they wish they were dead either.<br />  I hope the world wakes up from this nightmare soon.  It's a little too dark for me.

0743454537|4.0|This is the second novel of Jodi Picoult that I have read. She must like to write her books based on courtroom dramas because her other book, \\"Plain Truth\\" is a courtroom drama also.      I really liked this book but I think parts of it could could have been left out and the book would had still been good.  The love story between Campbell and Julia was a little boring to me. I was more interested in finding out what was going to happen to Anna and Kate.     I've read other reviews on here and some people were disappointed about the ending because they felt it was predictable, but not me. The ending took me by surprise. It came out of left field and WHAM!! I was really not expecting that. Although I wished it could have ended differently but then this wouldn't had been one of Jodi's style.

B000VNMMR0|3.0|I suppose in a world where everything is enhanced CGI or Virtual Reality the Die Hard franchise ought to take its already over-the-top formula to new levels of technological \\"try to top this.\\"  Thus the stage is set for the fourth installment, cleverly entitled LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD.  Here we find a very middle-aged John McClane (yet the years have been kind to Bruce Willis) on his way to serve a routine warrant on a cyber hacker (Justin Long, who needs to calm down) wanted by the FBI for questioning.  Yet after three Die Hard death match marathons the viewer knows all too well there is never anything \\"routine\\" in McClane's shoot-'em-up life, and soon the two characters embark on a perilous adventure that makes suspension of disbelief the next special on Comedy Central.<br /><br />I know this is a Die Hard movie; I know this is Detective John McClane.  But. . .come on.  Plunging down a shaft, jumping from a semi on a crumbling freeway, clutching the wing of a spinning military jet--all while dodging semi-automatic gunfire or torched tons of TNT--is, perhaps, just a tad too much.  But again, this is the age of mind-boggling special effects, so there's no end to the death-defying predicaments the filmmakers gleefully subject their protagonist to.  Not even Superman would survive this kind of punishment.<br /><br />Willis is delightfully cranky, cantankerous, and curmudgeonly; Long needs to calm down (I think I have mentioned this); and cyber villain Timothy Olyphant definitely lacks the cold, calculated evil of his villainous predecessors.  LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD deserves three stars just because of all the eye-popping visuals, which are impressive, but really:  this franchise should have ended after Detective McClane rode off into the sunset after saving the [[ASIN:B000O77SRC Nakatomi Tower]].<br />--D.

1593080778|5.0|\\"The Origin of Species - By Means of Natural Selection \\", by Charles Darwin, Barnes & Noble Classics, NY 2004.

Levine)  22 pgs., Contents 6 pgs., Appendix (Current theories)  10 pgs.,  Glossary 16 pgs., & Endnotes 6 pgs.,  4 pgs., &  Index 8 pgs. Inveiglement is a 5 pg. chronology of Chas. Darwin & one 2 pg. schema of divergence of taxa.  8\\" x 5 1/8\\".<br /><br />Certainly, by nearly everyone's standards, this book must rank as one of the finest ever written for its prose, logical thought, provocative conclusions and scientific inquiry, moreover, having withstood an enormous degree of challenge from all quarters, from the Church to scientists worldwide, and yet, importantly, receiving ever increasing support of its conclusions with advances made in geology, paleontology, bio-chemistry and DNA confirmation of continuity of life forms.<br /><br />This book has rather heavy prose, characteristic of contemporary writing style then existent, perhaps justifying modicum of repetition that more or less oft requires some sentences, if not paragraphs, to be reread for clarity.  The prose and logical reasoning closely follows that of Malthus's (\\"An Essay on the Principle of Population\\"), and Darwin was encouraged by reading his views of struggle for life and then stated \\"the doctrine of Malthus's applied with manifold force to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms\\".  What is especially striking in Darwin's case is the completeness of theory to include animals & plants, morphological patterns and instinctual patterns of behavior and to circumscribe his theory with statement that the Hereditable Bridge has never been broken, and a species once lost, cannot reappear. He touched ever so lightly on the subject of creationism, knowing the controversy, that would erupt, but he seemed to have reserved a room for a God and was, himself, a very caring, sincere and sensitive man.<br /><br />- finis -

B001GQACGO|5.0|I bought this album in November when it came out--and I have simply not stopped playing it! I LOVE Beyonce and I LOVE Sasha Fierce!  B'Day, in my opinion, was a somewhat mediocre album but Beyonce has really stepped up her game with this album. It is, in fact, due to this album that I have now become a new Beyonce fan and really anticipate what she does next!  The first disc is more slow and peaceful--nonetheless they are still really catchy. Outstanding tracks would have to be Halo, Broken-Hearted Girl, Smash Into You and Satellites! However, all the others are still amazing...Then the second disc--WOW, WOW and WOW. Radio, Hello, Sweet Dreams, Ego and Scared of Lonely are simply some of the best songs out there and I'm disappointed she didn't release any of them. There is only one track on each disc (Video Phone and That's Why You're Beautiful) that I wasn't impressed with, but this has got to my favorite CD of 2008, and its permanently in my stereo! BUY IT!!!
B001BPJJ9G|4.0|Very well-done movie.   It's about a stunt man who ends up in hospital, loses his girlfriend and has a young girl steal drugs from the pharmacy as he's depressed and toying with suicide.   He does spin some nice yarns, though he admits that he only tells her stories to get her to do his bidding.   The visuals are very nice, though the storyline could make many people uncomfortable.

The music fits so well with each scene and just makes for a wonderful experience.      However the soundtrack, on its own, just doesn't give the same inspiration.  The tracks are so short and just don't pull you back into the movie as other soundtracks do.      I will say this.  My two-year-old daughter can listen to the soundtrack alone and tell you what's happening on the movie when a particular score is playing. That's always an amazing thing to witness.

0312330537|5.0|The author paints a vivid picture of life in the slums and around Bombay.  His autobiographical novel gives the readers privvy to many private places in the city.

It's been a very long time since I felt that way about any book.  I hope Mr. Roberts will present us all with another fine book in the future.

B00006WKY9|5.0|This is one wild Scorpions album.  It rocks, but it's not mindless rock like many of those 80's metal/glam rock acts.  The Scorpions should NOT be included among those other less talented heavy rock bands such as Motley Crue, Twisted Sister and Dokken because this band actually has some great vocal melodies, solid guitar riffs, and decent guitar solos.  Furthermore, while they don't exactly experiment much, at least they know how to make a good vocal melody.      This is why the Scorpions, and specifically Taken by Force, deserves to be remembered as a classic.  Do NOT put these guys in the same category with Motley Crue and the like.  The Scorpions should be remembered more for their underrated 70's material.  I hope you agree.  Pick up Taken by Force to hear how rocking out with a destined commercial approach in the near future is REALLY done.

B000QR15XS|5.0|W.A.S.P. often stands for \\"W-hite A-nglo-S-axon P-rotestants\\" but with this band, it means \\"W-e A-re S-exupal P-erverts\\" and boy do they take that idea to the Nth degree! This album is as raw as their first EP, the vaunted \\"Animal F*ck Like A Beast\\" but more polished. This is the album where Randy Piper did most of the soloing & Chris Holmes played more rhythm guitar (except on the last track \\"The Torture Never Stops\\").<br /><br />The first song is purely an athem for those who're young and not sure what they want to do with their lives other than be somobody. I was 19 when I first heard this song and it struck me then that I too wanted to be someone in this world but what I hadn't a clue. Still like Alice Cooper's \\"I'm Eighteen\\" it was something the youth of America could identify with.<br /><br />My next favorite track is track five, \\"School Daze\\" and probably I liked this because I disliked my high school - much like 95% of the high schoolers out there do. Having to learn stupid facts for things that you'll never use them for is inane and mind numbing. Is it any wonder kids turn to drugs to geta way from it all? Try teaching them something that's both intersting and that they can use to make a living in their life.<br /><br />Next we have \\"Sleeping in the FIre\\" which in my opinon has one of the sexiest guitar solos of all time on it. Randy Piper should be praised for this awesome solo as it is bluesy yet sexy with much feel and it fits the song. It hints of S&M/B&D/D&S sort of thing with a hint of Luciferian worhsip thrown in. \\"Taste the love, of Lucifer's Magic...\\"\\".<br /><br />Finally my last favorite is \\"The Torture Never Stops\\" which is another S&M song but hey, this is an album by guys who label themselves as Sexual Perverts, right? Still the song rocks. It's one of my favorite 80's tunes and the openin gguitar riff by Chris Holmes just rips! I always have to have a copy of this in my music library to listen to when I get bored with the crap on the radio.<br /><br />All in all I rate this album with five out of five stars simply because the music is tight, classic and a great performance by a band who has followed in the footseps of Alic Cooper.th five out of five stars simply because the music is tight, classic and a great performance by a band who has followed in the footseps of Alic Cooper.

There was always something inside of me that told me that there was more to life than what it appears to be. The meditations in this book are very helpful; I particularly like the one where you imagine yourself in a bubble floating high above to a spiritual library that holds the key to what your purpose is in life. I recommend that everyone read this book that feels a little incomplete in their life or wishes to become more connected with the inner God or source.

B0014KD46W|2.0|Steve Winwood has some good riffs in this album.  Only problem is almost every song is based on some riff that is played over and over and over and over again.  If you like variety in your music writing, don't buy this CD!  Once a song starts you pretty much hear the same musical idea played for a long time.   This CD shows the downward spiral of a great talent.  Too bad.  Don't waste your money.
B000ZBPQEO|4.0|There's no questioning the value of the recordings on this set. No questioning the sound either - many of these recordings have been remastered and sound better than ever.<br /><br />HOWEVER - I recommend you check the components of this set as soon as you buy it.<br /><br />First, some sets come with an incomplete track listing booklet. This is really inexcusable in a set where one has ONLY the booklet as a source for what music is on the individual CDs. The CD booklet SHOULD have 86 pages. The one in my set had only 70 pages and had no listing for the contents of CDs 87 nor 88. The 71st page of the 86-page booklet lists the contents of CD 87. In addition, pages 72-74 (missing in the booklet in my set) give the contents of CD 88 (the documentary), and pages 75-86 include a brief essay by Richard Osborne titled \\"Karajan and EMI\\"(in English, German, French).<br /><br />Also, the track listing for CD 47 is incomplete - the CD opens with Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra, but the booklet is missing the Composer name/Title and the first three movements. Sloppy, sloppy production!<br /><br />To be missing this important info is really a bummer.<br /><br />Next, my set came with TWO copies of CD#56 and was MISSING CD#55. An e-mail to EMI requesting they send me a replacement CD and a complete booklet engendered a \\"sorry, but you need to contact your retailer\\" response. This is really unacceptable, because there's a good chance that my retailer is going to have a whole stack of sets with the same booklet problem (I might get lucky on the missing CD 55!), and that the retailer is going to ask me to return the whole set for replacement. That means that I will probably receive yet another defective set.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these production/packing problems serve only to reinforce EMI's reputation as being the company that makes Every Mistake Imaginable.<br /><br />On Edit: 4/20/9 - Well, I returned the original copy to [...] for a refund and reordered from Amazon.com. I'm happy to report that everything seems to be in order with the merchandise I received from Amazon. Both sets were produced in Holland, and maybe that's the reason that they are OK. I have a feeling the sets from Tower were produced by Capital in the USA.<br /><br />So, buy this set from Amazon, and you'll be OK.happy to report that everything seems to be in order with the merchandise I received from Amazon.

0312383320|5.0|Great book by Evanovich  - again or should I say as usual.  Janet Evanovich has such a great imagination and as way with words.  She  describes situations and her characters so vividly that if you close your  eyes you can almost visualize the plot as your reading.  Her characters are  always interesting and quirky. Stephanie sounds like a ditz but she really  isn't she just has a way of ending up in strange situations and then she  has to find her way out as gracefully as possible (HAHA).
B000092ZYX|5.0|If Kid A is like starring at a Rothko painting and OK Computer a Futurist landscape, than Hail to the Thief is a Munchian scream. It's a serrated strait jacket. It's a terribly bloody knife fight. It's a... well, you get the idea. For a band known for skipping across the darkness of one's mindscape, Thief was darker and more depressing than anything they've ever done (I believe the rumours that the five musicians came perilously close to calling it quits, though those rumours happen with every album). But it's also a beautiful summation of those ideas started six years previous. If OK Computer suggested a technology-fueled alienation, this is what alienation feels like. Raw, agonizing pain. What's most astonishing about this album is how physical it feels: \\"Myxomatosis\\" is the rock music equivalent of a seizure and \\"2 +2 = 5\\" is a nervous breakdown set to a terrifying falsetto. And by rock music, I mean ROCK MUSIC, because this is Radiohead's most \\"rock\\" album of their career. The guitars squall and shriek, the drums and electronic backbeat is insistent and determined. For all the press they get for their challenging missives, I love just listening to them rock out. And then, of course, there's the album closer. \\"A Wolf at the Door\\" employs a falsetto-less Thom Yorke as he chants alongside a propulsive yet uneasy beat that gradually builds. The lines that are most prominent (\\"flat on my face\\" - \\"put me inside/put me inside\\") provide much of the bruising force. While there is a desire to read a greater political meaning to the whole thing that Yorke et al have flatly refused is there, the greatest achievement of this album is how it conveys crippling emotional violence. Is it pleasant? Of course not. Is it powerful? Even for Radiohead, distinctively so.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|I've purchased all 4 Seasons on DVD, and in my opinion this one is superior to the other seasons.  There are some very cool bonus features this time around in addition to the usual gag reel, deleted scenes, on-location stuff.  I am THE MOST OBSESSED fan there can possibly be of this show.  I watch and re-watch and re-watch, etc. I think they hit their stride with this package and highly recommend it to other fans.  Has Mobisodes, a Fake Conspiracy Documentary, great piece on Michael Giacchino and the Lost music, plus an 8:15 Recap of the first three seasons on the First Episode DVD that is so very cool only in the spectacular way that Lost does cool!
1402720602|4.0|The book is very high in quality and the photography is outstanding. The price is about 1/2 of what it's worth. The only reason I'm giving it a 4 star instead of a 5 star rating is because of the drawings. Some dimensions are missing, they use a mix of metric and inches, the instructions for enlarging some of the drawings are not 100% accurate.    All of this can be overcome, with some effort. All in all this is a very good book and I hope these issues will be addressed in subsequent editions.

B001EOQWFI|5.0|I loved the movie in the theater, but seeing it at home on Blu-Ray was a totally different experience!  The detail of the surrounding backgrounds is incredible.....every time you watch it, you're looking at new and different things; it's like watching it again for the first time!  No wonder it won the Oscar for best animated film.  Definitely a must-have for your DVD....sorry, Blu-Ray collection!
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|If Hollywood remained merely the entertainment capital of the world, as it once was, vice trying so hard to be a political messenger, then \\"The Dark Knight\\" would have received an Oscar nomination for movie of the year and Christopher Nolan would have won director of the year.  In fact, let's try hard and remember than in an era where entertainment mattered enough for \\"Ben Hur\\" to win, perhaps we're short changing this movie against it earning the top Oscar!    As others have witnessed, this movie transcends the comic hero movie in the same way that \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" transcended fantasy.  It reaches a depth of emotion and reveals deep human psychology of the sociopathic mindset.  Health Ledger's performance was so powerful that not even Hollywood's misguided elite could ignore it.    But this movie offered so much more.  Nolan proves again he's a director who cares about getting facts right.  Just one example proves the point.  The movie uses what many considered a fanciful method of extracting Batman and a corrupt Chinese executive from an office high rise to a C-130 aircraft.  Some might know the recovery method was actually used.  Fewer know the actual name of that USAF mission was Operation Skyhook.  Nolan appreciates the facts enough to get them right in the movie, including such details as getting the lights on the cable and balloon accurate.  A director and producer deserves recognition for sweating such details.    Every significant character in this movie is brought to the edge and beyond, forced to surrender previously sacrosanct values to defend and endure against the mad evil of the Joker.  Several characters are destroyed by it, through actions of their own tortured cause (Harvey Dent).  Others due to external forces consuming them even as they were confused by their own saintly virtues stretched to unfathomable ends (Rachael Dawes).  These are characters you care about, not wooden and shallow, but filled with depth and tortured despair.    The Joker finds everyone's button and presses them with eager amusement.  Ledger's character is an adroit combination of psychopath and clinical psychologist!  He is a master manipulator disguised as a disfigured madman.  Batman comes perilously close to crossing the line into killer and torturer as his button is pressed.  Forgetting his sworn duty to his city, Batman sacrifices Harvey Dent to the less effective men of Gordon's crime unit because personal love means more to him at the moment.  Knowing this conflict already, the Joker lies by switching the locations, manipulating Batman into rescuing the one he values less after pressing Batman into forsaking his oath against self-fullfilling harm.    The movie is filled with such delicate yet powerful sub-plots.  Yet, Hollywood endures \\"The Dark Knight\\" as a necessary evil, something required to pay the freight to provide raw revenues needed to make the movies the Hollywood elite feel more important.    As the late Samuel Goldwyn observed, \\"If you want to send a message, use Western Union!\\"  If only Hollywood were still led by such honest entertainers who remember why it really exists.  It's not that \\"The Dark Knight\\" forgoes messages.  In fact the movie is effective because it masterfully blends transcending human traits into tight storytelling, filled with raw entertainment.  There's so much tightly packed into this movie that elements are left out of the release, which is where the bonus DVD picks up.    The finest elements of the bonus DVD are several fictional Gotham News Channel features.  These features are so well produced that it must have torn the hearts out of the movie's creators to leave them largely on the cutting room floor.  Each capture the look and feel of modern cable journalism news analysis programs.  But they go beyond and provide valuable background information only briefly alluded to in the movie.  The prime reason to purchase the bonus two-disk release is for the background these vignettes provide.    There are stories worthy of pure message telling.  \\"Schindler's List\\" is a powerful example.  But ultimately it is the story and not the message that endures.  Whether fictional storytelling like \\"The Dark Knight,\\" or gritty telling of tragic history such as \\"Schindler's List,\\" it isn't the message making that attracts people to movies.  It is the skill of the storytelling.  \\"The Dark Knight\\" is storytelling at its finest, with a perfect balance of social commentary and human introspection.  Long after the chic movies that titillate Hollywood's elite are forgotten, it will be masterpieces such as Nolan's \\"Dark Knight\\" which will endure.

He gets playful advising games to develop creativity and empathy, moving us towards the kind of skills that can't be outsourced. The challenges he covers are real and inescapable, except that it's happening so fast that Pink's correct predictions seem outdated for being made slightly before they happened.

0525951113|5.0|The jacket blurbs for DAEMON favorably compare Daniel Suarez's debut novel with the works of Tom Clancy and Michael Crichton. I would beg to differ. This book put me in the mind of the early cyberpunk work of William Gibson or, perhaps more appropriately, the final novels of Philip K. Dick --- VALIS, THE DIVINE INVASION, and THE TRANSMIGRATION OF TIMOTHY ARCHER --- which composed a loose trilogy and ultimately served as a capstone for his long and impressive bibliography. VALIS, published in 1981, was an anagram for Vast Active Living Intelligence System, which is what DAEMON deals with at its core. Those with long memories will recall the Y2K scare, which was occasioned by the theory that early computer programming codes did not take into account the turning of the century. It was believed that havoc would result; what occurs here, however, is far worse than anything that was anticipated leading up to 2000.    Suarez picks up and moves right along with the presumption that his audience has at least a rudimentary knowledge of computer programming and cyberspace. Readers who are of a certain age and station may well be served by having a 16-year-old at the ready to interpret some of what is occurring during the course of the work. However, Suarez does define the term \\"daemon\\": it's a quiet little program that runs in the background of your computer and Internet experience, transferring money, delivering e-mail and monitoring power level. Sounds mundane, almost boring, doesn't it? That is not the case, at least in this author's capable hands. What he does is extrapolate what happens when daemons are written with malevolent intent.    The \\"malevolent\\" in DAEMON is personified in Matthew Sobol, a legendary online game designer who uses the occasion of his premature death to launch his ultimate creation. When a notice of Sobol's passing is posted online, it activates a previously dormant daemon that initiates a chain reaction resulting in one death and then another. Lawenforcement personnel are just beginning to connect the two deaths and to classify them as murders when a cataclysmic event occurs that results in the horrific killings of a SWAT team and an FBI strike force. The instigator is Sobol, who from beyond the grave begins to unleash new layers of daemons that unravel a system that for the most part functions efficiently.    These acts raise a question: How does one stop a murderer who is dead, but whose plan of attack is constantly evolving in reaction to defenses against it? The answer may lie in part within an online computer game through which a reconstructed Sobol guides his carefully selected minions, planning a series of earth-shaking acts heralding not so much the destruction of the current civilization as midwifing a new one.    DAEMON is definitely a plot-driven work; it would be wise for the reader not to become too enamored with any one character, as just about everyone is potentially disposable. Indeed, there are enough explosions and destruction to satisfy even the most jaded action junkie. And while there aren't many sex scenes, there is one in particular that will cause those of similar inclinations to stop reading in order to defog their eyeballs.    This is just the beginning of Suarez's and Sobol's world. A sequel to DAEMON, titled FREEDOM, is due out in 2010, and parts of it are available online at [...] But my gut feeling is that the new world that Suarez is creating is too vast, too broad, to be contained on the canvas of two or even three books. Jump on now while you can still catch up. And hang on.        --- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub
068485743X|5.0|This book is a fantastic resource to anyone needing someone to give honest advice on how to stay out of  the rejection pile. Without going on and on, the author offers excellent examples so that his point is well understood. This book is for a more inexperienced novelist, which is likely who will purchse the book anyways.
0446401307|4.0|The Overlook is the 13th story in the Bosch series. In this one we are treated to a regular hard-boiled murder mystery being solved by a dedicated cop who does not mind doing things not exactly by the book while also getting a loaded social commentary.<br /><br />The mystery is that a physicist that handles nuclear materials is murdered in execution style and a whole lot of nuclear material (Cesium) is stolen. The threads and hints strewn all around the case point to this being an emerging terrorist attack on Los Angeles and so the FBI, and many other federal agencies jump in to get involved. Speak about internecine warfare! The FBI involvement also kicks in a special unit of the LAPD that is more of a slaptsick comedy outfit than a real police force, and also one that is more akin to the FBI in wanting to keep all the glory for itself rather than think the case through and approach things logically.<br /><br />Bosch keeps thinking that he sees a murder mystery and wants to handle this as a standard homicide and all this additional attention creates many distractions and obstacles to the case's solution.<br /><br />Bosch is also reunited with his love interest in the FBI - Rachel Walling - but it is never clear if they will work together, or at cross purposes. There is enough lying and deceit between the two of them that you wonder if they'll ever get back together again as a couple.<br /><br />Bosch is also training a rookie cop in his ways and some of the fun of this book is watching the rookie watch Bosch and draw conclusions that are different than what Bosch wants him to get.<br /><br />The action is very fast-paced and the whole story is resolved in a matter of 13 hours. The way the case breaks is somewhat hoky, but logical - although I suspect that if I researched it, I would find the science behind it as being wrong, or at least accelerated.<br /><br />This is a fun read that takes you away from the day to day cares and is great beach or airplane material!
0553807048|4.0|I'M A HUGE READER SO NATURALLY I WAS GONNA PICK UP THIS SECOND BOOK OF YOURS BEING THAT I KNEW YOU AND NADINE  BACK IN THE DAY THROUGH B AND R PORTN AND ALSO FOR THE FACT THAT HALF OF YOUR STOCKBROKERS LIVED HERE IN MY CONDO NEIGHBORHOOD IN JERICHO INCLUDING KENNY G, PAUL G. AND OTHERS LIKE ROB L. AND HOWIE AND QUITE A LOT OF OTHERS IN YOUR CAST OF CHARACTERS.     I ALSO HAD THE PLEASURE OF SEEING YOUR PERSONA FIRST HAND MANY TIMES WHILE ATTENDING SOCIAL EVENTS AT YOUR HOUSE AND ELSEWHERE. YOU WERE RUDE TO EVERYONE IN YOUR PATH TO THE POINT OF EMBARRASSMENT WITH YOUR CRAZY SENSE OF ENTITLEMENT (WAS IT ONLY THE DRUGS (EXCUSE) OR MORE THE DRUNKENESS OF POWER ITSELF?) THROWING SOUR PICKLES AT US IN SAMMY'S ROUMANIAN ONE NIGHT IN FRONT OF A CROWD OF PEOPLE BECAUSE SOME IN OUR PARTY WERE LATE, (I THINK IT WAS SCOTT'S BDAY MAY HE REST IN PEACE) WAS REALLY A HIGHLIGHT THAT I REMEMBER. WAS IT ULTIMATELY OK THOUGH BECAUSE YOU PICKED UP THE TAB FOR EVERYONE IN THE RESTAURANT?? I DON'T THINK SO.    BUT THIS REVIEW IS NOT ABOUT YOUR SOCIAL GRACES, IT'S ABOUT YOUR NEW BOOK SO HERE IS MY OPINION. THE FIRST BOOK WAS TOO RAW AND READ LIKE A PENTHOUSE ARTICLE, I'M SURE YOU WERE TOLD THAT THE PHRASE \\"LUSCIOUS LOINS\\" WAS OVERUSED AD NAUSEAM (I AM NOT A PRUDE BUT PLEASE) AND THANKFULLY YOU DID NOT REPEAT IT IN BOOK TWO. WITH  THIS BOOK HOWEVER, YOUR WRITING STYLE HAS IMPROVED TREMENDOUSLY AND COMES OFF AS A MORE PROFESSIONAL PRODUCT. IT ALMOST READS AS A FICTITIOUS WORK WHICH BY MY STANDARDS ALWAYS MAKES A MEMOIR THAT MUCH MORE INTERESTING AND WELL WRITTEN. IT SHOWCASES (JUST A LITTLE) YOUR ACTUAL SENSE OF REMORSE TOWARDS YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY BUT AT OVER 350 PAGES IN, I HAVE YET TO SEE ANY FEELINGS OF REMORSE TOWARDS THE PEOPLE YOU WERE ACTUALLY SCAMMING. YOU ARE ALSO STILL QUITE CONDESCENDING TO PEOPLE THAT TRULY CONSIDERED YOU A FRIEND WITH NASTY NICKNAMES AND ADJECTIVES WHICH MAKES ME THINK YOU HAVE NOT CHANGED ONE BIT IN YOUR ATTITUDE TOWARDS MERE MORTAL HUMANS, THERE IS THE ONESTAR KNOCKED OFF FOR INCONSIDERATE BEHAVIOR TOWARDS FORMER FRIENDS WHO WILL READ THIS BOOK.    I CANNOT BE COMPLETELY UNBIASED IN MY REVIEW AS I KNOW YOU AND TOO MANY OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THIS SORDID AFFAIR. I DO THINK YOU HAVE GREAT POTENTIAL AS A POSSIBLE FUTURE FICTION NOVELIST AND AS YOUR PERSONAL STORY COMES TO AN END, ESPECIALLY WITH THE STATE OF ECONOMY NOW AND THE FINANCIAL MESS (BERNIE MADOFF FOR EXAMPLE), YOU WILL HAVE PLENTY OF MATERIAL TO WORK WITH.    I HOPE YOUR KIDS ARE DOING WELL AND REGARDS TO NADINE. GOOD LUCK IN YOUR NEW CAREER... YOU HAVE GREAT POTENTIAL AS A WRITER.

B000B5XOSO|4.0|Many people say this is too dark. Well, to those people, GO BUY BATMAN & ROBIN! Ya don't want too!? Cuz it has a terrible plot with bad acting!? OK, then buy this.     Anyhoooooooooo.......    Batman Returns in Batman Returns. Batman has to try to stop a deformed man named Penguin who was thrown in the sewers by his parents. He blackmails a buisnessman Max Shreck to help him become Mayor. Shreck then pushes his assistant, Selina Kyle, out of a window, and then is revived by cats. She then becomes Catwoman, and now Batman has to stop another villain. Got it now? OK.    Batman: Batman is played by the amazing Michael Keaton. He is te best Batman actor yet. 1: Michael Keaton 2: Val Kilmer 3: Christian Bale 4: Geaorge Clooney. His love intrest in this film is Selina Kyle/Catwoman.    The Penguin: Yes, he is grotesque. Wait, no. Let me rephrase that. He is VERY GROTESQUE! Don't watch this movie unless you want to be grossed out by Danny DeVito's Penguin! EVen though he is horribly scary, he still makes a good Penguin, but I cant believe they made him a retard in the sewer! He should have been more like the comics Penguin.    Catwoman: Played by Michelle Pfeiffer. Tries to get revenge on Max Shreck for pushing her out of a window. It is a little cramped in the villians, with Penguin, Catwoman, and Max Shreck also plays a minor villain (I'll get to him next).     Max Shreck: played by Christopher Walken, pushes Selina Kyle out of a window and helps Penguin become the Mayor of Gotham City. He is kind of a minor villain.    Alfred the Butler: once again played by Michael Gough, helps Batman/Bruce Wayne ruin Penguin's chance to become Mayor, which leads to him trying to kill Gotham's first born sons. Oops. That was a spoiler. Oh well.    Buy this movie unless you like the campy Batman films.  If you do, buy it with Batman, Batman Forever, Batman Begins, and THE DARK KNIGHT.    And DO NOT buy this with the horrible Batman & Robin movie (See my review on it)

B0017R5UAA|2.0|Until their appearance on SNL in January of this year, it's likely your first awareness of the Fleet Foxes by word of mouth. The band's two EPs - on Sub Pop in the US and Bella Union in the UK - moved small volumes amongst indie-fans. Even the eponymously named LP - still on the same two labels as the group allegedly wants little to do with big labels - is only just getting legs. Yes, word-of-mouth - in the form of near universal critical acclaim - has led many, including this reviewer, to purchase the disc. (BTW, I - ala Lane Kim on Gilmore - purchased it after the wildly positive MOJO reviews.)<br /><br />As I walked to checkout in Best Buy, I looked more closely at the CD and thought to myself, \\"Is the cover a Breugel painting?\\"<br /><br />It was a painting by him (Pieter the Elder, to be more precise) and, assuming that all bands these days pick the cover with care, was a bit apprehensive about what I had just done to provide my own stimulation to the economy. As you can discern from the stuff I review, I tend to favor three-chord rock `n' roll. The fact that I looked to be about to listen to something far more...shall we say pastoral...left me less enthused.<br /><br />So, I elected to listen to my newly acquired Sundazed version of Grape Jam first. Now, after having listened to Fleet Foxes a few times, I'd like to share my views with you all.<br /><br />First, it is an absolutely stunning example of what the human voice is capable of producing. The soaring choral harmonies bring to mind the Beach Boys; the Abbey Road Beatles; the Bee Gees, among others.<br /><br />Second, it was difficult for me to categorize what I was hearing into a genre. At times, I felt I was listening to a form of Celtic music; Appalachian bluegrass; even madrigals.  I was also reminded of the Incredible String Band.<br /><br />Third, I found that, on repeated listens, the music was more layered and less minimalist than I had initially perceived. In that aspect, I found myself thinking of Marah.<br /><br />Fourth and finally, I felt that this music could get old quickly. Taste is a personal matter, to be sure. And, sitting in traffic during yesterday's commute, I wondered if I would want to listen to this album a month from now. And therein is one of the great keys to differentiating the so-called classic album from competitors: will you listen to it repeatedly? Does it become part of the soundtrack of your life?<br /><br />I don't think so.

B001PA0FFO|5.0|\\"Doubt\\", Father Brendan Flynn tells his congregation, \\"can be a bond as powerful and sustaining as certainty.\\"  So fitting that an engaging sermon on Doubt should begin a film so thoroughly based on it.  John Patrick Shanley's DOUBT is an engaging drama about what to do and where you go when you are uncertain and filled with, for lack of a better term, doubts.  He wrote and directed this film based on his Tony and Pulitzer Award-Winning play.  In one of the rich texts of the original play, Sister James asks Flynn if he always makes up little stories to accompany his messages.  He replies, \\"Yes.  What actually happens in life is beyond interpretation.  It tends to be confusing and have no clear conclusion.\\"  Shanley seems to agree.  In fact, he added the subtitle \\"A Parable\\" to DOUBT's title after it opened on Broadway.  He created his own little story to explain his reasoning and thoughts on that all-enveloping feeling of uncertainty and despair.  His play succeeded, and his film succeeds on many levels as well.     Meryl Streep plays Sister Aloysius, the principal of St. Nicholas Catholic School.  She rules with an iron fist, hissing and hitting students during sermons and interrupting classes to humiliate and punish kids.  When told by Sister James, adeptly played by Amy Adams, that \\"the students are all uniformly terrified of you\\", Streep replies wryly and nonchalantly: \\"That's how it works\\".  She is, at heart, a traditionalist, who loathes Father Flynn and everything he does and stands for.  When suggested that the school Christmas Pageant might include a secular song like \\"Frosty the Snowman\\" she rants on how the song inspires a pagan belief in magic and how it should be banned from the airwaves.  Trust me that \\"Frosty\\" is never mentioned again.  We know little of Sister Aloysius's past, other than she was married to a man who died in WWII.  Is her lasting grief the reason she's so bitter?  We never know, and it doesn't really matter.  That's why Shanley's character development is so unique.  He doesn't present us with life stories or background material.  We know who the characters are and what they're like now, and their attitudes and actions in the moment shape our perception of them.  We learn about them from their actions only, and we don't get motives or back-story.  Shanley doesn't psychoanalyze his characters; he presents them to us and leaves us to make of them what we will.  Aloysius is a true conservative, incorruptible and solid in her faith and methods...the true nun.  She will \\"do what needs to be done\\".    That's why she launches herself and Sister James into a campaign of suspicion against Flynn, who has taken a particular interest in the school's first African American student, Donald Muller.  Sister James comes to Aloysius with concerns: Flynn has summoned Muller to the rectory for a private meeting, and, after returning, Donald acted strangely and smelt of alcohol.  He's the alter boy.  Did he sneak some wine?  Or, as Aloysius is convinced, was he given some by Flynn?  After an initial confrontation with Flynn, Aloysius is convinced he is taking advantage of young Donald and his fervent denials are lies.  Sister James wants no part of it, but it's too late.  She's in it already.  And Sister Aloysius won't stop until Father Flynn is punished for his sin.  It's no matter that there is no proof whatsoever.  She has her certainty, and she's justified in all means she uses to bring him to justice.    Streep's personification of Aloysius is one of the best I've seen.  She completely submerges herself into the character, adapting mannerisms and speaking habits so unique and perfect you find yourself saying, this can't possibly be the woman I saw bouncing on mattresses, jumping with wild gesticulations into the ocean, and singing ABBA songs in the trailer for MAMMA MIA!   Well, it is.  That's the thing about Streep; she plays all of her roles with such cleverness and exclusivity that you can't possibly associate them closely with each other.  As Sister Aloysius she is a tsunami of acting, debating with Flynn with such forcefulness and convincing James with such smoothness and wit.  She deserved to win her Oscar nomination.    Philip Seymour Hoffman, as Flynn, can't seem to decide whether his character is in the wrong or not.  One minute he'll make Flynn's denials seem false and forced, but in some scenes, as in the last debate between him and Streep, he is so convincing that his innocence is thoroughly established in our minds.  Just as we can't decide, neither can he.  In one scene his characteristics will scream \\"I'm lying!  I've sinned!  Look no further, here I am!\\" and in some other scenes he'll make you wonder how you ever questioned his purity.  Maybe this was how he intended to play his character, but I found myself wishing he would, as an actor, decide whether Flynn was in the right or not and play the character that way.  Anyhow, his arguments with Streep, especially the last, shoot out sparks from the screen.      Amy Adams is wonderful in her role as Sister James, the nun who got herself into this mess and just wants out.  She came to Sister Aloysius with the purest of intentions, and now she is punished for it.  \\"I wish I could be like you,\\" she tells Aloysius.  \\"Because I can't sleep at night anymore.  Everything seems uncertain to me.\\" In early scenes she is radiant while teaching, a joy to the kids in her class and a joy for the audience to watch.  During a later scene in her classroom, she is overwhelmed by it all.  She becomes like Aloysius, snapping at her students and threatening punishment.  She apologizes to the class, but by the end of the film she is transformed.  She has doubts, and she's lost her joy in teaching.  She looks up to Aloysius as something to strive to and to Flynn as a mentor, and she's torn between them.  Adams, in her early scenes, reminds one of her earlier roles (one critic said that Amy Adams is \\"very good at playing dumb smart people\\"), but soon she breaks out of the mold and fleshes out her character.  Viola Davis SO deserved to win an Oscar for her brief role as Donald's mother, who wants him to complete his schooling at St. Nicholas.  \\"It's just `till June,\\" she says.  After this school, he may even have a chance at college.  She's accepting of her son's \\"nature\\" and is fine with Flynn's relationship with her boy.  \\"He has his motives,\\" she says.  \\"Everyone has their motives, you have yours.  But do I question him, when he's kind to my boy?  Never.\\"  She's heartbreaking in her only scene, as a mother who just can't do any more.  She wants the best for her son, but when will wanting the best come to something bad?  When does it get to the point where she just doesn't care anymore?    Questions, questions.  The film is full of them, and not all of them get answered.  Many will be unsatisfied with the end of the film, but I thought it was perfect.  The final line and final revelation of the film spoke oceans to me, and it further proved Shanley's talent as a writer.  He is a decent director as well, using several inventive techniques to exploit the audience's emotions.  And yes, several emotions are exploited.  This film is an intelligent, engaging drama and you won't stop thinking until way after the credits are done rolling.  Think of how many films keep you on your toes and provoke thoughts and questions still after the film is over.  I bet that list is short.      DOUBT succeeds as a very appealing and satisfying drama, that deserved all of its 5 Oscar nominations.  It forces one to look deeper than the initial suspicion and the initial revelation.  The performances are top-class and the script inspired.  The messages and feelings the story provoke are poignant and affecting...though not necessarily classified as \\"morals\\" there are many themes to the story that you would be hard pressed not to pick up.  Yes, doubt affects everyone, even the most firm.  But when does uncertainty envelopall?  How far does certainty alone carry you?  How can circumstance be enough to condemn a man or prove his innocence?  Ask yourself these questions while viewing DOUBT, but be open for your answers to change.  Don't be too certain, like Sister Aloysius, for purity can give way to corruption, and conviction can give way to doubt.

4789009637|3.0|It's a good premiere for students of Japanese and will teach you some things about the language. It's a pretty standard textbook for American schools.<br />However, while you will learn very basic Japanese from this, it won't get you much farther than that, since it's really meant to be used as a classroom supplement. I would recommend searching for another book if this isn't a required textbook for one of your classes.
0930289234|5.0|i've enjoyed my share of graphic novels over the last few years. some of my favorites are genre-breakers, like blankets, persepolis (and its sequels), and jimmy corrigan: the smartest kid on earth. to be honest, i haven't really connected with many of the graphic novels that are actually collections of serial comic books. but i thought i should read watchmen, since it's considered such a standout in the graphic novel world. so i bought it, about two or three years ago; and it's been sitting on my \\"to read\\" stack ever since.<br /><br />with the movie coming out in a week or two, i thought it would be a good time to get the thing read! so, on a recent weekend trip to mexico, and packed it along, and got through the whole thing in two days.<br /><br />it's not a speedy read, as graphic novels go -- it's fairly long, and there is so much detail on almost every page. part of the brilliance of the book, also, are the multiple layers in which the storytelling takes place. for instance, there's a minor character who sits at a newsstand regularly, reading the pirate comic book series written by a fictitious author who plays a minor role in the main story. but that story of that pirate series plays a role in telling some of the main story, through parallel inference. really, a fascinating literary device, with parallel text on panels where the main story is playing out, and occasional panels of the pirate story. regularly, the pirate comic's words actually provide inferred narration for what's taking place in the main story.<br /><br />the illustrations are seriously beyond what you see in most graphic novels. really brilliant details and coloring. and the story has lots of twists and surprises. but what's really captivating about the thing is how massively flawed all the characters are. none of the \\"super heroes\\" are superman types. even spiderman, with his teen angst and much-heralded complexity is nothing compared to the mess of these characters. a raging lunatic with a strong jack-bauer-like moral compass, a co-dependent with a sad compulsion to please, a brilliant hero who is really a villain (or some of both), an emotionally removed alien-like being who's more spock than human, neurotics, an alcoholic, a lesbian, suicidal tenancies, killers, has-beens, wannabes. you name it: this is a screwed up lot of characters who are often lonely, and don't mix well with others.<br /><br />therein lies both the strength of the story, as well as some of what i struggled with. there's a subtle utilitarian, ends-justify-the-means undercurrent to the whole book. in one sense, it's blatant -- the characters clearly believe that. but, while the book seems to try to stay neutral about whether or not this is merely the characters' perspective and justification, and not the author's perspective, gets blurry at times. i found myself, on several occasions, feeling like there was a not-so-subtle agenda of undermining any kind of theistic worldview (like christianity).<br /><br />all that doesn't mean i didn't like it - i really liked it, and am on the \\"this is brilliant\\" side in my overall assessment. but i don't think i'll let my 11 year-old son read it (he has asked, multiple times). there's also a good amount of language and sleaziness, and -- of course -- massive quantities of violence that, even though it's just a graphic novel -- is quite, well, graphic.rong jack-bauer-like moral compass, a co-dependent with a sad compulsion to please, a brilliant hero who is really a villain (or some of both), an emotionally removed alien-like being who's more spock than human, neurotics, an alcoholic, a lesbian, suicidal tenancies, killers, has-beens, wannabes. you name it: this is a screwed up lot of characters who are often lonely, and don't mix well with others.<br /><br />therein lies both the strength of the story, as well as some of what i struggled with. there's a subtle utilitarian, ends-justify-the-means undercurrent to the whole book. in one sense, it's blatant -- the characters clearly believe that. but, while the book seems to try to stay neutral about whether or not this is merely the characters' perspective and justification, and not the author's perspective, gets blurry at times. i found myself, on several occasions, feeling like there was a not-so-subtle agenda of undermining any kind of theistic worldview (like christianity).<br /><br />all that doesn't mean i didn't like it - i really liked it, and am on the \\"this is brilliant\\" side in my overall assessment. but i don't think i'll let my 11 year-old son read it (he has asked, multiple times). there's also a good amount of language and sleaziness, and -- of course -- massive quantities of violence that, even though it's just a graphic novel -- is quite, well, graphic.
0316035904|3.0|I loved When You are Engulfed in Flames and Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim. Sedaris' wit, sarcasm and ironic outlook on life, friends and family made me a fan and I am now reading his back catalog. I picked up Holidays on Ice figuring it might be a tonic to the over commercialization of the Christmas Season. I was right and I was wrong.<br /><br />The first story Santaland Diaries was exactly what I was looking for, a skewering of all the things wrong with the mad rush holiday shopping season. It was funny and witty and I knew I was in for a treat. Then I read the next story, which was Greetings to Our Friends and Family, a twisted look at the ubiquitous holiday letter, it was a little too dark and nasty for me. I moved on to Christmas Means Giving, a tale of keeping up with the neighbors that turns very grisly. Several of the stories I had read before in Flames and Corduroy, so that was a bit of a disappointment, I didn't realize all the stories weren't new.<br /><br />One of the other more memorable stories was Dinah, the Christmas Whore which was quite funny and rather touching. Of course it was a story involving David's family, where I find his humor at its best.  I also really enjoyed Jesus Saves, a hilarious story of David's French class where everyone of a different nationality tries to explain Easter.  So overall this collection was very uneven and it actually took me a month to read this very slight book, because parts of it were just too dark and a little shocking.
B001LMU182|5.0|The first few times I saw Akira were either on VHS bootlegs or in art theaters in NYC. Those copies or prints blew my mind despite any quality deficiencies they had. Eventually a new dub was released on DVD and that served as the benchmark for how best to view Akira as long as you had a great TV or a projector. Now the mark has been taken higher than ever before with this pristine crystal clear copy of one of the greatest animated films ever made. Any fan of this film will enjoy this new copy. re-buying every DVD one owns on Blu-ray is a ridiculous practice. There are some films however where this behavior is necessary to get ahold of the finest quality copy of some of the greatest and most beautiful films ever made. Akira is one such film. This copy is necessary and overdue.
B001KMB6X2|5.0|I just watched this last weekend. I found it highly entertaining. Never a dull moment and I thought the story plot was good, it had quite a bit of mystery and left wide open for a great sequel I hope to see. I watch a lot of sci-fi and this is really good. I would even venture as far to say that like Star Gate the movie this could spawn a great television series. Last 10yrs with a spinoff of 5yrs, probably not but I would love to see a spin off of this.
B001P5Q6F2|5.0|Lamb Of God are a great concussion inducing metal machine, and one of my current favorites, along with Machine Head and Meshuggah.  \\"Wrath\\" is a logical successor to \\"Sacrament\\", with another sterling production and riffs heavy enough to give you a hernia just listening to it.<br />  Plus, the guitars are getting better with time.  The playing level has improved dramatically since the \\"New American Gospel\\" days, which was more of a metalcore outing with a muddy production and virtually no lead work.  \\"Wrath\\" has come out swinging, opening with a tasteful acoustic intro that leads into the bombast we expect.<br />  What sets LOG apart is the bands' willingness to embrace the classic metal stylings but stretching the limits wherever possible.  Which leaves us with Randy Blythe.  This cookie monster grunter writes much more intelligent lyrics than most outfits, and you can understand him.  The trouble is, how long can he and other vocalists who favor the same style keep going before his vocal chords look like they were run through a tree shredder?<br />  I can't help but think that in a few years this cookie monster singers will be out of work and only able to communicate with sign language, such is the stress they put on their voices, not just in the studio but night after night on tour.  Take my advice, Mr. Blythe - you can't keep this up forever - better start singing.  Other than that, \\"Wrath\\" is a fine metal slab and will be one of the year's best.

6305428050|4.0|I firmly believe that Elisabeth Shue needs more work.  I mean, really; this girl should have a huge career right now and yet I find that half the known world doesn't even know who she is.  Her film choices scatter from inspiring to forgettable to just plain bad and I wonder just what she has to do to recapture the brilliance she showed us in 1995 when she nabbed an Oscar nomination for her staggering portrayal of a kind hearted streetwalker in `Leaving Las Vegas'.  Well, for those of us who love Shue, this little 80's classic is a surefire hit you will want to watch again and again.<br /><br />Cute, funny and sweet, `Adventures in Babysitting' is not mature fare, but it is nothing short of entertaining.<br /><br />Shue plays Chris Parker, a teenage girl smitten with her rocking boyfriend Mike.  She's more than ready for her big date (and that big kiss) when Mike blows her off last minute with some lame excuse (yeah, I said lame).  With nothing to do she accepts a job babysitting the Anderson kids for the night.  Young Sara is obsessed with Thor and Brad is, well, he's obsessed with Chris.  When Chris's best friend Brenda calls up in desperate need of some help Chris finds herself packing the kids (as well as Brad's friend Daryl) into her station wagon and venturing deep into the heart of Chicago.<br /><br />Like I said, the film isn't that smart, but it sure is a lot of fun.<br /><br />There are some truly funny and memorable sequences; from a brawl on the subway to being carjacked and even an improv sing-song; that will have you laughing and keep you interested.<br /><br />Elizabeth Shue has this genuine charm that reeks here, and even in her meatier and less `fluffy' films she still manages to draw us in with the purity of her spirit.  Here she has that in spades, and that is one reason why this movie works despite its flaws.  Both of the Anderson kids, played by Maia Brewton and Keith Coogan, are well represented; and the script nicely plays the budding (or is it) romance between Coogan and Shue.  There is nothing overly schmaltzy or saccharine about this movie.  It all has a very nonchalant character to it.  It never takes itself too seriously and so it never tries to hard to convert us or move us, and that plays to its benefit.<br /><br />With nice little turns from a very young Vincent D'Onofrio and a very funny Penelope Ann Miller (\\"Chris I'm begging you, it's really scary here. I've just seen three people shoot up, a bald Chinese lady with no pants on, and there's this old guy outside who wants his bedroom slippers!\\"), this is a film that will make you laugh, make you smile and make you just plain happy you have a working DVD player.) romance between Coogan and Shue.

B001GKJ2FM|3.0|For anyone who loves ABBA's timeless songs (including myself), it is hard to dislike \\"Mamma Mia!\\" In addition to those irresistible ABBA numbers, you've got nice locations (of the beautiful coast in Greece), plus the talented cast, veterans and newcomers. Sadly there are two things that \\"Mamma Mia!\\" doesn't have: story and direction.    Well, there is a story, but a very thin one. Three former boyfriends of Donna (Meryl Streep) travel to an old hotel Donna runs on a small island in Greece after so many years' absence. The three men (played by Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsgård and Pierce Brosnan) are in fact secretly invited by Donna's only daughter, 20-year-old Sophie (Amanda Seyfried), who is going to be married.    You will be told that far in the first ten minutes and ... that's all. The entire cast did well (OK, Pierce Brosnan needs singling lessen, I admit). Obviously they had a good time making this film and you can feel that in the end credits, but \\"Mamma Mia!\\" stops there. The characters sing and dance and it is fun to see them doing it, but their dancing and songs, or the lyrics, need to be incorporated into the story. First-time director Phyllida Lloyd (who also did the stage version) just doesn't know the rhythm of filmed musical, missing the timing of music--how to build up the emotion and when to start and stop the tunes. The songs, great as they are, begin and end rather randomly.     Great musicals like \\"Singin' in the Rain\\" have a good story to tell. You've got great songs and actors in \\"Mamma Mia!\\" but you need something more to draw the audience into the film's world. To do so \\"Mamma Mia!\\" depends upon the enthusiastic acting of the cast. You got Meryl Streep and she will not disappoint. Those who have seen such films as \\"Postcards from the Edge\\" and \\"Ironweed\\" know Meryl Streep can really sing. And she does not just sing, but bring energy to her performance and she does it again in \\"Mamma Mia!\\" Maybe too much of energy, but it is fun. With more subtlety, however, the film could have been better.
031606792X|3.0|I blew through all four books in about 10 days.  I am in my 30's, not my teens, but still a sucker for a good love story.  The writing was light and reminded me of high school when everyone is so self-absorbed and can dwell on and analyze the littlest things forever.  That perspective, and the attraction/tension among the characters Edward, Bella and Jacob are things that Meyer does well.  Obviously this is light reading - it's not trying to be on par with an Austen novel - so people who criticize it in that way are missing the point I think.    The last book sadly isn't really fulfilling.  Here are my thoughts on it:    ****SPOILER ALERT*****    1) I soooo wanted more of Bella and Edward's \\"first time\\".  Not anything risque but at least a touch!  We only got the \\"morning after\\" when she's all bruised up and then we moved right into her being pregnant.  Anyway, it was disappointing after all that build up.     2) The final \\"battle\\" was a \\"non-battle\\".  I would have taken some tragedy along with triumph there - it all ended really fast and with a big bow on it. Why not have Bella and Edward fight together to protect their family?  It'd be a great addition to Bella's transition from the helpless girl to a heroine who is her husband's equal and doesn't need him hovering over her to protect her all the time.    3) Like others, I was not a fan of Jacob imprinting on Reneesme.  It still felt very odd despite the setup.  I wanted him to finally \\"see\\" Leah which, for me, would have been a much more mature relationship and definitely less creepy.  Leah was protective of him and they had both suffered broken hearts - it would have been nice for them to find fulfillment with each other.    4) I envisioned a private and tender conversion to being a vampire - a sensual setup with Edward biting her in a tender way and then nursing her through the pain of conversion.  The way it is written, I was at least expecting a conversation about it afterwards between Bella and Edward (how concerned and worried he was, how she protects him from how much she was hurting..yada yada) but that didn't happen either.  Somehow they all just move on from that even though they dwell on so much else.    Anyway, this is all just my opinion.  It's Stephenie's story to tell and I am very grateful that she wrote it and shared it with us all.  I read a lot and no other world has absorbed me like this in a long time.  I am disappointed that someone pilfered Midnight Sun.  I really hope she is able to finish it some day and I will pay for it.  I think it's ridiculous to say she's \\"padding her coffers\\" by writing so much (other comments here on Amazon).  She has millions of fans who love her work and clamor for more and she deserves to be paid for her efforts.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Along with many others, I discovered this show as it was being cancelled. One of the biggest mistakes ever made in television! If you ever see a list of shows that were cancelled way too early, this show is either at or near the top.  Joss Whedon, the writers, directors, producers, and of course the cast came together brilliantly to bring Firefly to the screen. This is one of those Kismet moments in television. Intense action combined with well written stories and dialogue grab the viewer by the adrenal glands, the funny bone, and the heart. As different as the world of Firefly is, it retains enough of the link to our world that you can really relate and come to care about the characters.  Buy this series! Plain and simple, it is a piece of television history that you want to have in your collection.
B001L5SXQG|3.0|\\"Working on a Dream\\" is a generic Springsteen album. The E Street Band plays wonderfully. Brucey sings with his usual attitude and faux dramatics.

The pace of my moves doubled and my execution was flawless. I can only thank Lady Gagaga for that. My game stepped up on and off the court. I was dropping 40 points per in rec league games because my moves were better and I was having 40 phone numbers dropped on me because of my dance floor performance. Awesome is not even the word for it. I would go wtih Gaschlor. As good as Just Dance is, \\"Poker Face\\" is even better. I have an awesome poker face where I look like a Belgian food critic holding in a burp. I win no matter what my hand is because I am poker.    You know what? I kinda am digging the track \\"The Fame\\". Welcome to my life. The fame isn't always easy but I still execute everyday. Paparazzi is another good track I can relate to. When I go out in Gretna, all three members of the paparazzi follow me around like I have a three piece hungry man chicken dinner tied around my neck. It'a part of the Bpimp experience.    So get this CD and you 10 year relationship with average could soon end.

0743496736|4.0|I'm not going to repeat what is in most of the other more than 400 reviews of this book but I do want to address an issue I haven't seen in those other reviews.      Ms. Picoult has a strange but frustrating habit of raising a viable storyline and then letting it just die.  Several times in Nineteen Minutes, she raised the distressing real-life fact of dating abuse between Matt and Josie.  Some of Ms. Picoult's many hints include Matt's verbal put-downs of Josie, his not-so-subtle subtle accusation of her being overweight, his jealousy when she talked to another boy at a party, his frequent warnings that she could never leave him because he loved her so, Josie telling Peter that her leg was in a cast because Matt hit her and knocked her down, the time when Matt raped Josie and didn't use protection against pregnancy, and more.  Picoult must have had a valid reason for writing these scenes and yet each reference was single and she never even mentioned them again, let alone tied them together.      When I got towards her trademark surprise-twist ending, I was certain that was where all these scenes would come together but they never did.  Why, when Josie admitted everything else, did she never tell anyone about Matt's abuse?  Why couldn't it have been used as a  valid defense?  This type of dating abuse is disturbingly common in real life and yet so few teenagers know anything about it.  They think actions such as Matt's are proof that a boy really and truly loves them when, in actuality, those actions have nothing to do with real love at all.  They are forms of abuse, pure and simple!  Teenagers MUST be taught about this before they marry their abusers and end up in domestic violence shelters if they're lucky, or dead if they're not.  This is where it all begins.    In most other ways, Nineteen Minutes dealt with the issues of bullying and school violence far better than even some non-fiction books I've read on the subject.  But -- What a waste of a strong opportunity for Picoult to reach her young readers who may very well be in similar dating situations.  My disappointment abounds.
0765350386|4.0|In reading the synopsis of this book it didn't sound very interesting to me. The sample chapter also didn't really sell me on this book. The whole burning metal thing seemed to be a stretch. Because of Amazons four for three deal and the fact that I really enjoyed Elantris by Sanderson I gave this book a try. I must say that I found the whole magic system interesting and I was really glad that I bought this book. The only bad thing is due to my lack of confidence I now have to wait for book two to show up to continue the story. I hope you give this a chance too. It really is an enjoyable read.

B0007939NO|3.0|A town called Brigadoon appears in a remote area in Scottland once every one hundred years. A resident prayed for a miracle, to isolate his beloved hometown from the evils of the world, so they appear and disappear without becoming affected by the outside world. The consequence is that no one can leave its gates. When two travelers (Gene Kelly, Van Johnson) stumble upon the town, they are baffled by its quaintness, but one soon falls in love with a local girl (Cyd Charisse). Can he decide between his modern life in New York and the love of his life?<br /><br />A cool idea is ruined by bad direction. Vincente Minnelli uses hardly any close-ups to illustrate that his two main characters are falling in love; they're both beautiful so why not show their faces? The long shots display the large crowds well, but it seems stagy and far from intimate. It would be understandable if the scenery was beautiful, but the painted backdrops are painfully obvious. What separates the film from the stage show? Not much. A few songs are cut because they were considered to be too risque at the time, although some of Johnson's sharper lines were retained. (\\"Oh we have [witches]. We pronounce it differently.\\")<br /><br />The only two memorable songs are \\"Go Home to Bonnie Jean\\" and \\"Almost Like Falling in Love.\\" However, the stagings aren't all that impressive. \\"Bonnie Jean\\" does have an interesting dance break with Kelly and Johnson together. They're polar opposites; Kelly is graceful and compact while Johnson is clunky and showy. They work well off of each other and provide the best of both worlds.

B00005NWM3|2.0|Most of the time I listen to a singer or group a few times, buy an album, and then can form my opinions right there.  Nickelback took me a while.  They have a lot of great radio hits, they're as vanilla-mainstream as Microsoft and Blockbuster Video (maybe even more so given how much BV is struggling), and they're both loved and hated to a ridiculous extent.  I couldn't see any reason not to get one of their albums, so I got one. (Don't remember why I chose Silver Side Up in particular; all I know was that it sounded more promising than their debut.)<br /><br />It wasn't until listening all the way through (several times, mainly because I kept tuning out...red flag right there) that I realized the problem.  You ready?  Here it is:<br /><br />They're just not an album band.<br /><br />They have the creativity and talent for big, even huge singles (Someday and If Everyone Cared are fantastic), but that's about it, and as a result each album has a *lot* of filler.  There is some merit to the frequent complaint that \\"everything they do sounds the same\\", as they're not capable of much more than making slight tweaks to what worked.<br /><br />I count no less than four filler tracks in Silver Side Up: Hangnail, Hollywood, Money Bought, and Too Bad.  Additionally, Where Do I Hide and Woke Up This Morning are virtually interchanagable.  And Never Again deserves special mention for being about a very serious subject (domestic violence) that sounds like it was composed by a 5th grader.  Seriously, haphazardly jumping between two incredibly repetitive stanzas does *not* belong in a commercially released album.<br /><br />Get How You Remind Me and ditch the rest of this joyless exercise.

Caught in an accelerating tempest of secrecy and lies, Susan Fletcher battles to save the agency she believes in.  Betrayed on all sides, she finds herself fighting not only for her country but also for her life, and in the end, for the man she loves\\".      My Thoughts:      I absolutely loved this book!  Despite the fact that it lacks the religious intrigue found in the \\"Da Vinci Code\\" and \\"Angels and Demons\\"; \\"Digital Fortress\\" is a high energy techno-thriller that maintains Dan Brown as the king of page turners. \\"Digital Fortress\\" explores information age terrorism, and presents the question to readers:  \\"Do national security efforts end up costing individual's their privacy\\"?  Taken inside one of our government's most powerful agencies: The National Security Agency (NSA), readers are introduced to TRANSLTR: a super computer that is able to intercept and decode terrorist and private citizen email communications.   While there are many within the NSA who believe that this machine serves as the ultimate protection against terrorist attacks; there are others like Ensei Tankado (a former NSA agent) who feel that the machine violates individual privacy rights.  To show his opposition, Tankado creates an unbreakable algorithm called Digital Fortress that completely incapacitates the machine, and which could permanently cripple the NSA.   As characteristic of Dan Brown novels, the action starts in the first chapter as the creator of Digital Fortress and holder of its' code is murdered in Seville.  From that moment on, the reader is taken on an adventure into a world where things are not always what they seem.  As usual, the most intriguing thing about the novel is that Brown uses factual information as the foundation for this remarkable story.  He mentions a quiet thank you to \\"the two faceless ex-NSA cryptographers who made invaluable contributions via anonymous remailers\\".  \\"Digital Fortress\\" like other Brown novels, generates an uneasy feeling within the reader that I found to be truly addictive. This novel kept me guessing until the very end.  It is definitely a MUST READ!

0446310786|4.0|Really, history texts are \\"more entertaining\\" than this book?    Now this reviewer has something that can be used as a good talking point about the book \\"To Kill a Mockingbird,\\" but rather than saying it-he/she would rather bury their point in sarcasm. As many of you know, students have trouble learning by reading only textbooks. It's safe to say, textbooks can be dry, fact-laden, and lack the appeal necessary to engage a student who finds flipping their pencil around more interesting. Given the sarcasm, this reviewer knows that history books are generally considered \\"not entertaining\\" and uses a tongue-and-cheek approach to say that Lee's \\"To Kill a Mocking Bird\\" is less entertaining than what is already established as `low entertainment.'    My question is why? Why not say what you mean? Why the sarcasm? Why not suggest a resource or piece of fiction that portrays history better? But perhaps this reviewer can't. Perhaps their sarcasm is a tactic to hide their misreading of an important piece of literature.    Yes, Harper Lee's book does contain stereotypes, but let's take it further. Let's see Lee's book as a spring board to question the use of stereotypes at all?    Instead of dismissing a novel written in the late 50's (published in 1960) along side a late 70's television show (Goodtimes aired between 1974-1979), why not use this to question the case a television show duplicated the same stereotypes of a book twenty years its predecessor? Or how is it that such stereotypes are still used in fiction and film in our current times? This reviewer dismisses a book like \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" rather that seeing that it can be used to talk about the human condition (no matter how unfortunate this condition may be) that things outside individual perceptions are generalized and used, (often commercialized) that then perpetuate the misunderstanding of others to the demise of everyone, but in particular to minorities?    This reviewer writes that \\"Simply put, this is a novel about racism written for people who received their knowledge about racism from this book!\\" What I think this person wants to say is that instead of standing against racism, this book serves to perpetuate it. But how can this reviewer not take in consideration the time period in which the book was written (which was the same decade Lucile Ball could not say the word \\"pregnant\\" on television). But this reviewer fails to recognize that this book does not only show us prejudice thinking but calls it to question and provides us with the opportunity to talk about it. And this dialogue begins from where the book starts-from the point of view of children.    So reviewer, how is this book an \\"insult to intelligent readers\\" when readers you speak of sit some 50 years after its making? Isn't this book history itself? If you peal back its coming of age story, we get a first hand look at what at the time (as sad it as it maybe to us now) were controversial ideas? The situation where a man can be guilty simply because of the color of his skin puts to question how these notions have been embedded in our culture. This can be used to start a dialogue of how far we have or have not come. Instead of judging it, let's learn from it and put our contemporary egos aside to look at what is between the lines in this text.    For example, this reviewer calls to attention that the stereotypical use of minorities being saved by \\"archetypal\\" \\"perfect\\" white man and calls it a fault of the book. But isn't the fault of prejudice times the book is set in? Could Lee have created an African American lawyer character to do the saving of an innocent African American man on trial during the 50's? Sadly, no. Lee was using examples of what were available at the time to bring to question how others are condemned because of something as arbitrary as the color of a person's skin.    This is our shared history. I am not proud of it, but it is where we have evolved from. But when I read a review like thisone I question that very evolution. We have the privilege of being somewhere else in time, we know better. Should they have known better then? I say \\"yes,\\" because I live now. Did others at the time see what we see now? Sure, there have been people throughout history who have fought to the point of loss of life for the equality of all. Those people were visionaries. Lee in writing \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" does represent a piece of that visionary notion that says, \\"There is something wrong with condemning a person not by their actions but by who they are that others do not know.\\" You seem say how dare she call this to question by using stereotypes? When really there wasn't enough integration of people to see differently. Going by the publication history of this book, people where finally coming around to question how they believed.    So yes, this book contains the dangerous notions that have been used to justify not only supremacy but also hate and horrible crimes against others. But it also exposes the idea of how tyrannical popular belief can be. Use extreme care when relegating a book of this magnitude to the pile of the unreadable because you can't get over the time period in which it represents. To say something is racists when it shows racism is to dangerously stop the conversation that such literature brings.    So let's use the luxury of being forward in time (and it is a luxury as those who will be 50 years a head of us will have), we can peer into the systems at work in this book, and learn to not repeat the mistakes. Use it to question our notion of humanity by what others had to endure.    As Scout in the novel says, \\"when you really see them,\\" I think this reviewer failed to \\"really\\" see Harper Lee and this book. He/she claims to be an intelligent reader, but somehow does not understand that time-stamped literature show us ourselves and sometimes (dear, I say often) that side of us is not a pleasant one. Let's question the book, not dismiss it as something that perpetuates it unless it is in the hands of a person who chooses to use it as a perpetuation. Because in actuality, it's the times we stand juxtaposed against not the literary products thereof.    Classical literature helps us do this by getting inside, seeing the composite faces and lives of who they were.    So please drop the sarcasm and say what you mean. Then a great conversation and learning, learning about who we are-where we've been and where we're going-can really begin.
B001HVZO9S|4.0|Drumline is one of my favorite movies. I love music and bands and it has both. Anyway, the special edition blu-ray is ok. They just added the deleted scenes back in the movie. I have been the movie a few times already and it was a little different seeing them back in. I guess that is why it is a special edition. At least at the end (sorry if you haven't seen it), when aj and free say the bands will perform 2 drum battles, the special edition shows 3, kinda confusing, oh well, they were still good anyway. I recommend. The blu-ray edition brings out the picture and sound even more like any blu-ray would.

B001DCQIAU|4.0|This set will be attractive to those starting a collection as it is outstanding value at less than $US100 for the whole package.  It is a fantastic overview of Karajan's recording accomplishments and these performances, for the most part, are highly recommended.    However experiemced collectors who are interested in Karajan's performances will already have many of these recordings in other issues, and it is a great shame that Universal chose to overlook the opportunity to remaster these great recordings.   I personally would have been prepared to pay more if the recordings had been facelifted and so therefor can only award four stars for this pack as some of these recordings have not been transferred well.

0810970686|5.0|Greg Heffley stars in another round of journal entries illustrated with hysterically deadpan comics. He starts his year off, as many of us do, with a list of resolutions. But the thing is, Greg knows he's pretty near perfect just the way he is. So he decides he'll make resolutions for all those flawed people around him, starting with his mother and her noisy potato chip chomping. He's also keeping a watchful eye on his family's personal resolutions, such as his father's diet. Greg points out to him that sneaking brownies in the garage isn't exactly sticking to this resolution. Somehow, the family doesn't seem all that pleased with Greg's helpfulness.    Greg ponders how his Christmas presents were a total bust: \\"I guess once you're in middle school, grown-ups decide you're too old for toys or anything that's actually fun.\\" Out of his gifts of mostly clothes and books, he scored a \\"Math is Rad\\" volume and a glorified laundry basket disguised as a basketball hoop. When he points out that he doesn't do laundry or even put it in a hamper because Mom crawls around on the floor gathering his dirty clothes, his mother informs him that from now on he'll be doing his own laundry. Now Greg is kind of glad he has so many new clothes, because his goal is to make it to summer vacation without washing one garment.    Little brother Manny is allowed to get up out of bed past his bedtime to join the family watching TV. This burns Greg up because with Manny present, he can't look at the shows he loves. Greg remembers how his father kept him from getting up at night --- by using the rather scary author photo of Shel Silverstein as a boogeyman threat: \\"If you get out of bed...you'll probably run into Shel Silverstein in the hallway.\\" Of course, Manny doesn't have Shel Silverstein books. Manny gets such simplified picture books that Greg is inspired to write one himself, because after all, the only thing a successful storybook needs is a character with a memorable name who will learn alesson. Thus Greg's masterpiece, \\"Wise Up, Mr. Shropsharp!\\", is created.    Greg's wimpy ways are being challenged by his dad, and this proves to be a huge problem for him. He lands on the soccer team, where he doesn't exactly shine (when he brags about being chosen as a \\"shag,\\" he finds out that's the name for the kid who retrieves out-of-bound balls). What could be worse than soccer? Greg finds out when his father says those two dreaded words: \\"military academy.\\" Gulp!    Jeff Kinney is dead on with his details about life as a middle school kid. It all rings so true: Manny's obsession with his binkie and his blankie; the amazing abilities of parents to humiliate; creative ways with term papers; Greg's relationships with his big/little brother and his best friend; and much more. The author adds the zaniest scenes (including a particularly unforgettable one set at the neighbor baby's \\"half birthday\\" party), a few unexpected plot twists and a plethora of Greg-centric comments on life.    I love funny books, but when reading them I rarely (externally) even crack a smile. However, I literally guffawed several times while reading THE LAST STRAW. In fact, I dare anyone to read it without laughing out loud. I don't recommend this title only for kids; adults who haven't read the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series are missing out on a hilariously good time.        --- Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon
B0016MJ6HY|3.0|My Blueberry Nights is like a short story, but, to make a short story long, the characters come alive and the story gets longer. Indeed, it was based on an earlier short film by Chinese Director Kar Wai Wong. Maybe he should be called Kar Wai (so) Wong? It was just a short story's worth of film stretched out to 89 minutes. But actually, if you can get through it without falling asleep, it is pretty good. Kar Wai Wong likes to work without a specific script and he relies on his actors to flesh it out with improvisation.<br /><br />Since singer Norah Jones is no doubt familiar with improv, he chose her as the lead actress. She doesn't seem like such a great actor, but the role didn't call for much range. She is just sad and hopeful that some guy she met will come back, but you know nothing about him, and little else is revealed about her. She goes to a caf&eacute; and leaves some keys in a jar, and tells the caf&eacute; owner, Jeremy (Jude Law) to return them if he sees him again. She returns numerous times to the caf&eacute;, hoping for word about her man, but she also returns for the blueberry pie and conversation.<br /><br />=====================<br />Elizabeth: So what's wrong with the Blueberry Pie?<br />Jeremy: There's nothing wrong with the Blueberry Pie, just people make other choices. You can't blame the Blueberry Pie, it's just... no one wants it.<br />Elizabeth: Wait! I want a piece.<br />------------------------------<br /><br />It seems, however, that she is not the only one with keys in the jar, as Jeremy also does. So wrapped up is she in missing her man that she scarcely notices Jeremy, even as she derives tremendous comfort from the blueberry pie and the conversation. Eating blueberry pie and crying, one night she cries herself to sleep. There is vanilla ice cream on her lips, and then later there is none. Did Jeremy kiss her while she slept?<br /><br />Elizabeth takes off on a journey of self discovery that leads her West from New York, first to Memphis, where she meets a policeman (David Strathairn) also broken hearted for his young wife Sue Lynne (Rachel Weisz). Their story is a little film-within-a-film, and it's a short story that really works.<br /><br />Next she heads out to Vegas, or more like a small town that has a casino or two--a small town outside of Vegas. Baker? Harumph? No, not Harumph. While working as a waitress, she meets Leslie (Natalie Portman), a gambler with daddy issues. She needs a stake to get back in the game, and offers Lizzie either her car, an expensive Jag, or a third of her winnings if she comes out ahead. It seems like Leslie did not win. Leslie says that she will give her the car, but she needs a ride first. While on the road the hospital calls and says her father wants to talk to her, that he might be dying. For some reason not fully explained, she hates her father. He is a gambler and taught her how to play cards. He used to brag to his cronies that she thought that Jack came after ten.<br /><br />==========<br />Leslie: Sometimes your rhythm's off, you read the person right but still do the wrong thing.<br />Lizzie: Because you trust them?<br />Leslie: Because you can't even trust yourself.<br />------------------<br /><br />Natalie does pretty well, but I've seen her do much better. Though she was having a bad hair day, there is a lot of chemistry between Lizzie and Leslie (not THAT much chemistry. Get your mind out of the gutter. Still, who came up with these names?). They just look like they are having a lot of fun together, two girls on the road.<br /><br />All the while, Lizzie keeps sending postcards to Jeremy. He realizes that he misses her, maybe he loves her. The postcards never include a return address, but he calls and sends out cards to every caf&eacute; and diner in the towns her cards are sent from hoping the shotgun approach will find her.<br /><br />Anyway, you get the idea. There are a lot of Norah haters out there, but she did OK. Kar Wai Wong really wantedher, and he built the movie around her. Her character wasn't a musician, and her dream, besides getting another slice of that blueberry pie, was just to buy a car. By making her character a mere waitress, they kind of left out the most interesting thing about her. I think that Norah Jones herself would make a better subject for a movie, and she could play herself. In it, a young girl sweeps The Grammies with a subtle blend of jazz and country, and backstage, for the first time, she meets her father, also a musician from India. Someone wanted to make that movie, but both father and daughter quashed it. Talk about daddy issues.<br /><br />Norah wrote one song for the film, and Cat Power, also in a small part, did another. Other music was by Ry Cooder. My Blueberry Nights had very lush cinematography by Darius Khondji, with lots of night shots and neon lights. It was a subtle and nuanced film that didn't give in to cynicism. I wish I could give it more than 3 stars, but it was Norah's first film, and Kar Wai Wong's first film in English, so it was a good first try.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000FS9FCG V for Vendetta (Widescreen Edition)]] (2005) ....

B00006HAZG|5.0|Part 1 is fine, but...hang the expense...remake the second part starting from when Daniel Radcliffe gives way to that other fellow.  Of course, all the voice-over narration will have to be redone by him, too.  This should be done within the next several years while Daniel is the right age for the young adult David Copperfield.  So, the older actors will be 10-15 years older than when the earlier scenes were filmed?  Save on aging makeup, and anyone who can do plays over and over can do a movie twice.  The younger actors will have aged same as Daniel.  They were great; bring 'em back to reprise their roles.  They will look more like their younger selves than some other person.  Recreate the sets if necessary/possible, and no doubt the costumes still exist?  If something can't be recreated, rewrite the scenes as necessary, or digital alteration does wonders to delete anyone and insert Daniel into scenes he wasn't originally in.    IT'S A MOVEMENT!  LET'S SPREAD IT STARTING HERE AND NOW!    The movie is beautifully done and near-perfect in capturing at least an essence of the book, though of course it can never fully measure up to the book.  For those complaining it was too short, agreed, in some ways it was a skeletonized version of the book.  Perhaps unused footage featuring young Daniel could be rescued from a cutting-room vault, and a more detailed script featuring adult Daniel could expand the film to two or three times the length and do better justice to the story.    Now, for technical details.  Is anyone else's DVD picture vertically scrunched (elongated)?  Is there any way this can be fixed so this particular DVD plays right without messing up the TV picture for everything else?  Thanks for any help on this.

I like how they kept the Bond \\"feel\\" but moved along with the times, and technology.  Its got awesome locations, and a pretty interesting story line.  Its always a good thing when previous movie content is mentioned.  I like how they touched on the ending of Casino Royale, and played off of it for certain things but not the full point of the movie!<br /><br />Daniel Craig in my opinion shines, and has been my favorite bond up to this point.  Hes just got that seriousness about him but at the same time shows his softer side at the right moments.  All in all the characters in this movie are very well done!<br /><br />I will definitely be purchasing this movie on Blu Ray, and I look forward to the release!  If your a bond fan at all, you will enjoy this movie!
0307455874|4.0|Obama's book \\"The Audacity of Hope\\" is a refreshing change in politician's books. I read this before the election and again a couple of months after, and still find it a good read. The book is good content wise because it is very readable while at the same time mindful and intelligent. While the book is written as something many U.S. adults would be able to read, the content does not appear top be sold short.     But this book is imprtant for another reason: this book changes the idea of hope; after years of hope being the politicians way to get people to chase the golden carrot, a desperate need always within sight, always out of reach, Obama removes the bitter taste of believing things can get better.  His book reveals truth afer truth, constantly with attempts to explore the world not as a division of Democrat and Republican, but as both American and world citizen, with a responsibility and a love that is beyond compare.    Those two possibilities melted into one: loving responsibility is what makes Obama's book, and his work, so compelling; life in goodwill with good outcomes is not only plausible, it is here for us to take responsibility to obtain. Impressive. Read it; if for no other reason then to know the choices he has made for his Cabinet have been built on carefully laid foundations that we are one together.
1439102813|5.0|This is by far one of the best books I've read in years.  Not once did I want to put it down, and I don't believe I've ever felt the need to shed tears while reading any work of fiction, the way I did with STILL ALICE.  Lisa Genova has done a fabulous job with showing just how serious and how devastating Alzheimer's Disease actually is and also how hearbreaking it can be for the person who is stricken with it as well as how it affects their loved ones.  I'm not sure most people are even aware that anyone can be diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's by age fifty or that they can also have symptoms in their thirties and forties, so this novel was not only a very enjoyable read, it was also extremely informative.  The story was absolutely wonderful, and I certainly look forward to reading more work by Ms. Genova in the future.
0385340990|5.0|I downloaded this book from Audible.com. I think this is a book that lends itself well to listening. It is performed by 4-5 actors. With their charming English and French accents, the tale becomes alive in a way that I don't think it can by just reading (although I am not an expert on audiobooks...this is only my 5th one). I had the hardcover book in my hand several times, and for whatever reason, I resisted picking it up. And I am so glad that I did. This is such a lovely book, so well read. I am actually on my third way though it....not so much because it is that compelling of a read, but it IS so well performed. I highly recommend it to anyone who continues to be interested in WWII but doesn't want too heavy of a story. It is told through letter, notes and telegrams. It is a completely charming listen. I laughed several times and cried at least once. This is  unique take on a seldom-talked of part of the War on the European continent. After reading many reviews of people who enjoyed reading the paper copy, but I wanted to address the possibility of listening to it. It's easy, because it is broken up into short sections and read by a great cast. It reminded me of being a kid at public library readings, entranced by a good voice, well performed. It's like an audible play...and who doesn't enjoy being read to? I might not recommend listening to complex, great literature as listening to a book is more passive than reading it yourself. A lovely treat, suitable for anyone over the age of 13...but if you are an adult, please treat yourself to this rich entertainment.
B001DTUTU8|4.0|I did not have especially high hopes for this movie as it did not get a ton of press and did not play at theaters for very long. Yet, the movie was quite funny. The humor was very well placed and our whole family thoroughly enjoyed famiy movie night. We could certainly use more films of this caliber!
B001P9KR8U|4.0|Spoiler alert, first of all...<br /><br />I feel that this is a worthwhile film that has some beautiful moments, especially in the first 45 minutes or so. That said, while it seemed at first that Slumdog might actually live up to the enormous hype, things started getting a bit silly when the boys reached Agra. Having spent several months in India over the course of two trips, the Taj scenes were unrealistic at best and I was never really hypnotized by the film again after that. Security is very tight at the Taj and street urchins operating a stolen shoe ring simply wouldn't happen as you don't take your shoes off until you're well past the military style checkpoint that \\"slumdogs\\" would never be able to pass. This in itself didn't ruin the film or anything, but starting with those scenes my suspension of disbelief generally faltered and the whole thing began to feel somewhat contrived. I suppose the writer's desire to plug in the trusty old \\"rags to riches\\" story was probably the main reason for this as VERY FEW Indian street kids ever climb the social ladder. I feel that Jamal losing out on the money but finally rescuing the girl would have made for a more realistic (and artistically apropos) ending. Concerning Jamal, I also failed to see any physical resemblance between the adult version and the two younger ones. Actually, Dev Patel has a significantly lighter complexion than any of the actors who played Salim, Latika, or the younger Jamal.<br /><br />Ultimately, it seems to me that the gaggle of Oscars might actually damage Slumdog's reception somewhat as they inevitably lead one to believe that this is a once in a generation type of film. Simply put, it's not. For my money, City of God was a better executed film about street kids and Born into Brothels (while a documentary) was a superior chronicle of the Indian variety. Oh well. Slumdog is still worth seeing, it's just not quite worthy of the hype. 3.5 stars
B000001GQY|5.0|I own the Curzon, Gilels, Katchen, and Kovacevich for the 1st Concerto. Katchen was my first and remains my one true love for this concerto, with Monteux providing the perfect backdrop. The Gilels falls to second place due to the slowness of the first two movements, which to my sensibilities detract from the artistic merit. The Katchen piano sound is bigger and the performance is closely mic'd, both of which add to my enjoyment. IMO, Curzon ruins the masterful Szell interpretation of this concerto with his incessant audible humming. Szell pulls off the perfect dramatic opening, so if you are more tolerant of humming pianists than I am, it is also worth owning. The Kovacevich is sweet and romantic, but the distant audience perspective of the recording, coupled with Sawallisch's over sweet interpretation (e.g. violin vibrato) place it fourth in this group in my esteem.    For the 2nd Concerto, I have additionally Gilels/Reiner, Katchen, and Peter Serkin performances. I recommend most highly this Gilels/Jochum performance from my small group. IMO, the 2nd Concerto is the main reason for owning this set, and it is one of the finest recordings I own. My first love for this concerto was Gilels/Reiner, but I now find that performance too brisk, dry, and analytic in conception, the sound quality does not compare well, and Gilels' phrasing is sometimes choppier than the fluid performance he gives with Jochum. I was prepared not to like Jochum, the great Brucknerian, handling my Brahms, but it seems Brahms is in very good hands here. Again tempi are on the slow side, but I never have the urge to get out and push. I like expansive readings of Brahms' orchestral works if the pacing seems well-conceived, as it does here. The Katchen and Serkin performances are fine, but in light of the quality of this performance, nothing else need be said. Get this one.

B000024ZYP|5.0|This was my first exposure to the music of Anouar Brahem. I now am a rabid fan and possess at least five of his CDs. I will eventually own them all. All are highly listenable. He is a superb oud player steeped in the tradition but often strays into international waters with his unique compositional approach.<br /><br />With jazz masters Dave Holland and John Surman rounding out the trio, Thimar is perhaps Brahem's most jazz inflected CD to date and it is a winner. The instrumentation of acoustic bass, sax and soulful oud are a perfect combination, The tunes, mostly written by Brahem are little tone poems that turn out to be supple vehicles for improvisation. With three strong players such as these, the results are spectacular. Although I love every track, the title track, penned by Dave Holland is my favorite. It is the most energetic and playful track on the CD and really shows the degree of virtuosity this trio can deploy. Thimar is an album to play over and over. It is not to be missed. I consider it to be a desert island recording and one of the crown jewels of the ECM catalog.<br /> .

B001P5Q6FC|4.0|Lamb of God is back with another solid offering that is sure to please metal fans across the board.  Did they beat their previous release Sacrament?  Not in my opinion.  But there is surely enough here to be satisfied about.  I am a big Pantera fan, which is part of why I like Lamb of God.  You may notice some similarities.  That is a good thing.  But know that Lamb of God is not a copycat band.  They keep the energy up throughout, and their thrashyness will enhance your headbanging sessions.  Plenty of good riffs here to enjoy, and the heaviness is unquestionable.  If you are a fan of Lamb of God, or most other forms of metal for that matter, you really can't go wrong with this release.

B000NQRR1Q|5.0|Extremely well done ... poorly marketed . If your a fan of this magnificent Cult Classic you will understand exactly what I mean . Those who don't \\"get\\" Ninth Gate have a problem understanding its understated and elegant arrival because they were looking for some kind of American style Gore-fest or at the very least some kind of Exorcist type film . Ninth Gate is, of course, none of those things - what it is can best be described as European, tastefully accomplished Occult Theatre and an example of true Roman Polanski . Ninth Gate is the perfect Movie for a rainy night next to the fireplace - it is not, however, the perfect movie for anyone with the mindset of a thirteen year old looking for gore and a quick thrill . As anyone who is a fan of this wonderful picture can attest it makes me wonder if there will ever be a sequel and if there is who will direct it ? Ninth gate is a timeless Cult Classic and certainly one of my favourites .
B000W91RUG|5.0|\\"Frasier\\", arguably the greatest sitcom of all time and known widely as the most intelligent, sadly came to an end in 2004. Dedicated fans of the sitcom were sat wondering what to do next. Myself alike, we simply didn't know what to do with ourselves, we searched frantically for an equally intelligent sitcom alternative which simply didn't exist. Some of us suffered withdrawal symptoms and eventually got over them, while others simply withered away and died whilst huddling in a corner rocking back and forth waiting for \\"Frasier\\" to come back. He never did.<br /><br />Three years later and Chuck Lorre finally came to the rescue and brought us the utterly fantastic \\"Big Bang Theory.\\" No, not the theory of the beginning of the universe and everything in it, but rather the most fantastically amusing and intelligent situational comedy to grace our screens since the equally fantastic \\"Frasier.\\" It's a show much like Frasier that doesn't seek to just pop out one gag at a time, much like a stand up comedy performance, more rather it will create a genuinely hysterical situation from the simplest of things. It is made this amusing thanks to the fantastic writing, acting and non-patronising tone of the whole thing.<br /><br />The show is primarily based around four super intelligent stereotypical nerds and their blonde bimbo neighbour played by the wonderful Kaley Cuoco. The four nerds are the closest of friends and comprise of Sheldon played by Jim Parsons, Leonard played by Johnny Galecki, Howard played by Simon Helberg and Rajesh played by Kunal Nayyar. Each character has their own fantastic quirks that makes them individually a quality addition to the whole ensemble. Specifically Sheldon who is the genuine super genius of the group that contains not an ounce of modesty about his intelligence or his work. Parsons presents an almost seemless character that exhibits the general unease in modern society that you would expect from someone of such an academic nature, yet amongst his peers  exhumes a confidence that portrays an obvious annoyance amongst his room mate and closest friends.<br /><br />Looking at the general synopsis of the show you would be forgiven for thinking that it's a simple \\"boy meets girl, boy likes girl, but girl is too good for boy, but boy doesn't realise it so keeps chasing her.\\" Throughout a lot of the first season this is definitely portrayed, but it done in such a subtle way that it avoids the annoyance that would no doubt make it a cliche.  This is more about the intelligent banter between the two main friends of the four, Sheldon and Leonard. Leonard is the more down to Earth character, and although a bit of an outcast in his own right, feels the embarassment that such heightened levels of intelligence and geekyness that he possesses which Sheldon seems to look past.<br /><br />Much like \\"Frasier\\", this presents an extremely intelligent cast and some genuinely good acting along with presenting the prolongued fish out of water idea rather than weekly random situation that would create a string of gags. The acting within is superb and although the characters may seem quite transparent, there's the potential to have much more depth revealed from within. Kaley Cuoco is the unlikely candidate for this as although the last time I personally saw her was playing generally the same type of character in \\"8 Simple Rules\\", she expresses genuine potential of a great actress and she displayed her great acting skills in the scenes of \\"8 Simple Rules\\" following the untimely death of the legend John Ritter. Although that may have been fueled by genuine emotion, she delivered her lines with the same confidence and prowess we had become used to whilst playing to the Daughter who lost her Father story.<br /><br />If we get some emotional scenes, then I expect her to be on the front lines of acting within them. Other than the want of some genuine emotion, there's nothing negative I can say about this show. Throughout it uses a genuinely intelligent script that doesn't patronise the viewer by trying to explain everything they're talking about, or presenting a \\"moral of the story is...\\" angle to each episode. It gets a strong recommendation and I have to ask that if you haven't seen it already, then the question has to be asked. What the hell have you been doing with yourself?atronise the viewer by trying to explain everything they're talking about, or presenting a \\"moral of the story is...\\" angle to each episode.

0316017922|3.0|Malcolm Gladwell is the latest literary thrill, a NEW YORKER staff writer. OUTLIERS studies the effects of statistics and the environments in which those statistics occur. He writes persuasively<br />--a competent wordsmith who picks the data he uses with care.<br />As one example, he cites children selected for school years based on birth date. He shows that `older' (i.e. born early in the school year) athletes are more likely to succeed than `younger' (i.e. born late). Older students are bigger and stronger, do better athletically, get selected for extra training, go on to great careers. That centuries-old problem has afflicted students everywhere birth date is used as a criterion for acceptance.<br />His arguments run out of steam when he turns to his own family background in Jamaica. What he describes has to do with ageless, timeless human spirit and hope, little to do with the `outlier' effect--the person whose performance is a statistical anomaly. He admits this.<br />Gladwell falls down seriously in one area that undercuts his statistical arguments. He could have anticipated the problem and covered it. He didn't. It has to do with the basic unfairness of life, beyond the cognitive control of any living human.<br />Genetics determine destiny in many ways, yet who can pick a genetically desirable forbear--race, gender, color. Geography has a huge effect--born in the wrong place at the wrong time, and you're out. Environment? A killer. If you were in a place where the environment (schools, culture, even atmosphere) was not desirable, you were doomed. Worst of all, association: if born and raised to families where advantage and entitlement were inborn, introduced to the right people at the right time, you are way ahead in almost any profession or calling. The last is called `the lucky sperm club,' though the term applies in many areas of life, including genetics. Don't believe? Look at the dynasties in many areas who make sure that their offspring succeed, talented or not. Meritocracy is for most people a mirage.<br />Life is unfair. Do we succeed through happenstance or intention. Gladwell does not answer this question. So he failes the test of a complete argument, and he fails his readers despite his demonstrable skills.cy is for most people a mirage.  Life is unfair.

1401307450|1.0|I have read some biographies, mostly about musicians or groups, and I must say that this one is almost worse than the John Lydon one.    This guy tries to be, or looks like he wants to show he has lived the rock and roll lifestyle more than Motley Crue (The Dirt is a GREAT book) or Lemmy (another brilliant autobiography).    75% of the book is about how much drugs he has done, in such a repetitive way that is anoying, and also on how many girls he had sex with; more ego than Gene Simmons if that's possible. Has some good stories and anecdotes, but sadly are the 25% of the whole reading.     You've been warned, it's up to you. Bye.

630469654X|4.0|I wouldn't quite classify this one as a taut and rousing sword and sorcery adventure. Oh, but it does have sword fights and frantic chases and mad dashes and all the other tropes of action fantasy, but LADYHAWKE is more of a methodical action fantasy. It's got too much of a deliberate tone and pace for it to just grab you by your throat and get your juices going, nor will it inspire anyone to play sword fight with his homie. But it doesn't mean it's not good. It's actually entertaining, on a low adrenaline drip kind of way. Where it scores highly, of course, is on the romantic, heart-palpatatin' theme and on Matthew Broderick's performance.<br /><br />LADYHAWKE's story has its base origins in the 13th century (or so indicates the DVD bonus feature), and who are we to argue? It just goes to show that, back in the Middle Ages, they weren't effing around when it came to unrequited love. The movie opens in the dank dungeons of Aquila, soon to be vacated by Phillipe Gaston a.k.a. the Mouse, a young lowly pickpocket who engages in one-way, tongue-in-cheeked conversations with God and who doesn't care to keep his appointment at the gallows.<br /><br />Out in the woods, the Mouse scampers and skedaddles but still would've been quickly enough recaptured by Aquilan soldiers but for the intervention of the grim, black-clad knight Etienne Navarre. But the Mouse finds himself trading one captivity for another as he's now pressed into service playing squire and servant to Navarre and his horse Goliath and his hawk. For Mouse, things become even more strange. Night falls and the knight vanishes. But a beautiful woman, awkwardly named Isabeau, mysteriously appears. And somewhere in the distance a wolf gets to howlin'. This sets off Mouse's \\"What's Up With That?\\" radar.<br /><br />Mouse, wanting no part of all this oddity, in time finds out that the moody Navarre and his lady love Isabeau near two years ago were cursed magically by the despicable Bishop of Aquila, who had desired Isabeau for his own and, upon learning that he couldn't have her, made a deal with the dark forces. By day, the knight is accompanied by his lady love but in the shape of a hawk. When the sun sets, the hawk reverts to its human form - but the knight then transforms into a black wolf. Etienne Navarre has waited and waited for that one day in which he may gain revenge, having given up hope that the curse may be lifted. And yet, with the clever Mouse at his side, that hope may yet quicken to reality. Oh, and there's also some sloppy-looking priest guy who helps out...<br /><br />With all the Gregorian chanting and quite a few scenes taking place in a cathedral and the Bishop being the episcopal Big Bad, there's a decidedly churchy feel to this fantasy adventure. Doesn't make it good or bad, it's just there (okay, maybe it is a bit of a downer). The mood is consistently pensive and brooding, and maybe it's partly because the film wasn't shot in gloriously green New Zealand but rather in the crumbling castle landscapes of Italy under muted skies. It's almost as gritty-looking and low-key as [[ASIN:B0000AUHOM Dragonslayer]] (which, by the way, is also a good movie). For the romance freaks, LADYHAWKE comes with a pretty tragic love story. It's interesting to me that Rutger Hauer actually does a better job of pining than Michelle Pfeiffer. But Michelle Pfeiffer is so pretty that she can just sit there looking as she does, and she'll get the job done. I feel like I should swoon or catch the vapors or something.<br /><br />There are some lighter moments, mostly brought about by Matthew Broderick, button-eyed and earnest sounding even though one can sense that playful, disingenuous tone lurking just underneath. Broderick has made a career out of this tone. The story is told thru the point-of-view of the very personable Mouse, and thru his eyes, the forlorn lovers achieve this detached, near-mythical aura. Mouse, scamp that he is, still knows better than to try to mess around with Isabeau. He knows he's way out of his league, caught like driftwood in the torrent of this towering, tragic love story. But is it wrong of me that I care more about Mouse than Navarre or Isabeau?<br /><br />A few things that are wick-wick-wack: Firstly, it's not a big thing but I never could figure out whether Broderick was trying for a British accent or an American one from a 1930s screwball comedy. Second, I guess Navarre and Isabeau are both illiterates, else you'd think they'd be passing notes to each other, right? This next one bugs me quite a bit: After having politely addressed Isabeau as \\"Milady\\" all this time, Mouse picks a fine time to call her by her first name, right where the Bishop's hunter can conveniently hear it. And, lastly (and this is a gynormous beef for me), that hateful film score. Because I guess nothing says medieval adventure like electric guitars, keyboards, and synth. Can you say cheesy 1980s TV show theme songs?<br /><br />The dvd offers the full screen version on one side and the widescreen presentation on the reverse side. The special features consist of a series of text commentaries on the following: cast & crew biographies, the story's source, Creating Aquila, Brother Imperius's Abbey, some \\"fun facts\\" about the animals involved, and on why Donner decided to clothe the good guy in black and the villain in white. And the theatrical trailer. If you're not disappointed about the paltry special features, then I won't be either (except that I'm disappointed).<br /><br />I wouldn't say that LADYHAWKE is a stirring fantasy adventure; it's more a gritty, contemplative sort of medieval happily ever after. It's not up to the CG-backed standards of today's stuff, but the action is decent. Rutger Hauer has got that grim demeanor down pat, so he pulls off his fight scenes and then even has time to gaze wistfully at a bird and spout lovey-dovey stuff like: \\"Did you know that hawks and wolves mate for life? The Bishop didn't even leave us that...\\" But, more than anything, the film is carried by a very young, pre-Ferris Bueller Matthew Broderick who hams it up in a good way.

The rest of CD further illustrates how wrong I was about this band.  Even at its most annoying on numbers like the bizarre \\"St. Andrew\\" and the painful guitar solos of \\"Catch Hell Blues\\" I find I'm never less than intrigued and find myself thinking; \\"Just one more listen and this will make sense, too.\\" The cleverly stripped down \\"Effect and Cause,\\" the ridiculous vaudeville of \\"Rag and Bone,\\" and the throbbing organ driven \\"I'm Slowly Turning into You,\\" where lines like \\"Yesterday it hit me that I do/All the little things that you do/Except those same little things that you do are annoying\\" just fascinate me. I guess I'll have to check out the rest of The White Stripes catalog; when I find I start to like the things that annoyed me, it's time to learn from my mistakes.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|This is an intense, gripping film about how STASI, the East German Secret Police, observed and coerced its citizens.  The performance of Ulrich Muhe, the STASI operative who gradually becomes sympathetic to the life of the writer he is charged with surveilling, is extraordinary.  Much of the drama of the film is conveyed through his facial expression.  The rest of the cast is equally superb.  I do not speak German, but the English subtitles support the film nicely.  This is a great movie, one that you can watch repeatedly and still find interesting.
0879309210|5.0|I had the previous edition of this book as well but wanted the DVD and additional material. If I need to check something or make adjustments on my guitars and basses, this is the book I grab first. I have other repair books but I use them to supplement this one.
0061367036|3.0|Anyone who is any sort of fan of the show Supernatural will like what this book has to say, but it really isn't as great as I had heard.  Most of what they talk about are common things from the show, like salt and silver and such, and they don't even list everything the show has mentioned (note that this book only goes through about half of season 2).  It's fun to have and to read, but not very useful as a companion to the series (and I STILL don't know what the heck a chupacabra is! >.&lt;)
B001O2ZW1A|5.0|With the review Hans wrote and the product description, there's not much more I can add.  Many in the 60's thought \\"Eric Clapton is God\\".  If you are one, then SW is God's father!  He can turn water to wine and dirt to gold.  There is never a dull moment listening to this disc; he cover's so many genres.  And if you are into 5.1 Surround Sound, are YOU in for a treat... unbelievable!  This is a \\"must have\\" disc along with ALL of Porcupine Tree's, Blackfield I and II, No-Man's Together We're Stranger and Schoolyard Ghosts plus Opeth's Damnation!

NOT IN BOOK 4.<br />If you're considering getting book 4 -- don't.  Let book 3 end it for you and create your OWN ending to the story.  MUCH better than book 4's 'story'.

B000E6EHGI|5.0|I feel that this album belongs somewhere in the top 25 or so of all time.  Anything good one can find to say about the Grateful Dead is epitomized in this work.  The playing and vocals are phenomenal.  The contributions of Keith and Donna Jean are what I especially enjoy.  Keith is just lights out here, and seems to be an extension of Jerry and vice versa.  Their parts intertwine and play off of each other.  I know so little about Keith, but his proud legacy is thankfully burned into this album.  Any detractors of Donna Jean just need to listen to this record, and their complaints should be squashed.  Yes, she sang off key live sometimes...who cares?  Sometimes Jerry sucked, sometimes Bob was terrible.  The fact is that on \\"Blues for Allah,\\" Donna provides that feminine touch, that other voice, that seems to fully complete many of the tracks.  Listen to the end of 'Blues for Allah,' the \\"under eternity,\\" part, and you'll hear just how strong and soulful her vocals could be.
B001LPWGE6|5.0|This is a must have if you enjoyed these films of course..the packaging alone is a feature; the box and menus are top notch. No cheap menus here.

B00129H7VS|5.0|This HBO mini-series is, in my humble opinion, the best WWII series, movie, reenactment, whatever you want to call it, ever made.

B001GKJ2FW|5.0|Mamma Mia is fabulous whether it's full screen, widescreen or blu-ray.  I bought it in blu-ray for one reason....the price came down.  Yes, the scenery jumps out at you and makes you feel like you're part of it (my TV is 62\\" screen) and the sound does seem to be enhanced, but when you're singing along with the movie, who can tell?  HOWEVER, I am in no rush to buy any movie in blue-ray until the prices come down.  They are totally over-rated, and definitely over-priced.  Get smart you people who produce blu-ray movies, it's not going to sell if the price isn't right.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|I am absolutely thrilled with this CD. I wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone. I purchased this as a gift for my husband for christmas and what a surprise that he also gifted me with the same CD. I like all the songs on this CD and I rarely say that about someone's music (with the exception of Neil Diamond I love all his music, huge huge fan).   I do have my favorites that I will hit the repeat on just to hear that strong deep voice of David's. The music is awesome as well and I know that David will achieve great success. If you haven't had the chance to get this CD you are missing out on something very good.   While all the songs have something special in them my favorites are: Light On, Come Back To Me, Life On The Moon, I did It For You, Avalanche.   So if you have been undecided about getting this CD go with this thought it is an awesome very wonderful piece of music and David is spectacular are giving something good.   CC
0312983867|2.0|I wanted a somewhat light book to read, and this book seemed to fit the bill.  It started out great.  It was witty, fun and it sort of had enough of a hook to keep me reading.  But then it just lost all steam about halfway through.<br /><br />The book seemed incredibly formulaic.  Characters were added by design to add comic relief.  Subplots that served no purpose other than to break up the monotony of the main plot line.<br /><br />**Spoiler**<br />Stephanie Plum has to be the dumbest most pathetic main character I have read.  In this story she absolutely did nothing intelligent.  The entire plot happened on her.  This was like she sat back in a recliner and the story unfolded around her.  This is basically the plot:<br /><br />Stephanie gets attacked with snakes, call a Ranger to get help.<br />Stephanie gets attacked by a giant rabbit, call Ranger to get help<br />Stephanie shoots a cardboard cutout, call the other guy for help.<br />Stephanie gets locked out of house, call Ranger.<br />Ranger removes security, something bad happens, call Ranger again to reinstall security.<br /><br />Stephanie gets &lt;fill in here>, call &lt;fill in> for help.  Repeat 20 times till you get 300 pages.<br /><br />This goes on till the last pages where the we are told the whole purpose of the book.  She's a bond agent that couldn't even capture her man.<br /><br />Stephanie didn't do anything insightful or intelligent, she didn't solve the mystery, some other detective did.  She didn't capture her bond holder, he died of flu.  This is definitely a weak heroine and not someone people can look up to.<br /><br />I've read another Evanovich book and this is by far the worst.  It started out great however.

0743487486|5.0|This book was useful for me because it allowed me to truly consider the discipline techniques and attitudes I was using as a parent to a 2-yr old. It opens your eyes and really makes you think. It's always interesting when the truth doesn't always match with our common sense. You'd think some discipline techniques are productive, when in reality, maybe they're counter productive?
B0012GN2U6|4.0|I bought this when it first came out and I loved it, I've been looking for it for years and I was a little disappointed, it wasn't as good as I remember but that's just cause I'm a few years older. It is the only Santana worth listening to because it is excellent instrumental talent. Cool beans.
0743297334|3.0|the only reason i gave this book 3 stars is because Hemingway is an amazing author. However, I just could not grasp the point of this book. I had a very hard time keeping up with the dialogue as well as trying to figure out what the point of the book was! Although Hemingway's description of the character's personalities was vivid and very distinct, I couldn't understand how they all connected or why they were in Spain in the first place.   Throughout the entire time I attempted to figure out this book, I kept thinking how much better I probably would have understood (and therefore, enjoyed) it if I had read this in an english class in either high school or college.   after finishing the book, I read reviews on amazon, and although I was able to piece a few things together, I could not undertandd why so many people are giving this book such stellar reviews.
0688145078|4.0|My son really likes this book (he's 2) and he calls it the \\"big brother book.\\"  I like that it shows the dad being involved in infant care, but I don't like that it doesn't show the mother doing any infant care at all and that it only shows the baby getting a bottle.  I want my kids to see breastfeeding as the normal way to feed a baby.  Other than that, it's good.
0316017922|5.0|Gladwell's thesis seems to be, \\"It is hard to understand why some people or groups succeed or fail more than others. Often the answer lies not in their innate talent and intellect, but in cultures they absorbed in their early youth. And sometimes the differences are due to being in the right place at the right time.\\"<br /><br />As it happened, I had just heard a talk by mystery author Val McDermid a few days before reading this book. McDermid said, \\"There are many authors as talented and hard-working as I am. They just didn't have the luck I did.\\"<br /><br />She's right. You can look at almost any life and find an episode that resembles the premise of the movie, Sliding Doors: something either came along or didn't come along at the right time. Or you made one fatal decision and your life shifted irrevocably to a new path.<br /><br />Academic research recognizes this possibility through several theories, such as chaos theory and life course theory. Published career research has documented the influence of serendipitous events on career paths.<br /><br />One key event is your date of birth. Gladwell describes a lawyer who was born into an era of low birth rates. This lawyer experienced advantages, such as smaller classes and less competition, not available to his father who was born two decades earlier. I was reminded of research I read a long time ago, comparing success of men drafted into World War II at older or younger ages. Those who joined the military at a young age benefited from the experience; those who joined later saw a lifetime loss of earnings. The differences wasn't due to ability or talent, just their birth date.<br /><br />I was a little disturbed by Gladwell's interpretation of Chris Langan's failure to meet expectations based on talent. Langan, the man with the IQ of 200, claims he was forced to leave Reed College because his mother wouldn't sign the financial aid form.  At Montana State, a professor became defensive when Langan challenged the style of teaching calculus. The administration refused to honor Langan's request to change to afternoon classes so he could get transportation to attend.<br /><br />As a former college professor, I find these situations extremely plausible, regardless of Langan's social skills. Even in a private school, administrators can be surprisingly rigid. Financial aid officers live in their own worlds.<br /><br />Gladwell says professors would enjoy engaging with a talented student, but often lower division students are not engaging with experienced professors. They deal with teaching assistants who are struggling with their own professional identity. Fortunately, many universities now have freshman seminars to allow interaction with senior faculty, who would have not only the motivation but also the ability to mentor a struggling student.  And a request to change classes after an official registration date will almost always be denied.<br /><br />Ironically, if Langan had been identified as coming from a disadvantaged population (such as inner city students who get scholarships to prep schools) he would be less of an outlier. These students struggle and I understand that some schools now have special mentoring programs. I know people whose children turned down opportunities to attend elite schools because they wouldn't fit in.<br />When I read some negative reviews, I often wonder if we're reading the same book. Outliers is not targeted to an audience of research psychologists, although the author does cite academic research throughout the book. You can criticize the way Gladwell interprets the findings of the research. But you can also go through an academic psychology journal and second-guess the authors' interpretation of their data in many published articles.<br /><br />Are there more rigorous accounts of these phenomena? Sure. Could the book have addressed some counter-examples? Definitely. But it's still a high-quality, thought-provoking read.<br /><br />Gladwell doesn't write self-help. He presents ideas. Hopefully these ideas will help us understand why large-scale policies work or don't work. If we're in a position to influence change, we can use them. Meanwhile, we can have a lot of fun reading and discussing what Gladwell's written. And if you're motivated to go deeper into social psychology because the book is too light, even better.understand why large-scale policies work or don't work.

B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|Every new series tops the one before.  The ensemble of Tennant The Doctor) and Tate (Donna) is pure entertainment.  Together they carry the viewer through a perfectly timed plot that combines comedy and dramatic action filled with witty one liners.  Tennant is the perfect Doctor.  I can't imagine who could possibly play the part better.    In typical Doctor Who fashion the series concludes with a block buster finale that even outshines previous episodes- and who can forget season threes Dalek conclusion.    Just to put the cherry on the cake we see Rose Tyler return in this season.

0374280967|5.0|Bennett's novella is an absolute gem that was not only a captivating story, but was also incredibly intelligently written. It has been a long time since I have had the pleasure to read such a smart piece of literature. When the Queen picks up a book from a travelling library - because it's the proper thing to do of course, not because she actually intends to read it - this simple act sets off a whole series of events. As the Queen embraces reading with new vigor an enthusiasm, her family and staff become increasingly concerned with how this new \\"hobby\\" changes her and how she performs her royal duties.<br /><br />Bennet cleverly crafts his characters, not an easy feat given that his heroine happens to be one of the most well-known figures in the world. Anyone who loves books and enjoys reading will identify with the Queen as she jumps into the literary world with both feet and her realizations. Here I am tempted to quote some of my favorite passages, but I am afraid that would lead to quoting the entire book. So, I will limit myself to one: \\"There was something of that, she felt, to reading. It was anonymous; it was shared; it was common. And she who had led a life apart now found that she craved it. Here in these pages and between these covers she could go unrecognized.\\"<br /><br />Interest piqued yet? Those of us who immerse ourselves in reading and enjoy the sense of (sometimes) anonymous camaraderie have found a friend in Alan Bennett, but also in the perhaps unlikely figure of the Queen of England.
B000001E7V|4.0|Tricky's solo debut, \\"Maxinquaye,\\" is classic trip hop.  Indeed, from what I've read, it's one of the seminal works of the genre.  A mellow groove runs throughout the disc.  Be advised, there are lots of sexual references.  I was a little surprised that Tricky did not play a more prominent role in the vocal mix.  That being said, Martine Topley-Bird's cool, detached vocals work perfectly with the music.  Alison Goldfrapp also makes a nice contribution on \\"Pumpkin.\\"  The last four songs are not as strong as the first eight.  Still, this is a really good CD.  If you like Massive Attack and Portishead, like I do, you should like this too.  Highly recommended.
0385340990|5.0|This was an absolutely outstanding book and I hope will be a harbinger of excellent literature on my reading list for 2009.  Composed entirely of letters collected at the end of WWII, the reader becomes privy to a series of communications between budding author, Juliet Ashwood, and her correspondents - among them her best friend, publisher, potential suitor, and an unlikely group of people from the English Channel island of Guernsey.  As a way of coping with the German occupation, and as an act of slight rebellion, several members of the community formed a literary society and one member, Dawsey Adams writes to his favorite book's first owner at the war's close - one Juliet Ashwood.  Juliet's fascination with the literary society leads her on a quest for new writing material and inadvertently begins to absorb her personal life as well.<br /><br />The co-authors of this novel did a remarkable job in creating unique voices and styles for each of the many letter writers and the epistolatory form made the whole story uniquely personal.  Through their writing, we see what literature means to a small literary society and how sharing these experiences enables a sense of community and camaraderie despite the tragedy that surrounds them.  I enjoyed every moment with this book, though I must confess that I couldn't put it down and finished it in two days.  Though its title may be a mouthful, this novel brings something new and fresh to the literary scene with a communication vehicle rarely used anymore.  Thanks to both of these authors for helping me begin 2009 with a literary bang!

1416550518|3.0|It took me a while to comment on this book because I kept changing my mind about it while I was reading. For about the first half I was rather ambivalent, then I really started to enjoy it, and the conclusion fell for me. Morton's novel is guided by Grace, a maid employed at the antiquated British estate of Riverton, and her devotion to the historic Ashbury family that could not quite find a way to gracefully enter the twentieth century. As an elderly Grace reflects, she gradually reveals decades worth of family secrets and the facts behind the presumed suicide of an emerging poet on the lake behind Riverton.<br /><br />As a debut novel, I appreciated Morton's research and compassion for her subject, but I believe she fell victim to one of the classic debut novel pitfalls: trying to do too much. Readers are given multiple stories to follow to the point of distraction and Grace's own biography, while relevant to the Ashbury mystery, is never quite as interesting as that of the Ashbury sisters. Morton's attempt to meticulously tie everything together at the end is more reminiscent of the Victorian era than the move to the modern, which she claims be to so fascinated by in her afterward. Throw in the making of a movie about Riverton and Grace's attempt to record her own memories on tape and we get a novel overflowing with devices juggling for priority. The overall effect could have been much stronger had she narrowed her focus.<br /><br />The tireless devotion to a young Grace is perhaps what makes the first half of the novel drag, but Hannah and Emmeline's arrival into adulthood is where Morton really hits her stride. These chapters resonate with passion and emotion not to mention this is where Grace really begins to come to life. Had the entire book been as strong as this section, I would not have hesitated to give it more stars. Though she does not acknowledge it directly, Morton owes a great deal to Ian McEwan's \\"Atonement,\\" and many images and ideas from this celebrated novel creep up here as well: family secrets revealed in the storyteller's old age, scenes at the fountain, the tumultuous relationship between two sisters, a play acted by the children during a family gathering, the often disastrous consequences of socially unacceptable love, the lasting consequences of a brother's friend invited to the family's country house. I would say that while \\"Atonement\\" is the better of the two novels set in this period, \\"The House at Riverton\\" certainly has more action and I would be lying if I said I did not enjoy it.ep up here as well: family secrets revealed in the storyteller's old age, scenes at the fountain, the tumultuous relationship between two sisters, a play acted by the children during a family gathering, the often disastrous consequences of socially unacceptable love, the lasting consequences of a brother's friend invited to the family's country house.

0439023483|4.0|This story is set in Panem (think the United States post the effects of global warming)composed of a ruling Capitol, which lords over the surrounding districts. As a way to express their authority, every year the Capitol hosts a gladiatorial event where one boy and one girl from each of the districts engages in a highly-publicized, highly-televised fight to the death. When Katniss Everdeen's sister is called to the competition, \\"Catnip\\" volunteers to take her place and becomes the girl \\"tribute\\" from District 12. To lose would be to devastate her family and to win would mean everlasting celebrity, but the costs of victory could be too much to bear.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins knows a thing or two about how to hook her readers - this book is incredibly suspenseful and nearly impossible to put down. In many ways, the story reminded me of \\"The Giver,\\" a staple of my childhood library. Though both words are very different, the ideas its characters struggle with are very similar: identity, independence, persecution, morality, etc. Collins creates an environment that forces her readers to think about what makes a society function, why it works or does not work, and what its values are or should be. We are asked to identify with some of the most lowly on the social totem pole, to root for the underdog when everything is at stake.<br /><br />In general, this is a very good bit of writing and I would highly recommend it to young adult and adult readers, but I will say the the ending frustrated me. Though I understand that this book is intended as part one of a series, it feels as though it has unfinished business and looses its footing as a stand alone novel. The sense of conclusion and satisfaction felt at the end of a \\"Harry Potter\\" book is the result of a smaller story arc within a much larger story. In \\"The Hunger Games\\" it seems we are given a piece of a larger story arc, which made me feel as though my own hunger for this story was never truly satiated. That along with the particular eye-roll inducing name of Peeta, the baker's son, prevented me from giving this book five stars, but it will not prevent me from picking up the next book in this series.ye-roll inducing name of Peeta, the baker's son, prevented me from giving this book five stars, but it will not prevent me from picking up the next book in this series.
B001H5X7I4|1.0|Granted, high hopes from the Robert Downey Jr hype, but pure gold ended up being (unintentional) camp & cheese.    Kudos to RDJ for taking a gamble (could've easily gone sour & branded him a racist, sending him to rehab for racism).  Innovative start w/ satirical fake previews (albeit, I'd seen that in the Family Guy 'movie').  Good surprise casting with the studio exec (but the makeup job was the only really funny part).    In all, mildly entertaining.  I just bottomed the rating because it fell way short of the hype machine.
B0011HF6GE|3.0|I have to agree with the reviewer who said Bon Iver was great on Letterman...I'm glad I listened to the recorded tracks before buying the album though, the rhythm was much more solid live. Contrary to the people who say you should listen to this album over and over to \\"get\\" it, I think it's so labored and the rhythm so off that it only annoys me the more I listen. I'm glad he wrote these great songs, they're beautiful haunting and searching works. But like people said, they can come across as lackluster and dull on this album, and frankly the poor recording quality is NOT worth paying full price for! It's one thing to pay for a self-produced album and support an artist. It's quite another when that artist gets a record contract and then asks people to pay a record company for self-produced tracks when the company can certainly afford to produce a better quality product but won't. Too bad he didn't get some guidance on the quality before he went ahead and re-issued the CD, because he's not duping me into paying the over-fed music industry for this!

B001FB4W16|3.0|First off, don't even try to compare this to Allen Ball's groundbreaking first series, SIX FEET UNDER - the acting and writing of which was shoulder-to-shoulder with the SOPRANOS and made HBO what it was at its peak.   If \\"SIX FEET\\" was a prime rib then this is cotton candy.  And yet when you get past the shaky first 3-4 episodes it is absolutely a guilty pleasure.    I am not crazy about the casting Paquin as Sookie.  She didn't deserve the roll, let alone the Emmy she got for it.  I don't get HBO's love affair with her.  Her accent is annoying and she is so clearly \\"acting\\".  To add to the over-wrought awkward performances is her brother, Ryan Kwantan (who was clearly hired because of how he looks with his shirt off and not because of his acting...eeek) and Bill the Vampire who sounds like Elvis when he says \\"Aww Sookie\\"   Most of the supporting players also look like they're trying WAY too hard to appear southern or the clichet version of \\"gay\\" but end up coming off as plastic pretty people.  I love Vampire anything and while this show definitely feeds that monkey, I still wish it could be even be darker with more poetry and less camp.  Ball's use of the Vampire as an allegory for gay-tolerance is both brilliant in its concept and clunky in its execution.  I was very excited to see this show and like many of my friends was disappointed.  As I continued to watch each week, I found some things very entertaining in the series, long after my friends had written it off as mere cheese.   Funny how TRUE BLOOD got a second season ONLY 2 episodes into the first season which I believe happened because HBO needed a hit show so badly (and NEEDS Allen Ball) that they were going to give it a second season despite its obvious growing pains.  We'll see if HBO's unconditional love for Ball pays off in season 2.  I ultimately, think that HBO should hold all of its shows to the highest standard like it used to (when it HAD shows:-(  As I said, TRUBLOOD is junk food, a guilty pleasure and though mostly fun to watch, it isn't really as aware as it thinks it is.
0439023483|4.0|I bought this book because the concept is from the Japanese film/graphic novel Battle Royale which I love. Similar to Battle Royale only with a Lord of the Flies kind of survival twist.     The build up is good, the book doesnt just throw you into The Games, it builds the main character Katniss well and explains the history of this world.    Its an easy read and filled with action or suspense on every page once The Games get under way. There are some brutal moments in the book, but nothing too graphic for teens.    \\"The Games\\" arent too far off either. Combine the shows Survivor (cast with teenagers) with The Ultimate Fighter and give the contestants knives and spears, and you have The Hunger Games    Looking forward to Book 2.
B00008BXJ6|5.0|This is by far THE best album by AC/DC in the earlier days of their not-yet-famous popularity.  As good as Highway To Hell was, I think this one is better.  It is more raw and has more catchy tunes than HTH.  If you want a great album with the Bon Scott era, you can't go wrong with their first release in the USA.  All songs are good, but stand-outs are title cut, It's a Long Way to the Top, Live Wire, and T.N.T. You won't be disappointed.  Bon Scott was the flame that led to the band's break-out fame in the early 80's.  He is sorely missed by all his fans.
B000UD08HW|5.0|For those fans of Pink Floyd and just of David Gilmour, you will not be dissapointed. Crosby, Nash, and David Bowie are great added bonuses to this concert. I think the biggest thing is that Richard Wright is in the whole thing. R.I.P. Richard Wright. I love the selection of songs on this Blu-Ray. The quality is unsurpassed. Extremely recommended.     -Peace
B001P5Q6F2|5.0|The best way for me to describe Lamb of God after this album is to use a sports analogy; LOG is the all-pro player and the rest are in the minor leagues. Randy has grown in his vocal abilities, the drumming is amazing and the guitars have improved greatly and the all around improvement can really be heard on Wrath. On a side note, to the person who supposedly bought this CD while looking for Justin Timberlake, exactly what part of the ALBUM ARTWORK would suggest that this was in any way a christian band? Anyways, true fans of LOG will love the new album because simply put, it delivers true AMERICAN METAL!
0553582445|4.0|Fifteen years have gone by Fitz and Night Eyes have wandered the world and finally ended up in an out of the way cabin in the wilderness. Starling the Minstrel visits now and then, sparking up emotions and memories. One day she brings a small child, \\"Hap\\", she found on the streets, to live with Fitz, hoping to fill his lonely days. Fitz sees \\"Hap\\" as himself growing up with no one to care for him and tries hard to teach \\"Hap\\" how to survive on his own. This fills the first half of the book, not a lot happening but day to day experiences.  Enter Chade, who pays a surprise visit and asks Fitz to come home to Buckkeep and teach Prince Dutiful the wit and skill. Fitz hesitates until he is paid another surprise visit from an old friend, The Fool, who after staying a while almost convinces Fitz to return to Buckkeep. Then  a messenger arrives with an urgent request from Chade to return immediately. Prince Dutiful has gone missing.  Now begins a long, long trek first to find the Prince, then bring him home. They are in for a few surprises along the way.  I thoroughly enjoy all of Hobb's work. She develops characters who live and you care about. This book has a good, if not action packed, story line that keeps you reading. I was very sad at one part in the story, because it was very similar to one of my life experiences. This trilogy is definitely worth getting,especially if you have already read The Assassin's Apprentice, as it carries on the story with the same characters. I am starting The Golden Fool as I write this, and suspect this trilogy will come to a great and satisflying end as always.
B00164IV9G|2.0|I was not terribly in to HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU (HJNTIY).  As a sum total, it was a moderately enjoyable movie, yet oddly I found it to be poorly cast/acted, and full of clichés.    HJNTIY follows various relationships among people who all either know each other, or are separated by only a degree or two at most.  We see people falling IN love, people falling OUT of love.  Some couples do both.  Some characters seem to do neither.  And naturally, most things wrap up in a satisfactory manner at the end.  It's told in loosely interwoven scenes.  The easiest comparison I can come up with is to say it's like a NYC version of LOVE, ACTUALLY.  Although I enjoyed LOVE, ACTUALLY a whole lot more...mostly because many of the performers gave energetic, committed performances, including the drop-dead funny Bill Nighy, the droll Hugh Grant and the exceedingly witty and down-to-earth Emma Thompson.    If I had to pick a \\"star\\" of HJNTIY, it would probably be Ginnifer Goodwin (who is fabulous on TV's BIG LOVE).  She gets the most screen time.  Her character is a young woman whose very eagerness to land a man causes her to drive them away.  She is also utterly unable to decipher the signals men are sending her, and is really the character for whom the title is meant.  She forges a friendship with bar owner Justin Long, who guides her through the \\"code\\" of understanding text messages, voice mail,  pick-up lines and brush-off lines.  Goodwin throws all her energy into the part, and the result is an annoying character...it's easy to see why men run from her.  Yet I had to give her credit for her efforts.  At least she was trying.    On the other end of the scale was poor Jennifer Connelly.  It's now been a scarily long time since she's had a good part or really turned in a memorable performance.  I had high hopes a couple of years ago for her appearance in LITTLE CHILDREN, and though she acquitted herself okay, the nature of her role didn't help her and then Kate Winslet just flat-out out-performed her.  She is not a natural for comedy, and she mostly looked worn out and disinterested.  Justin Long was right there as well...he looked 10 years older than the last time I saw him...frankly, he looked a little unhealthy, and he certainly appeared to be uninterested in building a relatable character.    In between we had Jennifer Aniston and Ben Affleck as a couple that's been together happily for years, but Affleck just won't pull the trigger on the marriage thing.  Gee, a man who's \\"against\\" marriage??!?!  I've NEVER seen that in a movie before.  All their scenes were charming, because these two actors are endlessly affable...but there was no real sizzle.    Scarlett Johannssen reaffirmed her limited range. Obviously she's a stunning young lady, but with each passing role, she becomes more and more affectless and listless.  She's frequently paired with Bradley Cooper, who I am HUGELY tired of seeing in any way, shape or form.  I just don't get the appeal...he seems utterly incapable of being likeable.  He convincingly plays a cad in this film, but really never makes us sympathize with him.    Also, the film underutilizes Drew Barrymore...but I suspect that her character, had she been given more screentime, would have been unlikeable too...a rare feat for the always breezy and fun Barrymore.    Again, the awkward tapestry all these characters wove was mildly entertaining throughout, and when we left the theatre, I was pleased enough to chalk it up as a \\"win.\\"  But with merely 5 minutes reflection, I realized that there was very little work in the movie that was worthwhile, and I believe that HJNTIY will soon fade from memory.    The film MIGHT be a good \\"date night\\" rental...but why not watch WHEN HARRY MET SALLY again?  Or heck, even LOVE, ACTUALLY!
B001L5SXQG|1.0|AMAZON IS GRAND-AND DELIVERY WAS FAST! MY HUSBAND LOVES THIS CD AND PLAYS IT ALL OF THE TIME. AS FOR ME, LEON RUSSELL DOES IT--AND SO DO ELTON JOHN AND ANTONIN DVORAK. YOU CAN KEEP BRUCE FOR YOURSELVES.!! !
0765350386|4.0|I was browsing through the Amazon site...following threads and recommendations from other books when I came across this series of books. I had a new Kindle and was going on vacation, and wanted to take some light reading along. This was a great choice.    I enjoyed this book so much I quickly ordered the second and third books in the series.  I love this writer's style, and the characters he has created here.    Very satisfying series of books, and I look forward to reading other books from this author.  I'm a new fan.
031606792X|1.0|Like most of the other readers, I read the first three books in record time.  I'd heard some negative feedback from other readers about the final book, but, went in with a clean and positive mind-set.      Another review said it more kindly, the ending didn't go \\"he/she's way\\".  I'm not sure it went anyone's \\"way\\".  I can tell you, it had me hating Bella by the end as well as disappointed with every character in the story.  In fact, I've had the book for over a week, and I still can't bring myself to read the last couple of pages.  After shamefully loving the first three books, I wanted the stories to end with some sort of dignity and respect.  That I did not get. On the up-side, The first three books were awesome.
B001EOQWEO|1.0|We have seen and loved the movie, but the DVD you shipped was defective.  It pixalated and stopped and skipped scenes.  We know this can happen, so we arranged to return it and have it replaced.  The second one had the exact same problems in the exact same places.  I am assuming you got a whole shipment of defective DVD's which by the time of our return you should have known and not shipped any more from that shipment.  Now we had to go through the hassle of returning it a second time and not trusting that you would not send us a third defective DVD, we requested a refund and bought it from a local discount store.  I am unlikely to buy DVD's, CD's or other similar none book materials from you again.    Mark Carlin
0060899220|5.0|Everyone who eats should read this book. Everyone who cooks should read this book. Yes, everyone should read this book. It's one of the rare handful of books I go back to again and again, and it's got the best description of eating an oyster ever published in the English language. Bourdain pulls no punches here, and his razor sharp sarcastic wit is a comfort to anyone who has ever had to sit across a restaurant table from a pretentious bore. If you've ever worked in food service, you will recognize the characters in this book. Anyone who is thinking of going into cooking for a career or opening a restaurant for fun should DEFINITELY read this book-by now we can identify failing restaurants and why they are failing. Buy this book. Buy copies for all your friends. You won't regret it.
B0012GN260|5.0|If you're Maiden fan, don't wait the same thing. Remember, this is alternative proyect of Dickinson. Is amazing!!!!! The song Tattoed Millionaire is just excelent (one of my favorites).    If you havent listen any of Dickinson at solist, I recommend this one or Accident of the birth or Chemical Wedding.
B001N44BVQ|4.0|great movie,  and great performances by Crowe, Leonardo and Jordanian head of intelligence.  There were a few very predictable parts of the story line, but overall a great movie with lots of intense action and dialogue.  I wish the ending hadn't been so hollywood, but still very entertaining and great to watch.
B0000UJL96|5.0|This one literally starts off with a bang. The story then hits the pavement with the tires at full speed. Echoing the tense relationship between the US and the USSR towards the end of the Cold War, this one has a lot of very personal resonance for anyone who remembers those times. Klingon High Chancellor Gorkon was even named by combining the names of Gorbachev and Lincoln.<br /><br />The metaphor here presented shows the dangers of prejudice even with the threat of peace. Note the incredibly charged statements by even the Federation \\"good guy\\" characters as they have a hard time accepting that this long-standing conflict may be coming to a kind of end. In fact, the statements that are made by Admiral Cartwright took Brock Peters several takes to get through because they were so offensive to him. He understood the need to get them out, though, because the movie only really works when you are forced to re-evaluate your assumptions: that we are the good guys and \\"they\\" are the bad guys.<br /><br />There are some great action sequences and some wonderful (for the time) special effects. But it is the story that is just superb and that does not age the same way all other aspects of the movie do. It is still as poignant today as it was when it came out.<br /><br />Marvelous movie. Get the DVD.
055358894X|4.0|This has been one of the best books I've read in the last 6 months, rivaled by Name of the Wind. It took me about 6 months to read this book because the plot was painfully slow in the beginning.    It does a good job creating the history and setting the stage for character development and for the plot to unfold, but when I hit a third of the book and still nothing has happened, I let it sit on the shelf for a few months. I'm not the most patient reader.    However, once I got past that slow third of the book, the plot all of a sudden picked up. There were layers upon layers of intrigue, and just as I thought I'd figured out the evil scheme, something else didn't fit. It was for sure a roller coaster to the end. I can't wait to read the second book! I heard the second book's not as good, but I'll let you know when I read it.
B0000AUHOH|3.0|For real Trek fans, this one is fairly frustrating. There are just so many things here that don't quite fit with what had been established before: The Enterprise flies all the way to the center of the galaxy in a matter of hours (a trip that should have taken years); Scotty becomes a bumbling, head clunking oaf (though he may have been drinking some more of that famous green stuff with Uhura which might also explain her feeling him up in sickbay); Spock suddenly sprouts a half brother who, despite being fully Vulcan, gives a great belly laugh in the first five minutes of the movie.<br /><br />It doesn't help that they had to settle for sub-par special effects because their usual effects studio (ILM) was unavailable at the time. And the studio kept cutting the budget until Shatner had to settle for a horribly cut-rate ending rather than the smoking rock monsters he had originally envisioned.<br /><br />In the end, this movie has problems, but there are moments that, for me at least, still work: the \\"Plan B\\" is okay; the \\"Face Your Pain\\" moments, while over long and a bit out of place, give nice insight into the characters; there are several interpersonal exchanges that feel organic and lighten the mood.<br /><br />A fair to middling movie, but the DVD release helps out. By better understanding what Shatner was going for and why he was unable to pull it off, I can more easily forgive some (note SOME) of the missteps. The ending got short shrift, and a better ending can do a lot to help out a movie.
B001P5Q6F2|5.0|First off... if all you metal fans want TRUE metal, then get this latest album from LoG. Lamb of God DEFINES what true metal should be and this 11-track set will not let you down. Overall, 'Wrath' does have a different sound (as others eluded to), but just as someone said... bands need to evolve and grow. I couldn't agree more. They can't just keep playing the same stuff over and over...    My review:    I must say, I was a bit \\"worried\\" as I was listening to track 1 (The Passing) as it's a nice, soothing, mellow intro to the album... but then track 2 (In Your Words) woke me straight the f*ck up with a swift kick right to the balls! This album has it all, the ever-solid dualing guitars of Morton and Adler, killer vocals from Blythe and INTENSE and almost unbelievable drumming from the man himself... Chris Adler, which may be the highlight of 'Wrath'. Personal opinion here, but Chris Adler is at THE TOP of all drummers in metal today.    The bottom line here is... Lamb of God still holds true to the fans (and themselves) with their trademark 'Pure American Metal'. Period. With that, I say get this album any way you can... download it, buy it, steal it or do whatever else you need to do to get it! You won't be disappointed.
B000083C49|4.0|Who would have thought that getting home from a planet lightyears away would be such a hassle? Following only months on the heels of Star Trek III, this movie starts with our beloved crew on Vulcan with a Klingon cruiser. However, before they can get home, they decide to take a quick detour to the late 20th century to, quite literally, save the whales.<br /><br />Hokey oversimplification of the plot aside, this is actually a very solid entry to the pantheon of Trekdom. While there are some who take issue with the overtness of the ecological message (Trek is usually better at hiding its agendas) there is plenty here for everyone to enjoy. In fact, when it came out in Europe, it was billed as \\"The Voyage Home - Star Trek IV\\", not even playing up the fact that it is a star trek movie at all. In the end it became one of the most commercially successful of all Star Trek movies (as of this writing).<br /><br />Granted, commercial success does not prove greatness. (I would point out that the first Star Trek movie was a financial success.) In this case however, it is a good indication. In the best Star Trek tradition, there is drama, there is humor, there is action and (of course) there are aliens about to literally destroy the earth until Kirk and crew intervene and send them packing.<br /><br />Great fun and a wonderful DVD.
B001P5Q6F2|4.0|Still a good album, and an adequate follow up to Sacrement. After Sacrement its was pretty much certain that the audience would take notice if they started moving in another direction. The vocals are slightly less intense, the playing isn't as tight, a little more southern, but I still enjoyed. Keep bringing the heavy Lamb of God!
B001CDLATE|5.0|This film is a stunning visual tour of the locales and peoples of our world. Simply put, this is the coolest thing I've ever seen my Blu-Ray player and HDTV do!
B001IL1AMW|5.0|COMMITTED was the most inspiring episode of Smallville to date.  Clark and Lois doing what they do in every other incarnation.  Kudos to Bryan Q Miller for a great script and Glen Miller for awesome direction.  5 stars!!!
0767821629|5.0|This was a great movie. 7 minutes into it, Fuller goes into a bar and calls Douglas on the payphone. Does anyone know the singer or name of the song playing on the jukebox in the background, its great. Would like to get it. Thank you. [...]
0783229372|5.0|When THE HINDENBURG first was released, I viewed it and was not that impressed. Now, several decades later, I find it much better than my initial impression conveyed. George C. Scott is superb, as are other members of the cast. Although we certainly KNOW the outcome, what will happen to The Hindenburg, somehow the film still manages to have us hanging on every twist in the plot, as if there is still some doubt as to the eventual outcome.  That it accomplishes this is no mean feat, and a compliment to both Scott and the film direction. High recommended.
B0002O7XW2|5.0|Besides Carrie, Christine is my 2nd favorite Stephen King film! John Carpenter did an awesome job at directing this, as he did with my all-time favorite movie, HALLOWEEN! I love the idea of a classic red 1958 Plymouth Fury being possessed and kills for her owner. Her name is Christine. A nerd named Arnie Cunningham finds a crappy Plymouth Fury, and fixes it up. After he fixes it, it looks awesome! The bullies that pick on Arnie and trash Christine get whats comin' to them. Arnie's friend, Dennis, and Arnie's girlfried, Leigh try to find out about Christine's haunted past and try to stop her from taking over Arnie, who is now obsessed with Christine. I love how Christine fixes herself. If you love horror, classic cars, and Stephen King films, you'll love CHRISTINE!!!
B00004IC9G|5.0|One of the greatest and most Powerful debuts in Heavy Metal is this,Manowar's first Battle Hymn released in 1982.The sound is not quite the one that it's fans are quite used to,echoing a mixture of the NWOBHM,Arena Rock(especially Ted Nugent on \\"Shell Shock\\")and it's own burgeoning sound of power and glory.Chock full of classic favorites including there title cut,\\"Manowar\\",there first of many anthems to Metal in \\"Metal Daze\\" and the Orson Welles narrated classic of epic Metal on \\"Dark Avenger\\".  The greatest track and the one that may be the best of there career is the emotional epic,\\"Battle Hymn\\",which features terrific soling from one,\\"Ross the Boss\\" and one of the great vocal performances from Eric Adams.  Band leader,Joey Damaio also gets to flex his bass skills on the impressive instrumental,\\"William's Tale\\",which will become a regular fixture on many a classic Manowar record and certainly live.  This is one hell of a traditional Metal album and comes highly reccomended,even to those who have not \\"heard the call\\" yet.A must in your 80s Metal collection.
B001K98MFU|4.0|\\"GHOST IN THE SHELL\\" definitely made impact around the world with its release.  The film was one of the first animated films to blend computer animation with cel animation perfectly.  I remember purchasing every VHS release when it first came out, I remember watching it many times and just being in awe of its visuals but its cerebral storyline.<br /><br />The same can be said with the second film \\"GHOST IN THE SHELL 2: INNOCENCE\\", the second film loosely based on the popular manga series by Shirow Masamune and written and directed by Mamoru Oshii.<br /><br />But there is one thing about Mamoru Oshii's work that hasn't changed since the 1980's (from the second \\"Urusei Yatsura\\" 1984 film titled \\"Beautiful Dreamer\\") and now and that is unique storytelling and his keen eye for visuals.  And actually, visuals are his priority and storytelling and its characters come after.<br /><br />But every film that he has worked on from \\"Beautiful Dreamer\\", \\"Angel's Egg\\", the first two \\"Patlabor\\" films, \\"Avalon\\" and of course the \\"GHOST IN THE SHELL\\" films, his films are the type that I can never truly understand during the first watch.  In fact, I start to realize certain details during the second, the third and fourth watch because I feel that he's a filmmaker that has certain intentions and things nicely placed that only those who really, try to analyze, you get a different and possibly a much better interpretation with repeated viewings.<br /><br />I can tell you that \\"GHOST IN THE SHELL\\" required several viewings and I can tell you that this second film \\"INNOCENCE\\" required repeated viewings and after the third viewing, I was amazed how much I truly missed.  I feel that during the first watch, your eyes are so focused on the visuals, the details and also the audio (which I watched in English dubs, going back and forth with the two included English dubs).  By the second watch, you are now following the actually storyline much more closely.  The third was watching it with the director's commentary and the fourth was watching it in Japanese.<br /><br />VIDEO AND AUDIO:<br /><br />The video quality of \\"GHOST IN THE SHELL 2: INNOCENCE\\" is just beautiful.  The video is featured in 1080P High-Definition and there is so much detail in this world.  From the buildings, the shops, indoors, outdoors, you name it.  Also, a variety of colors.<br /><br />I know that this film was not the easiest to create and even the animators talk about their challenges that they had in this film and also during the commentary, both director Mamoru Oshii and animation director Toshihiko Nishikubo discuss the challenges in creating the film.<br /><br />If anything, Mamoru Oshii's films will always be expected to have awesome visuals and having anything less than that wouldn't be an Oshii film.  So, \\"GHOST IN THE SHELL 2:  INNOCENCE\\" really has its share of breathtaking visuals that just look so vibrant on Blu-ray.  From the ambers of the sunlight to the blues and blacks showing the grittiness of the streets.  Overall, video quality was well done!<br /><br />As for audio quality, Bandai Entertainment included a very well done English voice dub and also the Manga UK dub (which I didn't really care for).  Both are offered in Dolby Digital 5.1.  And there is a Japanese audio track which is also Dolby Digital 5.1.<br /><br />I am aware that the Japanese release of this film contains an uncompressed track that you would expect on a Blu-ray release.  And so far, Bandai Entertainment and Bandai Visual releases tend to be top notch for its delivery on the video and audio side of their Blu-ray releases.  So, I was surprised that HD audio was not included in this US release and it is quite disappointing because for Blu-ray, Bandai Entertainment has always delivered even on their DVD releases.<br /><br />But with that being said, the Dolby Digital 5.1 track is still very good.  There was good use of the rear channel tracks during the action and aircraft scenes and the front speaker channels brought out the dialogue and the music quite clearly.  And I found that the quality of audio was much better in the newer English dub versus the Manga UK dub.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />Included on the Blu-ray disc are:<br /><br />  * The \\"Making of `GHOST IN THE SHELL 2: INNOCENCE\\" - Quite a bit of information on this 16-minute featurette in regards to the making of this film.  From Production I.G. aligning with Studio Ghibli, the challenges that the animators had in making this film, interviews with Oshii, the voice talent and other key staff members and leading up to the premiere at the Cannes Film Festival.<br />  * Director's Commentary with Mamoru Oshii and animation director Toshihiko Nishikubo - Personally, any commentary that you can have Mamoru Oshii be a part of is excellent. Both men had a lot to say in terms of the animation, what they were going for, what challenges they had, the use of music and voice acting and the challenge of trying to finish the film in under three years (most animated film takes two years) and knowing that time was running out.  So, I enjoyed the commentary.  It maybe technical for some who enjoy commentary that is fun and shooting the breeze, casual conversations but this commentary is pretty much focusing on the film and the people involved in making the film happen.<br />  * Theatrical Trailer - A 5+ minute promotional anime trailer<br /><br />After watching the Blu-ray and taking in the visuals, storyline, commentary and special features, you get a good idea of the challenges that Oshii and crew had faced.<br /><br />Part of the challenge in the beginning was the production budget of $20 million, so Production I.G.'s president Mitsushia Ishikawa asked Studio Ghibli president Toshio Suzuki to work with him as a co-producer.<br /><br />And once the film was underway, the film surpassed the typical two year deadline and the film was going in its third year for completion.  And for an animated film to go in production that long, not only is that expensive but I can see how much stress it would put on the producers and the entire staff.<br /><br />So, this film had quite an interesting storyline in itself behind-the-scenes and you learn a lot of this through the commentary and the featurette.<br /><br />\\"GHOST IN THE SHELL 2: INNOCENCE\\" is not going to be for everyone.  I've always felt that Oshii's work could be deemed cerebral and possibly to intelligent for the casual animation fan to watch.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this film but I suppose a film that featured around Batou's character, especially for those who were so used to seeing Makoto in the first film, the manga series, the video games and even the television series of \\"Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex\\" may feel that something is quite missing without Makoto having a prominent role.<br /><br />But nevertheless, I think that Oshii did a great job in showcasing that sense of sadness with Batou not having his partner but then knowing that no matter what, she will still be there for him in some sort of way.<br /><br />And again, to truly grasp this film, you need to watch this film (or any of Oshii's works) more than once.  In fact, Oshii's films deserve repeated viewings because of the detail of the visuals of his films, the layers of his storyline and really, he has this philosophy about life and his own life that he puts into the film.  It's complex.<br /><br />But I think that's what attracts me to his works is because it is intelligent but yet you manage to find beauty in the worlds that he creates.  \\"GHOST IN THE SHELL 2: INNOCENCE\\" and the original \\"GHOST IN THE SHELL\\" are perfect examples of that complexity and beauty of visuals and storyline.  Some get it and some won't.  But once you become a fan of his work, you realize that he's a master storyteller with a keen eye of what he wants to accomplish.  And you know that you will need to watch his films again.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray, videoquality is well done.  There is so much detail incorporated that the 1080P High-Definition really makes those details come out.  And really, beautiful sharp and vibrant colors. But on the flip side, there is also a bit of disappointment with no DTS-HD or TrueHD track in this US release but yet knowing that it's in the Japanese release.  And that is quite surprising for a Bandai Entertainment Blu-ray release.<br /><br />But the Dolby Digital 5.1 track is still very good but for audiophiles that want the best in their films on Blu-ray, I can understand why one would be upset that the uncompressed audio track(s) were not included in this US release.<br /><br />With that being said, I did feel that this Blu-ray release was still highly enjoyable and to hear the commentary by Oshii discuss his work is always a major plus.<br /><br />Overall, this is still a solid Blu-ray disc release albeit not perfect but for fans of Mamoru Oshii or \\"GHOST IN THE SHELL\\", definitely give \\"INNOCENCE\\" a try!So, this film had quite an interesting storyline in itself behind-the-scenes and you learn a lot of this through the commentary and the featurette.    \\"GHOST IN THE SHELL 2: INNOCENCE\\" is not going to be for everyone.

It's complex.    But I think that's what attracts me to his works is because it is intelligent but yet you manage to find beauty in the worlds that he creates.  \\"GHOST IN THE SHELL 2: INNOCENCE\\" and the original \\"GHOST IN THE SHELL\\" are perfect examples of that complexity and beauty of visuals and storyline.  Some get it and some won't.   But once you become a fan of his work, you realize that he's a master storyteller with a keen eye of what he wants to accomplish.  And you know that you will need to watch his films again.    As for the Blu-ray, video quality is well done.  There is so much detail incorporated that the 1080P High-Definition really makes those details come out.  And really, beautiful sharp and vibrant colors. But on theflip side, there is also a bit of disappointment with no DTS-HD or TrueHD track in this US release but yet knowing that it's in the Japanese release.  And that is quite surprising for a Bandai Entertainment Blu-ray release.    But the Dolby Digital 5.1 track is still very good but for audiophiles that want the best in their films on Blu-ray, I can understand why one would be upset that the uncompressed audio track(s) were not included in this US release.    With that being said, I did feel that this Blu-ray release was still highly enjoyable and to hear the commentary by Oshii discuss his work is always a major plus.    Overall, this is still a solid Blu-ray disc release albeit not perfect but for fans of Mamoru Oshii or \\"GHOST IN THE SHELL\\", definitely give \\"INNOCENCE\\" a try!

B001EN71CW|2.0|It does not differ appreciably from watching the DVDs with decent upscaling (say, a PS3). If anything it looked a bit worse, because the graininess is now \\"sharper\\". Buy the DVDs, they're equivalent, and much cheaper.
B000EK76K8|5.0|I do a lot of video editing for a not-for-profit community cable channel.  I wanted to display in process production screens on a wide screen HDTV (37\\" Sharp Aquos) as I edited the video from my iMAC.  Because this adapters output is DVI which the Aquos does not support I decided to install a passive DVI-HDMI adapter and a 15' HDMI cable.  The result is wonderful.  The presentation is crisp and clear and the installation was simplicity itself.  If you're looking to display your iMAC screen images on a hi-def monitor or projector than this adapter is highly recommended.

B001Q1QF2O|4.0|Quite a bit different from her first album, Lily seems really upset at everything and everybody here. She has a message to get across and spares nobody's feelings doing it. A powerful collection of emotionally driven tunes that dictate every raw nerve she can connect to. The more you hear, the more you understand what she's feeling and easily begin to sympathise with her. This CD is a GIANT step forward for Lily and will clear the road ahead for her obvious success.
B001P5Q6FC|5.0|3 and a half stars is more like it...    I thought I liked this album at first, but now that I've heard it several times, it's my least favorite lamb of god. It's just a little too \\"hooky\\" for my taste.  For instance, lines like \\"So go and weave your tale of woe...\\" in \\"Set To Fail\\" - decent song & lyrics, but the execution & arrangement are just a little too catchy, in my opinion, for lamb of god.     And these catchy little melodies are peppered throughout 'wrath'- they're not horrible, they just get old fast. So I much prefer \\"Ashes Of The Wake\\" or \\"As The Palaces Burn\\"- those are great albums that tend to sound fresh again & again. I like \\"Sacrament\\" too, though it walks a fine line in some places. This one steps over the line I think. Also, I prefer Blythe's earlier vocal style- here he's a little too refined.     I will say there are 3 songs here that rank among log's very best; \\"Grace,\\" \\"Broken Hands\\" and \\"Reclamation\\". But overall, not the type of classic metal album I'll listen to again and again.

B000N6U0E2|5.0|Based on the true story of entrepreneur/millionaire Chris Gardner,  the movie follows the struggles of a homeless single father trying to raise his son in 1980's San Francisco, while pursuing the grand dream of becoming a stockbroker.  The story evokes tears of sadness and tears of joy, as it takes the viewer through a real daily struggle not uncommon to so many in the world around us.  A rags-to-riches story, yes, but even more a story of determination and hard work and a story of human potential.<br /><br />Will Smith performs his best role ever as Chris Gardner, and his real life son Jaden plays the  younger Christopher.  Their chemistry is inspiring, as is the rest of the film.<br /><br />This 2006 movie is rated PG-13 with good reason, however, and I don't recommend it as a \\"family film,\\" as it has some brief language, and the subject matter is too intense for children.  For teens, however, and adults, it is a must-see movie!
B001EO748M|5.0|I have now viewed this season twice since receiving it.  I am impressed with the quality of the production and am pleased with the facts surrounding this part of English history.  Some have suggested that all was not exactly correct.  I believe that the basic information about Ann Boleyn and Katherine of Aragon are included in this story.  After all, it it is entertainment and not a history class.      When I was in high school, it was mandatory that \\"Anne of the Thousand Days\\" was to be seen in order to discuss the story in class.  Apart from the sex scenes, this would be a good program to teach English hisotry surronding the 1500s.    Very very pleased with the purchase and with the story of Henry and his six wives.
160459201X|5.0|This is a very basic book about how to make use of our subconscious mind to change our behavior. Original edition of the book was first published in 1963. This is a revised edition. A reader can sense that there are additional materials being added which makes it appears to be rather long-winded. I have not seen the original copy, I think it is a mistake to add materials to the book by a different author which caused the book to lose its natural flow. Having said that the book is a must read for those who want to know more about the power of our subconscious mind.    The book contains many case studies and also lays out the steps for you to apply the various techniques in harnessing the power of the subconscious mind although with little stress on emotion and feeling which is a very important component in the law of manifestation.    This book should stand out as pioneer in the studies of human consciousness and what has evolved into the currently in vogue law of attraction.

0060555661|4.0|The most informative and helpful chapters for me were 11 and 12 where the author discusses how to analyze a company's balance sheet and evaluate earnings. In addition Chapters 13,14 and 17,18 were of special value since comparison of different companies balance sheets was done. Using what I learned from this book I was able to put together a simple litmus test for me to even consider a company. This test requires: (1)An increase of at least 10% year over year in stockholder's equity and (2) an increase of at least 15% year over year in retained earnings.This indicates that the increase in equity is due to earnings that are retained on the balance sheet indicating growth. If a company did not pass these requirement it is dropped from consideration , otherwise further analysis was done.  When to sell on the other hand was not as clear. Selling when the balance sheet deteriorates may be too late since by then ususally the stock has dropped significantly.   You will thus need a  book that allows you to objectively decide when to sell.The book [[ASIN:0743224906 Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World]] discusses how to determine bottoms and tops in stocks using more classic combinations of technical and fundamental indicators.

B000ZN802W|5.0|\\"The circles they grow<br />and they swallow people whole\\"--Eddie Vedder<br />_____________________________________________<br /><br />It is so easy in life to get wrapped up in our daily routines and comfortable habits.  INTO THE WILD is an inspirational story about a young man that broke the chains of conventional thinking and walked his own path.  I was expecting a basic, feel-good story that can't escape a certain level of foolish sentimentality.  But this journey is much more complex.<br /><br />It's the true story of Christopher McCandless, AKA Alexander Supertramp, a young man who abandoned his life of luxury in order to quench his thirst for adventure.  He was a college grad from a wealthy family, but just had different plans than those that were laid out for him.<br /><br />He donated his $25,000 savings to the hungry and embarked on his quest of fufillment in the wilderness.  Becoming one with nature.  His journey had one ultimate goal--Alaska.  He was ill-prepared to survive the harsh elements, having just his rifle and a field guide for edible plants.  Sound a little crazy?<br /><br />Well yes, it very well might be.  But Chris was an educated man, plus he had quite an infectious personality.  People seemed to be drawn toward his free spirit, which was evident in his numerous encounters along the way.<br /><br />So I doubt he was totally naive to the dangers his brave quest entailed.  He was running towards something, but quite possibly away from something as well.<br /><br />Emile Hirsch does an absolutely amazing job in this role.  Sean Penn also does an incredible job directing this story.  It really captures the heart of this wayward adventure, which was courageous, admirable, and also quite delusional.  A must see film.

B000X1Z0BU|1.0|I was so excited to get this film on DVD because I had missed its cinematic release but had heard so much great buzz about it... What a HUGE disappointment!! This was the most boring movie I've watched in ages, horribly slow, completely uninteresting and thoroughly unbelievable. The lead actor/musician is clearly quite talented, but there was absolutely no chemistry between him and the wooden lead actress/musician who is *painful* to watch. I can't believe they ended up having a real-life relationship because there are NO sparks between them whatsoever. The most realistic part of the film is when they meet at the beginning and he seems irritated and put-off by her. That's how I felt throughout the entire thing. I did like some of the songs, but apparently not the same ones as everyone else because the songs they repeated a few times were not my favorites. I can't believe this won any awards of any kind. I saw that previous reviewer who disliked it thought that maybe he couldn't appreciate it because he was a man, but let me tell you, as a woman who enjoys musicals, foreign films, romances, etc. I HATED this film. Avoid at all costs.
0800177363|5.0|Awakenings grabs your attention from the very beginning and it never lets go. The plot moves along at a good pace and the acting is superb. Moreover, this film is somewhat based on the real life experiences of Dr. Oliver Sacks, a prominent psychiatrist. The cinematography is excellent and the choreography also shines; this is not a film you'll forget anytime soon.<br /><br />When the action starts we meet a healthy young boy named Leonard Lowe (Anthony J. Nici) and two of his friends playing and going to school in the 1930s. Unfortunately, Leonard develops an illness so disabling he cannot write his exams in school. Leonard must stay home every day and he becomes more and more ill over time. We then flash forward to the summer of 1969 to meet Dr. Malcolm Sayer (Robin Williams) who, despite his relative lack of clinical experience, gets hired to practice psychiatry at a hospital in The Bronx area of New York City. Dr. Sayer's coworkers, including the doctors, think very little of him; and Sayer's only friend is one of the nurses named Eleanor Costello (Julie Kavner). Many of the patients in the chronic care hospital have been either comatose or unresponsive for decades; and clearly the staff has given up on them. Nevertheless, Sayer and Nurse Costello do extensive chart research and they find that many if not all of the patients had encephalitis when they were younger--could this be a clue as to how to treat them?<br /><br />Sayer thinks he has an answer that can help the patients; but his boss and colleagues bristle when he suggests using a drug called L-Dopa. Sayer thinks that this drug could help the patients at the hospital although it was designed to treat entirely different disorders. Dr. Sayer bravely insists that at least one patient should be allowed to try the drug on an experimental basis; and thus the now grown up Leonard Lowe (Robert DeNiro) is given the drug.<br /><br />Much to the delight of Sayer, Leonard \\"awakens\\" from his relatively catatonic state and experiences the change in the world that has come about during his nearly thirty years of being \\"away.\\" Leonard is shocked that he is now a man; and his mother Mrs. Lowe (Ruth Nelson) is sometimes hurt when Leonard wants to spend time with a woman instead of her! Leonard also wants to go for a walk alone outside the hospital; but even Dr. Sayer is worried that he could be taken advantage of all alone in the real world without some supervision.<br /><br />Yes, even more patients get better with the proper dosages of the drug L-Dopa. But will things stay that way? Watch the movie and find out!<br /><br />In particular, the performances in this film are unforgettable. Robert DeNiro is stellar as the grown up Leonard Lowe; and Robin Williams surely does a huge stretch from being the funny, wacky comedian to playing the role of a somewhat nerdy doctor in this movie. Julie Kavner also turns in a convincing performance as the one staff member who truly believes in Dr. Sayer.<br /><br />Awakenings deserves to be in your DVD collection. This film will appeal especially to people like me who have worked with troubled or sick individuals in hospitals or clinics; and people who enjoy human interest stories will appreciate this motion picture as well.nge in the world that has come about during his nearly thirty years of being \\"away.\\" Leonard is shocked that he is now a man; and his mother Mrs. Lowe (Ruth Nelson) is sometimes hurt when Leonard wants to spend time with a woman instead of her!

B000GGSMB2|2.0|I could never figure out the appeal of SCARFACE in the years after it came out.<br /><br />Easy to watch but easily discarded.  This story brings out the worst of Oliver Stone and Brian DePalma.  And Al Pacino for that matter.  His Tony Montana is almost a parody of a coked-out Cuban drug dealer.  Tony is a scumbag.  He was a scumbag in Cuba, he was dumped on Miami where he really excelled as a scumbag, and he ended up in a gloriously over-the-top scumbag death.<br /><br />The movie came out in the 1980s and was pretty much forgotten...until rap music.  Then the rappers gave SCARFACE a second life.  When they're not shooting at each other, they're worshipping Tony Montana.  I live in the Western U.S. and you can chart any mall's decline when posters and blankets and wall hangings of Tony Montana begin appearing in the storefront windows.  SCARFACE is a thug's dream.  Its enduring popularity owes more to the growing scumbag population in our popular culture than any cinematic merit of its own.<br /><br />But the movie is watchable.  I just watched the beginning on cable again the other night.  But it wallows in excesses and never makes you care about anyone in it.<br /><br />To make my point: try to imagine how it would play if Tony Montana went into business with the Corleone Family from THE GODFATHER PARTS 1 and 2 (I don't acknowledge PART 3) or even the equally-violent but much better developed thugs from GOODFELLAS.  How does Tony stack up against real characters now?

0743442539|5.0|To label this book just as a spy book it is a tremendous injustice and oversimplification. \\"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\\" is manly about our fatalism.     I've never read anything to even remotely resemble the style. It takes a few pages to get used, but once you get it, you are immersed. The story has some flaws, but it is extremely intriguing. The characters will stay with me forever. There is no much background about them. We know them through their reactions, ethics and spare thoughts and that's more than enough.    Even without the cold war, \\"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\\" still makes sense.

B000000H6Y|3.0|3 1/2    Though it may squelch and squeak over soothe a little more then you may remember upon original purchase, even somewhat tinned production, lame humor, and darkened sound-scape overkill, the group's patented brand of sluggishly beautiful goth-metal holds up, a humble variety and many different approaches taken throughout not lost upon the positive cross-demographics the band found success in. They keep the balance keenly marked between straight-bashed rockers and more heavy-breathing chillers, but accelerate way further with the latter.
B001PA0FFO|2.0|This movie was intriguing to me because of the presence of Meryl, whom I think has had some really stellar movie roles (other than her turn in \\"Mamma Mia\\", which I didn't quite like). However, there was *something* about this film and especially her performance that seemed altogether redundant. I have never seen Meryl work so hard at 'trying' to be a character, rather than just 'be' that character. It was amazing to watch. And for all the wrong reasons.<br /><br />I must say the only saving grace is Amy Adams, who is excellent as a confused and morally divided person who prefers believing the easiest explanation. On one hand, the movie wants to work as a moral tale to demonstrate that even in these so-called religious institutions, no one is sure of anything, let alone God and various forms of philosophy. On the other, it is determined to work as a star vehicle for Streep, who pouts, slams and overacts throughout the entire film - with almost no real punch to it.<br /><br />That this is considered 'serious cinema' is sad. Yes, the 'shocking' confrontation between Streep and Viola Davis is interesting only because' of the Davis characters' reaction, but once you move past that, its amazing that Viola even garnered an Oscar nomination for barely ten minutes on screen (she was good, but not great). Bewildering. Its amazing what nonsense can pass off as 'thoughtful, meaningful cinema' these days.<br /><br />Think of this as \\"religious-institution art-house flick for Dummies\\" and youre spot-on.<br /><br />Two Stars.

I was having dinner with some friends and the conversation turned to Scrubs and I mentioned that I was always impressed with the musical selections that were featured in the episodes.  This led to a conversation about how Zach Braff had a friend that he is always plugging which was Joshua Radin.  I informed my host that I had never heard the name and my friend of course runs to the cd player and puts in the We Were Here.<br /><br />This was a great cd and the music was so honest and seemed to be from the heart.  I was very impressed that it was just the singer and his guitar.  So many new bands try to over compensate for their lack of experience by over producing the music.  This was not the case here, the music was simple and straight forward.  My friend gave me her copy of the cd and I have played it non stop and have started to catch myself singing along.  There are no standout songs that would by your typical single, instead you get once of the most solid debut albums with great songs from start to finish (the last song Only You by Yaz is hands down my favorite).<br /><br />I have over a 1000 cds and this one is easily a top 20 in my collection.  It is perfect for being by yourself and just enjoying nothing but the music, it really puts you in a happy place.

B001N26GFM|5.0|My sister just left a voicemail for me. She sounded very hurt and upset because I made her watch this film. She said it was very depressing. But I think she didn't understand the relevance, the beauty, the heart-sink. I don't really think I can make her see it but then this film is for people like me and no, I'm not going to go into myself.<br /><br />What is absolutely remarkable about THE BOY IN STRIPED PAJAMAS is how there's no parallel monalogue of sorts. There is no sense of a common opinion being preached to you. The film very subtly gets its point across, the dialogue is apt and witty, the accent is English, the sets are wonderful, the characters all seem to leave an impression and towards the end of the film when you finally realize why the film is titled so, you will learn to appreciate it.<br /><br />On some message boards, I read some backlash towards this film but I think naysayers can say what they can yet you must not ignore the particular character, central character. By the time the credits roll, you'll be too stunned to move. I hope this gets its due by the time it's out.
B000006P8I|3.0|after owning this for a number of years I still can't make out exactly what the effort as a whole was meant to achieve.  While I really dislike Space Oddity, a meandering collection of pretentious folk songs and the stupidest 'instrumental' ever recorded, I don't give up on this period of Bowie's work.  Here his music seems much more genuine, a phase that did not show him as a wannabe hipster, which is probably why this album failed to go anywhere, even so much as to leave SO as his 'first' album.  Often times this album seems all over the place, but in fact much of the songs were recorded at different intervals, and the shifting--not evolving--of styles shows that he was not entirely sure what to do.  I wouldn't look at this album as a collection of his best recordings he'd done either; there are plenty of great early Decca singles that didn't make it on here.<br /><br />Like another reviewer stated 'Please Mr. Gravedigger' is by far the best track, not to mention most interesting; it's clear Bowie had some great ideas and a powerful ambition to do things his way.  My other favorites would be 'Rubber Band' and 'Join The Gang'.  Most of the tracks still fall into either folk-esque realms or standard pop of the time but they're all still recognizably Bowie.<br /><br />Still, I would not get this particular release, which honestly is a waste since there are a number of compilations that feature this entire album +.  But for completists who want to own the album AS it was released then this is a great gem, but if you're looking for more for your dollar look elsewhere, but don't pass up this early material, it's definitely worth looking into even if just for historical content.

B001KVZ6FC|5.0|Clint Eastwood has absolutely outdone himself with \\"Gran Torino\\".  I was expecting another tough-guy movie but what I got was something else entirely.  Yes, the Walt Kowalski character is indeed a tough guy, but he's so much more than just that.  Gone is the one-dimensional predictability of the \\"Dirty Harry\\" days.  The greatness of this movie is in the complexity and evolution of Eastwood's character.  He pulls it off masterfully while painting a gritty, realistic picture of life in a rough, gang-infested neighborhood.<br /><br />For the sake of avoiding any spoilers, I won't get into a discussion of the plot except to say that the climax of the story was entirely unexpected.  The setup certainly suggested a very different ending.  The story will appeal to a wide variety of viewers.  This is a must-see movie.
031606792X|4.0|If I could give it 3.5 stars, that's what it would get, but since I can only choose three or four, I'll choose four.    This was a somewhat disappointing conclusion to an overall good series.  In many points throughout the novel, I felt that Meyer was rushing the ending and unsure of where she wanted to take the story.  And my biggest beef is with Bella and Edward's daughter's name: Renesmee.  What the heck is that all about?    At the beginning of the book, we're following Bella and her discovery of her pregnancy.  All seems to be going well, and then we slip into book two.  Book two is Jacob's perspective, and this threw me off kilter.  Throughout the entire series, we've seen Bella's perspective of everything.  And suddenly, we have to see things from Jacob's POV?  The final book is an odd place to suddenly see things from another POV.  And then in book three, when the POV switched back to Bella, it didn't feel like it was Bella's perspective any longer.  It was as if Meyer lost her capability to see things from Bella's side.    But I digress.  Book three really picked the plot line up and made me want to finish reading.  The encounters with the Volturi and the question of whether or not the Cullens would survive was a page turner.  Fans do get their happy ending, but all in all, I felt it was rushed and contrived.  Meyer could have certainly wrapped this series up a little better.

0061142026|5.0|Stardust is a superb story, hearkening back to both ancient fairy tales and to Tolkien's beloved works. It pulls you in to its magical world and makes you believe in it without question. At the same time, there is a sense of modernism to the story that adds a complex element to the story. Many of the characters, even the magical ones, are recognizable as the heroes and heroines of modern stories, as well as the fairy tales we all heard as children. The love that drives Tristan Thorn to journey through Faerie, looking for his beloved's star, is at once timeless and innocent. He remains an innocent throughout the story, just like the young adventurers in the old stories.<br /><br />Everyone pursuing the star does so for a different, but elemental reason. Tristan seeks the star for love. Septimus and Primus, heirs to the throne of Stormhold, pursue the star for power. And the old witch searches for the star to regain her youth. All of these things - love, power, and youth (health) - are sought everyday by all people in their different ways, meaning that the reader is able to connect with this story on many levels.<br /><br />In terms of simple storytelling, Gaiman once again delivers. The language is flawless, and it is here that I could sense the influence of Tolkien, which is more than appropriate for the story. The characters are engaging, funny, terrifying, and real. The setting comes alive on every page. This book made it into my dreams as I read, and for me, that alone is proof of its magnificence. I would recommend this book to all fans of fantasy and adventure.
0375704027|4.0|Unlike Murakami's other novels (e.g. [[ASIN:0679743464 Hard-Boiled Wonderland]]), Norwegian Wood has no technobabble, no fantastical or supernatural elements. Without those frills, it's clear that Murakami is really an old-fashioned writer, and owes a lot to Kawabata and Soseki. Murakami's evocations of university life are reminiscent of [[ASIN:1929280106 Sanshiro]] (and his characters, like Soseki's, write letters constantly), and the very structure of his plot is identical to [[ASIN:0679762655 Thousand Cranes]] -- the first love is passionate but doomed, and the second love is sweet, but hampered by the protagonist's alienation. Of course, Murakami's story is purely about the angst of reasonably well-to-do teenagers, without the wartime lament lurking beneath the surface of Kawabata's opus. In order to make this seem less frivolous, Murakami makes his main characters noticeably less wealthy than their peers (though still wealthy enough to enjoy their idleness), and adds a dark undertone in the form of a series of romantic suicides incidental to the plot.    But one still shouldn't quite take Murakami at his word. Even here, the story has a certain deliberate glamour. The protagonist claims to be just an ordinary guy, with no particular talents. But nearly every woman in the story throws herself at him sooner or later. All his problems are caused entirely by the difficulty of managing these women. No wonder the book was so popular with young people -- the protagonist's modest self-deprecation is so charismatic that it can be viewed as a kind of confidence. He suffers by sleeping with lots of girls, which is really not suffering at all. It is noteworthy that he never loses face a single time in the book. He always manages to keep his cool, his women are never able to embarrass him. The only time when he is vulnerable is in the very end, and there too his solitude is heroic rather than desperate. Real suffering is awkward, mundane, and ungainly, not cool and collected.    The protagonist's saving grace is that he really is charismatic. He doesn't whine, and he really does try to do right by at least some of his women. There are no villains in the book (no analogue of Chikako from Thousand Cranes), all the characters are quite likeable, with the possible exception of the playboy Nagasawa (but at least he repents eventually).    Murakami's name-dropping (a constant in all his work) is less irritating here than, say, in [[ASIN:0679775439 The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle]]. There's less of it, and Murakami makes an effort to connect his pop culture references to his storyline and characters. Like, instead of just mentioning [[ASIN:0743273567 The Great Gatsby]] once (perhaps naming it as a good book for cooking pasta to), he will actually cite the contents of the book and bring up the novel multiple times in conversation. The titular Beatles song also has some relevance to the plot.    This is also Murakami's most erotic book. He writes about sex a lot, in every book of his that I've read, and it's usually not the high point of his writing. He's very explicit in this book, as well. For the most part, though, the explicit parts of Norwegian Wood don't seem vulgar and pointless, because they have a certain fresh-faced innocence. Midori is supposed to be \\"sexually liberated,\\" according to the back cover, but actually she doesn't come across as being any more liberated than Naoko, or any other female character in the novel. And, by today's standard, they all seem charmingly serious. It reminds me of [[ASIN:B0006BN70S Shintaro Ishihara]], whose most decadent and experienced female characters are always trembling virgins deep down.    And anyway, [[ASIN:0870113658 The Lake]] had a lot of perverse desire too, and even Murakami's one scene with gratuitous lesbian themes is probably just inspired by [[ASIN:0679761055 Beauty and Sadness]]. Murakami writes about it more than Kawabata, though. By the end, it feels like sex is the only way Murakami can imagine of depicting meaningful emotion or having his characters express themselves. Eventually, you notice that whenever his characters are supposed to have a true meeting of souls, he goes straight to the sex scene. In his defense, though, a young man like the protagonist probably would think like that in real life.    In the same way, the numerous romantic suicides eventually become an awkward plot device, because most of them occur with seemingly no reason. Murakami just isn't into the whole \\"show, don't tell\\" thing; when he needs a side character like the protagonist's dead friend Kizuki, he gives you a brief synopsis of the character's personality, without bothering to bring it out in conversation, then skips to the catastrophic plot device. I understand that Kizuki is only important to the plot insofar as the other characters think about him, but still, I think the book could have used at least one scene with him talking to the protagonist, to illustrate why he might have felt so isolated. It would also have helped show the gradual change in Naoko. But maybe Murakami isn't interested in that. He's interested in documenting Naoko's changing feelings -- but only documenting them, not showing how they naturally emerge from a single personality.    In his other books, when Murakami doesn't know what to say, he spirals off into fantasy. Here, the realistic setting deprives him of the easy way out, and forces him to come up with personalities and characters. As a result, Norwegian Wood is his best book, and he never said anything interesting anywhere else that he didn't say here. For instance, The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle reuses many details from Norwegian Wood -- the inexplicable death of the wife's sister, the smart-mouthed but lonely secondary female character, even the \\"warm mud\\" metaphor -- and [[ASIN:0375726055 Sputnik Sweetheart]] is just a watered-down retelling of the exact same story. If you're wondering what Murakami is all about, you can safely limit yourself to Norwegian Wood.

1572816295|5.0|This deck is full of stunning detail with black outlines and dreamy water coloured pallet. Even though the art is done this way it is not at all washed out and it is full of vibrant colour. The back features two birds on a cream background, which is classic and feminine.<br /><br />It showcases many little creatures of the night, quiet gothic looking people and central figures, fae, fairy tale characters and pretty much anything else from a gifted imagination. This deck has a gothic like theme, which will definitely find an audience with young adults, as it is still quiet romantic and not too dark. It has some splashes of Tim Burton and Dr Susses hidden within her artwork, but it does not take away from her creation at all.<br /><br />The artist and author of the booklet actually set out to create a Tarot Deck allowing the symbolism to draw her in, this incredibly detailed piece of work took her over a year and a half to complete.<br /><br />There is a completely different feel to a deck that has been created this way, unlike some decks that are just thrown together from artwork done by well known fantasy artists, those decks feel messy and are terrible to read with.<br /><br />The booklet has a small description of the card, the upright meaning and the reversal meaning; there is also a Celtic cross spread description in the back.<br /><br />The Paulina Tarot is elegant, detailed and full of stunning imaginative artwork and I highly recommend it.

B000FQVY2C|5.0|I bought this album on vinyl when it first came out, entranced by the title track ... but I really couldn't appreciate it at the time, because I was simply too naive & callow. Returning to it now, though, I can better understand why it was so troubling, even though it fascinated me in a way that few albums ever have.<br /><br />An immersion in world history, in Dada & Surrealism, as well as more complex & challenging music, opened this album up for me. The gorgeous baroque surface remains enchanting, of course; but the ennui, the world-weariness, the despair & chaos seething just below the civilized veneer are all too apparent.<br /><br />And so the \\"nonsense lyrics\\" are clearly the Dada-inspired response of the Western psyche at the end of its badly frayed tether to the monstrous horrors of the 20th Century. The characters in these songs continue to go through the motions of an organized, seemingly purposeful life ... but darkness is breaking through the cracks, and the cracks are getting wider with each day.<br /><br />As for the bonus tracks -- are they essential? Not really. But they are a treat, feeling a bit like the crumbling scraps & fragments of Western civilization that the ornate screen of the finished album barely conceals. As such, it seems to me that they add to the overall tone of the work. But that's just a personal interpretation, of course.<br /><br />The in-depth essay that accompanies this re-release sheds a great deal of light on the work. It doesn't fit into any safely defined category, unless it's that of The Unique. I think it's a seminal work in its way, condensing a cauldron of the 20th Century's history & art into deceptively lovely songs. Most highly recommended!

B000002TYX|5.0|First of all, this set is great.  No other band could do what The Beatles did (and most likely none ever will).  My only quibble is with the amount of needless editing.  Several tracks take a hard hit.  'Can't Buy Me Love' Take 2 - here with a guitar solo from take 1 crammed in for no good reason!  Not only that but the booklet lists this as stereo and it is not.  The full Take 2 has been on bootleg since the late '80's in stereo.  Also edited is the 1963 take of 'One After 909'; understandable since two takes were used to create a master.  But a much better edit was made for the aborted 'Sessions' album in 1984, with a better quality guitar solo.  The track 'Shout!' from the BBC special Around The Beatles is included in true stereo, yet entire chunks of the song are missing, editing it down from over 2 minutes to under one and a half!<br /><br />As I said the booklet lists many of the songs as being in stereo, yet if you really listen to them (like through headphones) you'll hear that they are at best 'mock stereo', at worst having only one instrument shuffled from one channel to the other.  Listen to how the Beatles original 4-Track recordings were mixed compared to these outtakes from the same sessions.  You'd think they'd have tried to mix them they way they did the 1960's originals for a more authentic sound.<br /><br />All in all, this is a CD to get to be sure.  But it won't kill bootleg recordings unless they quit editing things for no good reason.

I was really hoping it would look more like a journal replica than a media tie-in book. The Indiana Jones diary, while not getting it entirely right either, did a good job at trying to look like it was someone's journal, something you'd find in the character's house and not on a store shelf.<br />* The fonts. Sometimes the entries are in a handwriting font which is great! Other times it's in a type font. Did John put the journal in a typewriter? Maybe there's a reason for this but if so, it escapes me.<br /><br />There's plenty of strange info within, including the full excorism and bits of folklore and legends from around the country. I was surprised to find a mention of Dighton Rock in MA which is in the area I grew up in, it's one of those things you wouldn't expect anyone to know about unless they lived there.<br />One of the other things I really liked was they included references to the events in the Supernatural comics.

1416594884|4.0|As an unabashed admirer of John Le Carre's novels harking back to the brilliant The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, as well as his later work which evinces an increasingly ambiguous moral universe, I find myself somewhat saddened by the current state of the master's art. In his earlier writing one always found an almost crystalline surface of many facets that glittered ethical dilemma in all directions. Depending on where one sat in the room of the mind one saw an entirely different aspect of the moral issues that Le Carre raised. His writing and his thematic material were pliable. They possessed a malleability that prevented the reader from seeing any issue in simplistic terms. That is what made his work so remarkable. That plastic malleability has been removed from his latest work. Le Carre now seems to deal in often rigid Anti-American absolutes, a by-product of the Bush years and his \\"War on Terror\\". Without that sense of moral ambiguity Le Carre becomes just another writer. A good one, of course, but a writer without the depth and resonance necessary to create great work. A Most Wanted Man is a decent suspense thriller but everything wonderful that I remember about Le Carre's older work seems to have vanished. And that's a pity.

B001MW0IY8|5.0|It is very difficult to review an opus like THE CRYING LIGHT. Words often fail us in front of such beauty and compositional skills. In front of THAT voice and THOSE words. One thing is certain though: Antony's new album is one of the most important records of the year, and one that has already taken our hearts in its tender clutch.    Here is a track-by-track commentary:    .HER EYES ARE UNDERNEATH THE GROUND.  The album opens with this sweetly tense ballad where piano, voice and a very understated string arrangement intertwine to mark the beginning of the journey. A sense of awe pervades both singer and listener, while the coda of whirring strings summons a womb-like atmosphere. Alea iacta est. You cannot go back now.    .EPILEPSY IS DANCING.  An abrupt shift into adulthood and illness. The music gently swings to a waltzing tempo guided by cellos and acoustic guitars. The sudden changes in mood are very moving and precipitate the dramatic/ecstatc ending of the song.    .ONE DOVE.  A gospel-jazz, nocturnal ballad, where piano, voice and perfectly poised horns create a shivering mood. Antony's mood is a filigree of sculpted syllables that displays immense power via subtraction. And yes, doves do indeed die.    .KISS MY NAME.  The only song driven by a graceful, shuffling rhythm, mixing a tarantella-flecked soul feel with a subtly swirling string arrangement. The poppiest, most radio-friendly moment, but heartbreak is around the corner.    .THE CRYING LIGHT.  A deeply spiritual, imposing song. Nature and Man facing each other, the possibiity of love and acceptance becoming real. Voice, piano and handclaps build up a psychedelic soul mood.    .ANOTHER WORLD.  One of the sparsest tracks, where a slow brook of piano notes underpins the vocal and some guitar feedback. People started talking about THE CRYING LIGHT being an ecology-themed work when this was released as a single. A rather superficial explanation, in our opinion, as the song could just as well be a farewell letter from a dying man.    .DAYLIGHT AND THE SUN.  A vast composition full of orchestral surges and a gospel-inflected invocation. Definitely the centrepiece of the work, it effortlessly marries NINA SIMONE to STRANDED-era ROXY MUSIC (think SUNSET) ending in a calmer coda that sounds at times like a beatless version of HYMN OF THE BIG WHEEL by MASSIVE ATTACK.    .AEON.  The torrid soul track. Over an OTIS REDDING guitar pattern, voice and horns engage in their Battle of Restraint, creating an atmosphere that is pristine and intoxicating at the same time. The Fire of Love and the River of Time melt into this stunning East/West spiritual connection.    .DUST AND WATER.  The sparsest, shortest track, consisting of just a drone and a delicious Afro melody that brings to mind COME YE by NINA SIMONE. A moment of relative calm, but still a deep meditation on human destiny.    .EVERGLADE.  The album closes with one of Antony's most perfect creations. A ballad for voice and orchestra with a strong Tin Pan Alley feel, it simply manages to devastate you in less than three minutes. It has been described by its author as a vision of Paradise, and you can only agree: its alternation of longing and joy reaches such dizzy heights that you will gasp from the deepest corner of your soul. One question remains: is EVERGLADE the new OVER THE RAINBOW?    Enjoy.
B0018O4YSQ|5.0|I can see that there are very little reviews of the blu-ray and more of the old standard DVD edition from late 90's. But I love the new director's cut that was released for the blu-ray system it give a more thrilling and more mystirious look. The narration in the original was taken out in the director's cut because it gave to much away too quickly and the first 1-1&1/2 minute of the film was put at a later time in the film so that when you see the character wake up in the beginning you are in the dark (no pun intended) with him as well. The HD quality is perfect and ther 7.1 audio is amazing both restored to perfection. I will not give more of the story away cause some might have not seen the DC version and everyone hate a spoiler. But I will say that the Blu-ray disc is worth getting and i promises that once you see the DC version you will not see the original again even though the original was good.
031606792X|4.0|I went into this book with low expectations.  Having read the first three and finding myself annoyed with Meyer's writing, I wasn't expecting much to change for the final installment.  However, I was pleasantly surprised.    I loved Breaking Dawn as much as I loved hating the first three, and finally I felt like my time spent reading Meyer's mediocre writing had finally paid off.  Breaking Dawn is fun.  Sure it's cheesy at times, the characters are sometimes lacking, and it's not that much of an intelligent young adult/teen series when compared to Harry Potter or His Dark Materials, but Meyer isn't as repetitive in Breaking Dawn and the story moves along at a good pace in comparison to the other books.  All of the books in the series are entertaining, even if I wanted to chuck a couple of them across the room at times, but I had no problems with Breaking Dawn and was actually entranced.    The only thing that slightly annoyed me was switching to Jacob's POV.  It just wasn't consistent in the series, so why now all of a sudden?  It did give more insight into things, which I was grateful for and really the series couldn't have ended without, but it was still irritating.  That is the only major thing.  Other stuff that was even slightly annoying is just too small or insignificant to mention, and that is saying a lot coming from me--Meyer seems to have matured a bit in her writing skill (or maybe her editor got better in the editing department?).    All of the characters are still one-dimensional, but more likeable in this last installment.  Finally I found myself NOT wishing for Bella's death (she still is not my favorite character, never will be, but she was incredibly tolerable in Breaking Dawn).  That alone is enough for me to consider Breaking Dawn the best book in the series.
B001TH16DS|3.0|While I always thought Star Trek series prices were a bit too high (no fault of Amazon), hopefully this information from \\"High Def Digest\\" will help decide if it is worth the $80 price tag.    From \\"High Def Digest\\"    Marking the first 'Star Trek' series to come to Blu-ray, Paramount is preparing to beam up 'The Original Series' to high-def in mid-May.    Though not the first appearance of Kirk & Co.'s maiden TV voyage on high-def (Paramount previously released the complete 'Original Series' as an HD DVD/DVD combo box set in 2007), 'Star Trek: The Original Series - Season 1' will kick off the studio's launch of the 'Star Trek' TV franchise on Blu-ray.     Paramount has set a May 12 touchdown for the collection, which culls all 29 first-season episodes.    Presented in both their original broadcast versions as well as newly-retooled versions (boasting all-new CGI effects), 'Season 1' contains all 29 episodes, spread across seven BD-50 dual-layer discs.    Both versions of each episode will be available via seamless branching, presented in 1080p/AVC MPEG-4 video (1.33:1) and remastered English DTS-HD Lossless Master Audio 7.1 Surround sound.    Extras will see a spate of 9 making-of featurettes, including \\"Spacelift: Transporting Trek into the 21st Century,\\" \\"Reflections on Spock,\\" \\"Life Beyond Trek: William Shatner,\\" \\"To Boldly Go... Season One,\\" \\"The Birth of a Timeless Legacy,\\" \\"Sci-Fi Visionaries,\\" \\"Billy Blackburn's Treasure Chest: Rare Home Movies\\" and \\"Kiss 'N' Tell: Romance in the 23rd Century.\\"    Exclusive to the Blu-ray will be Starfleet Access, which presents picture-in-picture and pop-up trivia tracks on six complete episodes (including the show's pilot, \\"The Menagerie Parts 1 & 2\\").
B000002INJ|5.0|Manowar's Kings of Metal is an amazing album! I think this is on of their best releases, and probably the start of their epic fantasy conan-esque releases.<br /><br />The overall quality of the album is awesome. They use real choirs and even a church organ on one of the tracks. One song is a narration of a grandfather telling a story to his grandson. It is also the first album where they quit trying to pursue commercial success and ditched that mainstream sound; like what you hear on Fighting the World. Their musicianship defiantly matured since prior albums yet they still have the, \\"there is no other than Manowar mindset.\\" They truly achieve an epic feel, especially with the track \\"Crown and the Ring (Lament of Kings).\\" A symphonic track that gives you the chills. They have as well, returned to their aggressive, fast-tempo sound heard on many tracks of this album. To me, this album is a crowing achievement, and one of my favorite albums to date. I would recommend this album to anyone who wants to check out the true kings of metal, Manowar!
B0000029DD|5.0|This album is supernatural to me. I have listend to this album for over a decade now and still find it to be one of the most consistently amazing experiences every time I hear it. I am haunted that I will never be able to see him perform. That is where Buckley would have been attainable.

B001AK3S3U|1.0|The first xxx movie had a certain charm with it's unnglamerous but likeable super agent engaging in wild stunts.  It Had a decent story for that type of fantasy movie and was a decent a budget movie. That can't be said for this one however and Vin Diesel wisely stayed away from this really bad A movie.  It has alot of good actors in it who must have gone insane to appear in this flick.  If it were a bad b movie you could say: \\"well that's what you get\\" but this was a higher budget flick. It has a hero who convinces murderous gnngstas (these characters do exist in this movie ) to help him fight evil bad guys by telling them that what's good about this country is that you can still car jack (and kill innocent people) a block away from the capital building! Yes that's the mentality of this movie which aims to please fan's of  gangster crap rap. I am not saying that this means all rap is like gangsta rap lots of it are ok. but this movie embraces that gang rap mentality all the way,  and  this has nothing to do with anyones race either which some dude comment  claims that I mean. In fact it's  not too smart to assumes that anyone who objects to gangsta rap or movies that support that attitude hates people of color. I am presently dating a african american who HATES GANG RAP MUSIC and this movie too!  A bad movie is a bad movie and this is the only superagent movie that tries to shoot so low.  Or the only one that is this poorly written and dumb.<br /><br />  It has stunts that are silly and weren't meant to be, like a car traveling down railroad tracks and of course it is a perfect fit as the wheels burn away!.  Samuel L jackson ,a man of some class, must have had a large house payment due to be in this travesty.<br />  The blu ray print is very good but nothing can save this thing from being the bad movie it is. The first xxx was mindless fun but this one was a  huge bomb for alot of good reasons. Give me bourne, bond, undercover brother, shaft even but spare me this monstrosity..
B001NE80P4|1.0|'Cuz this movie reeks!!  Anyone with half a brain can see that Disney has shamefully resurrected the clich&eacute;d teenage musical films of the 70's that make real people sick to their stomaches.  At nearly two hours this vomit-inducing garabage heap will only appeal to naïve, preppy tweens with nothing better to do than sponge off their parents money or gullable soccer moms, who instead of sitting around with their Hannah Montana clones all day, should be looking for a job.<br /><br />With the innovating title \\"High School Musical\\" we follow the same politically correct ensamble of so-called actors from the first two installments into their senior year of high school.  This cast of perfect little dittoheads then sing and dance their way through all the lame problems of their senior year and graduate.<br /><br />Are you sure somebody didn't fart?  'Cuz this reeks BAD!
1440468397|5.0|I just recently went through a really rough break up and a friend of mine suggested that I read this book to start working on getting over it. It is a beautifully written book and the story is not at all predictable. It twists and turns and the whole time you find yourself on the edge of your seat, not able to put the book down untill you find out what is going to happen between Anne and Mr. Wentworth... will they see eachother? Will they speak? The characters are all very clear, and all very different. There's the annoying \\" it's all about her\\" sister, the well to do Friend, the loner bookworm, the bitter widow, the scheming cousin, each character is unique. Anne is polite and loveable. Everyone loves her and you will too. In the end, this beautiful love story gives a single girl like me hope that there is that perfect someone out there for me, but you don't have to be going through a loss to love this book. Everyone should read it. It is one of my new favorites of all time!

B001TH16DS|2.0|I love Star Trek but the price for this seems to be $20.00 to high. It would be nice to know what is going to be in the set so we can understa[[ASIN:B001TH16DS Star Trek: Original Series - Season 1 [Blu-ray]]]nd the price. Maybe there is a lot of extras that would make the price reasonable. Please give us some details to help with our purchase decision, thank you.
B000UR9T8C|3.0|I truly enjoyed the Spider-Man movie.  Spider-man's acrobatics and and graceful leaps and swings over the city of New York never looked more impressive.  The Hobgoblin's defiance of gravity was well done too.  If there was an award for fight choreography while in the air, the people who made this movie would win it.<br /><br />In addition I was impressed by the Sandman.  They couldn't have picked a better actor to play the role and NEVER has the Sandman seemed more menacing or impressive.  He reminded me of some of those monsters from the 1960s issues of Strange Tales.  BEWARE!!!  FOR TODAY, THE SANDMAN WALKS!!!<br /><br />The Sandman was easily my favorite villain in this movie.<br /><br />Actually he was my favorite villain of ALL the Spider-Man movies.  They did a far better job on him than I ever expected they would.<br /><br />That having been said, I had a few problems with the movie.<br /><br />Let's start with those \\"pumpkin grenades\\" the Hobgoblin used.  In one scene a grenade exploded right in Harry's lap ... or his face.  You can't really see the grenades exact location when it blows up, the point is that Harry is at ground zero at the time.  Not only should Harry be dead, but his body should have shrapnel embedded in his bones and muscle tissue.  Most of his body should be scorched and burned beyond recognition.<br /><br />However in the movie, they ignore this.<br /><br />Instead of being dead, Harry has some burn damage to approximately 40% of his face.  And to make it even more ridiculous the burns don't even look fresh.  They look as if they've been healing for ten or fifteen years!<br /><br />Then it gets more ridiculous.<br /><br />Later in the movie, Harry throws one of his grenades at the Sandman.  When it explodes half the Sandman's head blows up.  At the time the Sandman's head is approximately 10 feet wide and approximately 12 feet tall.<br /><br />The same type of grenade ..... but dramatically different damage.<br /><br />Then things get FAR MORE ridiculous at the end of the movie.  One of those same grenades is used on Eddie Brock and the black symbiote.  THIS TIME the grenade does EVEN MORE damage!  Both Brock and the symbiote are incinerated.  After the explosion there's no charred flesh.  There's no broken bones.  There's no charred jawbone for identification by dental records.  There's not even any blood!  Eddie and the symbiote are totally vaporized!<br /><br />The same type of grenade that was used on Harry.  Only Harry survived with relatively minor damage.<br /><br />Did the writers and directors think that nobody would notice?<br /><br />Okay, that was my main complaint, but there is one more.<br /><br />After Mary Jane breaks up with Peter, he goes to the Jazz Club where she works.  He's acting like a guy on steroids at the time and engages in a number of activities that are either illegal or extremely tasteless.<br /><br />The main illegal activities I'm alluding to are when commits at least three acts of assault.  First he assaults the bouncer.  Then he assaults the club manager.  Then he assaults the lounge singer.<br /><br />There might have been more people he hit, but it all happened so fast it was hard to tell.<br /><br />Of course the club manager would love to press criminal charges against Peter Parker if he could ever find him or knew where he lived.  Mary Jane obviously didn't rat him out, but at the end of the movie PETER RETURNS TO THE CLUB WHERE HE COMMITTED MULTIPLE FELONIES!!!!<br /><br />The club manager and the bouncer would recognize him almost instantly and call the cops to have him arrested.<br /><br />If the club manager is a really nice guy he might not press charges and merely have Peter banned from the club for life.<br /><br />But really....... are any of the club managers in New York City THAT nice??ie Brock and the black symbiote.

B001CTDH4Y|5.0|The movie was good, which was a major plus, but the fact that they did not use unnecessary name calling, especially stupid and idiot is a plus for me.  I cannot believe the use of these two words in our society and especially in kids movies.  Even though we have a very expansive collection of Disney movies, this will become my preferred one just for this reason alone.  And since both my children love puppies, I am sure they will agree also.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I bought this series about a month ago and it is the best documentary I have ever watched.  The colors and the filming are like not other.  A must buy!
B0010X73ZG|4.0|Im gonna keep this short and sweet since everybody else wrote so many spoilers.    1) Whether you love the ending or hated it; words you will never see describing it is typical, sappy, or cheesy. This alone seperates it from 99% of all other recent thriller movies.    2) I think most people cant put this movie in the same catagory as The Shining or The Exorcist. So 5 stars is a bit too high. On the other hand this is a better movie then The Fog, Hills have Eyes, Dawn of the Dead, and The Happening. I must note here that I really enjoyed Dawn of the Dead and The Hill Have Eyes. So this is not meant to bash the previously mentioned movies.    So in what league would I put in with? I believe I would put in the same catagory as The Thing, The Birds, and The Descent. So for me I give it a must see and a probable buy.

B00009ZYBY|4.0|Before I actually received the DVD, I would have liked to have known the condition of the box. Also, the included insert seems to allude to the fact that I should have 2 discs, not just one. On the whole, however, I have no complaints: it arrived in a timely manner, and there seems to be no major issues with the disc itself.
0525951113|4.0|When software genius Matthew Sobol dies it kicks of a virus which will undermine not only the internet but all computer technology.  Policeman John Ross finds himself investigating crimes that seem at first to have nothing to do with Sobol till his after-death plan starts moving outside the internet.  You'd think that this is impossible, but where there's a will, intelligence and knowledge there is a way.    Its not an exaggeration to say that by the end of this novel the world has changed, and not always necessarily for the better.  However I have the say the ending is also abrupt. I understand that this is because this is only part one of a two part novel.  However, without the second volume available now it means it's somewhat annoying.  If you like a full on thriller with a technological-computer-internet theme then this book is one you should find enjoyable.
0446402389|4.0|I loved this book despite it having one of the weakest endings I have ever encountered in any novel, much less one so riveting and well written.  Mr. Smith creates tension like few authors have ever managed to do.  The first 50 pages or so are very bleak and I empathize with the readers that found them too grim.  I actually found the depiction of Stalinist Russia unbelievably fascinating.<br /><br /> As the main character of Leo transforms, the plot really takes over and it is the main part of the book that I just cherished.  I literally could not put it down at that point.  But the final major plot twist is actually jaw dropping awful.  I couldn't believe it and it really was an unecessary device.  How can someone write something so brilliant and then tie it up so inanely? The tension, the relationship of Leo and his wife.  Leo's nemesis Vasili.  These are all great elements to a great story, and were it not for the last 50 pages this would have been a 5 star rating.  I hope Ridley Scott throws away Smith's ending when he films the book with Leo starring as Leo.  I usually hate it when filmmakers alter books that I have loved due to running time or structure necessities, but changing the ending of this great novel when it is filmed would be a wise decision indeed.
B001MC7TWW|4.0|I can only consider a The WHO Live recording when it's with all 4 members and Keith Moon is here and sounds great.The recording sounds a bit rougher than the Live At Leeds stuff (recorded soon after that) but because of the period recorded it well worth getting.
B001LA3LYU|2.0|I think all Jeff Beck fans can agree that his music and musicianship have transcended time and musical boundaries.  \\"Blow By Blow,\\" \\"Wired,\\" and \\"There & Back\\" are three works that stand out in my 40-some-odd-year-old collection and stay fresh after decades of listening.  Whenever I am down or need an inspiration, vintage Jeff is there, \\"Rough & Ready.\\"  Really.  The guy is truly one of the very best.  Ever.      I had the opportunity to see him in concert in Salt Lake City a few years back.  I was not disappointed.  You can insert your own cliches here; they'll all fit.  He and his band were absoluelty superb.    That's why I purchased this live recording with such great anticipation.  The last time I heard him live, I stayed high for like, three days.  But alas, Jeff didn't show up for this gig.  His guitar and virtuoso licks were there, but his soul wasn't.    It seemed to me that he was out to demonstrate he still had the chops and virility of his younger years.  I believe that was demonstrated rather conclusively in this rant.  But he left the artist home.  \\"Cause We've Ended as Lovers\\" came out sounding like \\"Cause We've Ended as Lovers I'm Going to Bludgeon You to Death With my Strat.\\"  Nothing remotely tender there.    Granted, Jeff's got license to butcher er, arrange his songs as he pleases, but please.  The whole album sounds like one big temper tantrum.      Listening to the rhythm section reveals wonderful studio technicians who can read the notes but don't really know (or care about) the phrasing, the nuances - the stuff that made his songs so dynamic. Splash, ride, kick, yawn.     This is one jam session that contains some passages from some of his songs.  That's it.  Beck's Bolero?  Pretense as thick as, well, jam.  Too over the top for me.  It's a shame, too, 'cause he never came across to me as being ego-driven at all.  *sigh* Go home, Jeff. Sober up.
1400082773|5.0|This well-written autobiography offers profound insights into the mind and heart of our new President.  Written long before he ever contemplated the remarkable turn his life would take, it provides an honest look into the search for his own identity, and the way his unusual heritage influenced his personal, and world, view.  AS citizens of the country he has now been elected to preside over during an unparalleled economic and cultural time of crisis, we would all benefit by reading this gifted man's personal story. The eloquence and emotion in his writing make this book an easy page turner.
B001QKSWOE|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I'm more of a smiler than someone who laughs out loud, but I had a number of moments with this book where I laughed out loud. I thought the plot was just fine--it wasn't intricate, but I wasn't looking for that. I was looking for a book to entertain me, and this one did a great job.    There are some strange problems with the Kindle edition, though. Throughout the book, I found a number of instances where words were interrupted by spaces. For example, the words were along the lines of \\"per form ance\\". I found these words fairly distracting.

0618680004|3.0|I was highly disappointed by this book.  I expected a university professor of Oxford to have much more maturity and professionalism.  There are good points made in this book, however others are extremely weak or certain arguments are half answered or not at all.  For example, in chapter 3 he states his dissproving of the cut argument that is, for example as he comments on Edward Lear's Nonsense Recipe for Combobulious Cutlets:      \\"Procure some strips of beef, and having cut them into the smallest possible pieces, proceed to cut them still smaller, eight or perhaps nine times.\\" Some regresses do reach a natural terminator. Scientists used to wonder what would happen if you could dissect, say, gold into the smallest possible pieces. Why shouldn't you cut one of those pieces in half and produce an even smaller smidgin of gold? The regress in this case is decisively terminated by the atom. The smallest possible piece of gold is a nucleus consisting of exactly 79 protons and a slightly larger number of neutrons, surrounded by a swarm of 79 electrons. If you \\"cut\\" gold any further than the level of the single atom, whatever else you get it is not gold. The atom provides a natural terminator to the Crumboblious Cutlets type of regress. It is by no means clear that God provides a natural terminator to the regresses of Aquinas.     God may not be proven by this text,(Originally it wasn't used to prove God anyhow) but Dawkins simply stops the argument when you come to the nucleus of the atom and states that the argument is proven wrong becuase at that point it is no longer gold.  Anyone could take the principle of this and go beyond the atom.  It just seems like he adapted an unrelated idea to suit his agenda, and makes him look like he's dodgeing the implied question aroused by the text.  As I've continued to read I keep finding childish or snobbish insults, fictional slandering dialogue,  and laxed arguments masking over the concrete arguments.  I expected more, especially from a highly educated person, cell bioligist, and leader for evolution and atheism.  Instead, I found Ann Coulter.
B000OY8NII|5.0|I love this series. For anyone who is a little uncomfortable with hard science fiction, this is the ideal series.  It is pure fun and humor.<br /><br />I would recommend this series to anyone who likes something a little unusual, but with lots of humor and great interaction of characters.
B000UNYJXQ|3.0|I watched this film at Allegheny College for political science class. I believe the film was rather interesting and made some very good points. However, the viewer must understand that Michael Moore is a socialist advocate. He is a very large supporter of government making people's lives better (rather than individuals making individuals' lives better). Therefore, he shows a beautiful picture of the Canadian, English, French, and Cuban healthcare systems to prove a socialist point.<br /><br />Some of the major positives of this film are:<br />1. Moore does demonstrate that lawmakers can be \\"bought.\\" This is interesting because some of the political science teachers at Allegheny do not believe that politicians can be bought and have case studies to 'back it up.') I prefere to believe Moore. However, that begs the question, \\"Do we want politicians who can be bought to run a nationalized healthcare system?\\"<br /><br />2. Moore gives September 11th rescue workers a place in this film. I believe the Bush Administration was not fair to all the brave Americans who sacrified their health to search through rubble in New York City in the aftermath.<br /><br />3. Moore points out that there are greaty corporation leaders who make millions of dollars (even billions sometimes) but have no sympathy for the common person. This is true because we personally see about the corporate elite (although we also see it among politicians).<br /><br />Some of the major negatives of this film are:<br />1. Moore tries to convince the viewer that Cuba has a better healthcare system than America. Near the end of the film, Moore states that Cuba has one of the best healthcare system in the world. However, early in the film, Moore showed a list of where the United States was. While the United States was not high on the list, Cuba was two places lower than the US.<br /><br />2. Moore does not really discuss the \\"taxes\\" for what he calls \\"free healthcare.\\" Basic economic laws tells us that nothing it free. Moore does not describe the cost of the nationalized healthcare to the United States if it were incorporated. Neither does he explain the additional costs our country faces - ex: we have a huge military budget, a huge prison budget, and a huge social security crisis. Many of these nations with nationalized healthcare do not have some of these expenses.<br /><br />3. Moore did not show anyone who disliked the Canadian, British, or French heathcare systems. This is not true. The law of averages says that no one is in complete agreement about anything  political, especially not something as controversial as healthcare. Therefore, while nationalized healthcare may be supported by a majority of people in these countries, it is not supported by everyone. Opposition does exist!!of the nationalized healthcare to the United States if it were incorporated.

B000VNMMQG|5.0|A well-written, well-acted real life story about an amazing man and his mentor.  It exposes the frailties and bigotries of man-on-man.  The conversion of the writer of the song is though the St. Paul conversion was relived.  It was not what I expected as I espected it to be the life and times of the author of the hymn.  It grabbed my attention immediately when the author of the hymn was a secondary character.  The closing scene is worth the entire DVD.  Inspiring!
B00021R7CG|4.0|This movie is much like the cult 1964 movie \\"Fail Safe\\" (which I highly recommend). I found this movie enjoyable and fast-moving. The acting wasn't excellent, nor was the production, but for a made-for-TV movie, it's not bad. Not bad at all.<br /><br />This by no means implies the plot, acting or directing are faulty. They're just not Oscar-class. All of the principals did excellent jobs. I found only one 'hole' in the script, but I'll leave this up to you to find. For you eye-candy folks, this movie is short on special effects, which I actually appreciated since it allowed me to focus on the story-line.<br /><br />But, truth be told, I'm a big fan of Darren McGavin and James Earl Jones, and I'll watch anything they're part of and enjoy almost all of it.<br /><br />If you like cold-war drama, you'll enjoy this one.
B000I5X81A|5.0|Alone they've been excellent and together they can only do better.<br />A slice of heaven... Nice smooth laid back classic Cale euphoria..<br />I really appreciate the sound Cale has always had and these recordings are in the same vein. Fans of either can be intrigued by its mastry.<br />After 5 Cale releases in 8 years, it's been a great decade!<br />Never would I have thought there would be so many JJ Cale albums in such a short span ever again... Keep rollin' on, brother!<br /><br />Highly Recomended!

0545128285|1.0|I honestly wonder if the reviewers and readers who rave about this title would give it another look had this book been published anonymously or with a different author's name printed on the cover.  The stories strike me as page fillers more than anything with half a plot and are vastly disappointing from the same pen that created Harry Potter.  I wonder if Ms Rowling can be truly proud of this product of hers.  If so, standards have slipped.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|If you consider yourself a moral person, then you need to watch this dvd. It doesn't matter if you are a believer or non-believer, anyone and everyone needs to pick up this dvd and watch it! Let's put it this way, if you are a non-believer, well then you have nothing to lose, but if you are a believer, then you are gaining new knowledge on this issue with global warming. Al Gore is such a great presenter and he does an excellent job delivering the facts. It's such a shame how there are still so many people out there who are deliberately trying to ignore or dodge this dvd. All I can say is, \\"SHAME ON THEM.\\"
0060558121|4.0|I thought that Gaiman would take a stab at every religion he thinks is a joke (pretty much all of them) with this book.  However, he just writes a story about an ordinary guy who stumbles into unordinary circumstances and his reaction is pretty realistic.  If you like Gaiman, I would definitely suggest it.

B001DJ7PR8|5.0|I lived in the city of my mother's childhood, Barcelona, for almost 9 years in my middle twenties to early thirties, I can completely relate to the whole movie and its characters.  I think I had a similar argument with a Spanish boyfriend right in the middle of the same street in Barcelona - and as an American on my dad's side, I can relate to the Vicky and Cristina characters and their personalities.  The movie is true to the flavor of the lovely city of Barcelona, Spanish men and women, and the people who are lucky enough to visit the province of Cataluna, if not all of Spain.  I agree with some who think Wood Allen travels well - I liked Match Point as well, but I think this is a little gem of a movie.  Maybe I am biased but then isn't everyone who has an opinion?
B0018CWESK|3.0|[[ASIN:B0018CWESK Van Helsing (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]]    I was expecting a nice collector's edition with a sleeve and possible reading materials inside.  What I got was a generic 2-disc DVD case (Foil like cover sleeve) with no insert at all!  This is a collector's edition by name only and does not contain all the items a collector's edition usually contains.  I was upset by what this edition did not have.  The second DVD did have some entertaining features such as \\"Making Of\\" where you can see how they constructed the set as well as a \\"Making of Monster\\" feature where they describe the making of the vampires and the Frankenstein monster.      If you are purchasing this in believe that you are getting a DVD with a nice collector's sleeve and reading material, skip this and get the Ultimate Edition.  At least there you can have a nice case!

015206396X|5.0|Prior to the Twilight series, I was experiencing an absolute hesitancy to the young adult genre.  After Twilight and now Graceling, I think I will be a fan for life now!  Graceling was extremely captivating, and kept me up well into the night with a mantra of \\"Just one more chapter...\\"  It's a great love story, with a powerful female warrior frontwoman, Katsa, who (in my opinion) will positively influence female tweens more positively than Bella's character from Twilight.  As for others' objections that the book is \\"anti-marriage,\\"  I see nothing wrong with Katsa's choice to refuse to marry, despite her relationship with Po. To each her own!
B001NY42KQ|4.0|How different is High School Musical 3 from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs or The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes?<br /><br />Not much when you think about it. They all depict what has been referred in the past as Disney's \\"idealization of life.\\" The High School Musical films let you live for a while in a school without the harshness of real-life student politics, teacher issues and especially the dark, cynical vision so often seen on television, films and books inexplicably accepted as \\"kid-friendly.\\"<br /><br />Therein lies its charm. Whatever your opinion of the High School Musical series, you can't help but marvel at how young people have taken to it -- despite its omission of language, sex and bitterness that some in the industry insist are requirements to \\"get the kids.\\" If only prime time TV would get the message perhaps it would not be at an all time low in viewership.<br /><br />Since this, the third film, was given a more generous budget, much of the money shows up on the screen, especially in the lavish production numbers like \\"I Want it All,\\" and particularly \\"Scream,' in which director Kenny Ortega pays tribute to Fred Astaire by flipping over the school hallway (and Zac Efron). The cast are as charming as ever. I was particularly happy to see the character of Mrs. Darbus (Alyson Reed) get a brief but nice opportunity to explore more warmth and depth than afforded in the previous chapters.<br /><br />And since this is the farewell film for the main \\"students\\" (though some of the others may emerge from the background in the 4th film planned for TV), there are at least three finales. These kids sing their goodbyes a lot before a curtain literally falls over the whole thing, never to be quite the same again until, perhaps, the High School Musical reunion movie we can certainly look forward to in about 8 to 10 years (wonder who'll be \\"available\\" to reprise their roles?)<br /><br />In the tradition of frothy musical fun, the story is secondary to watching the characters cavort. Sharpay, who despite learning her lesson in each film and \\"turning nice,\\" goes back to square one repeatedly -- like Wile E. Coyote. This time, she gets a British assistant to facilitate villainous monologuing because her brother is leaning on the \\"nice kids\\" side this time.<br /><br />The whole thing is a lot of fun. My daughter and her friends are starting to get too cool for HSM but still enjoy this movie, much as they're not into Miley so much but they like her sitcom just fine (Monkee career warning, Miley.)<br /><br />The DVD offers bloopers and short documentaries about the production and the farewell nature of the project, plus an extra reprise of \\"Right Here, Right Now\\" not seen in the theatrical version. A 2-disc edition also includes a digital download.<br /><br />Though it's always debatable whether any group of ambitious young performers in a film or TV series are as chummy as they are publicized to be, I can't help but believe their mixed feelings about leaving HSM behind. It's what they knew, it's what \\"made\\" them, and the future is exciting but pretty scary.<br /><br />Just like graduation.arning her lesson in each film and \\"turning nice,\\" goes back to square one repeatedly -- like Wile E.

B001O5LVPI|5.0|Lilo and Stitch was a box office hit in the summer of 2002, but when it was released to DVD in the US Disney had chose to release it on a single disk. Since 2002, there's been lots of talk of a 2-disc re-release, and a 2-Disc Special Edition DVD of Lilo and Stitch was released in the UK in 2005 with no mention of a US release.     Now, nearly 7 years, Three Sequels, and a TV Series Lilo & Stitch is FINALLY arriving on a 2-Disk Big Wave Edition!     Disney's website lists the special features as follows:   *Deleted Scenes   *\\"Your 'Ohana\\" Music Video Featuring The Hawaiian Chorus   *The Story Room: An Interactive Behind-The-Scenes Look At The Making Of The Film   *Lilo & Stitch Island Adventure Games   *A Stitch In Time: Follow Stitch Through The Disney Years   *\\"I Can't Help Falling In Love With You\\" Music Video Performed By A-Teens   *DisneyPedia: Hawaii -- The Islands Of Aloha: Explore The Hawaiian Islands   *And Much, Much More!     The 'Much, Much More' should include everything that's made it onto the film's internationally-available Special Editions. Most of these are left to speculation as to if they will be included or not, but it is almost guaranteed that the release will include the 'Alternate Ending' in which Stitch and the gang hijack an airliner to use in the chase at the end of the movie. That scene was cut and reanimated in light of the then recent World Trade Center attacks.     The plot of the film has been reviewed to death, but Lilo & Stitch has become one of Disney's break out films (dare I say franchise?) of the 21st century. It has spawned three sequels, and two television series (One designed specially for an anime market) so its about time this great film got the 2-disk treatment.     I highly recommend this re-release for everyone who's a fan of the cute and fluffy Experiment 626!
B000BCE918|3.0|it's nice to have all the Jurassic Park movies in one collection. Fun movies to watch.
B00004YX0R|5.0|Deeply felt, warm interpretations of the most powerful music ever written. Together with Lindsay Quartet's first set, Vegh quartet's set from the seventies, Quartetto Italiano's set and of course Takacs quartet's recent set these are the recordings to have. You really have to hear them all because every one of them is special in it's own way.

B00005JPUN|3.0|I saw this movie this last weekend on TV. From the view point of most who have written reviews here I guess I am easily pleased because I enjoyed this movie. It wasn't the greatest in sicfi or the worst in remakes. Somewhere in between, I guess you could say. I enjoyed it and did not find that I wasted my time in watching it. For a ten dollar movie ticket I may have wanted more but for a weekend find on TV or a rental it hit the spot.
B001TH16DS|3.0|I have been purchasing from Amazon for over 10 years this my first ever comment posted by me. I would not pay $80.00 for a single season of Star Trek on blu-ray.
B000002AH1|5.0|This is another double live album by Davis who put out so much quality work between 1965-1975 (and before that, too) that it's like discovering a gold mine that just keeps giving and giving.  This is one of my favorites, with the wicked intro track Sivad (Davis spelled backwards for anyone interested in that sort of thing), a wild rave up that turns into a slow burn blues/funk jam.  After some cool studio tracks (Little Church and a medley of Gemini and Double Image), another monster live track ensues, What I Say.  The bass line is simple, yet the jam that Miles and the boys lay over it is immense.  Jarrett's electric piano solo and DeJohnette's drum solo are undisputed highlights here.  The album closes out with two immense, monster jams Funky Tonk and Inamorata.  This album is a really good example of Miles's fusion period, one of his most intense and insane albums.  It's a precursor to Dark Magus and the later jazz/funk fusion albums, which are just as good as this kitty.
0780619951|4.0|This re-make (\\"The Island Of Lost Souls\\") produced some fascinating and gruesome human-monsters. You can thank Hollywood FX wizard Stan Winston for these creatures.  Sadly, Stan just died last year (2008).  He was fantastic in his trade.    Meanwhile, Marlon Brando and Val Kilmer \\"play God\\" attempting to create perfect human beings. What is created instead are \\"people\\" you almost don't want to look at. It took me two viewings to be okay with it. The first viewing left a bad taste in my mouth, but I gave it a second (and a third) look because the story is so different and intriguing. I liked Brando's dialog, too. His role, as \\"Dr. Moreau,\\" was easily the best in the film.    *****Spoilers****  What else is a bit unusual is that almost all the main characters in this are killed off by the end, some with sudden surprise.    Back in the '90s, when DVDs began, this was one of the best-looking disc I had seen up to that point. It would be nice to see a Blu-Ray made for this film.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|A great movie - a bit too fast at the start, but it settled down into a riveting show.
B000055Y0Y|4.0|Here's another entertaining Clint Eastwood action-suspense film. I am not a particularly fan of his but I have to hand to him: he knows how to make entertaining movies. It didn't hurt, either, to have John Malkovich as his co-star. Now there is an intense actor!     In this story, Malkovich plays an assassin, and he is fascinating to watch, thanks to his different disguises and the terrific dialog he was given. He also has a interesting voice.    Rene Russo is fairly low-key (for her), but that's fine and Eastwood plays the usual loner-cop role, not appreciated by his superiors but showing them all up in the end. I guess he couldn't stop playing the \\"Dirty Harry\\"-type figures, but he played them well.    There were some negatives this film, however, namely: credibility. The climatic scene, in particularly, had too many holes in it. There also were too many verbal blasphemes in here.    Overall, however, this is good, escapist fare.
B000IOM1YG|5.0|Though it wasn't their most commercially successful album (it peaked at #26 and it produced no major hit singles),\\"Pyramid\\",which is inspired by G. Patrick Flanagan's book \\"Pyramid Power:The Millennium Science\\",remains one of my top picks in APP's catalog.With sleek production,lush orchestration,and such outstanding songs such as \\"The Eagle Will Rise Again\\",\\"Can't Take It With You\\",\\"Shadow Of A Lonely Man\\" and the dramatic instrumental \\"In The Lap Of The Gods\\",it's difficult for any fan of prog-rock or classic-rock to pass up this underrated gem.And thanks to the beautiful remastering of Dave Donnelly and Alan Parsons that puts the inital CD and LP issues to shame,it's now a necessity.(Also included is an essay by Jerry Ewing and period memorabilia and artwork.)
6301007360|1.0|Unless you are a film critic and have been trained to watch this kind of cinema, you may well find it as disappointing and confusing as I did. The only thing worse than watching this version of _Medea_ was reading the infuriating glowing reviews that manage to say, \\"It's not a bug; it's a feature!\\"
B001P9KR94|5.0|I don't often leave reviews but I felt that this movie deserved it. When you watch the trailer or read the description, this movie comes off sounding stupid. When it came out I decided not to see it but after my friend told me he saw it and i decided to check it out. This movie is great. It keeps you interested the entire movie and you are at the edge of your seat by the end. This movie has such a sad and wonderful story about Jamil. All the things he went through. But there is no doubt this a 5 star movie. I have it pre-ordered and I cant wait to watch again.
B00000I14Z|5.0|Easily one of the greatest jazz recordings ever made. This should be required listening for every jazz student. It was for me. It is like a fine wine. The longer I listen to it the better it sounds. It puts a smile on my face and makes me want to slap electronic musicians upside their heads!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Greeting, all. After doing some research, I purchased the Sony MDR7506 headphones. I compared them with Sony MDRV6 and Sennheiser HD 650, which were a cheaper and more expensive option, respectively.<br /><br />These are great for any music consumer though I would not say they are \\"audiophile\\" quality. I would consider them a piece of \\"entry level\\" equipment into the world of high quality sound. The sound does tilt slightly toward the high end, so, in that regard, they are \\"bright.\\" That being said, the low end is not all weak.<br /><br />These headphones give very dynamic sound that will make whatever you're listening to jump out at you in a new way. I would recommend these headphones for anyone looking for an upgrade (my previous set was Sony MDRV150) without spending a bundle.
B00009R6H2|5.0|I chose the Manfrotto 410PL quick release plate RC4 with my Manfrotto 468MG ball head. The RC4 and associated connect housing has a number of features that the RC0, RC2, RC3 and RC5 plates assemblies don't offer.  The RC4 has a large foot print which provides a large lens with additional support and stability. It also has locking, which prevents accidental releasing which could result in possible dropping the lens/camera. The lens is secure. No accidental release. To release, the release button must be pressed and held while the lever is moved to the unlocked position.      Mounting is very ease. After securing the plate to the lens/camera, insert the right side of the plate underneath the right bracket and slowly lower the left side until it snaps into place. Whet is snaps into place, the lever will automatically move to the lock position.    The plate is shipped with 3/8\\" and ¼\\" screw for your camera/lens mount. Two bubble levels are mounted into the RC4 base plate--one on the side and the other on the top. This will indicate level regardless of whether the lens/camera is vertical or horizontal.    I purchase five of the RC4 plates, one for each lens and camera. Great plate well made worth the price and Manfrotto quality built in.
B000WQWPKA|5.0|Good Film, Picture is greatly improved from Standard Definition and slightly upgraded from 1080i, If you enjoy this movie and you can nab it at a decent price on amazon you wont be disappointed by the sound either.
B00009TB5G|5.0|The Battle of Helms Deep, I think, is the highlight of the Rings trio. That's why I like this middle film the best. I still can't understand a word said by Smiegel, but, oh well. I love the wistful mood this film evokes. The moody sequence where the Elv father tries to talk his eternally-lived daughter out of a doomed love with a mortal Man is also pretty special. See it soon.
B000R7HY0K|2.0|Thanks for not including the previews! The previews which were why we got a copy!<br /><br />Anyway, as for the movie by Sacred Cow Tarantino Lord Supreme of film geeks and fanboys the world over....... DEATH PROOF woulda been way cooler in 1970-something in an actual grindhouse theater while your too busy being loaded and making out with a chick to pay attention the whole time to all the drawn-out pretentious dialog. Yea, yea, a lot of it is clever. So clever. Ain't it funny this was played with another movie + all those fantastic 'previews' when KILL BILL was divided into 2 movies? Somethings that make DEATH PROOF good: Of course Kurt Russell was good. And there were some pretty female bodies to look at. I enjoyed Stuntman Mike fearlessly confronting the chick posse on the porch to get his lap dance and his little John Wayne impersonation. The two regular dorky guys scheming how to get some action. Russell sloppily scarfing down nachos was a nice and gross touch. (Maybe he knew that'd probably be his last tasty meal for awhile...) Tying DEATH PROOF with KILL BILL and PLANET TERROR with the Sheriff. And then Stuntman Mike getting his come uppings at the end was good--a nice \\"empowering\\" ending for women in the updated fake grindhouse movie for us. Also, the car was cool.<br /><br />Don't buy this DVD. Steal it or borrow a friend's. Or buy it if you want. I wanted to see DON'T. And THANKSGIVING. I don't care what their faux 'reasons' for not including the previews are. Greedy Hollywood swine.<br /><br />They didn't include the previews so people will buy this movie at least twice. EDIT: Should have given 1 star. Actually, Amazon should allow ZERO STARS.

B001P5Q6FC|5.0|Buzzsaw guitars? check. Jackhammer bass? check. Rapidfire drums? check. Pissed off vocals? check. It must be Lamb Of God. Ever since signing with a major label like Epic in 2004, haters and critics expected them to fail. 2009, two albums & two dvds later, their third major label release Wrath is now out. Some were skeptical after the release of Sacrament, which many cited its biggest flaw being that it was overproduced. If you ask me, there's no such thing as overproduction. If 1 album is overproduced, then everything is. I loved that album, it was my favorite for the longest time. Well, don't worry (if you ever really were in the first place). The big production of Sacrament has been stripped away. Wrath is a straightforward, raw, fast-paced album that doesn't hold back. More like a cross between As The Palaces Burn and Ashes Of The Wake. If you're looking for another Sacrament, you'll be disappointed. But if you were disappointed with that album, you may want to give Wrath a listen.
B001P5Q6F2|5.0|This album is effin' brutal!!  Thats the first word that comes to mind when I listen to it! Already heard it more than 10 times from start to finish. The stems on the bonus CD are really helpful because I am a guitarist and I like to figure out guitar parts of the songs I listen to.   The highlights of the album for me are 'In Your Words', 'Contractor', 'Broken Hands' and 'Choke Sermon'. Others are awesome too! I feel that Willie and Mark have been able to explore and expand their talent with the 6 strings in this album. Some very cool riffs in my opinion, specially in 'Broken Hands' and the short Intro song 'The Passing'.  Vocals are great specially on 'In Your Words' and 'Fake Messiah'.  Chris's drumming stands out really well in 'Contractor', which gives the song a very aggressive feel which is why its my favorite on the album! \m/     All fans of LoG, metalcore and death metal should try this one out!

B0000CFW87|5.0|Josh Groban with the help of David Foster has created a lasting album in Closer that is still one of  the most magnificent collection of ballads found outside of  the Classical genre. There are just a few contemporary artists that are reviving the art of romantic European ballads for example the beautiful song 'Un Amore Cosi Grande' by Andrea Bocelli from the album [[ASIN:B001G5SDJS Incanto]] 'Ave Maria' by Sarah Brightman from the album [[ASIN:B001E12ZF2 A Winter Symphony]], 'La Promesa' by Il Divo from the album [[ASIN:B001FOJ76S The Promise]] 'The Prayer' by David Foster from the album [[ASIN:B0018CK5RW Hit Man: David Foster And Friends (CD/DVD)]] and 'Com'e Bello fa L'Amore Quann'e Sera' by Liata from the album [[ASIN:B001MTWS7Q Intermezzo]].     It is refreshing to see Americans expand and embrace this beautiful genre of music. Josh Groban like Andrea Bocelli are leading the way.
0956010903|5.0|WOW! i was really impressed with the quality of this book. This is a must for any J.K. Rowling fan. My daughter is a 3rd grade teacher and she shared this book with her fellow teachers and students. She plans on displaying it over the mantle. The box was made like an old time leather bound book and when you open it you find the velvet rhinestone encrusted bag that contains the actual book. What a presentation!!!!
B000XNZ7LG|5.0|What a wonderful movie! Beautifully done, cast, crew, locations, story. The director, Roman Polanski though his own personal experiance,really captured Wladyslaw Szpilmans'story of survival and the hope his music gave him to keep going. Adrien Brody gave a preformace of a life time, never once did he seem like an actor playing a part, he was Szpilman.   A truely inspritional film for all humanity. The special features of Polanski talking about his own family experiance though WWII is also an inspiration. This is a movie made out of tears, love and will to survive.
B001PPLIEQ|4.0|Many people have suggested Quantum of Solace is a crushing disappointment when taken as the latter of the one-two punch it comprises with Casino Royale. Personally, I can't see it. I think one of the great things about the Bond series is how open to debate each of the films are. I have friends who swear by Roger Moore. I've rigorously defended The Living Daylights, but have nothing but loathing for License to Kill. I grew up with Brosnan and genuinely enjoy his four entries into the Bond canon, though I know that with perhaps the exception of Goldeneye (with its hopelessly dated score) they're all more or less junk. Connery's first four or five Bonds are untouchable, but at the same time they are boring when placed alongside today's crop of bruiser spy films. Quantum is anything but boring.     I agree that the storyline is a tad weak, but I don't know a single Bond film known for its exceptional storytelling. It's about the thrills and Quantum has them in spades! The laughs are here too, but as with its predecessor, they are genuine or ironically corny. Quantum has a lot in common with Casino Royale in terms of its globe-trotting chase structure. Quantum simply doesn't have the elegant break of the poker game which added a lot of depth and class to CR. Quantum is a much leaner, brisker sequel, which I find refreshing. How often does that happen these days?    Much of QoS' trademark Bond style lives in the details. In terms of cinematography, I don't know if we've seen a Bond this beautifully shot since From Russia With Love. Granted, some say pretty pictures are always thrown up to substitute for lack of a story and I'll give them that. But if a Bond movie isn't about a brutal man in tailored clothing who travels the world with an iron wit and a fast trigger, schmoozing beautiful women and many times, getting them killed....well...you get the picture. Trade in the details, most Bond movies are the same. At least Quantum of Solace looks stunning while doing the familiar. Soo Bond.    Casino was probably the best Bond film we've been given, but, Quantum is still better than any Brosnan, Dalton, Moore or late Connery Bond we've seen. It's vicious and polished and funny and devastating and well worth owning. I went to see it again in a dollar theater about 3 months after seeing it opening night and found the experience even more satisfying the second time around. I took my Dad who hadn't seen it yet and even in that tacky beat-down theater he walked out wide eyed, saying he wished he could see more films like it these days. Indeed.    Don't hate on Quantum of Solace! It really is very good and surely does not deserve the bad rap it unfortunately earned this past fall.
0312383320|5.0|Excellent as usual.  Pretty typical Plum series.  Not sure I am fond of Diesel as a character.  Not fond of science fiction.  He needs something to make him more a real person as everyone else in the series is real.  I realize this is not his first appearance in the series but wasn't fond of him the first time either.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|I remember being instantly hooked on Dexter during the first season. It was almost a religious thing for a friend to come over and watch the latest episode on Sunday night. The characters are interesting, the writing is excellent, and the pacing can be exciting (particularly in Season 2). This and CSI are basically the only shows that I have committed to purchasing on DVD. This is truly a superb show. If anything, it's the reason you should have Showtime.
B000JIHP88|3.0|Overall, this is a very nice mobile; however, it stopped working properly after just a couple months. Because of that fact, I would not recommend it.    Pluses  - My son quite likes it -- not as much as the Haba Flutterbys mobile, but well enough. He was about two months when we got it and is five months now.   - The animals are bright and engaging.  - The rainforest sound is very pleasant.    Minuses  - Stopped working properly after maybe two months. It gets stuck and makes a grinding sound until I give it a push (defeating the purpose of having the mobile - to entertain my son for a few minutes so I can do something else). It is not the batteries.  - The classical music setting are pretty tinny - but my son still seems to like them OK.
B00005LQ04|4.0|I'm fairly new to the world of Dario Argento. I've seen his daughter (Asia) in [[ASIN:B000B2YR7Y Land of the Dead]], liked her in that and so rented [[ASIN:B0009RQRT2 Trauma]]. That was my first taste of Dario. I wanted more.<br /><br />I've heard this movie was scary, but never saw a single frame from it. I'd heard [[ASIN:B001K9OXDU Friday the 13th]] was scary too, but it wasn't; maybe I'd just seen it too many times. So I added this one to my Netflix list and waited.<br /><br />This movie starts out slow but pulls you in very quickly. As they say in the trailer the last 12 minutes are scary (and they really are), but the first 92 aren't so much.<br /><br />They have their moments, but what really bothered me was the horrible music throughout! Maybe it was just the version I got, but the sound mixing was terrible. The audio couldn't be heard at all, so I turned up the volume. Then the music starts & builds, & builds, & gets louder, & louder. So I had to turn the volume down super-low. Then the music cuts (part of the director's suspense) and the actors talk, or whisper, and I have to crank the volume up again. And the transfer was really sad. It was really grainy, like it was copied from a VHS tape, and the colors weren't as sharp as I expected from an \\"enhanced\\" movie. I noticed the widescreen bars at the top & bottom of the screen flickering. That shouldn't happen, should it?<br /><br />I thought it was a really great movie. Maybe my gripes are just from this weak transfer of the film. There are many different version out there, so just look out for which one you pick up. I'd really consider getting this on DVD, but the poor quality is really a turn-off for me. And really, after seeing this movie & hearing the same music throughout, WHY would ANYONE want a soundtrack from this movie??

They were childhood friends , since she lived next door, but as she got older she barely spoke to him. She takes him on this extreme adventure and disappears the next day.<br /><br />The book is a real page turner and once you start reading you want to finish it to the end. I'd recommend this book for tweens and teens.

B001M4YZ90|4.0|My experience of this film was a new one for me.  I read the screenplay before watching the film.  It was interesting for me to see how my imagination pictured the film compared to Guy Ritchie's completed project.  In some places, the film exceeded my expectations.  Tom Hardy who plays Handsome Bob turns in an excellent performance that made his character seem larger than I experienced it on the page.  Hardy had worked previously in [[ASIN:B0009X7BDC Layer Cake (Widescreen)]].  He was one of the few characters where you could see vulnerability beneath the bravado.  Conversely, Thandie Newton's Stella seemed much smaller and insignificant compared to how I pictured her importance from the page.  Newton was in [[ASIN:B00003CXDG Mission - Impossible II (Widescreen Edition)]] & won the British Academy Award for her supporting role in [[ASIN:B000A3XY5A Crash (Widescreen Edition)]].  Her performance here seemed more on the nose, leaving less to read between the lines.<br /><br />Gerard Butler as One Two turns in a good performance, not as wild as in \\"300\\" nor as sweet as \\"P.S. I Love You,\\" but anchors the film.  Tom Wilkinson's bad guy Lenny Cole was a slime bucket from beginning to end, not giving him the depth he had in his Oscar nominated [[ASIN:B000067J3S In the Bedroom]].  Toby Kebbell (Match Point) as Johnny Quid, Mark Strong (Stardust, Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day) as Archy, Idris Elba as Mumbles and Jimi Mistry (Blood Diamond) as the Councilor all turn in strong supporting performances.  Richie may not get the buzz from the film that he did with \\"Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels\\" such as Best Director from the Tokyo International Film Festival, but I found this a satisfying film.  Characterizations have been thin in his films with more emphasis on action & comic violence.  Perhaps this is a transitional film for him.  I liked it!  Enjoy!
B001TODCII|5.0|The Liam Neeson/Luc Besson action film \\"Taken\\" pairs the Academy Award-nominated actor and noted action film director, writer, and producer in a story that focuses on the human trafficking network in Europe where young girls are forced into a life of drugs and prostitution.<br /><br />Neeson plays Bryan Mills, an ex-CIA operative who has retired to spend more time with his daughter, played by Maggie Grace. Mills spent most of his career around the world pursuing danger, so much so that he ended up being divorced by his wife, played by Famke Janssen. Janssen has remarried a wealthy businessman, and her relationship with Mills is still frosty. Right after her 18th birthday, Mills' daughter asks for his signature on a permission form to travel to Europe with a 19-year old female friend. Mills balks, but after tears and a cajoiling from his ex, Mills signs the paperwork.<br /><br />No sooner does she get settled in her guest accomodations that the daughter is kidnapped by an Albanian group trafficking in young girls from overseas. Mills springs into action, and travels to France, where he becomes a one-man wrecking crew bent on finding his daughter and returning her to safety.<br /><br />Neeson handles the action scenes adroitly, and since this is already his territory, Besson and his director, Pierre Morel, produce a high-octane film that is fun, entertaining, and even manages to put a spotlight on a problem that is beginning to draw attention worldwide.<br /><br />In addition to the riveting action, the subleties and no-so subleties of beign a divorced parent on the outside are handled accurately and poignantly. All in all, Taken is a great action film with a number of nice nuances around the edges.
B001H5X7I4|2.0|This movie makes fun of the dead and the wounded in strange ways. For example, in one scene a soldier stepped on a land mine and was blown to pieces. However, his head was intact. A short while later, one of his fellow soldier put that head on a stick and waved it around. I don't feel it's funny.
B001LRJH0U|4.0|that could of been a great movie.  The acting is stellar.  I loved Ed and Vigo's characters in this movie.  What little action there was, was very good.  That is really my only gripe.  It was a little slow at times.  Also, as another reviewer pointed out and I agree with, the villian was a little weak.  Definitely worth watching though.
0756404746|5.0|The Name of the Wind was one of the best debut novels I have read in a long time.

I highly recomend this to fans of the fantasy genre as well as to anyone who enjoys great fiction.
B00008WT5M|4.0|With their eye on continuing the commercial momentum started with [[ASIN:B00008WT5J Who Made Who]] and [[ASIN:B00009MGR6 Blow Up Your Video]], AC/DC hunkered down in Canada with hot producer Bruce Fairbairn and emerged with the first great album of the new decade. \\"The Razor's Edge\\" not only kept the band on fire, it also delivered two AC/DC classics with \\"Thunderstruck\\" and \\"Moneytalks.\\" It also delivered on most of the other tracks, maintaining a consistency [[ASIN:B00009MGR3 Fly on the Wall]] on [[ASIN:B00009MGR1 Flick of the Switch]] lacked.<br /><br />After all, with a stadium chant like \\"Thunderstruck\\" there to lead off your album, how could anything go wrong? Then radio took to \\"Moneytalks,\\" proving once again that few bands deliver rock hooks like AC/DC. Brian Johnson's howl leaves little doubt as to what's on the band's collective mind, and if you're still having trouble, titles like \\"Fire Your Guns,\\" \\"Shot of Love\\" or \\"Got You By The Balls\\" might clue you in. Add then it's my humble opinion that \\"Mistress For Christmas\\" is a blue holiday classic, and you have one of the great AC/DC albums, one that still holds up almost 20 years on.
B000VUQ4HW|5.0|Nosferatu is one of my all-time favorite films and I am glad so much effort was put into giving this classic a much-needed make-over in this Kino International 2-disc release.  The picture is so clear.  The only version I had before this one was the inexpensive Type O Negative soundtrack release which I'm sure is not at the highest ends of the quality spectrum, so this edition was a big improvement picture-wise.  There is a 3-minute feature (in German but with English subtitles) showing how this digital restoration was done frame-by-frame.  The film is also color-tinted which is what was commonly done in the silent era to set the mood of the scene.  The 1922 musical score by Hans Erdmann was performed and recorded for this edition (I prefer the Type O Negative soundtrack, but that's just me).    The film, of course, is timeless.  Most people remember Max Schreck's eerie portrayal of Count Orlok, but Gustav von Wangenheim (Hutter) needs to get more credit.  His performance is superb.  In the beginning he shows an arrogant confidence as he travels to Transylvania to sell the mysterious Count a house across from his own--although moments of doubt do creep up as he is being warned of the danger that awaits him by the natives or a vampire book, doubt that he quickly laughs off.  Later, he looks completely freaked (check out his eyes) when he discovers who Orlok is.      Special features include \\"The Language of Shadows-- Murnau: The Early Years and Nosferatu.\\"  This 52-minute documentary details the life of director F.W. Murnau including stills of some of his lost pre-Nosferatu films.  The occult's connection with Prana productions (explaining some of the occult symbolism in Nosferatu, i.e. that strange letter Orlok sent to Knock) is discussed.  They sure found a creepy guy to talk on this subject.  The part I liked best about this documentary are the shots of the filming locations showing how they looked then and now.  Some locations have changed a lot or no longer exist (WWII bombing destroyed some sites), while others look almost exactly the same (i.e. Hutter's house). My one disappointment in this feature is that there was no background or information given on the actors in the film.    Other bonus material on this set are a photo gallery of stills and lobby cards, scene comparison between Bram Stoker's novel, Henrik Galeen's screenplay, the Murnau's film, and excerpts (scenes) from eight other Murnau films: Journey Into the Night (1920), The Haunted Castle (1921), Phantom (1922), The Finances of the Grand Duke (1924), The Last Laugh (1924), Tartuffe (1926), Faust (1926), and Tabu (1931).  These excerpts are from 2-11 minutes long and have their own music soundtrack.  The second disc is the film with the original German intertitles (you can have English subtitles with this version).  I recommend this Kino International release to any fan of Nosferatu, even if they already have another edition of this film.

0345337581|5.0|Amazing book!  Thirty years old and even more effective.  Within the first ten chapters I was able to memorize Pi to the 50th decimal (but I just have not had time to look into the rest).  Plus, It makes for some fun memory tricks to play with friends.  This book is just phenomenal.
B001H5U232|4.0|To call this a Pat Metheny album is to completely miss the point. It is an Ana Marie Jopek album and sounds like one. And from what I have heard, her best. Listening to her other CDs, she has a tendency towards excess. So as lush as these arrangements are, she has actually used a bit of restraint in comparison to her other work.<br /><br />I find this album anintriguing experiment. To hear some of Pat's work (there are a number of tunes not penned by Pat here,) through a new and novel lens is interesting and at times provocative. More often than not the new arrangements work for me, partially because this is a great recording and everything has a sonic place. So as busy as the soundscape is, I can hear everything in the mix. Once one realizes this is NOT a Metheny album, one can simply enjoy it for what it is, an international world jazz (pop) CD featuring Pat Metheny's playing and compositions but  with a quirky personality all its own. Is it a \\"great \\" album? Probably not. But it is an interesting and unique take on Metheny's work.<br /><br />Contributing to the discussion re best vocal Metheny renderings, I do think Kurt Elling did a good job on Minuao. Lyrically I think he missed the boat though. The best vocal version of Metheny I have heard to date was a little known vocal group, Parris coming out on the stage in LA to perform several Metheny tunes with the band sometime in the late 70s/early 80s. Theytore up several tunes off of American Garage. I have looked but it doesn't appear they ever released a recording of that stuff.<br /><br />Certainly many of Pat's tunes cry out for a lyric, but for now we'll have to make do with this fine recording. I think there's more to like than dislike here, once one drops the comparisons to Pat's recordings of his own tunes.
B0006ZIJ34|5.0|Yes, music is great and pompous on this record. To be honest I slightly prefer NGD over this album but the music is still awesome. And the surround mixes are work of sound master. DVD-A layer and DTS 96/24 are both amazing. The powerful voice of Jim Kerr comes directly from the central channel and is much clearer then on remastered CD version. The album sounds differently and - for me - much better then on CD.<br /><br />Just a few questions - how long we have to wait for another Simple Minds album(s) in DVD-A or DTS 96/24? What about SFY, Sparkle In The Rain, Real Life and Live In The City Of Light?<br /><br />****1/2 stars for the music (I do not like Ghostdancing so much).<br />***** stars for the surround sound.
B001L5SXQG|2.0|As a Springsteen fan since the late seventies, I eagerly pre-ordered Working On A Dream. While I always appreciate Bruce's story telling, I did not appreciate how things came together in this CD. I was very disappointed with most songs. I guess that I long for the days of The River and Born in The USA. This CD reminded me of a mumbling Bob Dylan with Bruce showing up once in awhile.
B001KVZ6FC|5.0|What a shame that what will probably one day be regarded as Clint Eastwood's finest achievement was so conspicuously snubbed by the Academy.  Hollywood doesn't deserve such a beautiful, touching movie.<br /><br />Clint's snarling, grumbling curmudgeon, Walt Kowalski, makes Dirty Harry seem warm and cuddly by comparison.  But Walt has important lessons to teach us about humanity.  That actions really do mean more than words, that, as Viktor Frankl put it, there really are only two races: the decent and the indecent.  Way too troubling a message for the Hollywood crowd.<br /><br />As if that weren't enough to gain it a Best Picture nod, you get the little gem of a theme song, subtly woven into the body of the film and finally emerging in full flower at its end.  A melancholy, lilting ballad, it will stick in your mind and continue to break your heart long after you leave the theater.  \\"It beats a lonely rhythm all night long...\\"
B00003CXHJ|2.0|This submarine film has numerous and realistic special effects and action sequences, but that's the only good thing about this film. When compared to the film Das Boot, this one would never stand a chance. The characters are flat, the music is too bombastic, and the ending is a bit too sappy. I say watch it for the special effects and the action sequences. I also say watch Das Boot if you want what life is REALLY like in a submarine.<br /><br />Grade: D
B000SQKZKG|5.0|Recorded in 1974, this marked the best live recording of ELP (the original release was a triple disc LP, something very rare indeed).  The full versions of Tarkus and Karn Evil 9, a wonderful version of Hoedown, and the splendid Piano Improvisations by Keith Emerson mark the high-points of this grand recording.  What a power trio -- they broke ground with the use of synthesizers in live venues and defined progressive rock for a decade.  Still to actually see the trio in a live setting is something that can never be fully captured, even by a live recording.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|So I just picked up these bad boys over at my local Guitar Center with one of the gift cards I had lying around. After about 3 hours of use I'm utterly speechless! They have the most amazing bass response I've ever  heard! Transparent, accurate, and almost impossible to substitute. The headphones go fully around the ear so you can feel totally immersed in the music. They also have nice acoustic noise canceling. But above all, they are EXTREMELY COMFORTABLE! It doesn't squeeze your head into a migraine or make your ears sore but they fit perfectly around your head. They are made very nicely as well having a great folding design. Trust me, this is a great buy, and there's a reason you can see them in studios everywhere.
B001P5HI4A|5.0|because it opened my eyes to see the world with a different light. so i will always be thankful to streisand for this movie. and besides, she sings the whole time! you can ask for anything more?
B000NVL9FQ|4.0|Impressive debut from ELP, way back in 1970.  No matter how often I listen to this album, I keep thinking 2/3 of it is outstanding and the 1/3 is just hard to figure out.  Lucky Man (Greg Lake's all-time hit), Knife Edge, Take a Pebble, and Tank (Carl Palmer's percussion blast) are the great cuts, the other two are simply odd.  Of course, Keith Emerson's keyboards are great throughout.

0930073193|5.0|After reading this fantastic book I realized that all I learned back in school was fundamentally wrong. Also, the policies of the governments around the world, in general, lead to the impoverishment of the whole population. As the book explains, it's just important to look at what is seen to what is not seen. The science of Economics lies in not only seeing the immediate effect in a short group of people, but in understanding the effects on all people in the long term. This book, now over 50 years old is more actual and needed than ever, given the current economical crisis. I highly recommend it!
B000VBIEXS|5.0|It was December 1973 and history was about to be made as ELP released their concept album Brain Salad Surgery -- it proved to be their best overall effort (with Karn Evil 9 and Still You Turn Me On the best cuts) and combined the masterful talents of Keith Emerson on keyboards, Greg Lake vocals/bass & guitars (believe it or not, this proved to be ELP's last studio album where Lake's voice was in top form), and Carl Palmer on percussion.  All three members of the trio were at the top of their game for this project, especially Emerson with his keyboards and synthesizers. Though some may call it bombastic, I choose to call Brain Salad Surgery a masterpiece.  ELP toured with the album in 1974 and recorded their triple live album, Welcome Back My Friends to the Show That Never Ends, to capture the essence of their showmanship and skills.
B00003CXB4|4.0|I love this movie!!<br /><br />For some reason though Disney thinks that by adding new songs to classic movies like this is a good idea. They added a song called \\"the morning report\\" and it is HORRIBLE! Why? Just so they can call it the platinum edition and make some extra bucks? I love this movie, but I love the original, not the additional song that sounds like something they threw together in five minutes.<br /><br />BOOOOOO!!!

0316017922|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book, but found it annoying that the author didn't have the gonads to mention the most egregious honor killers.  He talked about Southern rednecks but not Muslims.  History and truthfulness apparently take a backseat to PC for Gladwell.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|This old school marionette action/adventure format first visited on   baby-boomer kids, is hysterically funny.  However, this isn't for kids!  It's for grown-up boomers who can appreciate the awkwardness of an outrageous  marionette sex scene. Just as Parker and Stone's \\"South Park\\" is an equal-opportunity offender, so is \\"Team America.\\"  Expect extreme stereotypes and un-P.C. behavior.  And a lot of good--if sometimes guilty--laughs.
B001KZVQJI|5.0|With every element the stroke of an artist, Peter Jackson's rendering of the venerable classic was an act of love, managing to utilize the best in modern film techniques while maintaining an old-fashioned aesthetic.  Nail-biting adventure, outstanding special effects, a beautiful woman, idealistic hero, and a land that time forgot -- it's a masterwork of a film.  It took everything the original film was, then trumped it.  What did we love about the original when we were children?  Why, we loved the journey to a mysterious island, modern man doing battle and surviving against prehistoric monsters.  But in 1933, special effects were more difficult to incorporate without the effect itself becoming obvious.  Not so now.  So this is the film the original version would have been had the studio had the technology.  This is a fair assumption, considering that the studio in that day had devised every special effect conceivable and necessary to bring the creatures of the island to life.  A stellar achievement, but Jackson took it the rest of the way.<br /><br />The crowning jewel in this masterpiece of thrills is Kong himself.  It was one of the most remarkable things ever, and one can only assume that it's the harbinger of even greater things to come as this technology advances.  Kong's face alone was the work of artists with an eye for living details, dabbed as it was with touches that bespoke of Kong's martial history prior to our arrival.  His scarred visage and an asymmetrical row of broken dentition were a tacit testimony of his struggle to keep his place at the top of a brutal hierarchy.  A brilliant touch.  Andy Serkis's motion-capture performance took full advantage of the cutting-edge animation, and brought Kong to life in a way previously unattainable.  The ape was more than some special effect.  He was a giant pet.<br /><br />I've seen Jackson's movie about five or six times now, and this [[ASIN:B001KZVQJI Blu-Ray edition]] twice.  Oh, man, if you thought it was something to behold in the SD DVD, you'll be astounded by the same lush beauty revealed in exquisite hi-def.  Some scenes, already so breathtaking in SD, engulf you now as you sit before a searing sunset, your eyes splashed with it.  And sweetening the deal further, this release includes both the theatrical version and the even better Director's Cut.  I'm happy to report that the longer cut wasn't a cynical ploy to sell Kong to us again by extending scenes or stretching out the battles.  Two new casualty-tallying confrontations with dinosaurs were restored to the narrative, one of which includes some expositional material on Carl Denham's deeper plunge into obsession.<br /><br />As for special features, you have U-Control, through which you can access various picture-in-picture making-of featurettes.  From what I can tell, there's no way to play them without a P-in-P capability, unlike other Blu-ray discs that permit access straight from the menu.  Admittedly I haven't tried hard, because none of that matters much to me.  The main thing is that this superbly produced adventure is now even more gorgeous and more impressive.<br /><br />I can't see how anyone who likes the original version can possibly fail to enjoy this tenfold.  Aside from the special effects, the cast turned in performances that seemed far more natural when contrasted with the acting methods in 1933, which are now so dated by their barking speech cadences.  Adrien Brody as Jack Driscoll portrayed the writer as intelligently aloof, reserved in word and action, but intense and soulful. Naomi Watts treats the material of an inherently absurd situation with exactly the right gravity, making us feel something, but not too much, settling for a pleasant sentimentality. As for Jack Black as Denham, I had a little trouble at first with his presence due to his work as a comedian.  However, he too was an excellent choice.  While possessing less range as an actor than his co-stars, his character was shallower, so it was a good fit after all.  As was everyone else.  Even if some characters were mere sketches, they were very good sketches.<br /><br />While the merits of the 1933 version are undeniable, kudos to Peter Jackson for fully achieving the original intent.  I'm unconvinced there's a rational reason for anyone who likes the first film to dislike this one.  As a person who's pretty sentimental myself, normally I'd agree with holding on to something strictly for the sake of nostalgia.  But this is the definitive edition, and just too good, making it easy to let go; and [[ASIN:B001KZVQJI King Kong [Blu-ray]]] makes it even easier.<br />___________________________________________________________________________d fit after all.

B001P3SA94|5.0|The music played in this movie was what made this film believable. The band played so close to the original versions of the songs covered in this movie. Each musician was hand picked by the great Steve Jordon to play as close as possible to sound like the musicians on the original recordings. Marshall Chess was their when we recorded this and said \\" \\"Never in my whole life sence the early days at Chess have I heard or seen anyone play or sound like you!\\" - Marshall Chess (2008)<br /> Steve Jordon, Kim Wilson, Larry \\"The Mole\\" Taylor,( Hubert Sumlim, who was on all of the Chess recordings with Howlin Wolf) Billy Flynn, Eddie Taylor Jr, Barrelhouse Chuck were the musicians who played on this soundtrack.<br /> Remember this is Hollywood! Yes their wasn't Phil Chess, Bo Diddley, and Sonny Boy Williamson ( to name a few). Their were many other people left out of the movie. Almost every artist at Chess was a star! They couldn't have everyone in the movie.<br /> I am so glad that this movie brought back the attection to the public all around the world the names of Muddy Waters, Little Walter, Howlin Wolf, Chuck Berry, and the great Etta James. Now go buy these Chess artists records. Listen how great they played! No one ever could touch them or sound just like them, or sing just like them. Or ever will.<br /> How lucky we were to have listened to Muddy, Walter, Willie Dixon, Sunnyland Slim, Johnny Johnson, Otis Spann, Chuck Berry, Howlin Wolf. We learned how to play our music by these great original Chess recordings!This is the pride of Chicago! CHESS RECORDS!!<br /> Living in Chicago getting to hear a lot of these artists play live really made the difference for us musicians here in the city.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|Metallica had a lot riding on this album - there was tremendous pressure on them to come up with a good record what with all the expectation on them.   To their credit, they have delivered a better product than the previous 'St. Anger' album. This album has gone back to their roots and tapped into them heavily. Great licks and the return of Kirk's solos go with the well-produced sound.   This is highly recommended for Metallica fans, and for the masses of rock fans as well.

031606792X|5.0|Twilight brought me back to my teen years and the intense emotions I felt.  I loved the combinaton of self-consciousness, invinsibility and thrill.  I devoured New Moon for it captured the pain I once experienced so vividly, and the notion that time does heal wounds, and that we can indeed experience happiness again...however devoid of passion.  I loved it also because it developed the characters so much deeper, and I fell in love with all of them-I got to know them and liked them!    I however did not like Eclipse.  While I enjoyed some of the romantic moments and the thrill and understood Bella's conflicted love, I felt the dialogue at times was unecessary and did not add to the character development.    I was fearful of Breaking Dawn but it turned out to be a fantastic end to the fantasy.  Many reviews complain of the happy ending and how everything fell into place for Bella.  However, I found it to be perfect!  I had read over 1500 pages of gut wrenching emotions, thrills, fears and loss in the first 3 books and I was so ready to embrace and indulge in happiness.  Breaking Dawn delivered that and much more.  I cried and gasped many times as I read this last book, however, I very much enjoyed the many tender love scenes.  It gave me the opportunity to balance out all the strong emotions I had felt during the series and for me at least, it closed the circle.   what a fantastic ride!  Thank you Stephenie

0132350882|5.0|Here's a rhetorical question: Should you work hard to ensure your software code is readable, well-structured, uncluttered with useless or flat-out wrong information, and is well designed? Rhetorical question #2: Should you spend time polishing code when you modify or maintain it to ensure you're improving the code you wrote earlier?    \\"Uncle Bob\\" Martin's Clean Code is a book full of sage advice on being able to deal with both those questions. The book's broken into three separate sections: Good craftsmanship principles, case studies of refactoring code, and smells/heuristics in existing code. There's also an appendix on dealing with concurrency.    Martin starts out with a frank example of how poorly written and maintained code can torpedo an entire company. A product that Martin and many others used in the late `80s began to lag with its release cycles, and bugs weren't being fixed in subsequent releases. The situation worsened, sales vanished, and the company eventually closed its doors. Martin recounts meeting one of the company's employees years later - and finding out that an unmaintainable codebase was the cause of all the woes.    Clean Code is intended to help you avoid such a mess.    The initial section covers such fundamental principles as naming conventions, function/method design and layout, use of comments, and a passle of chapters on design principles. There's a great wealth of things to get your mind rolling in this section, and you get a number of different voices/viewpoints as Martin brings in colleagues from ObjectMentor to write various chapters.    The second section is made up of three refactoring walkthroughs. Martin shows the initial condition of each example (all real-world software), then goes into great detail of the small changes he makes to apply the principles from the first section. These three chapters are outstanding examples of putting the principles from the first section to work. Additionally, Martin's writing style makes it seem that you're sitting down with him for a pairing session as you read. Normally I hate these over-the-shoulder discussions because authors usually fail and end up with a sappy, overly chatty example. Martin's succeeded at this before as well with his example of a pairing session in Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C#, another book you should run out and buy.    The final section is one chapter with a large number of smells and heuristics you can apply as you're writing and refactoring your code. Each item is concise and to the point, some with terse but beautiful example code.    The term software craftsmanship is generating a tremendous amount of discussion on blogs, articles, and podcasts. If you care at all about improving your skills and being a true craftsman, then you need to read this book.    Also, if you don't follow \\"Uncle Bob\\" Martin on Twitter (@unclebobmartin), you should. You'll get a passle of insightful bits on software craftsmanship, find useful tools like Uladoo, and get some passionate views on politics and life mixed in with all that.
B001HN6972|3.0|The first crucial mistake I made was, though I knew the book, I went to the theatre to watch the movie ... badly done. On the other hand, if I hadn't known the book I would have left the theatre after half an hour (as others did).    The story itself (the written story) is a compelling narrative about love, guilt and shame in post WW2 Germany - the conflict of an entire generation (the children of the \\"Nazis\\") about whether or not you are allowed to feel love for a \\"Nazi\\", whether you're allowed or not to at least try and understand or whether this entire previous generation was just despicable not worth anything but being hated, whether or not your understanding allows you to sypmathize and maybe lend a helping hand.    All of this is centred around the relationship of Michael and Hanna - to a degree around Michael and his father (which the film ignores entirely, but which is as important) - as rolemodels for both generations... it's not a question of whether Hanna's guilty or innocent - she's guilty, beyond a doubt - it's neither a question if the \\"handicap\\" she so strives to hide weighs heavier than her crimes - it doesn't - it's a question of putting things we know or think we know into persepective.  So much for the book, you might have guessed by now, I really like it.     The film is boring! It has its moments, like said before Michael visiting the survivor of Hanna's crimes in New York, which probably is the strongest moment in the film and allows some depth. Apart from that it barely scratches the surface of the story itself and for me is a disappointment.    Do I think Winslet's performance worth an Oscar - I don't know, I think she was good, as good as the script and the directing allowed, same as David Kross as young Michael... the three stars are for them and their effort to breathe life into these characters.    A must? No way.

B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Say what you will about the 2nd or 3rd film but the original Matrix on BR is something I've been looking forward to since I bought my PS3 and while I'd rather not have HAD to wait, it was worth it. I still haven't had a chance to go through all of the additional features but the Matrix and the Animatrix were amazing on BR! Reloaded was beautiful, as was Revolutions and they definitely take full advantage of a 5.1 setup and 1080p flat screen!    Great purchase, hands down and ZERO buyer's remorse!
B00006CXSS|5.0|Michael Kaman,music.<br />Kaman is responsible in a large part for the success of this wonderful mini series co-produced by Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg.The music is epic in tone,grand in sweep and sets the emotional mood throughout the series.Kudos to Kaman for his spectacular work.<br />The series,based on the book by the late Stephen Ambrose of the same name,follows the exploits of the men of the 101st Airborne(Screaming Eagles),506 PIR(Parachute Infantry Regiment),E(Easy)Company from their training in Toccoa,Georgia in 1942 to near the end of the units de-activation at the end of /46.Ambrose while generally a good author was known to have his \\"moments\\" and \\"Band of Brothers\\" was no exception.The biggest mistake he made here is depicting E Company taking Hitlers' so called \\"Eagle's Nest\\" above the town of Berhtesgarden,first.In point of fact the 7th Infantry from the Third Infantry Division took it on May 4/45,a day before the 101st arrived.This has been long known fact as it was even in the 101st Divsions' own official history in \\"Rendezvous With Destiny\\" and even in(the Airbornes' own over all commander)General Maxwell Taylors' memoirs,both written years ago.It's unfortunate Ambrose didn't do the proper research.In 2008 a plaque was finally dedicated at the \\"Eagle's Nest\\" site of the 3rd's accomplishment.<br />However,despite this faux paux and others much smaller,the series is still an oustanding piece of story telling.It tells with great drama,grit and realism the story of these brave and great young men as they trudge across Europe,often enduring the unendurable.There is little left out as far as realistic touches go;from the equipment,weapons and machinery used to the interaction of the men themselves and the wounds they receive both pyhsically and mentally,as they slowly and surely bond with each other,becoming \\"brothers\\" in arms.We also witness a certain\\"pecking order\\" that develops amongst the men;from those that were there from basic training and all the way to end,as compared to the replacements that arrive piecemeal into the group.<br />There are ten eps in this series ranging from around 50-70 minutes in length.All are filmed in widescreen(taken from a hi-def master)with a colour-washed sepia tone to them,giving a nice added touch to the proceedings.Also the camera work and editing provides(especially during battle scenes)a wonderful immediacy that draws the viewers easily into the action.<br />The actors throughout the series display a wonderful restraint,an \\"under-acting\\",if you will,which again serves to enhance the entire pace and mood of the series(watch for Simon Pegg of \\"Hot Fuzz\\" fame briefly as a courier!).From the acting to the directing,editing,story writing and to it's final execution,it is top drawer all the way.Therefore it was no surprise that it garnered itself six of the 19 Emmy awards it was nominated for.I believe it is STILL the most successful DVD release of all time to date,and deservedly so!<br />Along with the 10 eps on five discs,each disc contains a story summary,the usual scene selection and language selections,along with a \\"field guide\\" which includes:an intro to the field guide,soldiers(a blurb on the main characters),an historical timeline,a general map of Europe,a glossary of terms(military jargon,etc)and chain of command which lists the ranks of command from top to bottom,in order.On the sixth disc there is a documentary\\"We Stand Together Alone\\",about 77 minutes long.Also a behind the scenes doc about 29 mins.long,a video on-set diary by actor Ron Livingston(Capt.Dixon),some footage on the premiere of the film in France in June of 2001,little vids of each Easy Company persona and a photo gallery.<br />I cannot recommend this set\\"Band of Brothers\\" highly enough.Although vets and WW2 buffs will get the most out of this set,there is enough plain human drama and emotion in this series to attract just about everyone in every demographic.Very few watching will be able to catch or really care about any mistakes that may have arisen in the series.Its'intelligent and highly crafted story line,its great acting and beautiful soundtrack far and away make up for any shortcomings.A great piece of historical stortytelling that belongs in every one's home!that may have arisen in the series.Its'intelligent and highly crafted story line,its great acting and beautiful soundtrack far and away make up for any shortcomings.A great piece of historical stortytelling that belongs in every one's home!
0670020745|5.0|My Stroke of Insight: A Brain Scientist's Personal Journey by Jill Bolte Taylor is a story about a woman who is a Harvard-trained brain scientist and suffered a massive stroke. A blood vessel exploded in the left side of her brain which is the coherent, rational, grounded, detail- and time-oriented side. The right side functioned fine. She discovered that the right side of her brain housed all those feelings of well-being and peace. She never felt those feelings before because the left side was so busy with everyday chatter. She experienced deep internal peace for the first time. Her message is that this internal peace is accessible is anyone.
0440237688|5.0|I say this book is a keeper, but I just keep giving it away.  This is a great story that begs to be shared and discussed at length.  I won't go into details about the plot, the characters, etc..because it's all been done before.  My two cents is to say that this book is a gem because it encourages children to think.  The Giver shines as an example of reader participation.  You do not complacently read this book it forces you take a view, to figure it out, and to come to a conclusion.   That's why its a great story and one your teen should be encouraged to read.
0312383320|4.0|Plum Spooky is the latest between the numbers/holiday novel in the Stephanie Plum series. The next book set to be released on June 23rd is Finger Lickin' Fifteen. The holiday novels are a nice addition while waiting for the next main book in the series.<br /><br />Plum Spooky like all the other holiday novels has the same returning character of Diesel, however this time you can expect to see and hear more from the other main characters from the regular series ie. Morelli and Ranger.  Aside from that, there are the characters that people who have been reading the series will remember, Lula, Stephanie's parents, Grandma Mazure and Connie. The main plot of this book which is actually two plots, one is Diesel needing Stephanie's assistance in apprehending another unmentionable and the other is Stephanie trying to apprehend a high dollar FTA (Failed To Appear). There are also a couple of other sub plots, the small time FTAs that Stephanie is trying to apprehend and also the daily things in life that she has to deal with. I will not go further to avoid spoilers. Here are my thoughts.<br /><br />As is all the previous Plum novels, there are the same elements of humor. I am not sure if Ms. Evanovich didn't write as much humor this time or that it has just become the same ole same ole, but I did not find myself laughing as much as I usually do when reading her novels. As for her prose, it is just as good as it has ever been. This is one thing that I have always enjoyed about Ms. Evanovich's work and that is the fact that she can write a fast paced story with hardly any lag to it and she fills enough detail to get the visuals out and let the reader fill in the rest to make it their own. As for character development, this time there actually is some nice development with the Plum character that was quite a nice change of pace. I was actually getting tired of every book having the same formula to them...Stephanie tries to find that bad guy, almost catches him/her, needs to go home for something and becomes abducted, Ranger, Morelli, or Diesel comes to the rescue. Those same elements are also prevalent in this book as well, but this time readers can expect something different.<br /><br />Some Criticisms<br /><br />1. This is just a personal bias, but I have never been a fan of the 1st person point of view. This is very minor and just a personal thing.<br /><br />2. There is one part in the book that felt out of place where Stephanie who is driving one of Ranger's vehicles, calls Ranger to warn him if he doesn't hear from her in a few days to start looking for her and Ranger asks her where she is. Fans of the series know that Ranger always has her cars monitored to keep tabs on her, you would figure that he would also have all his vehicles monitored as well, especially when he has loaned her one of his.<br /><br />3. This was supposed to be a holiday novel and the title would lead the reader to think of Halloween with \\"Plum Spooky\\" however, the story takes place during September and we never get to Halloween.<br /><br />Some positives<br /><br />1. Ms. Evanovich's prose, I just can not say enough about it. She really knows how to keep a novel from getting bogged down and to keep the reader moving. Every time I read a Plum novel, I plow right through it without stopping.<br /><br />2. The development of Stephanie's character was a nice change. I would like to go into it more, but if you have read it then you know, if not, read it.<br /><br />3. Incorporating myths into real life characters was a nice added element. When it comes to unmentionables, Ms. Evanovich comes up with some nicely creative characters.<br /><br />4. Diesel's character is actually explained a little more. It was nice to know that someone actually knows a bit about Diesel and gives off a few tid bits of information on him.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed this one. I was expecting typical Plum and Lula antics, which there is plenty of, but there was also a change of pace. If you have never read a Plum novel, I recommend starting from the beginning. It would be a long road to catch up to this one, but a road well worth it. As for seasoned readers, this is a good addition to the plum series and don't think you will regret reading this.<br /><br />dimndbangra long road to catch up to this one, but a road well worth it.

B000AMPZF8|4.0|I bought this cold after hearing some other Muse stuff and it's great. I just keep playing it. Absolution is my favorite Muse album so far, but this one is second.
B001P5Q6FC|5.0|Yeah, they're back, and the Virginia boys are more pissed off than ever.  I was actually one of those listeners who felt dissapointed by Sacrament's odd production and Black metal feel.  Wrath is a more traditional Lamb of God album, without being too much of the same thing we've been listening to for the last nine years or so.  Randy's vacals are insane and surprisingly varied in this album and the drum sound has been returned to a happy medium between Ashes and Sacrament.  In short-Chris Adler is STILL amazing. The guitars are what you'd expect them to be, with a few nice melodic touches thrown in for good measure.  Some of these songs ( \\"In Your Words\\" in particular) are quite possibly some of the greatest material this band has created.  Wrath is what its name implies - an angry, epic, killer album that any self-respecting metal fan should pick up immediately.

B000021Y77|5.0|This is a FANTASTIC movie especially for people who are interested in exploring alternate realities and having serious discussions related to how one single split-second decision can change everything! I've watched this movie several times and it still WOWS me. The star, Franka Potente, who also played the girlfriend in The Bourne Identity, is amazing.   The comic relief in the 'cartoon' segments makes this movie lots of fun to watch as well. Viewers will also want to hit the slow motion button to see all the details of the lesser characters life changes. This movie is stunning and is a 'must see' for all thinking movie buffs as well as people who enjoy pondering the wonders of \\"what if?\\".
B001L5SXQG|4.0|Bruce makes the pop album he has talked about for at least 20 years.  Many of these songs feel over produced and almost cry out for the less busy arrangements they will likely have when performed live.
B000J10EQU|1.0|Leave it to Hollywood to turn a once-virtuous Superhero - who now only believes in \\"truth and justice\\" but not \\"the American Way!\\" - into another deadbeat dad with an illegitimate kid.  PHOOEY!  This is precisely the reason I wouldn't see Superman II - Superman and Lois Lane in the sack?  Are you kidding me?  Superman oughta sue for defamation of character! George Reeves and Phyllis Coates would have seizures.  This one's cape looks brown half the time - and where's the American flag?  How precious to add Messianic symbolism to the affore-mentioned deadbeat with the illegitimate kid. Give me a break!
B0000C6E4D|4.0|I am a long time Sarah fan this CD ranks up with the best her work.  She is at her melancholy and introspective best in this CD singing about her worries, fears and failures.  Her voice is beautiful and the composition is great on this disc.  Highlights for me are \\"Fallen\\", \\"World on Fire\\", \\"Train Wreck\\", \\"Push\\" and \\"Time\\".  \\"Push\\" is a beautiful love song and it's sad to hear that her marriage recently broke up as I can only assume she wrote this song about her husband.  I love this CD and recommend it if you are at all a fan.
6305263248|5.0|Yes the chase scenes are awesome but so is the acting and storyline,the double-crosses will keep you on the edge of your seat.Although some of the crashes look staged it's because no CGI was used,all of the stunts in this film are real.  The version I own is the 1999 release.The disc is a DVD-10 with fullscreen on one side and the widescreen version on the other,the PQ is very good for a 10 year old film.The DVD has plenty of extras and it has commentary by the director.
0634060384|2.0|This edition is missing some songs from older editions, and there are also incorrect chords here and there.  I've checked, and previous versions of this book have the correct chords.  I recommend looking for an earlier edition.  Here's hoping that the publisher does a little more quality assurance for the next version!
B000002UC5|5.0|A really cool, down home and funky record from long (seemingly) ago.  \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" still amazes me.  A wonderful, inspired vocal there and really nifty guitar part.  And the rest of the songs -- folksy for the most part -- seem like unpolished gems.  An attempt to shine them up would have detracted from the basic, homey beauty.  This is the ONLY McCartney solo album I enjoy so maybe I'm biased.  After this he went all poppy with (to me, at least) mostly unsatisfying results.  But this debut solo right after the official bust-up of The Beatles stands right up there with Paul's work on \\"The White Album\\" and \\"Get Back.\\"  I've gone throguh it on vinyl, eight-track, cassette, and now cd. I love it.
1563890119|3.0|I bought the entire Sandman series based on two things: I am a huge fan of Neil Gaiman's novels and the reviews of the readers. To tell you the truth, I am not that impressed. The art work is not that great and the story lines are not as good as his novels. I read a lot of graphic novels and this was good, but not great. I know that this is supposed to be the \\"weakest\\" in the series, but I haven't been blown away by any of them. In my opinion, they are just average.
0156034026|3.0|Would you like to have some tea or coffee before you continue? By all means, please do. I sometimes have hot chocolate, but I cannot tell if you have a reliable source of quality hot chocolate nearby so I will not presume to tell you what you should drink, if anything. Although it is frequently said, where I come from, that we should all be drinking water. \\"Drink more water\\" they say. But that makes me pee all the time, so I often don't bother.    Yes, yes, I'm sorry, I forgot - you are busy and you asked me to be brief, so let me cut to the chase, so to speak. My opinion is that the book is a memorable one. The story will surely weave itself as easily into your mind as it did into mine. You might be surprised, as I was, by how clear the characters are drawn given the nauseating form of narrative employed.     Did I really say that? I guess I did. No, no, I didn't mean that you shouldn't read the book, by all means go ahead and read it. Buy it. Read it. Lend it to your friends. Put it on your shelf and pull it down again to read it repeatedly... as you prefer. But really, the second person singular? It's quite trying and a little tiresome.     Oh, you want to give it a chance, you think it can't be all that bad? Well, you're right. It's not all that bad. But it's not all that great either.     Indeed yes, by all means, please read some of the other reviews, I read some of them myself too you know, quite interesting. My hot chocolate? I finished it some time ago and it was quite delicious thank you. No, I don't like marshmellows. Strange that.     Indeed, me too. Bye for now...
B000E1YVZU|2.0|To behold this musical on a NYC stage is an unforettable experience and I went and saw it four times. But to see it on film is a totally flat experience. It just doesn't work on the screen for me. Although you've got a top talented cast, the incredible energy and electricity that bolted across the stage are nowhere to be found here.<br /><br />The musical is a nitty, gritty story based in dank, scroungy Village surroundings, filled with nitty gritty people living on the edge. Since I lived in NYC for 30 years, I instantly felt at home with this hidden world that the average person can't imagine.  But to spend two hours in a movie theater, watching this dank, depressing story unfold, is a dark experience.  The musical numbers all seem forced. The people aren't very likable. They're all too dramatic and intense for one's comfort zone and the reason the movie bombed, is that middle America probably couldn't understand why the people in this movie just didn't pay the damned rent--and avoid all the drama and problems!<br /><br />This movie did very well in large cities where there were people who could identify with this bonhemian story of tragedy and AIDs. But even for someone like myself who is very familiar with this world, which takes place in the Village, where I lived, it's a dour, depressing experience with very little to feel upbeat about.<br /><br />I couldn't sympathize with the druggies and the prosties nor did any of the musical numbers electrify. They should have gotten a fresh, new cast for the movie version and opened it up more from the dark, always damp, world that enfolds this film treatment.
0375704027|4.0|In 2009, I would like to review each book that I read. Whether my personal reaction to a book is a review is up for debate.    (Last year, I tried one or two book reviews. But, I guess, each review focused on me as opposed to the book. Maybe that's how I write book reviews. Or, maybe that's how I read books.)    Right now, I am at the stage of my life where I like reading much better than writing. In order to make myself write, I'm not letting myself read anymore until I write the last book out of my memory.    So, here is my lame attempt at a this-isn't-about-my-love-life book review for \\"Norwegian Wood\\" by Haruki Murakami.        This book feels more immature than Murakami's other books. The sex parts feel too energized and awkward and seem more frequent and less significant than his later books.        But, I'm trying not to talk about sex. Or love. Even though that's the subject of Murakami's book.        He writes about people who die at the age of 17 and how they are forever 17. When I read that I can't help but wonder if that also happens to people who are still alive but with whom we lose touch.        Will my college roommate forever stay 18 in my head? Will my first grade teacher always stay a Miss rather than a Mrs or a Ms? Will I always remember the first person who I feel in love with in the spring time?        It's sad. It's angering.    And I just want to get on with my next book.    Another Murakami but it seems more sci-fi. And I'm on a sci-fi nerd kick.

I especially enjoyed Abigail Adams. This set of dvd's brings to life how this country was founded.<br />Every adult and school child needs to see this.
0061537934|5.0|That's what I am and I don't love this book - I'm IN love with it. It was wonderful getting inside Enzo's head. The author captures what feels like the essence of dog thought. Doesn't sound like you'd want to get inside a dog's head? I didn't think so, either - let alone learning something about racing - but this book proved me wrong on both counts. A wonderful, unusual... tail.
B0013ND30M|3.0|\\"Sleeping Beauty\\" is one of my grandchildren's favorite Disney movies.  I have had it on VHS for years, but decided to replace it with a DVD.  The color is wonderful on the DVD and the sound is better by far.  As everyone knows, it's a classic.
B000F1IQN2|5.0|Spielberg is an unashamed pandering crowd pleaser. Yeah he knows how to make technically good films but he really doesn't know what art is.    Schindler's List you say? Amistad? I don't know who your friends are but I don't know of anyone who isn't against slavery or horrified by the holocaust. Easy. What did you expect him to show the other side of those stories? Actually he could have, Africans sold slaves. Germany was in a gigantic depression.    But this film surprised me. Spielberg knew he was going to take criticism for treating this problem even handedly. He's Jewish after all. He raises questions that are uncomfortable for the good guy/bad guy crowd. So it's no surprise there are a bunch of 1 star reviews. Of course they hate him for questioning right wing dogma. I'm gonna give him a 5 star for being brave. Good for you Steven.    As for the film. I liked it. It's not something I'd want to watch repeatedly, it could use a little editing. It's not a fun film to watch. But it's certainly a good film worth watching at least once and maybe a couple of times. Due to the subject matter I doubt it'll be on TV very often.
0345457684|5.0|I bought this book after seeing it praised at Penny Arcade and I'm very glad that I did.      The core concept the story plays around with is that one's consciousness can be backed up and moved between bodies through technological means.  This transfer has become commonplace for everyday activities and can even be used by the wealthy to cheat death as a backup can be restored into a new body.    Like the best of science fiction novels Morgan uses this concept to great effect and takes it to many satisfying conclusions that would be wrong to spoil.  The author does an excellent job of fleshing out the world at every turn and making it feel like a real place as opposed to a flimsy backdrop.    I recommend this book to any fan of science fiction even if cyberpunk detective novels fall outside your usual area of interest.  After finishing Altered Carbon I can't wait to read everything else by Richard K. Morgan.

B000OCXMAE|1.0|Like most fans, Linkin Park won me over with Hybrid Theory.  There was a good balance between metal, rap, and other styles.  This album tries to become more mainstream.  They really lean away from the metal sound that made the band.  The only song that I could listen to all the way through was 'What I've Done\\".  There was either too much rap in every song, and I was waiting for Chester to come in with a heavy chorus, or the song was a ballad.  It was disappointing to say the least. As a fan of Hybrid Theory, this isn't the Linkin Park that I became a fan of.

B001LMU182|5.0|I'll keep this short and sweet.  No need to review the movie it self as there are already like 800 reviews singing its praises, and chances are if you're buying this on blu you've seen it before.<br /><br />So I'll just give my opinion on the blu-ray release itself.  The 1080p AVC MPEG-4 transfer is amazing, easily the best this film has ever looked ( on home video).  Watched on a 60\\" screen and the details were crisp and the colors are vivid and accurate.  I've only listened to the Japanese True-HD track so far, but it sounds great on my surround sound home theater set-up.  Great immersive experience.  Wish they would have put more of the extras from previous releases on here for the price, but I still found it worth every penny.<br /><br />Amazon shipped 2 days before release date and it got here one day after, that was a plus too :)
1603580557|4.0|One of my favorite class books from the mathematics of the 1950's is Ludwig von Bertalanffy's \\"General System Theory\\": [[ASIN:0807604534 General System Theory: Foundations, Development, Applications]].<br />Since the artor omits mention this book,<br />I really can't give her the five stars her book probably deserves.<br />Her \\"water works\\" systems control diagrams are unique and good; they remind me of the real time control diagrams in:[[ASIN:020101937X Real Time Programming: Neglected Topics (Addison-Wesley Series in Joy of Computing)]].<br />I have several linear circuit control books that came out of the late 40's early 50's that have maybe a better mathematics background like: [[ASIN:0675096030 Introduction to systems theory]].<br />The relationship between systems theory, control theory and population dynamics in biology is one of the concepts that need to be made clear.<br />The principles that govern chemical plants, fuel injection and automatic car transmissions also apply to world securities markets and<br />production of food. That we can use nonlinear analysis and fractals to predict and control our world on an much higher level than is, now, done<br />is the new paradigm that she is trying to get across.
B000DWMYQ8|5.0|This movie is very entertaining for my 3 yr. old grandson, and for his grandparents as well.  The story is easy to follow, moves along to keep our attention, and the characters are endearing.    There are morals to the story, like, don't doubt yourself, stick with your good friends, parents aren't perfect, etc.  There are lots of quick comments and jokes that keep us amused (through the many replays).    I'd recommend it to anyone with children.
B000ZOXDG4|4.0|Through out most of my lifetime Elizabeth II has reigned in England as a constitutional monarch. The first Elizabeth was another kind of monarch:<br />she was one of the last mostly beneficial absolute monarchs. The wrongs<br />of this system gave rise to a long period of civil strife after this period<br />in which royalists and protestants republicans fought it out.<br />She executed a number of Catholic conspirators in this film<br />as the result of a Papal ban on her father's Church of England.<br />In one view by defying the Spanish and the Pope, she established the British Empire in the world.<br />In another view she was the one who made more peace than war<br />and spent a lot of time building an army and navy for defense purposes.<br />Time has told and she was one of the greatest, best English absolute monarch and<br />makes the King George of the American Revolution look very bad?<br />The problem here is : do we believe this version of the biography or not?
B001CD6FKS|1.0|I love this movie, think it's the most unappreciated film of last year and one of my favorites. The Blu-ray is excellent, this is a film that's made for High-Def. This is a reference disk you show HD newbs, who'll take one look and say \\"I get it now. The picture and audio are stunning.\\" The colors really pop on my Sony Bravia, the audio is amazing, good extra features. This 3 disk version gets 1 star because the Digital Copy isn't compatible with Macs or iPods. It's the first Blu-ray that I've encountered that does this and I specifically purchased this 3 Disc version for the Digital Copy. I travel a lot and like having that ability to watch on the plane and in my hotel.
B001F290E4|5.0|I heard Seal sing some selections from this CD while guesting on late-night TV and that prompted me to buy it. I've read other reviews that tear apart his interpretations as not \\"innovative\\" enough, but you have to have been there for the first renditions in the soulful era of their creation in order to appreciate that Seal has done justice to every one of them. This is a very nice grouping of songs, both for their depiction of that era and as a showcase for Seal's signature sound. There are times when I cringe when listening to \\"covers\\" of classics in any genre, but this is not one of those instances. You will enjoy this CD!

Mickey Rourke resurrects his career with a superb performance as Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson, a professional wrestler twenty years past his glory days.<br />2. Randy is totally messed up, physically and mentally, all alone and living from one second-rate bout to the next.<br />3. He gets a shot at returning to the big time with a grudge rematch, but finds that his heart isn't totally into it.<br />4. Marisa Tomei plays Cassidy, a stripper/lap dancer also past her prime, following Elizabeth Berkley and Lindsay Lohan to the dreaded career-destroying pole-dancing sequence. To her credit, she doesn't look half bad, and this doesn't escape the attention of The Ram.<br />5. Randy has a daughter (Evan Rachel Wood) whom he has neglected her entire life, and does his best to make amends.<br />6. He makes a life-changing decision to stay true to the people who love him.<br /><br />This is a down to earth, gritty and believable look at the backstage side of professional wrestling, and the softer side of the guys who mercilessly batter themselves and each other to perform the dangerous choreography craved by their adoring fans.<br /><br />Between the wrestling action and the pounding `80s music (Quiet Riot, Accept, Ratt, Guns N' Roses, Scorpions) there's a genuinely tragic drama playing out, and the casting, acting, sets and costumes are absolutely brilliant.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of gritty drama that mirrors real life.<br /><br />Randy 'The Ram' Robinson: I'm an old broken down piece of meat and I deserve to be all alone, I just don't want you to hate me.<br /><br />Amanda Richards

0307269752|5.0|\\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" grabbed my attention because it was written by a Swedish author, Stieg Larsson, and deals with a complex journalistic story/dectective investigation/sex scandal set in Sweden. And since I am half Swedish, this was a slam dunk for me to buy. It turns out that Larsson, a well-known (in Europe) science-fiction writer and editor, was also a passionate writer about Nazis, neo-Nazis and other skinhead-type groups in his part of the world. He edited a magazine called \\"Expo,\\" and received many death threats. In the meantime, he wrote some manuscripts that had nothing to do with science fiction, called the \\"Millennenium\\" triology, for his own amusement. Amazing.<br /><br />One day, he dropped off the three manuscripts at a publishing company (things must be so much easier in Sweden). Editors realized they had some gems. That was 2000. In 2004, Larsson died of a massive heart attack at age 54 and may have lived long enough to see his first novel \\"Men Who Hate Women\\" (\\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" in America) published in his native language. One thing is for certain. The \\"Millenium\\" series will be the only thing he will have produced. It's a horrible loss of talent.<br /><br />But what a book the first installment is! An engaging 40-year-old reporter, Mikael Blomqvist loses a libel trial to a noted financial schnook and offers no defense at the trial. His magazine, \\"Millennium\\" looks like it's underwater, until he gets a mysterious offer to move north--way north--to solve a mystery in an island town in Sweden. There are plenty of details that some people may find tedious, but I hung on every word, for this section of Sweden was just a few miles north of where my grandfather lived, and the descriptions were exactly right. Blomqvist meets the bizare members of the Vader family, ostensibly to write a family history. However, he really is there to solve a 30-some year-old murder. It becomes an open secret and everyone has a pet theory they want to try out on him. Or some avoid him entirely.<br /><br />Meanwhile, back in Stockholm a battered and abused young woman with Asperger's syndrome fights against the public guardian system while doing brilliant private investigation work for a local security firm.She's odd, but brilliant, and it takes a while for people to realize that just because she's not polite or sweet, she's not useful or tremendously gifted. We'll skip over the scenes of sadistic sex she has to endure freeing herself from her government guardian, and move on to the fact that quite naturally her work puts her in touch with Blomqvist.<br /><br />The two begin to work in concert. She indulges in some brilliant hacking. Magic ensues. (My husband assures me that what she does is not feasible.) And many secrets spill out, some extremely gory. But things don't all end up happily. Blomqvist, by nature of his affableness, manages to involve himself in too many romances. Really, this guy gets more going on in the sack that anyone could imagine, especially that close to the Arctic Circle. However, it leads to some broken hearts and disturbed behavior, much of which will be addressed in the next book, \\"The Girl Who Ate Fire.\\"<br /><br />It's a novel for anyone who loves a puzzler, some romance, and great character development.

630516889X|5.0|This movie is your typical Arnold Movie from his heyday.  There are no spoilers in this review because this is an Arnold movie (he blows lots of stuff up and kicks butt)... Basic premise is that we find Arnold with a band of super tough commandos in some rainforest.  Unbeknownst to them an Alien Predator ship has landed nearby.  The Predators are a very advanced race of extraterrestrial aliens and, I guess, some of them (like us) enjoy the sport of hunting dangerous game.  These aliens like to hunt humans and other extraterrestrial creatures like the ones from the movie Alien (the one with Ripley): that's where the Alien vs Predator line of movies comes from (but there are none of Ripley's Aliens in this movie).<br /><br />In any case, this movie should be called Arnold vs Predator.  In the movie, a Predator ship lands and drops off its Predator hunter dude (no he doesn't wear an orange vest and doesn't have a visible human hunting license but...nor does he appear to have a bag limit on humans....rather the Predator has a camouflage that makes the Predator almost invisible, big guns, sharp knives, and all kinds of stuff to make short work of highly trained commandos)...the Predator goes wild in the jungle and proceeds to kill of Arnold's team of highly trained commandos until only Arnold and the Predator are left.  You know how the movie goes (Mano a Mano baby)...lots of big guns, lots of shooting, lots of explosions, lots of Arnold flexing his muscles and talking like he has marbles in his mouth (all of 400 words in this movie I think).<br /><br />In the end, its a fun movie filled with lots of action.  If you like Arnold and Alien themes, this is a great movie to watch.  I saw it recently on this DVD and I can say that it has aged pretty well, its not as fresh as a new movie but its aged pretty well --- to where I'd almost call it a classic for a handful of very artistic shots (if that can be said of an Arnold Movie).<br /><br />Anyway, hang your brain at the door and enjoy and,... as you and I well know (no spoiler here)... NO, the Predator does not stand a chance against Arnold.  Even when its Arnold with only a sharp stick and the Predator with advanced weaponry, you know the Predator is going down!  Its just a matter of how many fleshwounds Arnold gets along the road and the details of exactly how it all goest down.  Watch it and you'll see.you and I well know (no spoiler here)...

B001JQTSG6|5.0|This is a blu-ray for film lovers.  The film grain has been reproduced beautifully.  There is some minor ringing on a few high contrast edges, but other than that nit-pick, this looks just like watching it at the movie theater, but with a pristine print.  Looks just as Scorcese intended in gorgeous black and white.  One of the greatest films has been given a great restoration and now looks its very best on blu-ray!
B001MYIQFE|3.0|5 stars for the album.<br />5 stars for the sound quality<br />1 star for the HDCD glitch and missing segues between songs<br />2 stars for the artwork which is missing the lyrics.<br />-Average of 3 stars.<br />***<br /><br />A classic album \\"Heartbeat City\\" may or may not be the best album the Cars released but one thing for certain it's the most controversial reissue in recent memory. Steve Hoffman remastered this CD from the original master tapes and the result is stunning if also stunningly frustrating for many fans; the album has better detail and a terrific, wide dynamic range BUT the original album had all the tracks with running into each other with minimal gaps. Hoffman's version of the album, however, doesn't. The songs fade out and have the gaps you would traditionally expect between the tracks.<br /><br />Three additional problems have cropped up one with the HDCD encoding. Evidently the HDCD encoding is flawed--with the CD shifting out of HDCD mode unexpectedly as the volume goes down on a track. That won't be a problem IF you don't have an HDCD player.<br /><br />The next issue is that if you rip this CD to your iPod (perhaps due to the encoding error)the tracks are missing small sections of the music. I haven't ripped my edition to my iPod yet but others have and have had problems.<br /><br />The final problem is a simple one that Audio Fidelity immediately addressed; evidently the CDs were shipped without the lyrics (the original album had the lyrics on the sleeve that held the vinyl record). There have also been some complaints that the scan of the artwork is a bit shoddy but I that wasn't an issue on my copy. Audio Fidelity will be shipping out a lyric booklet to those who purchsed this CD just contact them at their website or call them.<br /><br />So why three stars? The album deserved four or five stars originally (depending on whether or not you feel it was The Cars best album. For me the debut and \\"Panorama\\" were my favorites). Hoffman's wonderfully detailed, warm remaster sounds good but this CD has a number of flaws which prevent me from giving it five stars. The flaws bring this Audio Fidelity edition down to three stars. Is it an essential album? Absolutely. Does this sound better than the Target or regular version of the CD? Yes but IT IS severely flawed and you should be aware of the shortcomings of this CD before you order it. If you don't have an HDCD player you won't notice the problems I mentioned and you may or may not have the issues with your iPod just be ware of what I mentioned.number of flaws which prevent me from giving it five stars.

0439023483|5.0|Wow! This book was incredible. This book was recommended to me and I didn't expect it to be amazing. Boy was I wrong. It was soo good. It's about a girl named Katniss who enters the Hunger Games in the place of her beloved sister Prim. She ends up being an actual contender in the games. She also has an angle. She's is deeply head over heels in love with Peeta the boy pick for the Hunger Games. At first the love is artificial but will it become something more? You watch Katniss battle hunger, and physical limitations. I will warn you thatthe book is sad as well as the ending, but there is a sequel. I highly recommend this book. Even if you didn't like the summary, trust me the actual book is much better!

B001ED7C58|5.0|I fell in love with the music of \\"Twilight\\" when I watched the movie the first time and knew I had to get the soundtrack.  All of the songs match the movie so well.  They are original and not by the bubble gum singers and groups that would ruin a movie soundtrack for a movie as great as this one.  There were a few additional songs from the movie I wish would of made it to the soundtrack but the songs that did make it are all just great!  Would suggest to anyone who likes original music with a little edge.

Don't get me wrong, he is worthy of nearly all the tremendous influencing his name has incurred, and rightfully put out many, many brilliantly composed pieces. But his albums as a whole tend to be shaky, with ruggedly elegant songwriting rarely taking center stage, over mainly simple piano-n-riff-rock, albeit with a tenderness rarely seen in conjunction with a distortion pedal.

B001GAOY5U|5.0|Amidst an ever increasing number of mediocre and lackluster Bluray releases it is nice to find one that lives up to the potential of the format and is worth paying the ridiculously elevated prices that Bluray currently commands.  The movie itself is decent but the Bluray presentation is exceptional.  Coming with a generous 4 pairs of glasses (and for those of you whining about only 4 pairs, please consider that 2 pairs have been the previous standard on 3D home releases) the 3D transfer is amazing with lots of dimensionality.  This IS anaglyphic 3D but it is not the usual red and blue lenses.  These glasses are a much lighter pink and green and eye strain typical of anaglyphic 3D is greatly reduced.  Images fly off the screen and the film takes on a beautiful psychadelic color pallet unlike anything I have seen before.  The 2D transfer also included on this disc is prestine with no film dirt or blemishes of any sort.  The high def photography practically flys off the screen in the 2D version.  The 5.1 audio mix is exceptional with plenty of surround effects for your rear speakers.  Also included on the disc is an informative and entertaining commentary track from Bendan Fraser and director Eric Brevig.  Three brief documentaries round out the disc that comes packaged in a 3D holographic cover.  This is one Bluray release that really delivers and does not feel like an over priced rip off.

B0000542DH|1.0|Natural Born Killers is Oliver Stone's look at America's obesession with murderers.  It follows Mickey and Mallory Knox, two spree killers who grew up in abusive households, as they ruthlessly murder people.  It also looks at the media attention paid to them and the celebrity status they achieve.      Stone was obviously trying to make a point in this movie, but it's lost in all the tasteless violence and poor dialogue.  To make matters worse, he portrays Mickey and Mallory as an all-American couple you should root for while making a law abiding prison warden and news reporter villians.  The most amazing thing about this movie is how many fans it has.

0393320928|5.0|I strongly encourage you to enjoy the pages of this book as I have. It portrays the study of science as something that curious people do to live well. Science is the study of how our world works. Scientists explore what happens and how it happens with the delight of children at play and the logic of objective experts. Mr. Feynman models the process in an inspiring and personally curious manner that can only come from someone that enjoys his life as he contributes to society.         There are few ways that show young people exactly what it is like and how to pursue a career in science. This book is fantastic for the job. It is recommended by the Young Adult Library Services Association as an outstanding book for the college bound under the category of Science and Technology. And, it is interesting with a very real and fascinating main character. You will enjoy reading it and learn about what it is like to be involved as a scientist with NASA.          This book is about the life of an internationally renowned physicist. It portrays Mr. Feynman's father as someone who encouraged him to think like a scientist from a very young age. Mr. Feynman talks about what it was like to be a young man falling in love and a married man relating in a loving, caring way with both his wives and children. He discusses his worldly working life and how he related to his friends. Most exciting, perhaps, is how he handled his investigation of the Challenger space shuttle disaster. Mr. Feynman exquisitely and humbly relates his life in the center of the greatest of man's scientific endeavors.        Although this book models the life of a fascinating scientist, it fails to answer questions about Mr. Feynman's life that naturally came to mind as I read the book. Mr. Feynman writes to his second wife while traveling, yet the book never mentions anything about how he came to marry a second time. And while I strongly recommend that young students read the book to know what it is like to be a real scientist, some of the technical material will probably be a bit beyond the comprehension of this audience.        I thoroughly enjoyed this book from cover to cover. I like the way Mr. Feynman related to the world as an ordinary person. Yet, his accomplishments and experience clearly define him as a man of extraordinary talent and high integrity. His story can be proudly held as a model of what a scientist is. As a teacher I would ask my students to be curious, ask questions, and relay information in an honest yet humane way as Mr. Feynman has so elegantly demonstrated in his biography.

B00078XGRO|5.0|This movie soars above the previous outing in film-making quality, writing, action and just about any way you can think of. It is also much darker, contributing to this outing becoming the first movie in the Star Trek series to receive a PG-13 rating.<br /><br />Taking a page from the lesson learned from The Wrath of Khan, they decide to bring back a known foe: the Borg. Granted, each time we meet the Borg, it is a different group, thus not necessarily qualifying as a simple recurring villain, but given the hive-minded nature of the Borg, it makes little difference. They are all basically programed to behave the same. However, while TWoK showed Captain Kirk being pursued by a man who felt wronged by him (even quoting Captain Ahab in his last moments before dying), here we see our beloved Captain Picard take on the role of Ahab in his personal quest for vengeance against the cybernetic whale that had crippled him so many years ago. (Again, \\"Moby Dick\\" is brought up specifically in this movie too.)<br /><br />As a first motion-picture outing for director Jonathan Frakes (who had directed several episodes of the series), this more than satisfies. In coming up with a directorial style for this movie, he watched movies like Alien, Jaws, 2001, Close Encounters, etc. and it shows. He more than competently creates a tense, claustrophobic atmosphere, yet still manages to appropriately work in bits of humor (a standard of Star Trek).<br /><br />The effects are great, the performances top notch and the DVD is a must have.
0316017922|5.0|Whenever we visit my parents around the holidays, we are excited to find bowls filled with Christmas candy in almost every room of the house. M&M's here. Holiday Mints there. As soon as you come upon a stash, you can't help but grab a handful.<br /><br />Malcolm Gladwell's books are like Christmas candy for me. Whenever I see a new one, I grab it and go. I knew Outliers: The Story of Success would be a good book, since I found Malcolm Gladwell's previous two books: The Tipping Point and Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking to be entertaining as well as informative. Gladwell has a knack for challenging conventional thinking by telling fascinating stories.<br /><br />Outliers follows the same formula. Here, Gladwell challenges the conventional notion that success comes from being \\"self-made.\\" He shows how the rise of certain people to success is never a one-person affair. Culture, family, community, and hard work all contribute to one individual's success.<br /><br />I highly recommend that pastors, preachers and teachers read Malcolm Gladwell. You might think that a book like Outliers is a waste of time. Not so. The illustrations and stories here make for powerful sermon examples.<br /><br />For example, consider the first chapter in Outliers - a story about the Roseto community. Gladwell shows how this unusual community had virtually no cases of heart disease among people below the age of 65. The doctors and scientists were stumped. No answer seemed to make sense of the data... until they realized that the community itself was acting as a sort of vaccine against heart attacks.<br /><br />Now think of the ways a Christian teacher can use this material. What does the power of community teach us about the church? How does an example like the Roseto community help us as church leaders to emphasize the importance of community?<br /><br />Gladwell also speaks of the \\"10,000 hour rule\\". Those who succeed are generally those who worked the hardest and longest. It is not talent or innate giftedness, but perseverance that ultimately counts in working up the ladder to success. And he uses the Beatles as proof! (No more details. I don't want to spoil the story.)<br /><br />Most fascinating to me was the chapter on plane crashes - particularly the Korean airlines that were deemed unsafe for a time because of the unwritten cultural rules of protocol that prevented first officers from questioning their superiors (the pilots). Gladwell peers into Korean culture, showing how the culture's indirect speech was responsible for putting passengers in peril.<br /><br />While I found the chapter on airlines fascinating, I wish Gladwell had countered with another chapter that shows how our American individualism/assertiveness can be just as dangerous in other circumstances. Some readers might jump to the conclusion that indirect-speech cultures are inferior to direct-speech cultures.<br /><br />I encourage you to pick up Gladwell's book(s). They are filled with fascinating details and stories. If you aren't a teacher, pick up the book for enjoyment. If you are a teacher, don't miss out on the opportunity to fill a file with powerful illustrations.nce that ultimately counts in working up the ladder to success. And he uses the Beatles as proof!

0316067601|5.0|The description of the combat in this book may be the most realistic, exciting, haunting one that I have ever read. It has altered my view of Afghanistan and must be read by policy makers if they really want to help the people of that impoverished conflict.    But don't get me wrong. It is not a policy book. It is a first-hand account of a superbly trained team being attacked by a tenacious enemy. Marcus spends a considerable part of the book explaining how the team is trained and prepared. That is followed by his account of an amazing battle.

0061808121|5.0|I have never understood those who talk about who will write or when \\"The Great American Novel\\" will appear. It has already been written, by Harper Lee.     Sissy Spacek was an inspired choice to narrate this book, with her soft Southern accent. Indeed, as you listen to her read you can well imagine a grown-up Scout reading her memoirs. Ms. Spacek does not try to 'mimic' other voices, such as Jen or Atticus, but simply changes tone a bit.     This audiobook is unabridged: you get every single word (including the wonderful quote about lawyers having been children once). There are no 'sound effects' or such during the reading. At the end of each chapter is some soft music (lutes or such) to lead you into the next chapter.    If you are a fan of To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee, you will want to obtain this audiobook. I will remind all that there was another audiobook version put out in 1990 or so (I forget who read it); I thought about buying it (at Barnes Noble), hesitated a year or two, and then it was gone. They simply did not make that many copies and they were soon all gone.
B00001U0DP|5.0|The movie is inspirational. I'm a guy. I don't like movies that make me cry, but this one I love because it does make me cry.

B000BW7QX6|5.0|Joss Whedon is a brilliant story teller and this movie proves it. The characters, the action, the dialogue, they're all great.  Loved the movie and the series.
B000002N2N|5.0|This album basically has all of their classics done the way that they're supposed to be done.  The Ramones would do their songs much more slowly in the studio because the studio metronomes had a limited speed.  I would have preferred if their live album was this exact show, but at CBGB, for symbolism, and for the album cover to be the classic cover of their self-titled album, but that's probably the dumbest thing to wish for.<br /><br />This album is a live concert from the Ramones when they had just released their third album, and they do most of the tracks from their early albums, but in a much more energetic form, and again, much faster.  For the Ramones, it works to do their music faster, and a comment that someone made about them is that it's not as easy as it seems to do only downstrokes at that speed, or to play a simple beat at that speed.<br /><br />The tunes basically just use I-IV-V chord progressions, usually sneaking a forth chord somewhere, and they usually use power chords, and for all of you music theory freaks, a power chord is the root note with the fifth.  They just use two note chords?  Yes they do.  Also, the line-up is basically a drummer (Tommy Ramone), a guitarist (Johnny Ramone), a bass player (Dee Dee Ramone), and a vocalist (Joey Ramone).  The two note chords and the simple line-up really proves that less is more... at least in this way.<br /><br />Because I've been giving guitar lessons, this is an album that I recommend for a guitarist to start out with when they're just beginning.  However, keep in mind that they play fast, so it's not best to try playing at that speed.
B001AX9DT0|5.0|Where do you start in describing this man's music? It is varied, subtle, souful, poetic, beautiful, haunting, romantic and fun. A lot of other adjectives would also apply, but maybe you get the idea...I LOVE his music! I just discovered it about a month ago and within a week bought all 3 of his CDs. He started out strong with Trouble and gets stronger and better with each effort. I think Gossip in the Grain is his best yet; if it contained nothing but the poetic beauty of Winter Birds I would not regret buying the CD. But there is so much more...Sarah, Let It Be Me, I Still Care for You (the best), and the poetic spirit shining through again in the beautiful, Gossip in the Grain. And you just gotta love the fun of Meg White and the foot stompin', hand clappin', Henry Nearly Killed Me, and even the twangy, goodtime, Hey Me, Hey Mama.  No one could accuse Ray LaMontagne of being a one song artist. He is a genius in many different styles. Interviewers don't seem to like him because apparently he is painfully shy - just leave the poor man alone and appreciate his work! He is without a doubt the best artist I've come across in a long time!  If there were a 10 star option, I'd give him that.

B001TODCII|5.0|We can negoti....booommm !........ This is one brief movie, so full of fights and action, you end up feeling they left in every kick-butt scene and took out some of the dialogue ones which could have given this movie more depth but hey, I'm not complaining, nothing wrong with a good dose of butt-kicking, specially when it's done this greatly, by terrific actors and for reasons you end more than caring about. Sure, everything goes just right for Neeson in his quest (it seems even Rambo would have more trouble reaching his objectives) and he definitely can't seem to be hit by any of the dozens of cars driving the opposite way or even by the hundreds of bullets shot at him but then again. Who cares ? My only 3 real complaints: 1) After substantially reducing Paris' population it seems hard to believe Neeson would be allowed to simply return home like any tourist. 2) Who ended steering the boat when Neeson took out every living soul on it?, 3) How did the Sheik know exactly which of the 3-4 girls was Neeson's daughter ?    7-9-09 An additional couple of complaints: 4) Liam Neeson playing his recording while investigating in the apartment, and listening to his daughter screaming out \\"oh my God, they took her !\\", when in reality she yelled this out loud before Neeson evern turned on his tape recorder and 5) Neeson takes the camera card in order to investigate its contents and it is easy to notice that the photo one of the girls took of the other outside the airport (prior to them both being photographed by the creep) is not there.
B0012GMX1K|5.0|Gentle Giant was one of the very few incredibly talented progressive bands of the 70's. \\"Octopus\\" was most likely their most dynamic album.  For all you newbies, I highly recommend along with \\"Octopus\\" the albums  \\"In a Glass House\\", \\"The Power and the Glory\\", \\"Interview\\" and \\"Free Hand\\" (my favorites)    I had a the rare opportunity to see them perform live in Berkeley and San Francisco in the mid-'70s.  MAGICAL!  Their performances rivaled any studio productions.  Their sound was diabolically tight and you were pulled into the vortex of their fantastical fantasy! In those days, Gary Green wore a ridiculous red and green elf costume complete with green elf boots! He danced and leaped around while playing, and all the band members switched instruments with energy, ease and wonderful skill, without missing a beat.  There will never be another like them.  Songs: The Advent of Panurge and Knots were indescribable.  GG opened for Yes at the S.F. show, and I thought they blew Yes out of the water!

B001PCNZ90|4.0|One disc approximately 40 minutes long.  Remastered in 2008,the sound is crisp and clean.  Alfred Lion of Blue Note Records was never one who pushed \\"the new thing\\" in jazz,even when other labels were at the time  releasing this kind of music with a bit of success.  Having said that,Blue Note did release some albums that looked ahead.  Jackie McLean's DESTINATION OUT! and ONE STEP BEYOND,for example,were turning points for both jazz and Blue Note.<br /><br />This quintet is made up of musicians who went on to play some of the most forward-thinking jazz of it's time.  Besides Moncur III on trombone,we have Wayne Shorter on tenor sax,Herbie Hancock on piano,Cecil McBee on bass,and Tony Williams(who was all of eighteen) on drums.  Together they make up a great cohesive unit on this set.  The first track lets the listener know they are in for something different;indeed if that was the only track you heard you might wonder about the other tunes.  It is almost atonal in composition,with everyone playing around and sometimes over one another,while at the same time weaving a dense blanket of sound that is fairly intense.  The second track (all the tunes are by Moncur III)is basically straight ahead jazz in execution and is a real contrast to the first track.  It's almost as if the players are letting the listener catch his breath after the first opening salvo.<br /><br />The third track is somewhat of a blend of \\"outside\\" music and straight ahead jazz.  While there is a melody it's pushed into the background,only to reappear again.  This is one of those tunes that demands the listener's full attention,as the group switches back and forth,and sometimes blends both styles of music together.  Being the longest track on the album,it gives the players plenty of opportunity to stretch out,which is very satisfying.  The last track starts out with drumming,sounding almost like a strange military march,which then quickly segues into a call and response type thing between the two horns.  Then they quiet down and Williams comes in on drums in that same quirky off-kilter march style.  This track is basically a showcase for Williams' technique-the rest of the group fall in and out of the composition seemingly at will(but you know this was a true composition by it's tightness)letting Williams' drums carry the load.<br /><br />All in all this is a good example of Moncur III's writing and (with the rest of the band) playing skills.  It is certainly a welcome addition to the few recordings under his name.ns.  Then they quiet down and Williams comes in on drums in that same quirky off-kilter march style.

Fair Warning is Halen's slightly darker side, with wonderful results, brining fort guitar-oriented tracks from the unbelievable intro to \\"Meant Streets\\" plus alternate tunings are all over this. I can't stress enough how Fair Warning is a guitar masterpiece, and deserves a place in almost every guitar player's handbook. These reasons and more explain why Warning certainly wasn't a chart-topper in it's day, but \\"Led Zeppelin didn't write tunes that everybody liked. They left that to the BeeGees.\\"

B001CZJKS0|1.0|Actually, they didn't include ALL the Halloween movies. They included the first 5 movies that are, according to some, the best of the series. They did not include the last three movies: Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers (#6), Halloween: H20 (#7), and Halloween Resurrection (#8). The awful remake created by Rob Zombie is considered by some as #9.<br /><br />The first movie directed by John Carpenter was of course the best. The second movie directed by Rick Rosenthal was good, but in my opinion, not as good as the first. Few movies manage to surpass their originals anyhow. The third installment directed by Tommy Lee Wallace was atrocious, and while the fourth film directed by Dwight H. Little returned us to the Michael Myers storyline, it still didn't live up to the hype. And the fifth movie directed by Dominique Othenin-Girard & Arthur Speer wasn't that much better than its predecessor. Halloween 5 is littered with plot holes and events that make no sense whatsoever.<br /><br />The sixth film, The Curse of Michael Myers directed by Joe Chapelle is an important film because it gives more of a back story about Michael Myers, but still was a less than stellar film. This movie was also Donald Pleasance's final appearance in the Halloween series as he passed away in February 1995, seven months before the film was released.<br /><br />Halloween H20, which was released three years after Pleasance's death, while it does contain voice over work from his character Dr. Loomis in the beginning, it is not the actual voice of Donald Pleasance. It was actor Tom Kane trying to sound like Donald Pleasance.<br /><br />After hoping that H20 would be the last of terrible sequels in the Halloween series, four years later, they hit us with Halloween Resurrection directed by Rick Rosenthal, who directed Halloween II. But not even bringing back Rosenthal could help this awful movie. The only thing anyone could say about this movie was that Michael Myers finally kills Laurie Strode.<br /><br />I liked the first two movies, but not enough to buy the box set. If you want a good horror movie box set I recommend either Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street.ut not enough to buy the box set.

0060557818|5.0|There aren't many authors who continue to put out unbelievable works over and over again.  Gaiman is one of them.  This book is just plain awesome.  It's about a normal guy who gets unwillingly wrapped up in an adventure in a world-within-a-world that exists behind the scenes of our own reality in the subways of London.  This book has it all: unwilling antihero, great GREAT characters, antagonists who are evil incarnate, magical fantasy elements, a plot that never stops or lets up, and an ending that is just fantastic.  I've read 2 other books by Gaiman: Stardust and American Gods, both great books on their own.  This is my favorite of the three.  The worst part about this book: I can never again read it for the first time.      Buy this book.
0783225482|4.0|If you want to see a flick that is ostentatious, that is daring and innovative, that is uproariously funny yet deeply dark, and that has special effects that literally make your skin crawl, then you must see DEATH BECOMES HER.  Director Robert Zemeckis pulls all the rabbits out of his hat to craft a visual experience the viewer will never forget--and all with a sharp, biting verve.<br /><br />Ah, immortality.  And beauty.  Ageless glamour and elegance.  Who wouldn't want such a gift, no matter what the price?  Two rivals, an aging movie star (Meryl Streep) and self-help guru (Goldie Hawn), willingly pay the ultimate price for eternal beauty in their never-ending tug-of-war over a shallow mortician (Bruce Willis, who is really fun to watch in this quirky role).  It's a struggle that crosses over to lethal force; trouble is, neither woman can be killed--but she can darn sure be disfigured.  Is that neck hopelessly broken?  Get out the mortician paint.<br /><br />It's impossible for Streep to turn in a mediocre performance, and she's at the top of her game here.  Hawn and Willis are outstanding, too, while Isabella Rossellini, who plays the witch who sells Streep and Hawn their \\"magic potion\\", is absolutely stunning.  Look for a cameo by the late great director Sydney Pollack as an ER physician about to receive the injury case of his career.  With eye-popping special effects and a tongue-in-cheek spoof of vainglorious megalomania, DEATH BECOMES HER is grand (and often icky) fun.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, [[ASIN:1413406114 Walk-On]]

0440241413|3.0|Rebecca Bloomwood has what a lot of girls would turn green with envy for. An awesome apartment in a trendy neighborhood, a job that gives her almost complete freedom, and a closet full of awesome clothes...the only problem is she can't really afford it...any of it.<br /><br /> The bills are piling up and Becky knows she can't keep chucking them in the dumpsters she happens to pass by on her way to work...or on the way to the stores to shop away her troubles. But one day she runs across a story in her work that she actually cares about, one that might just not only help herself, but might actually help others as well.<br /><br /> Ok, I have no idea whatsoever why everyone thought this book was so amazing. Yes, it was fun, it had a good storyline, and was a relaxed chicklit book that would essentially be a fast beach or plane read. That's about where the good points end however I'm afraid.<br /><br /> Throughout the entire book I just could not fall in love with Becky. I felt she was nothing more than just a whiny child who couldn't control her impulses. She would also lie and cheat, and was not above being dishonest to her boss and family. She would just get herself into these crazy situations that she only made worse by creating more lies and fibs. Instead of being funny however, I found these situations to be embarrassing. I was embarrassed for her and found myself skimming over a lot of them.<br /><br /> Bottom line, I guess I just didn't like \\"Confessions of a Shopaholic.\\" I wanted to like it, I tried to like it, I finished the book and found it to be moderately entertaining, but entertainment value alone does not make for a fantastic read. Because I could not form a relationship with the main character I could just not form a liking for \\"Confessions.\\" Was it worth a read? Sure. Will I pick up the next book...I'm on the fence. If there's nothing  better around maybe, but I have a lot of books in my pile to read at the moment, and I don't think I would insert the next book in the series anytime soon.soon.
0060557818|4.0|\\"Neverwhere\\" is an entertaining dark fantasy from celebrated writer, Neil Gaiman. The wild and whirling world he creates from the material of urban London -- where unsuspecting folks can fall \\"between the cracks\\" and end up in the surreal London Below -- owes a debt to GK Chesterton's delightful and outlandish \\"The Man Who Was Thursday,\\" another joyous flight of singularly British imagination.<br /><br />As in Susanna Clarke's masterpiece, \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell,\\" Gaiman offers a vision of London as an Old World enmeshed with Other Worlds - mirrors and doors and subways can be passageways to dark, unknowable places. Gaiman's characters are memorable - I especially enjoyed the condescending Marquis de Carabas, a man who does not suffer fools gladly. Richard Mayhew is a likable but often hapless hero. He's a character slowly coming to terms with the sights and wonders around him, but for a good deal of the story he does little besides offer variations of surprise and bewilderment. This is more an observation than a complaint, since Gaiman wants his reader to see Richard's character arc from befuddled businessman to worthy hero.<br /><br />Gaiman is especially good at evoking atmosphere; his rich descriptions weave a magnificent tapestry of surface textures. He has a lot of fun with London landmarks, offering parallel takes on the British Museum, the Old Bailey, Earl's Court, and so on. In this sense, it is no wonder that Gaiman hailed Clarke's debut as the best fantasy written in the last seventy years - their sensibilities accord as devout Anglophiles fascinated by the intersection of reality and imagination.
B001TH16DS|2.0|I am in complete agreement with the other posters. If this was the ENTIRE original series the price would be acceptable. OR, if this was the first season featuring both the original and the new Special Edition versions then maybe. But no way is a \\"special price\\" of $81.00 for just the original 1st season in any way reasonable. Got it on DVD and that's just fine. At least they got the price right for the Original Movie Collection.<br /><br />I've bought a TON of DVDs and Blu-Rays on Amazon over the last few years and I know the prices are generally the best found so this wouldn't be Amazon's screw up. The studio actually expects people to pay this amount. I guess we'll have to wait and see what is available on this set. If it is literally the original first season as available already on DVD with a few new bonus features this set will be a laughing stock at the current price. Let's see what happens.
B000NQRR1Q|5.0|\\"Some books are dangerous, Mr. Corso...\\"<br /><br />Meet Dean Corso, a short and thin type with greasy hair, goatee, trenchcoat, and a Lucky Strike dangling from his lips. His business is books, antique books, and visits estates to appraise rare volumes... Seems simple enough, his knowledge on the subject is encyclopedic, but in a way that seems to be the extent of it. He comes off as a man who can rattle off the catalogue number, how many copies exist, and of course, their value. But he comes off as the kind of man who probably hasn't actually read anything for quite some time. It's a business, and Corso is a scoundrel, eagerly waiting to rip off anyone who employs him...<br /><br />Enter Boris Balkan, an aging scholar who has dedicated his life's work to the Devil. Well, Balkan was lucky enough to acquire a very valuable volume just before the previous owner hangs himself. That is the way of things, Balkan has just completed his vast demonic library with the forbidden volume The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows, a book whose author was burned alive for protecting this ancient grimoire. An author who was rumored to collaborate with Lucifer himself, so you can imagine that Balkan is giddy to have such a treasure. But he enlists the aid of Corso to authenticate the book, trsuting a man who can be bought by cold hard cash. Corso is sent to Europe to compare The Nine Gates with the two remaining copies... But not without the previous owner's wife trying to snag the book for herself, and Corso's best friend ends up dead...<br /><br />Sex and Sects and Satan!<br /><br />What a wonderful thing, to watch something that combines two of my favorite passions: old books and the cinema. Based on the novel The Club Dumas by Arturo Perez-Reverte, this film weaves a fantastic mystery. The first-person style of the film allows the viewer to only discovers the clues when Corso does, which means we are in the dark as much as he is. The film does not give anything away and remains ambiguous throughout, which is a rare treat because mysteries these days tend to reveal who the killer is in advance, instead this plays like an old nickel and dime trash detective novel or classic noir. In fact, this is the kind of story I could see being told with fedoras and five o' clock shadow, luscious women on the knee while pounding a glass of scotch. Well, scratch the fedoras, everything else is here. This truly is a modern-day film noir, our protagonist is sleazy, he likes money and femme fatales. The entire story revolves around him, there is not a scene he is not involved in. Johnny Depp does a great job in portraying this half-wit bibliophile. Other treats include dark brunettes, mysterious blondes, tales of orgy cults, and the devil!<br /><br />I've never listened to it, but I don't need an audio commentary to tell you that the color scheme is brilliant. If this movie were filmed in Smell-O-Vision, it would constantly reek of wormy parchment and decaying and musty leather and wood. Everything has an earthy and organic glow to it, lots of burgandy and browns, the atmosphere it creates is almost physically palpable. The music varies from quirky to sinister, playing both with and against the atmosphere. The idea of sinister books played out in a rich milieau of money, women, and murder. This is perhaps one of the most underrated films, especially in Polanski's catalogue.<br /><br />- M.a rare treat because mysteries these days tend to reveal who the killer is in advance, instead this plays like an old nickel and dime trash detective novel or classic noir.

Other treats include dark brunettes, mysterious blondes, tales of orgy cults, and the devil!    I've never listened to it, but I don't need an audio commentary to tell you that the color scheme is brilliant. If this movie were filmed in Smell-O-Vision, it would constantly reek of wormy parchment and decaying and musty leather and wood. Everything has an earthy and organic glow to it, lots of burgandy and browns, the atmosphere it creates is almost physically palpable. The music varies from quirky to sinister, playing both with and against the atmosphere. The idea of sinister books played out in a rich milieau of money, women, and murder. This is perhaps one of the most underrated films, especially in Polanski's catalogue.    - M.
0321146530|1.0|Remember back in college when you would come up with 2 pages of good material then bs it into 5 to meet the length requirement?  This guy does it to make a 200 page book.    Test-Driven Development is not very complicated.  You can fully understand it just reading the wikipedia article on it.  This book doesn't explain much more than that.  There are a ton of examples for just about any situation you can think of inside this book, but any decent programmer could just look at an example or two online and be just as well off.    This book would be most helpful to someone who has just started learning programming on their own (no degree or job experience), but this book is mostly just a waste of time.
B0011UBDTK|1.0|I waited for more than a month and never received the product I paid for.  The vendor never gave me the shipping information either.  I e-mailed him after waiting for 3 weeks, he said the product was out of stock. but he sent it out already.  I waited one more week, nothing showed up.  He e-mailed me saying if I didn't get the package in 1 more days, I could e-mail him either to re-send it or get a refund.  I e-mailed him asking him to send the package again.  He never replied.  so I waited 2 more days for his reply, in vain, so I had to file a claim.  I think I ordered it on Jan. 12th and I filed the claim on Feb 28th. so, if you want to experience what I did, order from him at your own risk.
0394800389|4.0|We have a (growing) collection of Dr. Seuss books for our 18-month-olds, and I can find something unique and educational in every one of them, this one included.  I do think that, for children just learning language, the alliteration may be a bit of a negative - while they are working hard to understand and say individual words for different objects, the rhymes in this book make everything sound the same.  I know this will be a hit for the kids when they are a bit older and have a more solid command of the vocabulary, but I find it not to be the MOST appropriate for my very young toddlers.
B001H5X7KC|1.0|This is possible the worst movie I have ever seen! There were few giggles but not a LAUGH OUT LOUD comedy. I thought this was a family film but I was wrong, they said the 'F' word in every line and the actors didn't work as hard like they should.  The only funny parts was in the commercials and that's about it! I was very disappointed since I really waited for this movie to come out.   Ben Stiller did a horrible job and I can't believe Tom Cruise was a nominee for his role. I thought he was the horrible one out of the bunch!  Overall, this movie blows. literally.     DON'T BUY IT!!! (:
B00129H7VS|5.0|What a fantastic transfer!  Everyone knows what a great film BoB is.  It is worth repurchasing to witness it in all its full 1080p glory.  This is a MUST OWN BluRay.
B001B6EAOY|5.0|I love it. I bought an 8GB microSDHC. Put that in the adapter, popped it in  my psp. All you have to do is format it from your psp (so backup any files you previously have to your computer). I recommend this product.
B00005JOHC|5.0|I don't like scripted comedy shows especially on network television, I find the cheese factor is major, but my boyfriend is a big fan and after seeing it with him, I am one too! The hijinks 2 men and a kid or really, 3 big kids, get into are hilarious and it's written from a man's point of view. I find myself learning about the male psyche and laughing hysterically at the same time. The first episodes obviously explain alot of stuff, what Charlie does for a living, how Allen ended up at his house, where Rose came from! It's a little cheesy but irresistible not to like. Besides any show where you can see Ducky, is worth watching, Jon Cryer is a great actor and my favorite brat packer of all!
031606792X|5.0|a fun series, on the corny side, but really, sometimes you just need something fun like this book. very vivid book really draws you in.
0375826726|3.0|I actually have read the book twice now (I get into the habit of re-reading books when I am waiting for the next installment) and I think I am starting to hate Roran. I like how he is so determined about love and Katrina but as a warrior he seems like such a...male mary sue(can't think of the name). I almost threw the book down when he made that soldier flinch by going \\"Bah!\\" just because of how rediculous it sounded although it would have been better if he said \\"Boo!\\". But after a few of Roran only chapters I started skipping them altogether like I did in Eldest.  I like how Arya is starting to warm up to Eragon and starts showing more emotions other than constipation like before. It's slow yes but it's different and I like different.  I liked the wolf elf idea with the sexy musk but I keep picturing a blue hairy person entering to that Milkshake song and shimmying about. I also liked Elva and how she did not do the 'noble' thing to do.  Something else that bugged me was all the new Gods and religions. I think they should have been introduced over a period of time in the first and second book. especially with Nasuada and Ajihad's background. it was just kinda random when Nasuada started saying stuff like \\" Thank *insert God name*\\". I keep picturing the Dwarf God that appeared as a huge Goron too but I like the way he elaborated on the dwarves since it wasn't like \\" oh, here's a god, there's a god, everyone has a new god!\\"   Oh and when Galby possessed Murtagh I kept hearing the voice of Galby from Eragon the movie and would start laughing.
0307454894|5.0|I just finished reading this book and i just had to say it was amazing. I read it in less than 3 days it got me hooked from the first page til the end. The way in what is written from the main character's point of view makes it somehow more personal and it was for me as though i was reading that person's memories and thoughts through his teenage years and into adulthood and the way this woman became such an important part of his life.  I think what i loved the most was also the fact that since he was talking about his past the story moved on really quick. I mean is not like an everyday book written in present tense but mostly was like a jump into his memories with details about the many things that surrounded him through his whole life and his thoughts about it, from friends in school to the way people act everyday and it makes the reader analyze these questions at the same time with the author.  The ending was really emotional i could feel myself holding back some tears through the last couple of chapters making me feel as though i was part of the story myself.  I recomend this book to everyone is beautifully written and pretty fast reading. I can't wait to see the movie now which probably wont be as great as the book but i'll have to try.
B000TGJ80S|5.0|This is the best dracula movie I have seen to date. I enjoyed it when it first came out and have enjoyed it several times since. Having seen many vampire movies and reading all sorts of vampire books, this is one I can continue to come back to and see over and over again.<br /><br />Anthony Hopkins does a fabulous job, as always.<br />Gary Oldman is truly a scary Dracula but at times can be very sexy.
0767817664|5.0|I am very satisfied with the DVD. This movie has always been one of my favorites.
B001KL3GY0|4.0|This is a great compliment to the already strong collection of Franz Ferdinand Albums. This album retains its alternative edginess and beat, but has a dance feeling. A must-have for fans of the older albums.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|Of course I am a big Jane Austen fan, and I have seen many or most of the various productions, Hollywood or BBC or etc.  My favorite Pride and Prejudice is still the BBC miniseries, but the movie version did capture me.  There is a feel about it, beyond the beautiful people and cinematography and costumes, that is gripping and poignant, haunting even.  My kids, 9 (boy) and 4 (girl), watched the movie with me recently, and were glued to it. What is she feeling?  What is she going to do?  They were spellbound.  I enjoyed it even more, watching it with them.  And I ordered the soundtrack, my first movie soundtrack.    The CD arrived a few days later.  I put it in on a quiet Saturday morning, and it grabbed me.  I am no technician.  I do not have the right words to describe the performance, or critique it in any educated manner.  But it moved me.  And it continues to do so.  As I listen to it, it is clear to me that so much of the feel of the movie is due to the soundtrack.  The moments I remember, that stick with me, are without dialogue; they are embraced by and carried by this music, the movie soundtrack.  Lizzie at the edge of the world, surrounded by the beauty of the country near Pemberly; Lizzie spinning on the swing; Lizzie running from the church in tears.  It is the soundtrack that created these moments for me, not the actors.  While this CD is playing, my kids, busy playing, will stop and say \\"Mama, this is where she is on the swing!\\", or \\"She's running away, is this where she's running away?\\"  They feel it too.    With renewed interest I watched the Emma Thomspon version of Sense and Sensibility.  While the movie is probably as good as Pride and Prejudice, nothing stuck with me, and it quickly disappeared from my thoughts.  I attribute the difference to the soundtrack, one poignant, the other forgettable.      So I heartily recommend the Pride and Prejudice soundtrack.  It has brought me much joy.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|Several years ago, I tried to read this book.  I didn't get very far into it, deciding that I just didn't like it. I didn't give it a chance.    Recently, I just finished this book after it was a recommendation from a book club.      I cannot believe I put this wonderful, beautiful, haunting, and wholly satisfying book away years ago.  This book, is hands down, one of the best I have read.  It is truly amazing.  The author should be very proud of this literay work
0446619078|5.0|The Last Coyote is enjoyable from cover to cover.  This is the fourth installment in Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch series of novels that only seem to get better with each book.  This time around, Bosch is on involuntary stress leave after fighting with his boss at his job as a homicide detective.  While attending mandated counseling sessions, he decides to finally investigate his mother's unsolved murder in the early Sixties.<br /><br />Detective or crime fiction can often seem played out, but Connelly has always written his stories with more sophistication than average.  In a somewhat tired genre of writing, this book stands out.
B000002KKD|5.0|This is humerous debut that showcases quircky vocals, funny lyrics and rocking 80s dance tunes.  Cindy Wilson and Kate Pierson sing brilliantly together, and Fred Schneider's voice plays well against their sound, in spite of his limited range.  The \\"Peter Gunn\\" like guitar and pulsing beat that drive \\"Intro\\" with its screaming keyboard riff provides the perfect segue into \\"Planet Claire\\". \\"52 Girls\\" showcases the ladies singing against a simplistic, yet perfectly catchy choppy synthesizer chord.  \\"Dance This Mess Around\\" mixes references to dance craze steps with product references (\\"Do the Aqua Velva\\" Schneider yells).  \\"Rock Lobster\\" was the biggest hit on this one, which still stands the test as one of the great 80s dance tunes. Enjoy this, and dance your butt off while laughing your head off.
0525951113|4.0|This book is a fast-paced-tech-thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat. The story line evolves around the mysterious deaths of several employees of a computer company. The detectives who investigate the case and the other characters are easily likeable or loathing, depending on your point of view. Regardless all the characters are richly portrayed and come to life, including the computer program run amock. The first thing that struck me about this book was the intensity of the development of the scenario. I imediately thought that this book would make a good movie. I started casting immediately. This book is in the vein of books I read before in science fiction but with a modern post 2000 edge. Think ccyberpunk for the new milenium. Totally absorbing and enjoyable stuff for the scifi reader. Highly recommended.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|The bass smashing cover photo sums up the theme of this release of mass distruction.  At a time when the English youth were troubled by a failing economy, mass labour strikes and disenchantment with the Monarchy, the Clash's journey through reggae, rockabilly, punk and rock showcase the edgy emotions of the struggle.  The staccato guitar and drum that begin \\"London Calling\\" cut through from the onset.  Their version of \\"Brand New Cadillac\\", with the caustic lyric rework of \\"balls to you baby, I ain't ever coming back\\" rival the original version.  Two albums in the original vinyl release are worth listening to every second.  It is a great representation of punk angst.
159102594X|4.0|Good characters each seperate but intertwined throughout the story. Vivid descriptions and subplots. This book has conflict, torture, adventure, politics, scheming, love, failure and success, heroes with shades of gray, dark creepy magic, an Inquisition of goverment torturers bent on rooting out corruption, varied countries with vastly different cultures. All in all one hell of a good story. If you liked Firefly by Josh Whedon, this story is for you. Great characters and subplots in which at times the heroes are against each other.
B000AJIAOO|5.0|The song \\"Somewhere\\" is what started it for me. I heard it on a youtube video months ago, and absolutly adored it.<br /><br />The intro is beautiful, despite no lyrics, and it leads in seamlessly to See Who I Am.<br /><br />It would be hard to choose a favorite song on this album. They are all brilliant in and of themselves. \\"Pale\\" sounds very celtic to me, and so sad, especially the chorus.<br /><br />Angels is about someone whos been deceived, after believing someone was the one for them, only to have their heart broken. Memories is a heart breaking song about always having someone with you, as long as you remember them.<br /><br />Somewhere to me, is the saddest song on the album, but it also speaks of hope, that you'll find the one you love again.<br /><br />So worth the money.

B0018AVNKC|5.0|If one of Salvador Dali's nightmares could be transferred to film and shown in 3D, Coraline would be the result. I just saw this movie today at the theater, and I must say it is one of the most visually captivating and surreal experiences I've seen on the big screen. But in a good way! And not to mention I saw this in Digital 3D, and that made it even better! This was the best 3D movie I've ever seen!<br /><br />This is also the first Stop Motion movie to be filmed in 3D, and I sure hope they make more of them. The 3D wasn't gimmicky with things flying out at you, the 3D adds tone and depth to the movie. Like the scenes in the tunnel- you really feel as if you're in there! and the glasses are great too- they aren't the crappy Red and Blue glasses which hurt your eyes. They're polarized 3D glasses, meaning slightly tinted, like sunglasses. This said, it's crystal clear, and your eyes actually feel good while watching this.<br /><br />In Coraline, Coraline Jones and her workaholic parents move to an old apartment close to the woods. The place needs a lot of enhancing, and where she lives are two ladies on the lower level and the a crazy but loveable man named Mr. Bobinski on the higher level. She is also being annoyed by Wyborn, a nerd who lives with his grandma. However, in the house, there is a secret doorway which in the day, is justst bricks, but in the evening is a portal to another world. She goes to this other world and finds that her \\"Other family\\" lives there, and they have buttons for eyes. They also have the \\"other\\" Wyborn, and so on. This is a great place to be and offers happiness until Coraline realizes she must make a sacrifice she'd never make. And because of this, things start getting pretty scary!!!<br /><br />This is a beautiful and amazing movie. I don't think I've ever seen something so captivating visually and story-wise, and this movie has some beautiful and sometimes disturbing imagery. It really is Dali-ish at times and is pretty stunning to look at. And as I mentioned before, the 3D is spectacular. There is nothing like it. Like I said, it's not gimmicky, it makes the movie more dramatic. It brings the movie to life, and puts you in it. I must warn you this is NOT for kids- it's VERY creepy and for the most part, will frighten the young ones.<br /><br />So in short, do not miss this movie while it's in theatres, You won't regret it, and if you can see it in 3D, be sure to do it. Too bad the Jonas Brothers movie kicked it out :(. Anyways, see this movie!ned before, the 3D is spectacular. There is nothing like it. Like I said, it's not gimmicky, it makes the movie more dramatic. It brings the movie to life, and puts you in it. I must warn you this is NOT for kids- it's VERY creepy and for the most part, will frighten the young ones.

B001C4CI8A|4.0|BODY OF LIES<br /><br />*** ½ Out of 5<br /><br />Release Date- October 10th, 2008<br /><br />Running Time- 128-Minutes<br /><br />Rating- R<br /><br />Screenplay- William Monahan<br /><br />Director- Ridley Scott<br /><br />Starring- Leonardo DiCaprio, Russell Crowe, Mark Strong, Ali Suliman, Golshifteh Farahani<br /><br />I was quite excited for Body of Lies due to the talent that was involved. While I'm not a huge fan of Russell Crowe he is a very talented actor and in my opinion Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the very best if not the best actor working today and of course with Ridley Scott directing that also got my interest. But while I did like Body of Lies I have to admit I did find this to be a pretty big letdown. Maybe my expectations were too high, but when all was said and done Body of Lies was good, but it could have been a lot more.<br /><br />The screenplay by William Monahan is well written and plotted, but there just seems to be something missing. The characters I just couldn't make a connection with and for me that was the biggest problem. The characters are interesting, but never given much depth and while again the script was well written in general my only problem was the lack of depth to the characters; the plot is strong, but I also felt at times certain plot points weren't set up enough. Again the script was good, but just lacking in certain areas.<br /><br />The strongest parts of the script for me was when Roger Ferris (DiCaprio) has lunch with Aisha (Golshifteh Farahani) and her family; in these scenes is where there is a little more depth to the characters and I think more scenes like that would have greatly helped the movie.<br /><br />Director Ridley Scott does a fine job with the pacing; Body of Lies moves at a solid pace and there's never really a slow moment and the action scenes are quite well done. It is possible to have a movie well written, directed and acted, but yet not fully work. Body of Lies was a good movie, but was lacking the extra something that separates good movies from great movies. Scott though gets the job done and I think it was more of the script than the directing. The final act though was excellent and tension filled and in these scenes is where Ridley Scott really succeeds.<br /><br />Russell Crowe as Ed Hoffman delivers a solid performance, but he wasn't used to his full potential and while again it was a good performance he didn't show how talented he is. The biggest selling point for me was Leonardo DiCaprio who I honestly feel will go down as the greatest actor of his generation his talents as an actor is awe inspiring, but like Crowe, Leo isn't allowed to show his full range. Leo's performance was no doubt another winner in a career, which is shaping up to be legendary. The body of work he's done in the past few years is truly amazing, but when you have an actor like Leo you need to take full advantage and again Leo delivers another excellent performance, but he just wasn't used to his fullest potential. Iranian actress Golshifteh Farahani in her American film debut was the standout and nearly steals the show.<br /><br />Overall Body of Lies was a solid, but flawed movie; while the movie was good like I said I just felt as if it was missing that extra something that separates good movies from great movies. But with all that said Body of Lies is a good movie, but could have been more.<br /><br />The Blu-ray is loaded with extra features that cover pretty much every aspect of the film and they are also in HD. The picture quality is brilliant and the sound is great. The 2-disc DVD is about the same price as the BD, but for the extra couple of dollars I'd highly recommend the Blu-rayjob done and I think it was more of the script than the directing.

0446579939|4.0|I'm an Army Officer who picked up another one of Sparks book and felt like a woman after reading it, yet gave this one a try and was much happier with the results.  Nicholas got the emotions of a soldier just right this time.  The emotions of lost feelings and finding your place after war came out loud and  clear in this page turner.<br /><br />Nicholas spiced up the elements of what might have been a \\"good\\" case of PTSD and wove a story around a good luck charm that drew the main character into a love story.<br /><br />The story draws you in and will not let you do anything but fall in love with the characters, and even the dog who is the co-star of the book.  I was expecting a heart breaking ending but he did not have the guts to finish his book off by killing the lover boy (I wish he would have, because it would have been less expectant).<br /><br />I think most people will love this book.
0375842381|5.0|His Dark Materials is without a doubt the most intelligent children's fantasy I have ever read.  Pullman is a literary genius and master of sophisticated prose.  His world is so original and imaginative that nothing else compares.  It is refreshing to read something written for a young audience that does not automatically assume that kids are not smart enough to read something so complex.    Lyra is a fascinating protagonist.  She is incredibly multi-dimensional, strong-minded, and her flaws are endearing.      There are so many brilliant themes running amok in His Dark Materials that would help shape the moral fiber of any young mind.  Of course this series has not been without controversy, but accusations from religious communities are very much empty.  This series has a strong theme of being anti-religious corruption, not exactly anti-religion, as many would lead you to believe--which is ironic in so many ways.  As such, it will be controversial to anyone who doesn't want to think for himself but prefers for a religious institution to tell him how to think and feel.  This series is about the importance of freewill and the need to retain it against all costs, so the uproar from the religious community only makes Pullman's case all the more stronger.    His Dark Materials is thought provoking.  I found myself contemplating its themes and having deep sociological and universal conversations with people even after finishing the series.  It is definitely a must-read.
0061245097|5.0|I got my hands on this book.... Oh my goodness I read all 3 books in 5 days.  Being a mom of 2, I stayed up pretty late however it was worth every minute.  I have marked the calendar for all of Frost books that are coming out! I love her writing style.  Keep up the great work!
0312383320|5.0|With Janet Evanovich releasing only one Plum book a year, these in-between-the-numbers books are great.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book from start to finish.  I found myself laughing out loud a lot.  Sure, I would have loved to have Morelli and Ranger in it more, but Diesel is a great character too.  And I can't say enough about Lula.  I don't see how anyone could not like this book, but everyone has their own opinion.  I, personally, highly recommend it.
B0006IIPIK|4.0|I hadn't watched this in years & well I have to admit, this movie is right up my alley, I very much enjoyed it for many reasons. I love the visualization, the scenery, the atmosphere, the fact that it is a movie based on the Golden Era of movies, as if it was shot in the 1930s, it was like an action adventure film noir meets Jurassic park and the Iron Giant. I loved the giant robots & the dino creatures in this. The story has Jude Law as Sky Captain along with Gwyneth Paltow and Angelia Jolie trying to save the world from a mad scientist. Ok its a little deeper than that, but for me it was the action,all the great scenery of where this chase goes from the city to ice to underwater to the jungle. It was also like an Indiana Jones movie too. It had everything needed to entertain, had a lot of action, acting was fine but these movies are made for non stop thrills and this delivered. I do have a passion for giant monsters,robots and great atmospheric scenery,so if you are the same, I highly recommend this movie. It is a lot of fun and a good mix of genres.

B001NFNFNU|1.0|I walked out of this film in the theatre. I just couldn't watch Jolie put her hand over her mouth and cry one more time. I hear that Clint Eastwood is retiring from the movies. Thank God. His bleak vision of the world has bored me since \\"The Unforgiven\\" right through \\"Mystic River\\" and \\"Million Dollar Baby.\\" Enough is enough!
B001Q1QF2O|4.0|Lily Allen is back with her sophomore album, and while it may not be the most 'marketable' disc ever, it's certainly a lot of fun throughout as it ebbs between raw emotions, glossy production, and cheeky lyrics.    Moreso than her last album, Lily dabbles with a variety of genres and samples - including the rodeo-tinged 'It's Not Fair' (when guys 'have fun' first), the Greek folk dance opening of 'Never Gonna Happen', 70s meets carnival 'F*** You' (arguably the cheeriest tune on the album despite its tart send-up), and the 1920s jazz club style of closing track 'He Wasn't There'.     In terms of the most glittering, super-produced tunes - opening track \\"Everyone's At It\\" still manages to send out a strong message against prescription pills and the over-medication of today's world, while 'The Fear' is a slightly duller follow-up tune. 'Back To The Start' is probably the best of the dance-y tracks, as a four-minute lifelong apology to Lily's older half-sister.     Surprisingly, my favourite Lily tunes this time around come in the form of ballads and love songs, of which the album is chockful. 'Chinese' is probably my favourite, detailing the nuances of comfortable, familiar love, while 'Him' provides an interesting commentary on (presumably) Jesus as a pop culture icon.    Overall Lily's second album is great - especially if you're already a fan. At times it draws cues from her protege Kate Nash, at least in terms of having a bit more fun and variation throughout her album - but every song still comes off as recognizably Lily.
B0002NRQTI|5.0|Counterparts was, in my opinion, a huge comeback album for Rush.  When this album came out in the fall of 1993, I said to people, \\"Rush is back!\\"  The heavier sound from the 1970s and early 1980s was back.  After releasing a string of softer albums between 1982 and 1991, Counterparts goes back to Rush's roots.  Heavier guitars are instantly noticable, beginning with the first track, Animate.  It gets even heavier with the next track, Stick It Out.  In fact, Alex Lifeson provides Jimi Hendrix-like guitar feedback on this track!  The album continues to rock with Cut To The Chase, a hard rocker.  The next track takes things down a notch with some acoustic guitar mixed with electric, Nobody's Hero.  A good song, but I don't care for the subject matter.  My least favorite on the disc, but still a good song.  The next song is rather pop-like, Between Sun & Moon.  The next track really rocks, Alien Shore.  Great guitar and drumwork.  The Speed Of Love follows, a good song that is catchy.  More mellow, but still good.  The next track is one of the best on the album, Double Agent.  Heavy guitar with some electronically altered voicework by Geddy Lee that sounds sinister!  This song's melody and guitar reminds me of some of the material from the song 2112 and the song Cygnus X-1.  Excellent, and really heavy.  The next song is an instrumental, Leave That Thing Alone.  This might be their best instrumental song ever.  Right up there with YYZ and Where's My Thing?  The next song is a Rush classic, Cold Fire.  It is more commercial, but it rocks.  It starts with what sounds like some bottleneck guitar work by Alex Lifeson.  The album ends with the song Everyday Glory.  This song is kind of U2-like.<br /><br />Overall, this album is a winner.  A major comeback for Rush in my eyes, because I felt they were getting too mellow over the previous ten years, though they were releasing quality albums.  My only complaint about this album is I feel that Geddy Lee's voice isn't as good as previous albums, and even some albums since, such as Vapor Trails and Snakes & Arrows.  Geddy Lee seems to have a lower range on this album, and seems to \\"talk\\" more in some of the songs, rather than sing.  His voice seems to lack enthusiasm and energy on some tracks.  However, there are some strong vocal performances, such as Alien Shore, Double Agent, and Cold Fire.  I highly recommend this album to all fans who don't have it, and to anybody discovering Rush for the first time.  This album is just as good as their 1970s and early 1980s material.

0307269752|5.0|Stieg Larsson is a Genius!<br /><br />Book Review of  \\"The girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\"<br /><br />First off, if you cannot stomach reading about graphic sexual abuse, then you should pick a book with some lighter fare.  Having said that, this suspense thriller from the late Stieg Larsson will keep you on the edge of your seat.  At 600 plus pages, it's a hefty mystery but I finished it in record time, and you know a  book is good when you reach the last page and you feel wanting for more.<br /><br />The story begins with Mikael Blomkvist, a publisher of a magazine titled Millennium who is sentenced to 3 months for libel against a corporate titan.  The plot gets going when he is approached by an old retired CEO Henrik Vanger,  former head of the Vanger corporation.  As he tells Blomkvist, he is officially hired to write the family biography but in actual fact Vanger wants him to try to solve the decades old mystery of his grand niece Harriet Vanger's disappearance.  To deepen the mystery, every year after Harriet's disappearance, Vanger receives a flower from an unknown person, a tradition which Harriet had started when she was eight.<br /><br />The book's title character is perhaps the most intriguing- Lisbeth Salander, a  skinny 24 year old 90 pound,  pierced and tattooed goth chick with a distaste for authority figures  who has Asperger's syndrome and incredible computer hacking skills.<br /><br />As a murder mystery Tattoo would have been an excellent read but it is so much more. It exposes the dark underbelly of Swedish financial politics,  abuse of social services by authority figures (Salander is directly victimized in one scene)  and right wing misogynist attitudes towards women in general.  After reading this book I can understand why it was originally titled \\"Men who hate women\\" although Dragon Tattoo is a catchier title.<br /><br />Like many other readers worldwide I can't wait to get my hands on the next two books in the series \\" The Girl who played with Fire\\" and \\"The Girl who kicked the Hornet's Nest\\".  Larsson's untimely death in 2004 was indeed a great loss to the world of literature in general and crime fiction in particular.<br /><br />He has left a lasting legacy which readers will enjoy and cherish for generations to come.<br />Well done Stieg.  Rest in peace.s Nest\\".     Larsson's untimely death in 2004 was indeed a great loss to the world of literature in general and crime fiction in particular.

B000IFS0HM|2.0|\\"Angela's Ashes\\" is an autobiographical story of Frank McCourt growing up in Ireland during the depression and World War II.  Through the entire book I just really wanted something good to happen to this family, but it never does.<br /><br />The first probably 3/4 of the book is incredibly eye-opening.  It was amazing to me how little this family could live with, especially food.  It made me see how resilient people can be, how little we really need, and the terrible circumstances some people live in.<br /><br />If you don't read anything else in the book, the chapter on Frank's first communion is worthwhile.  I was in tears reading it to my husband, laughing so hard at Frank's grandmother's horror at Frank throwing it up in her backyard.<br /><br />Overall, I don't recommend \\"Angela's Ashes.\\"  It was bad while he was young and poor and that was difficult to read, but the last about 1/4 of the book the story turns south.  Think young man growing up.  He gets a little too much 'excitement' when he's alone and sometimes with others.  Maybe McCourt is happy sharing his blatant immorality, but I don't need to read about it.<br /><br />I love when I finish a book, close it, and just have to sit and breathe for a few minutes and let the greatness of it all soak in.  When I finished this there wasn't even a hint of that.  More like, \\"That was it?\\"  There was some good, but it didn't overwhelm the bad.

B00002Z88D|5.0|This is a really great c.d. It is not what you would expect from Metallica. The cd is a live concert with the San Francisco symphony. The symphony adds a new dimension to metal music. It is really quite beautiful. The songs on the cd are classic Metallica, a few new and not so knowns. A definate competitor of Death Magnetic in my cd player.
B001P9KR94|5.0|I watch alot of movies but somehow this one had slipped under my radar until an Indian American friend recommended it. Since that day I've seen the movie 3 times in theaters (sure it was on dates but still!) I can't wait to get my blue ray copy so I can experience the wonderful cinematography and music in high def. The movie deserves all the accolades it has received and it is a very fun and uplifting film which is rare for Best Picture winners at the Oscars. I cannot recommend this film highly enough!
B000IZJ1KC|5.0|This has got to be one of my favorite albums of all time by now. I've listened to it well over 100 times... Times change, most people would list Beatles albums, or a Rolling Stones album amongst their faves... I am not from that generation, I'm 29... so when I was in high school, I was listening to KORN, WHITE ZOMBIE and 311... I didn't get my first PANTERA record until I was 18, that was Cowboys from hell... I liked it... I didn't love it, a couple years later a friend gave me a copy of The Great Southern trendkill and I went \\"there ya go!\\"... all killer, no filler... I'm a drummer and a guitar player, so I like many different types of music, but Metal and Hard rock music are my bread and butter... Later I bought albums from Cradle Of Filth (which I have to say is sort of a band you grow out of) and Dimmu Borgir (a band whom I still dig)... eventually I checked out a few \\"Black Metal\\" bands and the one that grabbed me and wouldn't let go is IMMORTAL... They are more than a Black metal band, but still, you put on an IMMORTAL record at a party, your gonna get some funny looks... however, IMMORTAL is an awesome band with awesome musicianship and that's what I want when I listen to music... not to be trendy or depressed or paint my nails black or be a Hot-topic fruitcake... Anyways, as a guitar player, and after watching some of the most entertaining interviews with Abbath on YouTube, I became a fan of the guy... He's funny, he's got a hilarious sense of humour and he's no BS, he just wants to rock the F out... So when this came out I bought it right away and it's one of the few albums I can listen to on constant repeat... One may argue that it's just slowed down recycled IMMORTAL riffs with rock solos... maybe at times, but who cares... put on any Rolling Stones record and tell me THOSE aren't recycled riffs!! Anyways, any fan of REAL Heavy music, Metal or Rock should seriously pick this up, who knows, you may discover something new.
0525951113|1.0|The first three chapters do a passable job of plot development and getting the evil gamer Matthew Sobol's character introduced to the reader.  Then, in chapter 4, the wheels come off.      Gratuitous sex, drugs and partying, seamy characters, foul language - this does absolutely nothing to further the story.  In fact, I found it a complete turn-off.    Blood and gore surround the primary characters throughout the book.  Even if you suspend disbelief, you cannot help but ask \\"Why did Suraez write this piece of trash?\\"    Do not be fooled by the testimonials on the back flyleaf.  Most of them are from people who he acknowledges at the end of the book as providing \\"time and effort\\" with his writing.  It's like having your mother write a review of your book.

Yep though the love story is sweet, short and intense it is accidental long lost brother and sister action.
1554073847|5.0|This book was recommended to me by the manager of the day care where my twin 2 1/2 year old girls go to school.  We are just getting started in the process of introducing them to potty training - trying to get the interest up.  This has quickly become one of their favorite bedtime reads.    I, too, would now recommend this to the parents of twins as a great book to get little girls interested in using the potty.  At this age, my daughters are tightly bound to Mom; the story line links the little girl to her Mom, striking a cord with my girls and making the message more easy to relate to.

B001NFNFF8|4.0|I found it difficult to initially write a balanced review on ItEM because I felt so connected to this film. To disclaim, I performed Civil War re-enacting for 8 years with the 5th Texas, and my family name matches the main character; Never have seen Robicheaux/Robechaud in any film. So that aside, I just watched a great Tommie Lee Jones film filled with Civil War history (including a great role by Levon Helm playing John Bell Hood) and modern bayou mystery. Also nice to see the Louisiana area get some film money injected into their economy.<br /><br />Plenty of upset people out there about the loss from the book series to film, but since I had not read any of the books, and I appreciate a film that doesn't spell every character out for you - this made for a solid, low-key suspense crime saga. Yes, there is a plethora of characters that pop in and out, obvious story lines not being conveyed in their entire sequence, and personality traits never explained with TLJ's violent/subdued split angles - but it all made (wholeheartedly) for a rewatchable film. Believable performances all around, and I hope to see them all again in more of these (like the successful Jesse Stone/Tom Selleck series). Nitpicking aside from other posters (Yes - there was Texas Cavalry in the Civil War) and the film being too short (I look forward to the other films being made), I hope people give this film a chance.<br /><br />The BD sound was excellent with the DTS, and some of the pans will test your display refresh rate (several sequences of low angles/pointing up with sky backdrops; vehicles driving along ridges, fan boats skimming along the bayou, etc.). Some of the music mix sounded perfect and the 1080p shows our flawed characters' shortcomings in ways I never imagined, including John Goodman in tight swim trunks. There are absolutely no extras to speak of so I could not say this is a 5 star BD release, but definitely worth the purchase.
031606792X|5.0|I really liked Breaking Dawn. After the disaster that was Eclipse I had low expectations for this final book. I was tired of Bella with her constant whining and fainting and the way she betrayed Edward made my sick in Eclipse. Breaking Dawn resolved my issues with Eclipse and unlike alot of the negative reviews I did not see a problem with Bella getting married and having a child.  I mean come on, she was about the become a vampire and everyone is upset because she wasn't going straight to college after high school lol!! She has time to attend college 100x if she wants to in the future. I also like that she stopped whining in the book and that her character actually progressed.<br />This story is a fairytale, I was expecting for Bella to get everything in the end and I was happy when she did.<br />Jacob's character really shined in this book and let me tell you, after Eclipse I wouldn't have minded if she killed his character off.  I enjoyed looking at things from his point of view and I liked how Meyer resolved the 'love traingle' that I was so disgusted with in Eclipse.<br />I just started reading Midnight Sun on her website and I love it, reading from Edward's point of view is refreshing. I hope she gets it finished and in the bookstore soon.
B00122FW4E|4.0|With a band as accomplished and multifaced as REM, the problem with any live album or \\"best of\\" compilation is neatly summarizing their career, or even capturing the essence of their greatness as a band.      This live collection chooses to focus on their anthemic alternative power pop side.  This is not what they do best, but they do it better than almost any other comparable band.  With just one exception, this collection overlooks their first three records entirely, the ones that solidified their signature jangle pop that influenced thousands of bands.  It also under-represents their mournful acoustic based folk side (see Out of Time and Automatic), which I beleive is their strongest suit.  It doesn't give much of a nod to the more experimental offerings of the last decade either (Up and Reveal), come to think of it.       That leaves, as stated before, their unique brand of intelligent, quirky power pop, and it is peformed, for the most part, masterfully.  They sound as tight and assertive as a band as they did in the peak of the Bill Berry years.  Every track is played louder and faster than its studio counterpart, and the effect is largely invigorating.  Every song seems lightly dipped in the oily, grungy waters of Monster, played with an intensity reminiscent of the Lifes Rich Pageant era.  The songs that benefit most from this approach are the six songs from Around the Sun, which sound much more urgent and energized here, especially Electron Blue.  Other songs that either surpass or at least provide interesting alternatives to their studio versions are Walk Unafraid, The Great Beyond, and the blazing opener, I Took Your Name. Drive by itself is almost worth the price, as Michael Stipe's vocal literally breathes maniacal new life into that strange, droning Pink Floydian space-folk anthem.  When he intones, \\"Maybe you're crazy in the head\\", he sounds exactly that.     On a critical note, a few of the performances are played so faithfully that they bring nothing new to the table live.  Cuyahoga, Losing My Religion, and Leaving New York are virtually indistinguishable from their studio versions.  Other than that, there's not much to complain about.  It is priced very reasonably for what is essentially a double album.  Could it be better?  Of course.  But capturing what makes REM great is a tall order, and this is an admirable go at it.
B000002LJW|5.0|I have so many Clapton albums from Cream forward but this has always been one of my favorites. Of all the many Clapton songs over the years this cd contains my absolute favorite- Old Love. The cost of this cd is worth it just for this song.

1592402690|3.0|I was interested in reading this book, but once I got it, I found most of it to be rather hard to believe. Apparently, if Geoff Emerick hadn't been in the control room, the Beatles would have gone the way of the Archies. I'm not denigrating the contributions to the Beatles recordings that Emerick obviously made, but some of the things he says about Georges Martin and Harrison are more than a little hard to believe. A fair book, not much more.

People say that it was better than \\"Hannibal\\", I've never seen \\"Hannibal\\", but people said that it was too grusome. But this movie was just as suspenseful as \\"The Silence Of The Lambs\\", and Anthony Hopkins still plays his oscar winning role to a T.
1401207138|4.0|NOTE: The 2008 Absolute Watchmen reprint (2005 print is discontinued), that Amazon is now selling, has a different cover. The reprint has a clock on both the front and back covers of the book.<br /><br />I could go on and on about how \\"Watchmen\\" is one of the greatest comics out there and how Alan Moore is a genius, but I won't do that because I am sure you already know. Instead I am going to talk about the Absolute Edition of \\"Watchmen\\".<br /><br />The Absolute Edition is the must-have edition of this graphic novel. The Absolute Edition is an oversized slipcased hardcover version of the graphic novel measuring in at 12.9 x 8.6 x 1.8 inches. It contains restored and recolored art and 48 pages of bonus material. To be more precise, the following is on a slip of paper that comes with the Absolute Edition:<br /><br />\\"This oversized hardcover collection features digitally remastered line art and brand new coloring, overseen by John Higgins and Dave Gibbons. It includes 48 pages of supplemental material that has been out of print for nearly two decades, featuring a sampling of Alan Moore's script pages and the original series proposal, plus tons of Dave Gibbon's initial character designs, cover sketches, and promo pieces.\\"<br /><br />The supplemental material is quite excellent. It is interesting to find out what was behind the creation of the characters in \\"Watchmen\\" and how they resemble some earlier comic book characters, like how Dr. Manhattan is similar to Captain Atom.<br /><br />The only downside I can think of about \\"Absolute Watchmen\\" is the high price tag. Do I think it is worth the price here on Amazon? Yes, I really do. But I would have preferred it to be a little bit cheaper.

B0014Z4OQG|5.0|WAKE UP!<br /><br />Just in case you were sleeping and didn't notice, I gave this movie five stars.  Yep, that's right; I gave `Cloverfield' an A.  I know what you are thinking.  `He's crazy.'  Maybe I am, but the truth of the matter is (and I've stated I rate each film according to genre as well as overall entertainment and artistic value) that for the type of film `Cloverfield' is, and for the type of film it makes claim to be, there really isn't much more you could ask from it.<br /><br />I mean, honestly; what isn't right about this picture?<br /><br />The film is crazy suspenseful, action packed, gripping, witty, enthralling, memorable; I mean I can't think of a single thing that I would have changed.  The script may be a little cookie cutter but the execution is fresh and intriguing and adds layers that aren't there on paper.  Visually it is superb, using the very underused `less is more' tactic in order to create true suspense and fear; and when it does insert CGI in order to give us some brief glimpses of this `creature' in order to validate our fear it is top notch.  Casting a group of unknowns adds to the feeling of reality that sets in, which only increases the fear.<br /><br />I mean, really; watch this movie in the dark and tell me you weren't pulling your feet up on the couch and checking behind you at every creak in your house.<br /><br />The concept is simple; a group of friends get together to wish one of their own a bon voyage when the city is attacked by some creature and they are scattered.  They travel together with a handheld camera through the city to rescue a friend who is injured and wind up documenting something unbelievable.<br /><br />A little side note for those of you who have either complained about the shaky camcorder style filming or are biting at the bit to do so; DON'T.  Listen, I understand you don't want to get sick or whatever, but the camcorder filming is the whole point of this movie.  If you know that that type of filming doesn't bode well with you then don't bother watching this movie.  Seriously, to complain about a directorial choice that is more than explained to you in the trailer for the film and that serves as the whole foundation for the film is rather ridiculous.  This movie, stripped of that shaky frame, would not be the same film.  It is meant to pull you in to the action and make you feel a part of it, and it does that very thing.<br /><br />Anyways.<br /><br />I admit, this isn't a thought provoking drama or a brooding character study, but it isn't trying to be.  Sure, sci-fi or even horror films are allowed to stray into deeper territories and I encourage that wholeheartedly, but for a film that claims to be nothing more than a sci-fi thriller I can't fault it a thing.

1595141715|5.0|This book was amazing, and very thought provoking. It makes you understand, in a way, that people can affect each other so much without knowing it.    Was it really any of the persons' direct fault that Hannah did what she did? Not at all. They all unknowingly played a small part in it. They didn't see what the consequences would be, or that it would lead in a death.    It is a book that will definitely make you look at the world around you in a different way, wondering how the things you do will affect other people, and making you feel more cautious.    The story, from the two different perspectives, lets you into the minds of the two main characters, Clay and Hannah. One is trying to figure out what caused a person he cared about to take her own life; the other is trying to explain to him, and others, just why she did.    I listened to the audio copy of the book, and the way it had been recorded, if felt as if you were hearing Hannah's voice for yourself. It made it a more emotional experience, and much more intriguing.    But that's what the story was for; showing through the voice of Hannah, that something unexpected and horrible can happen if you don't pay enough attention to the things around you.    [Spoiler Warning] It's the reason why, in the end, Clay doesn't let Skye walk away and give up the opportunity to talk to her, but follows her. [End Spoilers]    Over all, this book teaches that you can only do something once, and what you do with that one chance, can matter enough to save (or destroy) someone's life.
B00007LTIA|4.0|To me, it is kind of surprising why so many people dislike this album, including YES' very own fans, receiving lukewarm reception at time of release. Sure, 'Closer to the Edge,' which came out one year before, in 1972, is more of an exciting, energetic listen, this one is much more soothing and majestic. I guess some people just don't like change. Why criticize a band who tries to do something different with their music? This is not just mere noodling, imo. This is YES music that takes you places. Maybe some people can't handle 20 minute plus songs, but to me that is what Progressive Rock was intended for, to stretch it as far as and as open as music can go. Maybe the public just never wanted to lend their ear to such a long record, believing that 'Tales from Topographic Oceans' pushes the limits of how long an album should be.<br />I truly think that some of YES' best music can be found here, within each of the 4 original main tracks. Over the last couple years, I have gotten into so much music, and many genres, whether it being ambient, electronica, or 'Psybient' (psychedelic & ambient) music by Shpongle- I always come back to YES, and listening to this really is a musical awakening. This really is one of the most relaxing albums that I own, an epic journey that flows on from start to finish. Closer to a 4.5 rating than a 4 star rating.
B00006JL1Z|3.0|This is an excellent compilation of the \\"late\\" Fleetwood Mac - from Rumours onward.  If you like the Buckingham-Nicks era, you won't be disappointed.  But as often seems the case, the Green-Spencer-Kirwan-Welch lineups have been ignored, making this only half of the superb retrospective it could have been.  If you're looking for \\"Oh Well\\", \\"Black Magic Woman\\", \\"Bare Trees\\", \\"Woman of 1,000 Years\\", or \\"Hypnotize\\", you'll still need to buy the original albums.  Although the sound was very different (not better, not worse) once Buckingham and Nicks joined the band, Fleetwood Mac fans deserve the full range of the greatest hits.
B000026FOA|5.0|What a revelation this was, to discover such a talent many years after the artist's death. Now a personal favorite artist of mine for a few years now. Today, and not too long ago, one can hear artists who were deeply inspired by Nick Drake, who to me has one of the most peaceful, but tortured voices that I have ever encountered. During the time that Nick Drake was alive, his music wasn't nearly as appreciated as it is today. This album, his debut, is also his best. Bryter Layter's pace seems a bit more sped up, and lacks his better songs. 'Pink Moon' was my first album by Nick Drake, but personally, I just don't care for the more stripped down sound. This one contains weeping strings and soft vocals, it's surprising that songs like \\"River Man\\" or \\"Way to Blue\\" weren't hit songs in their day. Those two are also two of Nick Drake's finest achievements. Maybe with recent artists like the late Elliott Smith and Iron and Wine, we can appreciate Drake's incredible talent that much more. Not only was he an incredible singer, but the strings sections by Robert Kirby, on this release is just simply gorgeous. The great Robert Thompson, of Fairport Convention, also lent his talent, playing guitar. I cannot think of any artist with a more piercing voice than Drake's, one that can split a Man's heart. You couldn't say that about any hard-core band or heavy metal group that has more shock value than they have songwriting skills. No, and for me it is hard to think of any other folk artist with a more powerful delivery. This man, Nick Drake, was a genius, who died way too young at age 26. At least people are still discovering his music. Whether these people are generally happy people, or sad, Nick Drake's music always touches the heart. As with most artists, one only wonders what could have been if Nick Drake was still living today. He could have become one of the finest singer/songwriters, although to me, with only 3 albums, he is just that.

B001P5Q6F2|5.0|I popped Wrath in and my ears were instantly surprised to hear a very soothing/ melodic acoustic introduction. Now, fans of Lamb of God would know that the band has very few acoustic parts in any of their songs, so this really intrigued me, being a huge fan of acoustics. It kinda reminded me of something Shadows fall might do. The overlapping electric guitar quickly comes in, setting the mood perfectly. The thing I love about this album is that it is very clear to me that the band is progressing,yet still retaining their signature sound and heaviness. There are 3 tracks on here with acoustic portions (quite uncharacteristic of the guys), and every one is amazing. Grace begins with a beautiful bluesy, soulful acoustic portion, quite obviously written and played by Mark Morton. Last but not least is Reclamation, which sounds haunting and kind of tribal to me- Excellent closing track, ending in classic Lamb of God style, being the longest song on the album and containing an acoustic intro.<br /><br />Now I don't want to make it seem like with all this acoustic talk that Lam of God are getting lighter or anything... Not at all. If anything, they're just as heavy as ever. There are many many vintage Mark Morton/ Willie Adler guitar tradeoff riffs here and some sick breakdowns also. Guitar solos are more frequent than ever on here too, and thats for sure a bonus. I'd have to say that my fav. tracks are Broken Hands, with an extremely catchy chorus and great, melodic guitar work, and In Your Words, the first \\"true\\" track on the record. Also- Choke Sermon and Fake Messiah are the other front runners. Honestly, there really aren't any weak tracks on here, but if I had to choose, I'd say Everything to Nothing is my least fav. track on here. Of course, when you're dealing with these guys, you know you're gonna be getting some dirty/ gritty riffs and that's exactly the case on Wrath. As the band themselves stated, Wrath is really a \\"natural\\" \\"no frills\\" metal album. It's nice to see this type of album these days. It's got it's own unique identity and it pays homage to the thrash roots also. Another interesting note is also that Randy has some, how should I put this, cleaner, more high pitched screaming than previously. There's also some really cool gang vocals too. The band really made the songs fit and flow smoothly with Wrath, and though I still prefer Ashes of the Wake and Sacrament to it, they did things just right on here and showed why they're on top of the metal world now.<br /><br />So, go pick yourself up a copy if you haven't done so and enjoy some good modern day metal. If you're a musician, you just might want to pick up the deluxe edition. The second disc is every single track picked apart individual instruments. So it's something cool to play along with. Enjoy!!!!is type of album these days. It's got it's own unique identity and it pays homage to the thrash roots also.

B001M5UDGS|5.0|Pros:  -Fun music  -Interesting characters  -Leaves you wanting more    Cons:  -leaves you wanting more  -features are mixed  -probably not for everyone    I first saw this online not know what to expect and was surprised.  It draws you in with an interesting concept. Keeps you watching by giving you some entertaining music (which does stand alone).  Finally the story itself begins pick up and keep you watching right through the end.  Since the pacing shifts gears (from concept to music and lastly the story) it may cause some people to lose interest before story really take center stage, however it worth sticking with it.  The main character (dr.horrible) is interesting and endearing.  He hold this world together and ultimate the story.  On the other side, the sterotyped, self righteous, and campy hero (Capt. Hammer) may detract for some.  In fact most of the other character inhabiting this world are on the campy almost 2d characters. If the camp is a serious turn off it probably not for you, for the rest this is where much of the charm comes from.  In short,  I loved it for the music, the camp, and the heart of Dr. Horrible.

B000005Z0G|5.0|This cd was before 2pac became really commercial and focused on money and fame more. Everyone will always say that All Eyez On Me or Me Against The World was his best album but trust me a lot of that has to do with the fact that they were commercialized to the max. I'm not saying that those albums aren't unbelievable, because they are. But as 2pac became more mainstream, the personal interaction that you felt with him on his earlier albums started to diminish. On this album you literally feel like he's talking to you and it really shows how talented he was. He was hard on this album; imagine the political knowledge and awareness of public enemy combined with the anger and passion of Rage Against The Machine. He absolutely tore the roof off and at the same time dropped an astounding amount of knowledge. If you've never heard 2pac before and you want to know why he's considered the best of all time, listen to The Streetz R Deathrow, I Get Around and Keep Ya Head Up. I honestly can't believe that this album doesn't have at least 200 reviews like all his other later ones. Do not get 2pacalypse first, in my opinon it was underproduced and 2pac hadn't really found himself musically yet. This is not one of those albums where you listen to it and say, \\"It's not bad, but I can see why it wasn't as highly praised as his other albums.\\" This could easily stand amongst Me Against The World and All Eyez On Me as one of his best albums.
B000NIWI9K|5.0|Mozart's Cosi fan Tutte is a delightful opera, full of melody, tangled motivations, good natured teasing, silly disguises and serious thought.  In this performance from Glyndebourne the singers are beautiful as well as talented; consequently the entire story comes alive.  Wonderfully executed musically and visually, it's a performance that completely embodies the spirit of Mozart's opera.  Not to be missed.

031606792X|4.0|Breaking Dawn is definitely a book that has a lot of rises and falls in the \\"intensity level\\" of each section.  From the start, you hear of Bella and Edward leaving for their honeymoon. They return with a surprise to all: Bella is pregnant.  This is very controversial in the vampire world, as it has never really happened before.  The baby eventually takes over Bella, almost killing her, until the Cullen's discover it craves blood and not human food.  After successfully delivering the baby, many unexpected things come about from her leaving the reader speechless.      Though all in all this was a great book, I expected more for the ending especially from Meyer.  All of her previous books leave you with such a powerful ending that just sums everything up.  The ending to Breaking Dawn, was just plain boring.  It was so predictable and simple.  I wish she had taken it down a path that no one would have expected.  Though the ending sort of ruined it for me, I would recommend this book to Twilight Saga readers as it does take it a further step than the rest.  For anyone who likes a great ending though, I do not recommend this novel.

0312360266|3.0|This is my review of the book, not an explanation of what the book is about, so I'll go straight to my opinion of it and whatever else is in my head. The book let me with several  unanswered questions: who exactly gets marked? can it be anyone ot is there a special criteria? why does the mark occurs in the first place? meaning, why does the goddes needs to mark humans? were vampires becoming extinct and that's why humans are needed? Maybe I just think too much about it. The book has a nice combination of vampires and magic, which I really enjoyed. I was really put off by the whole \\"only dumb people smoke\\" I already know smoking is bad for you and I don't enjoy having a whole lesson on it when I'm reading...for fun (probably the price you pay when you read books for youn adults). Also, it really bodered me how fast Zoey and Eric became an item. Oh and I HATE the \\"Twin\\" thing, how annoying!!! But not all was bad I just had to get these things out of my chest. I'm looking forward reading the second book, but I'm not in a rush.

He started looking at it and asked if he could get it. A book? He wants to buy a book?? Uh...yeah you can get it. He had it read by that night. So we went right out to buy the second one. He had that one read by the weekend. For this book we had to preorder it so we knew it would get here.    All I know is that my boys love these books like they have never loved books before. They are ingulfed in them, I hear them laughing and they even discuss them when they are both done and compare thier favorite parts. I am actually starting them all this weekend because I want to see why they are so good.  Thank you, Thank you, Jeff Kinney. I feel it only takes one good book to spark an interest in reading. These books did that for my 12 year old. Finally!!!   A friend of ours just got the books as well for her 11 year old. She said something was wrong with him because he was taking the book to read in the car instead of his IPod. She said she wanted to cry because she was so happy:)   Get these books for your kids. You cannot go wrong!
B001GCUNYO|5.0|Last year we had RAMBO and this year we have TAKEN.  In both cases some older guys show today's younger action heroes how it is supposed to be done.<br /><br />Sorry but Bourne holds no candle to Stallone and Neeson in these 2 films.<br /><br />But both TAKEN and RAMBO are more than just action movies... they also have a message about our world today.<br /><br />There is a difference between IDEALISM and REALISM and ignorance is not bliss.<br /><br />Especially in America today Political Correctness seems to have made a large part of our population oblivious to the fact that real evil exists in the world and has to be dealt with.  Instead we have too many people turning a blind eye to so many bad trends and warning signs developing in our changing culture but they choose to stick their heads in the sand and think \\"everything will be OK, people are inherently good\\".<br /><br />With RAMBO it was the well intentioned missionaries who could not believe they would run into problems in Burma (But Rambo knew better).<br /><br />With TAKEN it is the naive, socially liberal family that thinks they can travel the world without a care (But Neeson's character knows better).<br /><br />In both films, our central character has to rescue our idealistic, naive victims from the harsh realities that truly exist in the world.<br /><br />I wonder how many viewers of these movies get the underlying message and how many only see these as tough guy action films ?

0312383320|5.0|How anybody could not like this latest 'between the numbers' entry is beyond me.  Stephanie is at her best (ruining cars, blowing up buildings, exciting the interests of fab men like Joe Morelli, Ranger, and, well, yes, Diesel).  As a working bounty hunter, she actually gets the body tickets on several FTAS, while working a case involving far-out techno-psychos and a bunch of monkeys.  Who could ask for anything more?  Janet Evanovich is the one writer I would most like to be left with on a desert island -- and here is all of her best stuff:  great characters (Lula the ex-'ho is at her best, although Grandma Masur is only in this one briefly, and Vinnie Plum doesn't actually make an appearance); wonderfully sexy men (Joe and Ranger, although Diesel I can take or leave); and all the Jersey ambience you could ask for.  A Cadillac Escalade figures largely here, as well as the Pine Barrens -- the legacy of Tony S.????.  Anyway, the usual cast of characters is enlarged with the weirdo inhabitants of the Pine Barrens:  Sasqwatch (SP?), Elmo the Fire-Farter, and the Jersey Devil, e.g.  I laughed and laughed, as always with Janet.  More, more, more, I always wish for.......

Stephanie's character always has some really funny lines I laugh so hard I cry.  Another excellent addition to the Evanovich mysteries.  Think some of the readers may be taking things a bit too seriously...it's a fun and entertaining read.

1423113497|5.0|I've read all four books and I have found them pretty good. Not as good as the Harry Potter books in my opinion- they don't have quite the descriptive and immersing storyline- but the Percy Jackson novels are full of adventure throughout the entire book, which I found to be entertaining enough to make up for lack of detail. My only disappointments are that the books are really written for a younger audience (unlike many other YA books, which are written so teens can enjoy them and older adults can get even more out of them, i.e. HP), also that he either assumes you have a bad memory or that you haven't read the previous books.<br /><br />My opinion is based from someone who is 25. If your the parent of a teenager or preteen, then my nags do not apply to them. They will likely love the books without any complaints! I'm more speaking to those closer to my age or older.<br />My 16 yr old brother loved the first book and is reading the second- and he hardly reads. He never finished the 3rd HP book, and hasn't read much of anything else except half of a zombie book. I thought he could use some new books, and I hoped to enjoy them as well.  - Which I did.<br /><br />Each book gets better. the story becomes much more developed with each book, but it always seemed like Riordan tried to keep them short. I personally like more immersion- which needs more detail. But don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to put down the books! I think their great books, and I would recommend them to anyone under 20, and many adults who enjoyed the HP books.<br /><br />*Edit: My little brother is now finished with the fourth book and my family is excited that he is actually reading! He very much liked these PJ books and is telling his friends about them. I've already said he could lone the first one to a friend. I'm looking for other books now that he might like. Think I'll go with the Bartimaeus Trilogy next.

0679735909|5.0|This is not an easy book to read.  I had to try to get into it more than once.  However, once I did get into it, it was like finding a buried treasure.<br /><br />'The book'.......so begins this sweeping tribute to the written word, the intellect, and the creative power of metaphor.  The novel is about two literary critics researching two dead poets.  They keep finding new information and the book is layered like Russian stacking dolls.  It is a magical version of the 'what ifs' that comprise our inner and outer journeys juxtaposed with 'what is'.<br /><br />The story is told in alternating chapters going back and forth from the past to the present.  It is an amazing feat of writing and a book I will re-read and cherish always.  If you are in love with books, words, art and great writing, this is a book that you do not want to pass up!

B000FVQLQQ|4.0|As I usually try to do, I read the book prior to seeing the movie.  The book was much clearer than the movie but I thought the movie was very well done.<br /><br />The movie is about the Nobel Prize winner in economics, John Nash.  It stars Jennifer Connelly and Russell Crowe,  John Nash is a Princeton student when he develps Schizophrenia.  The movie is very accurate in its portrayal of delusions and hallucinations, though it was sometimes confusing - especially the part about whether his roommate really exists.<br /><br />Both Crowe and Connelly do excellent jobs.  The movie goes light on Nash's bi-sexuality, does not go into his having a deadbeat dad, and ignores his relationship with Eleanor Stier.  Other than these things, it is pretty true to the book.<br /><br />Nash does have a beautiful mind.  Once he starts losing his mind due to the tragedy of schizophrenia, it is heartwarming to see that he maintains the respect of his Princeton colleagues and students.  I applaud this movie for raising peoples' consciousness about schizophrenia.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie for anyone who enjoys drama and is interested in mental illness and resilience.

B0008KLVG4|5.0|Of the many blockbuster films Steven Spielberg directed, I wonder if this might wind up as his most famous years from now. Like Hitchcock and \\"Psycho,\\" it certainly was his most shocking and scariest film. For months, people were afraid to go into the ocean after seeing this film. Few people knew what a Great White Shark looked like, but they have ever since this film came out!    No, it doesn't hold the terror it did when released about 30 years ago, but it is still scary, still entertaining and moves at a fast pace. This is a quick two hours of movie-watching. The music has held up even better than the special-effects. The creepy music whenever the shark is near still can get your adrenaline flowing!    I didn't find any of the human beings too appealing. The more I watch this, the more I wish the shark had eaten more of them, like Richard Dreyfuss and Murray Hamilton.

B0011NVC98|1.0|Admittedly, the only reason I finished the movie was because I paid to see it and it was more than half over (have to see the end then right? It would be like suffering in vain). I've never read Beowulf although did glance over it quickly before seeing the film, to get the gist of it.     I simply could not get over the poor character modeling and animation. This looks like a film that was made 8 years ago not in 2007. The story was lame and I think most disappointing of all is that nothing was ever truly resolved. Beowulf was a self conceded jerk-wade of a character who I thought was to have the strength of 10? men. Rather than ripping the beast's arms off in the first big battle scene as I thought I read about Beowulf, he just slammed the beast's arms by closing the door until they came off. It was just irritating to watch this film.
B001F0TM5I|5.0|This is a visually stunning adventure worthy to be in anyone's Blu-Ray collection!  I am particularly satisfied that this is an extended version of the film, which includes the steamy lap-dance that was cut short from the movie theaters.  The action progresses with the movie, and the sound of the roaring engines really put you in the drivers seat.  If you have a sound system with your home theater setup, you will enjoy this!
B000YABYLA|5.0|The title of my post says it all. The movie was rather predictable and bland movie in my taste. But I wanted to offer its thanks for being a movie that plays an important role in our modern day in age. What was amazing about the movie is that Juno decides to have her baby rather than having an abortion which may seem like the logical choice considering her age. Despite the debate that rages on about the issue, nonetheless, Juno decided to instead offer her child for adoption.     Regardless of anyone's viewpoint, some couples simply cannot have children on their own and many would even welcome an adopted child. In fact, I knew several that ache to adopt a child (but unfortunately it can be rather expensive). Although the couple Juno allows to adopt her baby dissolves, the wife is still left with what she had been wanting the entire movie: her child and to be a mother. I do believe this movie reveals that young mothers do not have only one choice concerning unplanned parenthood but another, which might turn another couple into a happy family. If that way of thinking does not put a different spin on things and encourage your heart, I'm not sure what would.
B001ILHY1I|4.0|I really didn't expect much out of Paul W.S. Anderson's remake of Death Race.  To be quite honest, I thought it would be an ungodly awful film that should have never seen the light of day in the first place.  Well, I was wrong and pleasently surprised that despite its absent-mindedness in terms of such things as character development or logic, Death Race manages to provide the goods in terms of action, spectacle, and excitement.  Jason Statham stars as a framed prisoner forced to participate in the title act; which is watched by millions worldwide.  There really isn't much more to the story other than that, and Statham's mission avenge the death of his wife and escape, but Anderson manages to pack in so much vehicular carnage and chaos that you can't help but take your eyes off the screen.  Statham's brand of machismo is on full display here, and it's as magnetic as ever: there's just something about the guy that you can't help but admire, making him more than worthy of being considered a top-flight action star.  Tyrese Gibson stars as Statham's rival Machine Gun Joe, and there's some other great cast members including Joan Allen as the evil warden, Brotherhood's Jason Clarke as the equally wicked head guard, and the great Ian McShane as Statham's mechanic.  All in all, Death Race is good, mindless fun that manages to be enjoyable, and in that regard alone, it's definitely worth seeing.
B0013FSL3E|4.0|Let's be upfront and frank. You will not be disappointed in watching this film. It's one of the best animated movies in years. The graphical design and animation are superb. That is one of the great benefits of animated movies over any other genre of movies: great story lines, cinematography, rich full colors and textures, etc can all be adjusted exactly how the animators desire. Nothing is really impossible for animation films(except limited to budgets) and this film in many ways is brilliant.    However the movie, while surpassing most recent animated movies in brilliance except Kung Fu Panda, is somewhat forgettable. The storyline is a bit flat and character development of the main characters of Wall-E and Eve were disappointing. That really is/is not the fault of the Pixar since the characters are rather mute during the film. Despite great non-verbal communication, I found it difficult to attach myself to the characters. After getting through about half the movie, Wall-E got to be rather predictable although still enjoyable. I do believe 20 minutes of the movie could have been cut out as the movie began to drag a bit by the end.     The final question I always ask myself in assessing a movie is whether it has high re-watch value. This had the overall impression of med-low re-watch value yet I would rate the film overall at A-    (Also, don't forget to check out Burn-E in the extras AFTER watching the film. Perhaps my favorite part of the film and hands down the best thing I've seen in the past 5 - 10 years. Extremely creative.)

078322947X|5.0|When it comes to making remakes of classic films, it's almost a guarantee that the newer picture won't live up to expectations.  One of the few that does is Sorcerer, a 1977 remake of The Wages of Fear.  The movie begins with introductions of four characters, all of them running for their lives as something goes wrong, one is a terrorist, another a banker, one a getaway driver, and the fourth a hitman on the run.  On the run from their pasts, these four men find themselves in a desolate, rundown Nicaraguan village.  When it seems all hope is lost, a solution presents itself, a very dangerous one.  A local oil company needs nitroglycerin transported to one of their wells.  Driving two trucks, the foursome heads out through the jungle where the slighest disrpution might set off the nitro.  The movie creates a sense of doom and dread like few others.  With every bump, your stomach drops.  The last hour is nerve-wracking all the way until the twist ending that caught me off-guard completely, and hopefully will surprise you too. It's a very real movie, almost like a documentary, putting you in the driver's seat with the characters.      Leading the four main characters, Roy Scheider plays Jackie Scanlon, a getaway driver of a robbery gone horrifically wrong.  Scanlon is on the run, a mafioso on his tail looking for revenge. Scheider is very strong here in an incredibly physical part.  Bruno Cremer is Victor Manzon, a French banker who discovers $15 million francs are missing from his bank, completely unaccounted for.  Manzon may be the most sympathetic character, a man who just wants to see his wife again.  Franciso Rabal is the most mysterious as Nilo, a hitman hiding out in the village, but we never find out why.  Amidou stars as Kassem, the lone survivor of a terrorist bombing, the rest of his men being arrested or killed.  These characters all have their faults, but the actors do such a good job you find yourself rooting for them.  Ramon Bieri has a good supporting role as Corlette, the man who sends these men on a suicide mission.     The DVD is a dissappointment unfortunately, but it's not expensive so that's good.  The movie's shown in a grainy fullscreen presentation that does make the movie look grittier, more realistic if nothing else.  Special features include a trailer and cast and crew info.  Maybe there's a special edition somewhere down the road, but for now this might have to do.  It's a fantastic movie that will keep you pinned to your seat until the final shot, check out Sorcerer!
0321544080|1.0|I have to agree with so many of the reviews here....this is a very disappointing book. Some very interesting pictures...but very little usable instruction. McNally seems to have endless equipment, budget, and contacts. How many average photographers can rent a helicopter to dangle a model above the Hollywood sign? Or have access to James Brown? Unless you are at that level, there is not much here for you but some semi-entertaining stories. This is definitely NOT a Scott Kelby type book. I'm disappointed in him too for recommending something so highly that has little or no practical application.
B000002TLX|5.0|I'm a pretty big fan of Richard Marx & own almost every album he has ever produced. But it wasn't always that way.  When he first came on the music scene way back in 1987, I thought he was pretty talented & I liked a couple of his songs but for whatever reason, I didn't really get into him. It might've been because I bought into the myth that he was just another wannabe hard rocker or maybe becuz he mostly had ballads on the radio or maybe even becuz it wasn't considered \\"cool\\" to say you were a fan of his. But when the songs  \\"Hazard\\" & \\"Keep Coming Back\\" were released as singles in 1991, I decided to buy his then current album (Rush Street) & the rest as they say, was history. I soon discovered that Marx was not only a great singer but also a great songwriter as well & he had many terrific songs that were right up there with the radio hits. I eventually went back & bought his 1st & 2nd albums & liked them even better than the 3rd one. I could have kicked myself for not buying these albums sooner cuz I had really missed out on some hidden gems.  Luckily I finally came around & am now one of his biggest fans. :)<br /><br />As for this album, it is strictly a collection of Marx's biggest radio hits & they are some of the best songs of the 80's & 90's bar none.  They're all great but my favorites here are the awesome rockers: \\"Don't Mean Nothing\\", \\"Satisfied\\" & \\"The Way She Loves Me\\". The tender ballads: \\"Endless Summer Nights\\" & \\"Angelia\\". The dark & mysterious: \\"Hazard\\" & the sexy jazz influenced: \\"Keep Coming Back\\" with the late/great Luther Vandross doing stellar b/g vocals.  Also, the inclusion of \\"Touch Of Heaven\\" from the underrated 1997 album: \\"Flesh & Bone\\" was a very nice surprise because it was never released as a single. It has a terrific R&B groove to it, passionate vocals by Marx & is a terrific song that should've been a major hit for him but wasn't.<br /><br />So to sum it all up, you can't go wrong with this collection & it contains almost all of Richard's hit songs. Even so, I highly recommend that anyone who really likes these songs, checkout the actual albums that these hits came from.  You'll probably be amazed (as I was) at the number of hidden gems & hit worthy songs of his that never made it onto the radio.<br /><br />P.S. One last thing. If you guys wanna hear some more great songs that never made it onto any of his official albums, make sure and checkout a site called: Forgottenmelodies dot com. They have lots of rare albums by popular artists & several un-official Richard Marx albums as well. I have one cd that has an amazing acoustic version of \\"The way she loves me\\" as well as several B-sides, un-released demos & live cuts from several different shows that Marx did back in the 80's & 90's. Sounds great too!ard's hit songs. Even so, I highly recommend that anyone who really likes these songs, checkout the actual albums that these hits came from.

B001DHXT6G|5.0|Sometimes being a fan of the original Star Trek series is hard. You love the show, but it sometimes can cost you an arm and a leg to purchase the DVD versions. There are presently two boxed sets...the discontinued three-box set, and this present remastered three-boxed set. (Update: add the Blu-ray version to this list. Review was written prior to this edition coming out...)<br /><br />I had a hard time of deciding which version to go with. The out of print version can still be purchased for around $160-$180 used, but contains no new effects or significant clean up. The remastered version, on the other hand, has each and every frame of the series retouched and remastered.<br /><br />I finally decided on the remastered three boxed set and I am totally glad that I did. I've only seen STOS on reruns on television. The remastered DVD set has done a remarkable job in refinishing the overall look of the show by adding more contrast, color, and redone special effects which make revisiting Star Trek a novel and virtually brand new experience even for a long-time fan such as myself.<br /><br />The packaging is pretty spartan with each season's DVDs encapsulated in a multi-DVD plastic case holder. This dvd carrier is then enclosed in a plastic outer case. The DVDs, unfortunately, do not display any of the cool artwork of the previous iteration of DVDs But if content outweighs your aesthetic needs, you'll do just fine.<br /><br />The special effects team did a terrific job of doing just enough to make the Star Trek experience true to the original concepts while tweaking here and there to spruce up the look of ST.<br /><br />I was blown away by the way each episode was remastered. The crispness and look of these new prints actually drew me deeper into these episodes although I have viewed them many times on television reruns. Watching them on a flatscreen HDTV brings new life into the show.<br /><br />Although the remastered collection, is for all practical purposes, done in standard DVD format, (with the exception of the dual disc HD DVD first season), the detail and colors of the show are remarkable. The special features, some of which were presented in the discontinued boxed set, were fantastic. I have never seen these, so those of you who have maybe somewhat disappointed. In any event, there are several new features that all trekies can enjoy.<br /><br />The biggest downside to this set is the price. In my opinion, it is way too expensive for what it offers. Even for a die-hard fan of the original series, the pill was just too expensive to swallow. I was fortunate enough to purchase this set new at a very deep discount, but the present $200-$220 price mark for this set is extraordinarily overpriced, in my opinion.<br /><br />For those of you who want to see Star Trek in all its remastered glory, waiting a bit more until the set is more reasonably priced will offer a better value. For all others who cannot wait, it may be worth it if you buy it at a discounted rate or through the use of coupons.<br /><br />And for those of you who cannot wait at all, this set still offers exceptional entertainment value. If you already purchased the previous three-boxed discontinued version, it may be a bitter pill to swallow by again buying this series.ual disc HD DVD first season), the detail and colors of the show are remarkable.

6305327041|5.0|One of the most memorable endings, and some of the funniest scenes in cinema. Everyone can appreciate something from this film. Sex, violence, kidnapping, dismemberment, foul language, witchcraft, drugs and alcohol, and Tim Roth playing the quirky bellhop in the center of all the mayhem. Truly a classic.
B00129H7VS|5.0|Stunning in HD, and uses the technology well.     The new features for BD are great --- the time line is cool, but the extra interview footage from the real paratroopers is outstanding.     As the action happens to the characters on-screen, the actual person will pop up to talk about it in interview footage not aired with the original series or on DVD. It includes some individuals that weren't shown previously at all, like a brief clip with Col. Robert Strayer.    I watched the series to see it on BD, then I watched the whole series again with the in-program interviews. I wasn't bored for a second. I only wish there was more.    I only have two gripes:    1. There is a glitch in Episode 8 @ 48:35. I have found it on multiple copies of the BD. I have not found evidence that it is due to a layer break. This did not come from the digital film transfer for HD DVD (released in Japan), which is seemingly being used again for BD, pointing to manufacturing issues in the BD edition. The producers opted to use the VC-1 video codec over H.264/AVC, which was arguably the right choice (at least at the time) to preserve film grain.    2. The BD takes unusually long to load --- 2 full minutes, even on a well-equipped PC --- and you are forced to watch several title screens.
B000TU16GS|5.0|this is a great book for all ages. this is especially great for reluctant young adult readers like i use to be. it is james bond for 10 to 15 year olds.
031606792X|5.0|I so enjoyed this series and loved the ending.  I can only hope that Stephenie's career will be as long and successful as Nora Roberts!  Thanks for a great series.
0316017922|5.0|Gladwell does his normal excellent job of throwing out thought-provoking statements and then backing them up with data. His arguments are compelling and provide yet another way to look at things. While some people find a few of his topics off-putting or controverisal I think he comes at them with an honesty and openness that is refreshing. I can highly recommend all of his books, including this one.
B001OBT3FC|5.0|If you like superb video and audio and appreciate classical music genius, this is the ultimate disc for you.  If you own 1080p video and at least moderately good multichannel audio equipment, you are in for a treat.  The  performance is flawless and the vediophile and audiophile experience is without peer.  Even the camerawork and the shots of the hall are breathtaking.  This disc sets the bar at a new high level for those of us who are looking not only for the best performances from the best of the best but stunning video and audio technology This disc is a must have. My only regret is that it makes the rest of my library a little disappointing.  Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!
B000R7I3LY|5.0|As a professor of music (I teach the History and Social Analysis of Rock Music) I try to stay on top of current events and trends in pop music.  I have owned this CD for months and I never get tired of it.  I feel Sara is one of  the brightest new young talents on the scene today.  This CD has catchy piano grooves reminiscent of Elton John and Billy Joel.  Her voice is soulful and distinctive - truly unique.  At times you can hear the bluesy sound of Bonnie Rait, the grace of Fiona Apple and Norah Jones.  BUT the stunning element is the power of her voice... it's BIG.  In the music \\"biz\\" it's referred to as the \\"money note\\".  When Sara sings a money note - you can buy stock!  What's even better is that she doesn't do it all the time, making it all that more effective when she does.  Just listen to \\"Come Round Soon\\" and \\"Gravity\\" and you'll see what I mean.  Her voice can reflect her mood from shy and vulnerable to assured and demanding.    Finally - the lyrics.  They are excellent.  Sara is the new Joni Mitchell:    Thought provoking - \\"There's a harvest each Saturday night at the bars filled with perfume and hitching a ride.  A place you can stand for one night and get gone\\"    Transparent and Soul Bearing - \\"You hold me without touch. You keep me without chains.  I never wanted anything so much than to drown in your love and not feel your rain.\\"    Clever word play - \\"Leave unsaid unspoken / Eyes wide shut unopened\\" or \\"Savor the sorrow to soften the pain sip on the southern rain\\"    Strong willed - \\"The angels said I'd smile today / Well who needs angels anyway?\\"    \\"Little Voice\\" is a little gem.  I look forward to Sara's next project.
B0000089GM|5.0|I love the cd. It is in excellent condition and plays perfectly. My friends also think its awesome. I listen to it at school and nobody had heard anything but \\"Du Hast\\", so the sounds were abit of an eye opener for them. Thank you for this its an excellent product.
B001GM28HO|5.0|I will make this very brief.  This album is just fantastic.    A friend let me hear some of it and, being a person who enjoys electronica and dance music, I enjoyed \\"Poker Face\\" and \\"The Fame\\".  I went ahead and bought this album because the price was reasonable, but knowing what I do now, I would have paid more for it.  Every song adds to the quality of this album, especially the last track that sounds sort of like the music you would have heard ten years ago from No Doubt.  If you like dance music, espcially dance music that you can pop and lock to, then you should definately add this to your collection.
B001N18HMS|4.0|The Empyrean is John Frusciante's long awaited new studio album and it doesn't let you down: we find here the fragile songwriting we loved on \\"Curtains\\", the experiments of albums like \\"The Will to Death\\" and the smooth songs that graced \\"Shadows Collide with People\\"; the cover from Tim Buckley (\\"Song to the Siren\\") is one of the highlights.<br /><br />A word about the package: the two vinyl records are housed in tight paper sleeves that look just like two sheets glued together, extracting them can result in a damage with scuffs or even scratches.<br />The A-side of the first record is pressed in an \\"eccentric\\" way, causing a great amount of tonearm horizontal movement, I don't know if that's only a problem with my copy... you can actually hear some pitch bends as a result, and it's a pity.
B000002KAT|5.0|This is my all-time favorite album. I've made love by it thousands of times. It is the first true \\"rock opera\\" in that all the songs seem to meld into each other creating an evolving theme of love and loss. The writing, the music and the vocals are Van Morrison at the zenith of his art and power. Although MOONDANCE was a worthy and powerful successor to this record, it does not possess the romantic pathos of ASTRAL WEEKS and, to date, Morrison has never reached this level of artistry again. He's come close with VEEDON FLEECE, and his last Warner Bros recordings, the 3 volumes: COMMON ONE, BEAUTIFUL VISION, & INARTICULATE SPEECH OF THE HEART are some of the most beautiful popular music produced by anyone. But they don't reach the simple beauty of the music or the poetic complexity of the lyrics on ASTRAL WEEKS. If Van Morrison never makes another record, ASTRAL WEEKS will continue to brush the heart strings of lovers young and old, alike as long as recorded music can be heard. It's a masterpiece.
006135323X|5.0|I think this is an excellent book because it is very easy to read.  But at the same time describes our behaivor based on several experiments.   This book will help you to consider every aspect or option before you take a decision.  Is a pretty interesting view of our mind, and how it works.
0312370849|2.0|I'd never heard of the V&eacute;l' d'Hiv', so when I read about this book, I was intrigued and ordered it.<br /><br />The book tells the story of Sarah, a young girl taken in the V&eacute;l' d'Hiv' roundups.  She was a protective older sister, and she hid her 4 year old brother in a secret hiding place with a story book and stuffed animal.  She promised she would be right there to let him out as soon as it was safe, and locked the door so no one could harm him.  Weeks later after losing her parents and suffering at Auschwitz, she escapes, and rushes back to her brother.  She had been imagining all the things he was thinking and wishing he could know she couldn't have returned sooner.  When she comes to her own door, there is another family, an Aryan family, there along with an awful smell coming from the secret hiding place.<br /><br />Sarah's story is paralleled in alternating chapters with the life of Julia, a modern journalist, whose story rather trivializes that of Sarah.  The stories do interlock eventually, but the book would have been much better if the author had only presented Sarah's story.  One thing that bothered me was that on the one hand, Julia was appalled at the careless disregard for human life in what she was reading about.  Then other hand, she seriously considers aborting her daughter, and that only because of what others were telling her.  A definite inconsistency.  Also, the author tries to bring in too many components of the modern world.  Julia deals with an unfaithful husband, gay friends, an uncaring boss, pregnancy, and divorce among other things while she studies and researches Sarah's story.<br /><br />This would truly be a book of poignancy if it were solely Sarah's story.  As it is, I was disappointed to find it little more than a shallow novel.

Ignore those who have given it fewer than 5 stars.  After having read their \\"reviews\\" and comments I feel nothing but pity for them.  They obviously do not understand the film.  Perhaps they should spend more time reading and less watching 'reality tv'???  Godsford Park is a gem - one should view it for the glorious sets alone.

And yes Winnie, it made us, you know, happy. Thanks. The best hour long drama series, like ever.
1592289444|3.0|This is a very interesting story, and although parts of the story may be based in fact, it is clear that large portions of the book are fabricated. It should be read as a work of fiction.
0316017922|5.0|This is a very engaging and entertaining book. In the case of the Korean pilots and Jewish lawyers, Gladwell has a way of making sense of all the cultural stereotyping and racial generalisation, putting them into their proper context, and somehow articulated to the reader that stereotyping can be beneficial if properly understood. I don't know how much to believe there is a link between thousand years of hard working Chinese farmers and their descendant maths ability and high IQ.     The 10,000 hours \\"rule\\" to become an expert at anything is comforting for those of us who aren't blessed with the smart of Bill Gates, Warren Buffett and the likes. I can't help but notice most of that are hardcore technical skills like singing, music, programming or writing. Does the 10,000 hrs rule applies equally well to business management ? Most would say the practice of becoming a great business leader take years to perfect. How then could one explain the cause of most business failures by senior management who have had tens of thousand of hours being managers. Rarely a company fails because of its technical problem.     Some have argued that the book is just a collection of the author's own anecdotes, flimsily research at best. Gladwell wasn't asserting himself as a scientist. Even the non-scientist audience would be hard-pressed to accept some of the grander theories (such as the link between rice paddy farmers and high IQ) without more vigorous supporting evidence. This however, does not detract the general theme of the book, which is to say a lot of the Outliers' success are a combination of luck, hard work, tenacity and the grace of others around them. It is a fun read.

B00003CWN3|5.0|I had no idea what this film was about when I borrowed it from the library, but I was sold by the message that it was \\"a true story about hope, fear and the courage it takes to be yourself.\\"  In this film, I have discovered a story that is powerful, moving and inspirational.    Hillary Swank played the role of Brandon Teena, a transgendered teenager struggling for acceptance, with such gusto that it is little surprise she won the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Lead Role.  Her portrayal of Brandon was believable and seemed to me to be on-target.  Swank is aided by a phenomenal cast whose performance bring to life the many complicated emotions in this story.    The story itself is important.  Transgendered individuals and the transgender experience are underrepresented in our cultural literacy.  Along with films, such as TransAmerica, Boys Don't Cry puts a human face on transgender issues and gender dysphoria.    This is a compelling story passionately told and should be seen at least once.
006135323X|3.0|This book was okay. Some of the information presented by the author was interesting but he overexplained many of the experiments he conducted.  Also, he kept repeating his ideas in a way that made me feel that he didn't think readers would be able to grasp the concepts in the book. This read wasn't as exciting as I had thought it would be.
1439102813|5.0|I urge everyone to read this book.  It is so moving and real.  I could not put it down, and while it was frightening to some degree as I am 57, it was also amazingly poignant.  I highly recommend this book and hope Ms. Genova is in the process of writing another.

1594201927|3.0|This book was one part discussion of the current financial crisis, one part anecdotes about certain figures in financial history, and three parts history of financial markets (stock market, bond market, insurance market, etc.).  A challenge for an author of financial books is the level to pitch it at.  What will interest the expert will be boring or useless to the novice, and vice versa.  By including the history and anecdotes, Ferguson partly overcomes this problem by including factoids that many economically sophisticated folks will not know and enough \\"fun stuff\\" to make the dismal science lessons bearable to the initiate.        On balance, though, the book left me not cold, but lukewarm.  I learned some new things, painlessly, but also felt that there was not much \\"there\\" there at the end of the day.  The book pales next to some of the great financial entertainments, such as Barbarians at the Gate or Liar's Poker.  Reading Michael Lewis' Panic (haven't yet) would probably be more fun, and there are other books that would be more educational.  You get a little of each with this one; OK, more than a little, but not exactly a lot either.
006091307X|3.0|This book is dated.    But that doesn't mean you can't enjoy it. It references songs, topics, and people who are not necessarily known today. If you are the age of the author or perhaps the age of his children (provided he had them young), then yes, you would be able to get the reference without the aid of Wikipedia and Google. However, I'm much younger (over 30 but under 40), so I had to keep my laptop close at hand while reading. This is not a problem for me. I learn this way, but if you are turned off by that, then perhaps you should give this book a pass.     There really isn't a strong plot here. What plot does exist can be described as a gerbil, spending his days running on a wheel, never really getting anywhere but expending a lot of energy.    In my opinion, this novel's saving grace was the humor. The more-than-memorable characters and their names give rise to a small and sometimes outlandish chuckle.    A sentence can be as long as a paragraph and a paragraph can span an entire page, but if you stick with it (I found reading slowly and sometimes aloud helped me to stay focused and not loose the subject of a page-long sentence) the worst thing that will happen is that you will have had one hell-of an experience.
B001GAOY5U|2.0|I bought this movie, as there was nothing said about it not being 3D.  They, at Amazon, sent me others to try fixing the problem but there were no 3D versions left.  The movie was an average movie but nothing to write home about.  The 3D version makes it a far better movie, as I picked it up at Walmart for much less.  Amazon has always made the return service very easy which is why I stay with them for most of my online purchases.
B000Z0OX9O|5.0|For years, I have loved the majestic soundscapes that are the genius of Vangelis. This set has finally brought the \\"Blade Runner\\" magic to full height. I don't mind at all that disc 1 is the same track listing of the 1994 release. It was just nice having every haunting note that made up the original score in one complete set. And the new material on disc 3 is a wonderful compliment to the feel that Vangelis was striving for on his original soundtrack.<br />Now if we could just talk him into releasing the entire score from \\"The Bounty\\", perhaps the planets will align.
B001GIQNJM|5.0|This book Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia is very easy to read. A New York woman tries to become pregnant during her marriage but decides this is not what she really desires. She decides to get divorced and travel the world in a healing process. She decides on three main places to recover. Rome, for pleasure, Mumbai for spiritual guidance, and Bali for \\"balance\\".  I'm sure lots of people need to find themselves in this unsure world. It's definitely an interesting book.

This movie is about the life and times of IP Man, famous for his style of Chinese martial art - Wing Chun, which specializes in close quarter combat, concentrating on centerline attack and defense; Donnie Yen is an excellent martial artist and it shows in this film!  I won't give away the movie, just go and buy this fantastic movie, it has been compared to Fearless, which I have seen, and it is a great movie also, but this one, IP Man is my favorite of all my martial arts movies!
B001N26GFM|5.0|I was blown away by this film.  I found it to be deeply moving, thought-provoking and even a little terrifying.<br /><br />The film begins with the family of the commander of a concentration camp during WWII.  The mood is idyllic and innocent - until Bruno, the 8-year old in the family, notices a farm through his window.  Of course, we know this is no farm.  As viewers, we are taken on a journey with Bruno as he tries to grasp not only what this farm is and who is in it, but also the role his father plays.<br /><br />Bored, with little to do, Bruno sneaks away from his home and comes across one of the barbed fences of the camp where he meets another 8-year old to play with - except that he is stuck on the other side of the fence.  As he becomes friends with this little boy, Bruno finds his own world become confusing.  Can his friend really be without human emotions?  How can he not be human?<br /><br />Another aspect I found fascinating was the portrayal of Bruno's family.  At first, his mother just reluctantly accepts who her closest neighbors are.  Yet, as the film continues, her own eyes are opened to what is occurring just a mile away yet she is absolutely helpless to do anything about it.<br /><br />At first, I actually thought that this could be a film that children could watch.  It is not.  While it is a fascinating movie, if you don't like sad films I would suggest avoiding this one.  It isn't graphic or explicit.  The violence is implied, urged on primarily by your own knowledge of the Holocaust.  However, this doesn't make the film any less frightening.  I utterly recommend this film, I found it to be well written, well acted and well filmed along with having an excellent soundtrack.  Watch!
B001KQ031Y|5.0|superb sound, superb picture, funny movie. Why you all hate on Stiller?  Stiller and Stallone have something in common. Everybody hates them and sais the cannot act or are not funny. I think Stallone and Stiller are great actors in their own special way. This movie is so good and funny that I was shocked the moment I saw the feedback. Have you watched the same movie as I in whom Ben Stiller got shot like in Platoon, Downey is a black dude and action and fun is all over the movie?  People please watch the movie and then decide for your self!

B001NFNFNU|5.0|There's not much to say about \\"Changeling\\" without blabbing away the  essential plot. I will say that writer J. Michael Straczinski was given some info about a horrible case involving the LA police during the late 1920's. Using this info, he crafted a riveting screenplay to expose a true situation that many aren't aware of. I agree with some previous reviewers who said that the last half-hour wasn't really necessary, creating red herrings that weren't fully resolved.  In the hands of director Clint Eastwood, with an amazing crew that recreated LA in the 1920's to the letter, this isn't that major a flaw. Ms. Jolie is confident and powerful, avoiding a lot of histrionic clich&eacute;s that might've been. It's a great performance. She is the absolute center of this film. There are terrific and complete supporting roles by John Malkovich as a crusading preacher, and Colm Feore as an arrogant police chief. The small but powerful appearance by Amy Ryan is amazing, giving Jolie's character the grit to survive. Jeffrey Donovan is excellent as one of the most unlikable characters I've ever seen, a police captain who seems to hold the reins. Also fine is Michael Kelly, as, perhaps, the only good cop in the film. Without giving anything away, watch for a magnificent performance by Jason Butler Harner as a delusional sicko. Yes, it probably didn't have to be so long, but watching the wonderful actors under Mr. Eastwood's guidance is worth it. It's a true story that somewhat went \\"under the radar\\", since the Great Depression was rife with corruption and crazy people. The DVD extras are minimal, but interesting. I was never bored for a minute.
B001G9LVGG|5.0|I am always figuratively entranced when I listen to a Loreena McKennitt song.  The depth and the soul, and the artistry, found within them.  With this cd, she completes one of her previous recordings, \\"A winter garden,\\" creating a beautiful new Christmas album.  One can almost feel an invocation of the winter spirits.  As usual, her singing is grand and her music is better.  This cd is quite worth it.

After listening to \\"You Belong to Me\\" (track 6) \\"Love Story\\" was so over for me! ahhh i freakin love \\"You Belong With Me\\"-- best song on the album and that song is pretty much why you should buy it!

B000QB36LS|5.0|I don't have much else to add to what the other reviewers have said, I just want to say that once you've read a book this compelling and complex it raises your standards for everything else you read.Give your self the gift of reading The Bell Jar.
0887307280|1.0|The author took way too long to get to his points and when he finally did I was left asking \\"That's it?\\".  I suspect this book is for someone who is really novice at running their own business.  But even then, it doesn't give enough practical advice for the novice to then implement some concrete ideas.  I truthfully don't see why this book received all the praise it was given.
0375842209|5.0|\\"The Book Thief\\" caught me in its literary and humanitarian spell. Death narrates and reveals himself not as the Grim Reaper but as an observer of human frailty. This novel, which takes place during the rise and reign of Hitler, brings readers inside a German village and into the hearts and minds of people subject to the cruel facts of life under a dictator. It is an in-depth overview of all the people, Germans and Jews alike, during Hitler's horrific rule. Liesel, the book thief, keeps herself, Max (a Jew her family is hiding), and people in the town hopeful and alive through books she steals and reads to them. For me, this unique use of the power of the written word is one of the more touching and original themes I have read in the many novels I read. I did not want to put this book down. It is a page turner that reaches deep into the heart and mind. I sent copies to friends and family, for it is one of those books that becomes a friend for life and changes one's outlook on death, life and human folly.[...]
B0002U0UKS|3.0|Kids like it; I thought it was too long & hard to follow.  One must be a lover of foreign animation to appreciate this one, I suppose.

B000A6T1HC|1.0|I've heard well over half the selections now from this CD.  Although Miss Bartoli's obviously has a very strong and expressive operatic voice, she has absolutely no idea how to sing early music.    Miss Bartoli's runs on the livelier selections are so percussive and hard that they literally hurt my ears as she sings her way through them.  These passages are meant to be sung lightly and expressively, with a polished beauty to the vocal tone.    Her lyrical interpretations and trills on the arias are equally over the top for the style the composers intended them to be sung, although CALDARA Si Piangete Pupille Dolenti was...tolerable.  The music should draw you to the words being sung; not to the performer or their \\"flash\\".    I truly hope that Miss Bartoli's efforts and talent take her in a different direction.  This recording should never be used as a standard for how Baroque or early music is meant to be performed or sung.  Consider Emma Kirkby or other Baroque soloists if you really want a proper introduction into this beautiful and heavenly music.
1603420398|4.0|I really want to give this book 4.5 stars.  It has beautiful pictures and the directions are very clear and well written.  It is a great book to flip through for inspiration.  I do agree with other reviews that it would have been nice to see some finished projects, but overall I highly recommend the book.  I think there are many things in here that I will make.
B000VXLC3K|5.0|Best car listening CD ever made; I wore out my tape, had to find new!
B001N26GFM|4.0|This film probably didn't do as well at the box office because most moviegoers go for fun, not to get depressed. It's films like this that are best experienced at home. And it's a film that is an excellent jumping-off point for discussion with young (10 and above, though the two boys whom the film revolves around are only 9) children about the holocaust - which, all too often, seems to be losing its place in history.<br /><br />I won't go into the detail of the plot as that is covered elsewhere on the Amazon site - and in other reviews. It is also important NOT to know how THIS story ends. (We all know how the holocaust ended.) It gives the film its impact.<br /><br />In the standard \\"Making of\\" documentary (20 minutes) in the Special Features, we learn from both the Writer/Director, and the author of the book on which the film is based, that they want the film to be watched by families together and used as a discussion tool. The film is rated PG-13 \\"for Thematic Material involving the Holocaust\\". There is violence in the images of injured people (and the makeup is very graphic) but much is implied. We learn what is going on in the \\"work camp\\" by seeing fleeting images or hearing sounds.<br /><br />At 94 minutes, the film is brief enough so that children will not get bored. It is NOT a film that, in my opinion, should be watched by children under 16 without a parent or other adult to answer questions they might have, or better yet, ask questions of the children to see that they understand.<br /><br />Miramax made the production in partnership with BBC Films and nearly all the cast are British. (We learn in the documentary that that the woman playing the mother seems to be the sole American among the lead actors.) I did have a small problem at the beginning getting used to the British accents of all these characters who are supposed to be in Germany. (I guess I'm used to actors having German accents in films about the Holocaust.) But, after a while, I accepted it and moved on.<br /><br />I have not listened to the director's commentary. And the deleted scenes included in the bonus features don't add much, but it's good they are included.<br /><br />This is not a perfect film but well worth using as a teaching tool. The more that the younger generation knows about the Holocaust the better the chance that it will never be repeated.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"ned to the director's commentary.

B000002UB3|5.0|There are so many good things to say about this album. And many sad things, too. It's the last great album by the one and only great Beatles. But the good news is that every song here is good to fantastic with a few timeless classics thrown in to boot. George really shines on this record. Here Comes the Sun being every thing a music fan could want to hear--it's inventive, beautiful and uplifting. John is incredibly inventive here also in both lyrics and melody--again pushing the envelope but also writing one of the great vocal moments in their career with \\"Because.\\" Ringo gives the kid in everyone a chance to celebrate just being a kid with his Octopuses Garden song. And Paul wraps it all up neatly with the single most relevant couplet in musical history:And in the end the love you take is equal to the love you make. The Beatles come full circle and give it all they've got on this one. The dueling guitars at the end of the record along with Ringo's one and only solo work perfectly. John's nonsense language skills adds whimsy and reminds us of the journey still in progress. This is high art performed by four incredible musicians. tHEY GREW TOO BIG FOR THE BOX BUT LEFT THAT BOX FULL OF UNTOLD TREASURES FOR ALL TO SEE AND HEAR. This was it--the end--but to their credit they wrote it all the way they themselves would have wanted it to be.Something remains one of the greatest love songs ever written by anybody anywhere.Stunning achievement and everlastingly relevant to the cause of humanity everywhere on the planet.

B001GSV3EC|5.0|Having been a huge fan for many years, I'm still blown away by the touch, technique, taste, and passion Jeff Beck still brings with every performance. He has said that every show is different and this one is stunning. Covering songs from throughout his career, he infuses all these snippets from his many styles, from Blues to Rock, Jazz, Reggae, and symphonic anthems that no one can emulate. Moving from one tune to the next quickly with no fat or excess,he and his excellent band leave you slack-jawed and wanting more. If there is a more inspiring guitarist out there, I haven't heard him or her. Beck makes you feel like you did when you first heard lead guitar. Encore!
B001BTG3OQ|5.0|Shortly after I received this flash I had an opportunity to use it at a Chinese New Year celebration where there were lots of dancing and acts on a stage.    I was very impressed with the ability of this light to Zoom and reach the far edges of teh stage and reclcle quickly.  I never had any issues with the light over heating as I have read about in other reviews.  I had many quick full powered flash discharges at this event.    It is a flexible light and works well in a variety of settings.    I am very pleased with this speedlight!
B000002U8G|5.0|Of course you could go and get Dark Side of The Moon, but hang on a minute...    Pink Floyd's Meddle came out in 1971, but like all great stuff, it still sounds good today.  From the haunting opening One of These Days, on through the various mellow acoustic pieces that follow, this is an album which presents grand artistic range, and one disc not to be missed.  The recording quality is good and it helps showcase the multi-talented gents making up the ubiquitous and never to be pigeon-holed Pink Floyd.  If you'd like to hear one of the best spacey songs of all time, again that being One of These Days, grab a copy of Meddle.

B001KL3GWM|5.0|The Allman Brothers DNA is evidenced in this solid and highly listenable CD from Derek Trucks.  'Down in the Flood', the opening song, is an excellent example of terrific blues rock: smart, crisp, and filled with guitar hooks that last beyond the time you listen.  The next song, 'Something to Make You Happy' does exactly that.  The remainder of the CD does not disappoint.  Duane Allman would be proud.

B0017ANAZO|3.0|George Cukor made this film in 1939 with an all female cast and it was much livelier. But first a little story:<br /><br />Every year at the Castro theater (the oldest theater in California) in San Francisco's gay Castro district, the owner shows this film to a sold out crowd. You can barely understand the dialogue as every person in the audience repeats every single damn line in the movie after having watched it SO many times. Once you get into the party atmosphere, its pretty amazing. The lines are quick, sharp and bitchy and the audience never stops talking or laughing throughout. If you can catch this experience you'll save yourself from this remake.<br /><br />Meg Ryan (too pretty), Annette Bening (not believable), Jada Pinkett Smith (just mean), Eva Mendes (just mean), Debra Messing (Debra Messing redux), Cloris Leachman (great performance), Bette Midler (same Bette), Carrie Fisher (very brief), Joanna Gleason (okay), and Candice Bergen (well cast) sound like a cast that could only win in any film, but this remake is a dud. Sure, there are a few good lines here and there, but it's bitchy without being funny. It borders more on the mean-spirited side, rather than on the clever and outrageous.<br /><br />If you don't know what \\"a spritzer\\" at the perfume counter is, you'll know within 15 minutes.
0142000671|5.0|Of Mice and Men opens with a perfectly 19th-century-like description of a creek. We almost expect a respectable bourgeois couple to emerge from the trees discussing a ball or an engagement. Instead we get Lennie and George:<br /><br />  \\"So you forgot that awready, did you? I gotta tell you again, do I? Jesus Christ, you're a crazy bastard!\\"<br />  \\"I forgot,\\" Lennie said softly. \\"I tried not to forget. Honest to God I did, George.\\"<br />  \\"O.K. - O.K. I'll tell ya again. I ain't got nothing to do. Might jus' as well spen' all my time tellin' you things and then you forget 'em, and I tell you again.\\"<br />  \\"Tried and tried,\\" said Lennie, \\"but it didn't do no good. I remember about the rabbits, George.\\"<br /><br />It's hard to appreciate, I think, just how steeped we are in these archetypes now. They are instantly recognizable to the contemporary reader. George and Lennie are popular culture.<br /><br />Of Mice and Men is a long way from Dickens' fixation with the workaday dilemmas of the faintly well-to-do, which is in itself a far cry from the country gentry of Austen and Bronte. Some of Hardy's better novels dwell on the workers, but never quite believably. Though his father was a stonemason, his fingers aren't dirty enough. And it has always seemed to me that Faulkner's portraits of working folk bear the imprint of a soft-handed gentleman, the brilliant observer with fingernails stained by ink, not dirt. Doubtless I am missing others.<br /><br />So along rolls the Great Depression. Steinbeck is right there to chronicle it. (Avoid the dreary In Dubious Battle, which reads like a museum-piece.) Steinbeck's fingers might not have been callused - evidently he, too, was more observer than doer - but he wrote as if they were. Lennie and George have come to stand in for a whole generation, while the depiction of the black stable buck Crooks is especially poignant today, mere hours after America's first black president has delivered his first State of the Union address.<br /><br />Steinbeck is no master stylist. He uses too many apostrophes in the hunt for accuracy of dialect and his descriptions are sometimes flat and leaden. But if you read with your spine as Nabokov suggested, Of Mice and Men is an unbridled pleasure. It recalls the joys of childhood reading, the kind that highfalutin literature and pedantic high school English teachers often kill. Of Mice and Men is finely-rendered tragedy coated in a working man's dust and sweat.<br /><br />  George said, \\"Guys like us got no fambly. They make a little stake an' then they blow it in. They ain't got nobody in the worl' that gives a hoot in hell about 'em - \\"<br />  \\"But not us,\\" Lennie cried happily. \\"Tell about us now.\\"<br />  George was quiet for a moment. \\"But not us,\\" he said.<br />  \\"Because - \\"<br />  \\"Because I got you an'--\\"<br />  \\"An' I got you. We got each other, that's what, that gives a hoot in hell about us.\\" Lennie cried in triumph.He uses too many apostrophes in the hunt for accuracy of dialect and his descriptions are sometimes flat and leaden.

061891868X|4.0|Smolin's book is extremely well written, and is an apologetic, yet punishing critique of String Theory and theoretical physics in general.  We are left with the impression that String Theory is nothing more than metaphysics parading as science [which is what most educated people have always believed about it anyway].    Unfortunately, Smolin is unwilling to give up [or even critique] the ideas of Feyerabend and other post-modern science philosophers, which have helped to justify String Theory and similarly exotic departures from traditional science.  He seems determined to march down a merry road that is essentially \\"String Theory: Part Deux\\".  It would have been nice to see some humility learned from the incredible shenanigans that have characterised the history of String Theory, but Smolin concludes with the assertion that genius \\"seers\\" are what is needed, and guess who can spot them?  Him.  In fact, most of them are close personal friends of his.    Uh... No.  Try again, please.    But a great book, anyway!
0790729601|3.0|This is an action film, with a smart tough guy and a woman he needs to protect.  I saw it, and now I can't remember a thing about the plot, though some of the details I do, like when Arnie used a refrigerator door for protection but still got his hand skewered.<br /><br />This film is fine to pass the time, but there is no reason to buy it or savor it.  Recommended tepidly.  While it is too bad that I no longer enjoy this kind of mindless action film, I guess there are better things to do with my time.  While watching, I continually felt myself thinking, OK, whatever, some guy thought this up, I paid for it, what am I getting?  Not anything new, that's for sure.  And I didn't forget myself and get enveloped in the story.
B0014YVCDK|4.0|This isn't Pearl Jam's best, but I still love this record. They have produced perhaps their best mix of power and atmosphere since Vitalogy, and this work really accentuates what the band is so good at: taking a simple dynamic (picture the riff of Tremor Christ, or the accented beat of gods' dice, found here) and weaving a subtle and complex platform around it. It's like riding a wave, taking that visible part of the song and letting it take you somewhere, while the rest of the band is the force below, just driving the wave along.    Not every song here is fantasic... I found Evacuation somewhat forgettable, but there are plenty of gems(gods' dice, of the girl, rival, grievance and more.) Beautiful rock music, nothing more or less. This album, and Pearl Jam in general, is the sound of driving down the highway with the stereo cranked. It's the soundtrack to personal freedom.
B00006G8G1|5.0|This is one of the best DVDs that I have bought. I couldn't imagine Iron Maiden performing for that huge crowd. It's simply amazing. This was a gift for my father's birthday, and we enjoyed it. I wonder what else Iron Maiden would release.
B001ECE6C6|1.0|I've been a fan of Pat Metheny for over 25 years and this is the worst album he ever played in. I cannot belive he is actually involved in this project. The arrangements are awful, very smooth jazz, very cheesy, with those fake drums...aargh!!! I am not sure what the deal is and why he did this album the way he did it. She has a good voice, but that's it. It could have been done the Pat Metheny way and it may had been a good experiment, but this, sounds like it was arranged by Kenny G.  I LOVE Pat Metheny, but from someone like him I espect always the best and this is no even close to it.    If you want some good collaboration albums listen to \\"Persuance:the music of John Coltrane\\" with Kenny Garrett, \\"Concierto\\" with Jim Hall, \\"Quartet\\" or \\"Metheny Mehldau\\", \\"Wish\\" live with a young Joshua Redman.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|First I should say that I started liking Metallica at the Black album then \\"discovered\\" their origins and liked them even more going backward.  My other favorites are Master of Puppets and And Justice For All.  I am not an overly-dedicated fan - I like what I actually like, and I was bored by most of what came after Black and nauseated by Saint Anger.  Death Magnetic for me is about as cool as these three favorites, but clearly different.  The other thing that draws me to DM is the fact that so much music right now seems to be in a stale, boring rut and this is a healthy slap in the face of all that.      Now that I have read some complaints and explanations about compression, I suppose I 'd say I notice that too and it does detract from \\"what could have been\\".  I don't think it a glaring, horrible thing though.  I would have said, otherwise, that the main thing missing from this album is some of the softer, acoustic or semi-acoustic guitar interludes that used to provide for a creative tension with the heavier shred in songs like One and M of P.  Personally, one production improvement I like is that it seemed occasionally on older Metallica the drums were too loud, and this album is not like that.    Anyhow, the point of new music is not to nearly-remake an old song as a new song, which would be lame, or to over-use any formula.  This is new Metallica that seems to draw on old passions and style preferences while interpreting some modern influences well.  It takes \\"measured\\" risks into new territory with essentially none of those risks turning into the disaster that I think Saint Anger was.  The modest level of risk may have sacrificed some exciting reward that we didn't get, but overall the result is really good.  I also appreciate the return to guitar-leadership and the use of \\"non-4-4 time\\" and complex and dramatic rythm guitar riffing and the tight interplay of drum and guitar parts.    There are quite a few long-lived bands that I liked for only a portion of their careers and then found myself wishing they'd get out of a commercial rut and return to what once made them different.  Some bands have tried that, seemingly in desperation, and produced something lame that almost dilutes my appreciation of their older stuff.  And I like some new bands, so it's not about being stuck in the past.  It's just about how difficult it is to continue being interesting and innovative over decades.  Metallica is the only band I can think of lately that really pulled this off.  For folks who like the other Metallica that I like most, mostly heavy but not only the heaviest shred, untamed but still well thought out, innovative without being too obscure... you'll like DM.
B000JIHP88|5.0|My son loves this mobile.  It is very cute and has great music.  I noticed that some people complained about it being too quiet to hear, but it seems perfect to me.  If you are like me and notice that a lot of children's toys are really loud, then you'll think this mobile is perfect because for once, someone took into consideration how children hear.  I think sometimes parents don't realize that many adults don't hear as well as they did when they were younger.  In addition, the speaker is such that it directs the sound down towards the child.
B001CWOCV8|2.0|I just received this Blu-ray and loaded the disc for review.    1. This disc has some issues with the Main Menu. The Main menu can only be adjusted after the concert program actually starts.  2. It locked up my Blu-ray player during the first song. Lost all functionality. I had to unplug the player to kill the process.   3. The picture quality is DVD like, not Blu-Ray (lacked vividness and high definition)  4. The sound quality protrayed Lionel like he was singing in the background instead of upfront.   5. I gave it two stars because of the songs (have been a long time Richie/Commodores fan)  I am not sure what has caused all these issues - Region conversions? Bad transfers? Getting the product to market without proper reviews?    Hope someone from the Richie organization (including Lionel himself) sees these reviews and get these issues corrected. It should not be about making money but giving us a product that is worth the money. At this time this Blu-ray is not worth it, it falls in the category of being just OK.
0446401307|4.0|This is a shorter and faster read than one generally expects from Michael Connelly, but it still delivers.An execution style murder soon develops into a harrowing case of stolen radioactive substances.  Bosch as usual knocks heads with the LAPD brass, the FBI, and his new partner.Rachel Walling is back in Bosch's life to complicate matters.One conflict with an overly zealous FBI agent and a later conflict with a wrong-headed police captain seem a bit over-the-top even for Bosch, but they are still fun reading.   A more realistic conflict is between the older and experienced Bosch and his capable but youthful partner who still has much to learn if only he will realize it.  This has the wit, the action, and the suspense but not quite the depth of the previous books.  Still one to read and enjoy.

B001LMU182|5.0|This time it really hit me. The charm of this Anime classic is real and to be enjoyed many times. I know because I bought, re-bought, watched and re-watched and after thinking, \\"Naaaa.\\" I bought and re-watched it again (as a BD)  and I followed the story as I marveled at the great backgrounds and effects. I'm an animator and it's hard to get past the beauty of this film; but the story really is great. And has this been imitated! The Blue-ray picture is great. I hope you get along with your neighbors because the sound is like a Big mad dog.<br />I just watched Akira BD and I immediately put it back on for an antipasto. This is a happy purchase and if you act (during the first pressings) you get a styling sleeve and you get a really good [ looking and informative ] booklet. Really!
B001TH16DS|3.0|Well, I guess if you are a loyal Star Trek fan the studios feel as if they can just screw you over.  Yes, I bought a HD DVD player ONLY for the first season of Star Trek which was released ONLY in HD format.  Well, guess what?  I'm stuck with the Betamax of DVDs.  Hey Paramount!! How about giving the loyal fans who bought the HD versions a price break!!  Oh, never-mind, that would be good business.

B000R7HY0K|4.0|Underrated role for Kurt. The ladies were great and the campy old school feel of watching a grindhouse film was fun. I did like the Robert Rodriguez version a bit better but this was definitely worth the watch.
0374531269|5.0|I do feel on occasion that the distance that seperates us in North America from the strife in the world can have a de-humanizing effect on our view of conflict and struggle.  I purchased this book for that very purpose and can honestly say that it did a great job of humanizing this, and other current issues, for me.      The writing is well structured, language is simple, but not simplistic.  All in all, an enjoyable and thought-provoking read.

0374531269|5.0|Memoirs of a Boy Soldier is a fantastic book that reveals the true horrors of the civil war in Sierra Leone. Beah gives a horrific, but amazing tale of his life as a young soldier. He lived a normal life at first, but the rebels soon captured his village. He was gone that day, however, and escaped. He started traveling from village to village, until he was drafted into the army. He then started ruthless killings, murdering the people he believed responsible for his parent's death. After awhile, he got picked up by UNICEF, who took him to the capital of Sierra Leone, which was still primarily safe at the time. He eventually gets moved to the United States through the U.N.   This is a fanatistic book that gives you a completely different perspective on your life. I recommend this book to everyone, of all ages, because it is a truly inspirational tale of one boy's hardships in a brutal civil war.

B000NA28I4|3.0|Well it didn't totally sucks but after reading the book yesterday and having really fresh in my mind and then they pulled a Harry Potter Movie 3 deal where they made up stuff that wasn't in the book and then jumped around at a pace of a million mph...  Should have been longer for one I mean really if you are going to make a excellent movie these days don't take a book with 509 pages and jam it into an hour and a half.      Ticked me off when Arya was awake and helping them when she was found.. Hello she was unconscious for what a week?      Sephira they actually did a good job with her.      But his cousin running away bah he went to work at a mill to win a wife gees why change that????    I mean if you have a good story why change it?  Well I guess we know how it went cause we have no sequel do we cause they know nobody who has read the books will bother to go after this crap.    The whole battle scene at the end is wrong .... come on did the screen play writers even bother to read the book or did they get the cliff notes version and make garbage up?  I only paid 5 bucks for my movie and feel ripped off.      NO WONDER ALL THE RENTALS WERE STILL FOR SALE AT HASTINGS NOBODY WANTS THEM!!!!!
B000002B30|5.0|I have been a Springsteen fan since the Filmore days and that is a long time ago. So when we took a trip to see the \\"old folks\\" I bought this to have a little driving music. With four adults in the car and one of them likes only angry rock and rap you have to be careful about what your putting in other peoples ears. I put this in and I had a twenty year old know-it-all asking me to play it again. When we got home I couldn't find it and then I spotted it on the seat of his van. Look it may not have your favorite Springsteen song on it but it does have the best and what more can you ask for.  Dangerous Dan

B000WQWPKA|4.0|This is an awesome movie! I just purchased a new Blu-Ray player (Samsung) and a 73-inch Mitsubishi projection TV. I'm in HOG heaven! This was the first Blu-Ray movie I tried out on the player.<br /><br />As far as the sound goes, I was blown away (7.1 surround system). For the video, well, it was great in most places, but some scenes were noticeably grainy, especially in the shadows. Other scenes, everything was perfect.<br /><br />Other than that, a great disc!
0930289234|2.0|I've never been a comic book reader and just because they have changed the name to graphic novel doesn't impress me much either.  But a friend brought in Watchmen and asked me to read it and give my opinion.  I finished the \\"book\\" this morning and from first to last I thought it was dreary.  The only characters I really liked were the two Nite Owl men and Rorchach.  Not one other character showed the least bit of humanity or even a pleasant personality.  The story was just depressing and it took all my will to finish the darned thing. The only part I actually enjoyed were the in-between chapters. That is why this review has two stars and not just one.  Those I really enjoyed especially Hollis Mason's Under the Hood excerpts. They were excellent and didn't need illustrations to tell a good story.  I'm not quite sure why Time Magazine declared Watchmen one of the \\"100 Best Novels since 1923\\" It isn't.
0553288105|2.0|The book is not bad, it is exactly what is expected of Asimov. It has a great general plot - it is creative and catches the reader in the first few pages. As any of Asimov's stories, it has a lot of science involved, he gives an interesting explanation on many of the concepts he uses, that can be fairly understood by anyone, it's obvious he knew what he was doing. The Universe that he describes in the middle is also creative, and enjoyable enough. All this is what can be found in any book by Asimov.  Besides that, Asimov doesn't offer anything. The story is divided in three parts, which simply don't match. The middle, as enjoyable and praised as it is, just doesn't fit in the novel, what happens there and is not explained in one of the other parts is just irrelevant. I read it, and at the end expected that the story would somehow intermingle with the humans to get an ending for both of them, however, the story is just abandoned altogether. According to me, the middle was just a ~50 pages long pretty description, and not part of the book.  The first part is good science fiction, with decent character development and a very good plot. But then, the third part is again really bad. The best word to describe it is cheesy. (** SPOILERS AHEAD **) The fact that Asimov includes the cliche story of the guy and the girl who start off as friends with a common goal, pledging they are not interested in each other, knowing it's impossible to be intimate, and ending up loving each other and doing the impossible is just disappointing. It just not his style, and therefore feels completely forced in the story. (** END OF SPOILERS **).  Not a bad book, but I expected a lot more from Asimov.

B00005JKEZ|5.0|The two-disc edition of one of the best Technicolor costume adventures ever made is superb. If you want only the best Hollywood film productions for your permanent collection, then this version of The Adventures Of Robin Hood belongs in it. Kudos to Warner Brothers for spending the time and money to get this great film just right for DVD. It's a knockout.    I grew up watching the awful edited-for-TV and scratchy 16MM classroom versions of this film classic, so the deep, clear and crisp colors, widescreen presentation and enhanced sound track of the original production were a revelation. So were the actors, who now seem newly minted and thus better able to flesh out their wonderfully compelling characters. Errol Flynn's energetic portrayal of the legendary honest robber has never been equalled. (P.S. What a handsome devil Flynn was!) Ditto Olivia de Havallind's dewy, smooth-voiced and beautifully costumed Maid Marian. Claude Rains as their scheming enemy, Prince John, is even more dastardly than I thought.      The addition of a well-researched and presented technical history of the production by film historian Rudy Belmer, along with myriad behind-the-scenes film clips and anecdotes, makes this fine entertainment even more enjoyable. I better understand and appreciate what it took back then to get everything and everybody together to make great films like this one. Thanks, Mr. B.     It is a tribute to the filmmakers that the modern-day viewer's knowledge of TAORH's technical aspects doesn't detract from the sheer pleasure of watching a splendidly told medieval tale. You keep cheering for the brave Saxon commoner and his merry band as they battle their cruel Norman overlords for king and country (and the comely Maid) with heroic derring-do -- especially when Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone are on screen. The two actors play off each another exceptionally well. Their climactic swordfight is masterfully staged and well excecuted; it is notable that few of their fightscenes were doubled by stuntmen. Let's face it: Americans can't do swords. End of story.     This DVD is first-rate: well restored, produced, packaged and presented. I'm betting that like me, you'll be watching this edition of The Adventures of Robin Hood a lot and seeing something new every time. May our swash never buckle!

0156029065|5.0|In this delightful and intriguing tale of adventure, Umberto Eco leads us through 12th-century Italy, France, Byzantium and lands much farther east. We move through history and myth, from the Holy and Roman Emperor Frederick to the realm of Prester John.<br /><br />The protagonist of the story is an Italian peasant boy named Baudolino. He is a born teller of tall tales, but after Frederick adopts him, he puts his creative mind to work in many ingenious ways, often solving otherwise intractable diplomatic problems. Baudolino is educated in Paris. With a group of friends from his student days and some from his hometown, he joins Frederick on the Third Crusade. After Frederick dies in mysterious circumstances, Baudolino and eleven others set out to find Prester John.<br /><br />With his usual skill with language and his intimate knowledge of medieval history, Eco leads us through wild lands where Baudolino and company encounter all the mythical creatures they have read about in books in Europe. They finally arrive at the city of the deacon who is the designated successor of Prester John. Near this city, Baudolino falls in love with a Hypatia and fathers a child with her. But before the child is born, a war breaks out, Hypatia sends word that she and her people are fleeing, and Baudolino and company head back west.<br /><br />Back in the west Baudolino tells his tale to a Byzantine official named Niketas. He then learns, to his astonishment, that he may have inadvertently contributed to the death of his adopted father Frederick. Devastated, he becomes a stylite for a while (i.e., he takes up residence in a small hut at the top of a pillar, a form of monasticism). After several months of this, he heads back east again, to fulfill some promises he made along the way and to seek Hypatia and their child.<br /><br />The story starts out in a very interesting fashion, and ends leaving us wanting more, but reasonably sure that Baudolino will fulfill his dreams.
0061544493|4.0|How could I miss the stylish book written by the British pop star? I was a big fan of Posh Spice and her hubby David Beckham.   I didn't enjoy much of the early chapters in the book, but I like it she gave top tips on each topic. Something old, something new, but they are useful. My favorite chapters in the book are shoes, winter, special occasions and make-up. It's so nice that she gave suggestions on what gifts to buy for the holidays. She told you where to buy your clothes, shoes, purses, etc. As expected, she has very expensive taste. She does recommend some high street stores that you could afford, such as H&M, Zara,Victoria's secret. There are many glamour pictures and she shows you what a hot mom looks like.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|Loved the movie. I watched it 3 times in 2 days. If you like musicals, this is one you have got to see! Meryl Streep does a good job of singing and is where we would like to be.

B000VLOKQI|1.0|I am a big fan of the Who and I will for sure someday purchase this DVD. Based upon reviews here,it promises to be very good.I have several other WHO-related DVD's,(Kids...Isle of Wight,etc.)  The reason for the \\"one-star\\" is because I am protesting Pete Townshend's constant sell-out of our precious Who songs for TeeVee show (a lyric from a Townshend song contains the line: \\"you might see me on dumb TV\\";apparently TV is not dumb enough for you to rake in some more shekels from it,eh,Pete?),theme songs,commercials,Pepsi,etc.etc. ad nauseum. He once said: \\"They're MY songs and I can do what I want with them\\". While that may be true in the \\"technical\\" or fiduciary sense,what Pete seems to fail to understand or care about that THOSE SONGS ARE OURS,TOO! We may not have written 'em,but we bought 'em,which in turn made Pete Townshend a very rich man.  I feel he is damned disrespectful to us,his fans and to his own songs and their importance. These songs,along with those of other artists and groups from the '60's and '70's were the soundtrack to our lives and,speaking for myself;it's very painful and irritating to hear something like \\"My Generation\\" being used to hawk swill like Pepsi. Hearing \\"Who Are You\\" as the theme to a violent,gory crime drama TeeVee show is very sad,IMHO.  I believe that Townshend owns the publishing rights to his songs. If that is indeed the case and I am reasonably certain that it is, (if someone knows better,please correct me),then by his sloppy,cynical disregard for his fans feelings about these great songs and his self-admitted awareness of their commercial potential,then perhaps he is not the best caretaker of the legacy of The Who.(Moon,Daltrey,Entwistle and Townshend are the only 'OO that there ever was.) Perhaps Pete Townshend should pay attention to someone like John Densmore who refuses to allow his fellow remaining Doors to \\"cash in\\" on their greatest songs,(to sell crap on TeeVee).  When I get this DVD,it will be a used copy as I do notwant to even remotely risk giving Pete Townshend another penny of my hard-earned cash-I've already given him much more than he deserves;the cynical sell-out that he is.
0312370849|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  The theme of the Holocaust and the impacts to both the Jewish victims and those who lived through the times has been done many times already.  What separates this book from the pack is the use of modern day characters and the emotional impact that past atrocities and events have on current lives when old realities are stumbled upon. I was prepared for a trite ending to the book (the subject matter HAS been often done!), but it turned out quite satisfying.  A good read.

1416562605|4.0|On a superficial level, reading the work The White Tiger by Aravind Adiga will introduce readers to a side of India that's much different than the usual glamour of contrived gurus and opulent Bollywood.  The White Tiger is portrayal of the lingering, residual effects of India's caste system on its slow yet inevitable push toward technological modernity.    Adiga's novel focuses on one man's breakthrough from \\"the Darkness\\" of backward rural poverty to \\"the Light\\" of urban entrepreneurship and what americans would probably describe as middle class luxury.  The story centers on Balram Halwai's struggle to accept more of life than his caste will allow.  Born without a true name, Balram progresses from lowly sweet-shop worker to personal driver and servant to becoming a \\"respectable\\" businessman of Bangalore.  As with all good stories, the plot advances with the rationalization of one's choices and sacrifices.  Sacrifices and choices involving losing one's family, one's humility, and murder.    Adiga adds several layers of philosophical complexity throughout the novel.  One the one hand, this a work outlining the persistence of slavery, not only in Indian culture, but modern culture as well.  Balram is an aberration, an Indian who defies his culture not only in the pursuit of \\"entrepreneurship\\" but also the pursuit of being a free and true man.  Adiga compares most Indians living in the lower castes to being chickens suffocating in a great coop, unable and even unwilling and perhaps proud of it, to better their lot in life.  It is only when Balram finally realizes in his anger that the rich always get the best in life and the poor always get the leftovers that he makes the choices that cannot be reversed.    The greater psychological slavery realized by Balram is perhaps akin to something Nietzsche may have said regarding god being dead.  Adiga certainly puts it to the reader to decide whether Balram's choices are truly necessary to become a free man in a highly corruptIndia.  Whether they are or not, such is the plight in the darkest corners of India, for those truly grasping for a better life.  It is certainly compelling, a story with choices that multitudes are facing every day.  Excellent read.

B001N26GHU|4.0|This album is an improvement over Magic.      This time the band got together to record intead of doing each of the parts seperately.  The sound quality is still a little muddled but all in all it is much better.      The quality of the songs are goos as well.  I absolutely love Outlaw Pete.  This may not be his best collection of songs.  It certainly will not be a masterpiece.  It is still better than Human Touch and Lucky Town.  I just wish that the band could have a bigger role in this album.  The E Street Band was always part of the appeal that made him famous.      I recommend buying this album.  Just temper your expectations.  Once you do that, you can enjoy the album.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is one of the best romantic movies ever. It is truly moving, and escapes all the bullcrap of the normal Hollywood \\"Chickflicks\\" and \\"Romantic Comedies\\". These movies are generally just filled with sex, and very little basis for the man and woman liking each other. Pride and Prejudice is a very intellectual movie that deeply explores romance, love,  and attraction. This movie makes you believe love is real, and not just some fake Hollywood thing. The movie is deeply moving. Expect yourself to smile, laugh and cry.
B001GQSY5K|4.0|A shame all the George Lucas bashing these days because I think Star Wars: The Clone Wars is impressive and I actually bought it. It had good special effects, nice intertwining plotlines, it filled in some blank spaces in the rich canvas of this generation-spanning series, and it was a plain and simple fine piece of imaginative tale-telling. The criticism I've heard is that it panders to a younger audience, and the voices aren't the original actors (do YOU wanna shell out fifty times more money for the on-screen stars?), and some people even said it's inauthentically canonical since it lacked the 20th Century Fox opening credits! Hey, whatever, it's your viewing experience, as for me I say so it's not sci-fi a la Tolstoy and yeah I can see how hard-core purists might kick but you know, I enjoyed this flick and I'm not going to rag on it. I think there are still so many great stories waiting to be mined from Star Wars and hope they keep 'em coming for a long time from now.
B000VNMMQG|3.0|William Wilberforce was a member of Parliament who earned his place in history by becoming one of the great English abolitionists of the late 1700s.  Inspired by his deep-abiding love for God and his commitment to Christian principles, he was instrumental in bringing an end to slavery in his nation.<br /><br />Written by Steven Knight and directed by Michael Apted, \\"Amazing Grace\\" plays like one of those historical costume dramas of yore - serious in tone, stolid in execution, inspirational in theme and handsome in appearance.  The movie provides an interesting history lesson, even if it doesn't always make for the most gripping or compelling of dramas - especially since its characters, Wilberforce included, often emerge as more two-dimensional than three-dimensional in nature.  Still, it's a great movie to look at, and the stodginess itself becomes almost reassuring in its old-fashioned comfiness.<br /><br />Ioan Gruffudd as Wilberforce and Albert Finney as John Newton, Wilberforce's spiritual mentor and the composer of the hymn \\"Amazing Grace,\\" head a fine cast that includes Romola Garai, Benedict Cumberbatch, Rufus Sewell and Toby Jones as well<br /><br />And when that final vote is taken to make slavery a thing of the past in England, well, prepare yourself for goose bumps and throat lumps aplenty.
B001I82RVS|5.0|Call up your gore bros, it's time for a splatterparty!<br />This dynamic visual slice of insanity is drenched in way more blood than Tampax could absorb.  The gore flows like wine, it's time to dine on demented violence and get inebriated on the psychotic bewilderment spewing out from the mind of Yoshihiro Nishimura.<br /><br />TOKYO GORE POLICE really is just pure creative and crazy genius.  Amazingly shot in just 2 weeks, this film instantly catapults itself near the top of greatest gore cinema ever imagined.  It's like an addictive injection of TETSUO, ARMY OF DARKNESS, ROBOCOP, GOZU, DEAD ALIVE, and VIDEODROME.  This film is waaaay better than the ultra-violent MACHINE GIRL.<br /><br />It's a dizzying journey of maniacal mayhem.  The gorgeous Eihi Shiina(AUDITION) is the cop hunting the \\"engineers\\", a group of criminals that can mutate their severed limbs into warped weapons of destruction.  The story immediately spirals into a vortex of awesomely wretched sick battles that probably feels like an acid trip.  No ill side effects, it just doesn't get any crazier than this!<br /><br />Your DVD collection sucks without this flick.  BUY THIS NOW!
B0017R5UAA|5.0|The sound is an odd combination of The Beach Boys, the Moody Blues, and something...medieval. I'm not a huge fan of The Beach Boys, but after listening to this album for the third time I recommend it without hesitation. It would be easy to write the sound off as overly nostalgic, but instead it's a beautifully complex album that manages to be original yet haunting.

She's a remarkable vocalist with the ability to make you feel like she is channeling some of the greats from the past. The album is produced by legendary and highly celebrated music produer David Foster. If you have any interest in this style of music, it's a great buy. The only other thing that would make this an even better listening experience is to purchase her other album, the self titled \\"Renee Olstead\\". Enjoy! I know I do.

Not since the days of Neuromancer or Snow Crash has a book excited me so much.   Yes, it is technical.   But that is the very thing that makes it work so well.

B001P9KR94|5.0|This is the first review I've written. It's just not something I normally take the time to do. But I'm making time for Slumdog Millionaire, a film that swept the Oscars and won many other awards - and deserved every one of them.    While I'm not actually reviewing the quality of the Blu-ray release (as that's still a month away as of my writing this), I am reviewing the film itself. Even if this ends up being a bare-bones release that doesn't include a single trailer as a special feature, I'd still give it 5 stars, assuming they treat the video and audio with the pristine respect they deserve. No tech specs or special features have been announced at this time, but I'm really hoping for at least one commentary track (preferably with Boyle and Dev Patel) and some behind-the-scenes making-ofs. Do I want to know everything there is that went into the film's conception, production and reception? Absolutely. But more than anything, I just want to own this masterpiece of filmmaking on the best possible format.    After seeing the trailer when it first came out, I saw Slumdog Millionaire before all the hype started spreading. In my town is a non-profit theater that shows independent and lesser-known films (in addition to the big award winners and cult classics). Anyway, it was there that I first saw this film. I was even more blown away than I expected to be. Not that I had any expectations. It's Danny Boyle. What can you expect?    Danny Boyle has taken us from post-punk to post-apocalyptic England (Trainspotting, 28 Days Later). He's taken us from tropical sands to the sun that heats them (The Beach, Sunshine). Now he's taken us to India. The film is shot as beautifully as you would expect. It will make for fine demo material on Blu-ray. Every scene in this film can be defined as 'eye candy.'    It starts out with a torture scene. Then it cuts to a game show. Then it cuts to a group of boys playing in the slums of Mumbai. This interweaving of flashbacks of flashbacks is really intricate but easy to follow. We are taken on an incredible journey of two slumdog brothers, Jamal and Salim, as they beat impossible odds of survival by being able to think quickly on their feet and looking out for each other (most of the way). How does Jamal end up on Who Wants to be a Millionaire? How does he know the answers to all the questions? Will he know the answer to the final 16 million rupee question? Will he find his one true love?    By the time you find out, you already can't wait to see it again. And so I did. But the second time, I brought about ten people with me, who I had convinced through sheer joy in raving about this film.    Also worth mentioning is the music. While watching Slumdog Millionaire the first time, I made the decision to go out and buy the soundtrack the very next day. It's all so catchy and just as eclectic as the visual aspect of the film. The music and editing are done so effectively that they become characters themselves. Composer A.R. Rahman is now very much on my radar. But I've dragged this review on long enough. I'll let the soundtrack's reviews and Oscars speak for themselves.    If there's anything you should take away from this review, it's this: Slumdog Millionaire is a joy to behold. It is a beautiful film unlike anything you've seen (though it combines many familiar elements): it is a unique, vivid, inspiring, disturbing, funny, depressing and uplifting roller coaster of a film -- all within two hours. You will be just as excited experiencing this film upon repeat viewings as you were the first time watching it. The climax will still get your heart beating as fast as it was, even though you know how it ends. (Because, let's face it, you knew how it ended the first time you saw it.) You will also find yourself going out of your way to share this film with others.    Hope this helps!

0440237688|1.0|Laborious. As writers voices go, this one is droning the minutes of the Petty Bureaucrats' Town Planning Meeting. There are plenty of other dystopias to read, executed rather better. Pace, characterization, vivid description, originality are all notably absent from this book.

9707704667|5.0|The structure, the prose, and the plot of this novel all invited me in....  I was quite aware that I was being seduced by it, and I didn't mind in the least.  As a native speaker who hadn't picked up a real book in Spanish for 25 years, I was delighted to rediscover how playful our language can become in Vargas Llosa's hands.

B001GKJ2DO|1.0|I used to like ABBA, until I saw Mama Mia! A horribly disjointed musical, where songs feel contrived to fit into the story; a story that doesn't seem to come together. Individual songs are usually done alright, but don't segue from one to another very well.     The cast butchered several of the songs, but especially S.O.S, Take A Chance On Me, and anything where Pierce Brosnan sang. On a side note, I also counted at least two violations of Chekov's Gun. And finally, I think it has a bad moral message. Which you only recognize if you manage to sit through the whole thing.    If there is justice in the world, cast members without established careers won't get to have them as punishment for the worst movies I've seen since The Talented Mr. Ripley.

1932073221|4.0|I have read all of Sanaya Roman's books. This one was another life-changer for me.    The thing is, so many of us live in fear of lack. Because of this, we create more lack. Creating Money teaches how to get beyond those fears and live a life of abundance. It's all about feeling good ALL THE TIME, not just when you have reached your financial goals.    Previously, I approached money with so many emotions. I was jealous of those who had it. I was always worried I would never have enough. On and on... After reading this book, I really feel, at my core, I have released all the fear I had about money and now truly see it as what it is: ENERGY. It's an energy I can control by attracting more of it.    To really thoroughly understand that money is energy, read this book then check out [[ASIN:1608420000 10-Day Money Makeover - Simple Steps to Create More Money and Financial Prosperity Using Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT)]]. Once you read Sanaya's book, you will have a clearer understanding, but then you will need the tools to make that understanding a part of your day-to-day life. EFT is a great tool to help with this.

B001GZ6QC4|3.0|OK, let me first say that Heith Ledger is brilliant here and deserving of the Oscar. But the movie is overly dark, overly long, overly violent, confusing and humorless.  Even the Joker's fate at the end is unclear. Also lacks any sexual passion in the scenes with Maggie Gyllenhaal.  If you love special effects, I guess you will like the film, however I found the Iron Man to be a far superior film (and Robert Downey Jr. was very funny.)  Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman are all great actors, but I feel their talents were wasted here.  See it, but only for Ledger's masterful performance.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|It is one of the greatest classics that they only play about once each Christmas.  Now I can watch it whenever i want.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|If you haven't seen it and are wondering if the Joker steals the show... the answer is YES, and go see it.
B001DPHDCY|2.0|I am not a big fan of Jim Carrey, but I read the positive reviews and purchased this movie. What a waste of money. While the animation is very good and the Seuss atmosphere, when present, comes through nicely, most of the story and dialogue isn't anything that I want my kids watching. The story rambles on like a bad SNL skit and the name calling and \\"crotch\\" humor don't have a place in our house. There are some nice scenes that stick to the original story and Jim Carrey does a good job as Horton, but much of the show is filled with inappropriate humor and gratuitous pop culture references. And, the other reviewer is right, the shot at homeschoolers is unnecessary as well.     My wife grew up on Seuss books and she was ready to shut the movie off early in the show. She soldiered on and watched it with me almost to the bitter end. We finally shut it off when the story degraded into an REO Speedwagon song.    If they would have stuck with their core Horton story and the excellent narration of Charles Osgood, then the movie would have been much better and about half as long. As it is, I don't think this movie is appropriate for younger viewers as it will demonstrate language and behaviors you probably don't want in your house. We'll stick with the original 1970 adaptation.

0440244870|2.0|I read the book before the movie came out and absolutely loved it!  The only reason I give it 2 stars is that being this book is a \\"movie tie-in\\" makes may lead people to believe that this book is like the movie.  Well, it's not.     If you want a fun read, this is a great book.  If you read the book and expect the same story line from the movie or vice versa, you'll be greatly disappointed.  The book and the movie, kept separate, are each very entertaining.  Tied in?  No.
0316010669|2.0|I am disappointed in this book and feel it has been a waist of my time and money.  Unfortunately the book is poorly (if any at all) researched and relies heavily on a number of public stories that are already known and extensively debated in public media, most importantly, without drawing any useful nor new conclusion.  Most of the conclusions made in the book are either common sense and already well known so it really adds no value nor offers any useful thought.      The book argues that the snap judgments (called thin slicing by him) made by experts are often closer to truth than snap judgment made by amateurs but then gives contradicting stories.   It then talks about the fact that humans behave unexpectedly, often irrationally , often hastily in emergency situations (e.g. police arrests, assassinations).   Both of these points are common sense that are familiar to all of us.  We all have experienced these situations and know that they could be true.  However, what we don't know much about is whether we can learn anything to perform or prepare better for these situations.  The book offers absolutely no insight nor useful thought unfortunately.     The stories are all over the map, he touches, race, police brutality, fake art, coke tasting etc etc with no clear direction nor conclusion and fails to encourage any useful thought at the least.

B0000062FL|4.0|A quintessential classic Latin  guitar rock album, with a small percentage of Caucasian catering, makes Abraxas elude the almighty full-tilt masterstroke record but contains enough side-by-side memorabilia to warrant historical preservation.
067182449X|4.0|In the Diary of Anne Frank it basically tells a story that will always be remembered in history. Anne's life was like any other ordinary teenagers but it ended up taking a turn for the worse when World War II broke out. Hitler had taken control and he was taking many Jews to camps/places were they were being held. Some were killed, injured, and got diseases from their harsh environments. Anne, her family, and another family named the Van Danns went into hideout in a place called the Annex in Germany where they stayed for 2 and a half years. They got food, supplies, and clothes from the help of a woman named Miep (I think that's how you spell her name). She would spend her own money and risk getting arrested just to help all the people in need up there. After almost 3 years of living there, someone must have tipped them off because Nazi soldiers came charging inside and arrested 8 people hiding in the Annex. They were taken to a concentration camp where Anne Frank died from disease. A few weeks later the war ended and everyone who was still alive were released. Miep had found Anne's diary where she kept entries while living in hideout and later got in published.<br /><br />In my opinion this book was very interesting and pretty good. But at times it was extremely boring. There wasn't much that she could do while living in hideout, so most of her diary entries were repetitive and she talked about the same thing most of the time. Other than that it's a decent book and I think everyone should read it.
B0001CCXZW|1.0|Annoying, whiny and stupid.  Writing revolves around characters shallow and petty.  Based on it's popularity and critical recognition, it must have had some quality but from the few episodes I watched, I couldn't watch anymore because the storyline and characters were, as I said at the opening, annoying, whiny and stupid.
0143038419|4.0|I read some of the other reviews here calling this book self-obsessed, and saying Liz is so rich/lucky to travel around the world, etc. This *is* a personal journey but many people who find shades of themselves in her and her troubles have been able to find a lot of help and realise many things. I found the book very helpful and enlightening. Primarily, we *are* all self-obsessed, so if we can accept that first and then read the book, putting aside the consumerist thought \\"What am *I* getting out of reading this?\\" you Will get a lot out of it.     Then again, this may not be a book suited for people of all ages and circumstances. This is great for the average person (woman, especially) who has had a fairly decent life, but faces heartache and issues nonetheless and would like to discover more about life and the self. This book is not The Answer, but it does answer some questions, and help in many areas.    Come to it without expectations, and you're likely to be pleasantly, if not wonderfully, surprised.
0679735909|5.0|This is my favorite novel of all time. I wish her other books were as good - this one is both poetic and totally engrossing
0691131511|4.0|It is a thorough and comprehensive history of the Byzantine Empire. It is not written in a strict chronological order. Instead, it is organized around concepts, culture, and events. It opens to our view an important history of the West that is typically hardly touched on in most historical accounts.  It is well written and is easy to understand but oddly, it's not a compelling read that you can't put down. Nevertheless, it is interesting and quite informative.
0312383320|4.0|I love the Plum books - my mom and I both read the series and we both end up laughing out loud over some of Stephanie's antics.  The numbers books are better - but a good dose of Plum between the numbers can really cheer you up on a cold winter's day.  If you want a good laugh, read this book!
1416562605|4.0|This book is well written and very interesting.. i couldn't wait to read until the end..
B001L5SXQG|3.0|When Magic came out,I thought it was a Great Shift in Bruce's production.  The \\"Spectoresque\\" production really worked  and the songs were very interesting.  On this disc, all the songs sound like \\"B\\" Versions of the Magic songs.  Although \\"Outlaw Pete\\" is sort of a \\"Bat out of Hell\\" moment, it seems silly for Bruce to be singing it. Being  Campy works for Meatloaf, but not Bruce. I think the Title cut, \\"The Wrestler\\" and \\"Queen of the Supermarket\\" are good songs, but  most songs relied on the production, which was overdone and the songs lack any substance. If you listen to this CD on a Very good system, The sound is very harsh.   This CD is not as bad  as \\"Devils and Dust\\" (Boring),  but certainly not in the same league as \\"Rising\\", \\"Magic\\" or \\"Born to Run\\".

0465043577|5.0|This book should be recommended reading for all the eager beaver finance MBA's learn concepts like CAPM, Markowitz theory and risk capital budgeting. Mandelbrot's thesis challenges these very pillars of finance and highlights the hidden dangerous implications of the simplifying assumptions that these theories make. Modern finance does not account for the highly non-stationary nature of market stochastics that result in large fluctuations in market return. Additionally he blows a big hole in the risk-return linear relationship specified by CAPM and gives several good examples where the real data does not fit the standard models but is efficiently recreated by his fractal geometric constructs.<br />Unfortunately for the most part he takes an empirical view of the market. I wish he had taken a single stock and analyzed it in greater detail. Additionally he should also consider analyzing more exotic financial instruments like derivatives and commodities.<br />This is a pioneering work that will hopefully develop and enhance our understanding of modern finance.

0316017922|3.0|The author of Blink and Tipping Point writes his third book, Outliers, on the story of success.    Gladwell opens with a story of a small town in Pennsylvania that has escaped all heart problems, despite a diet typical of all midwesterners. Unique for its almost completely Italian immigrant population, doctors are convinced its dietary. The real truth is much more suprising.    So begins Gladwell's latest book on the real truth behind success.    Unfortunately, there are no real surprises. There are some interesting antecdotal facts about birthdays and seasons along with the actual amount of hardwork it takes to become a success.    But in the end, I was left wanting. It seemed to me to be a little more than some loosely connected stories of people who have made it.    Then, the last story, autobiographical in nature, just seemed too easy to me. A bit self-laudatory.    His third was not nearly as good as the first two. It was interesting, but not worth the price I paid.    I would wait to buy at half-price, if you are interested and you like this sort of stuff.
B000MG1YC0|1.0|I have followed Morten since he was in Tristania.  Morten to me was one of those musical geniuses that emerged from the womb with his gifts.  The first Tristania \\"Widow's Weeds\\" is Tristania at it's best.  I was in love with Vibeke and short of idolized Morten's growly vocals.  They remixed their songs like \\"Pale Enchantress\\" for whatever reason on Angina... Oh, and \\"My Lost Lenore\\" sounds like \\"Pale Enchantress\\" too... But that's forgivable.  Come to think of it \\"Sirenian Shores\\" sounded an awful lot like \\"Star-Crossed Lovers\\" but I hardly think that prepares you for what happens next.    So you have Morten leaving Tristania because he's a genius and wants complete control over everything.    And he has that.  He composes everything in his \\"Star-Goth Studios of Norway\\" writes all the lyrics and his band pretty much is only useful when he tours... But he's Morten Veland, a drunk Norwegian gothy metal genius.    And \\"At Sixes and Sevens\\" sounded like he didn't miss a beat.  Even the girl Fabian Gondamin or whoever was studio only.  This is where you get he has an obsession with female singers, because since then he couldn't keep them longer than 1 cd.  Henriette Bordovich or whoever didn't stick around for the new cd (She was on Elixer) either because he was gettin busy with her or she didn't like the new direction.  You never hear him put out one song without the girl.  Not one.  The first song he ever put out with a severe absence of HIM though was Cease to Exist, a beautiful Tristania song weighing in at 9 mins plus featured on Angina.  Maybe that was the next clue to what is to come... Well that minus about 6 minutes of air-time.     So now he brings us 9 destinies and a downfall... which reminds me of Coal Chamber when they brought us Chamber Music.    I feel it seriously had to go like this.  I don't know how anyone conscious of their own existence can see it any other way.    \\"I think I am gonna release a terrible album.\\"    It had to!  How else could it be any different?  DUDE!  Did he hear Evanesence and think \\"Wow they are so much better than Sirenia.  Sirenia should be more like Evanesence.\\" and BELIEVE what he just said?    DUDE?  WHAT ARE THEY DOING NOW?  ANYTHING? NO!      Change THAT drastic is worthy of a COMPLETE NAME CHANGE!  YOU CAN'T EVEN CALL YOURSELF SIRENIA ANYMORE!  IN FACT, SINCE THEY AREN'T DOING ANYTHING ANYMORE YOU SHOULD JUST CALL YOURSELF EVANESENCE!    UGH!

0307387178|5.0|Into the wild repesents not only the desire of merge oneself in nature but, more compelling, the quest for the real nature of the human being. Supertramp and few others shows us that real life isoutdoor life not urban life, made of artificiality and invention.

0307237699|5.0|This book doesn't really NEED another to sing its praises. But for me,  the greatest part of the book is that it helped its author get elected.  I must be the exception, since I only read it in the first month AFTER  the election last year. It is superlative in its analysis of what is going  wrongly in America, what is needed to fix it, and how to get from here to  there. To think beyond party politics and partisanship to the kinds of  changes he proposes is indeed AUDACITY. But that is just what we need today in the U.S., a positive kind of audacity: hope. I highly commend  this book to any and all readers; I found it eminenetly readable and enjoyed it immensely. Didn't want to put it down. Now that he's there  longer than his first month, I pray for him daily. I know he welcomes that.

B001TH16DS|4.0|I've got all three seasons on blu. Considering they were probably using ancient films to re-master it, it looks pretty clean. I'm not a big Star Trek guy, but I did want to see how it fared on blu. I wasn't disappointed at all. 75% of the time the picture looks great. They really cleaned up the dirt on these w/o taking out too much detail. A must have for Trekkies.

B0002VEPRQ|5.0|We bought Mary Poppins for our special needs 5 year old grandson who has CP.  He cannot walk or talk but when we played Mary Poppins for him, his reaction was STUPENDOUS! He clapped his hands, laughed out loud and kicked his feet.  He especially loves the part when Dick Van Dyke is dancing on the rooftops.  We have NEVER seen this type of interaction from him before.  We don't know what genius it took to put this movie together, but genius it was - from the songs, to the dancing, to the cast and especially Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.

My 7 year old is a member of this \\"cult\\" now & you should be too!
B001P9KR8U|5.0|By the end of two hours, Danny Boyle would have sent you through the slums of India witnessing the abject poverty, religious violence, inhumane acts of cruelty (against children) and the eventual modernization of  Mumbai where Jamal Malik sits in the hotseat about to win 20 million rupees in India's version of Who Wants to be a Millionaire. Through some strange twist of fate, he was arrested on suspicion of cheating and from there on, we see Jamal's life unravel in front of us as he recalls the answers to the questions.<br /><br />Much credit must be given to the child star Ayush Mahesh Khedekarwho plays the child Jamal, for his excellent and endearing portrayal of a slum child who lost his mother to religious insurgents. Along with his brother, Salim, they navigate their way through the streets, making money through the most ingenious ways while never forgetting the young girl, Latika, whose hand let go of his during an escape. The main cast also works well but it's really also A.R. Rahman's excellent score and soundtrack with an eclectic mix of Indian, electronic and ethereal music that makes the film such a success.<br /><br />At the end, Slumdog is a heart-wrenching and bittersweet tale of growing up and love. Still, it brings so much hope to the millions of children and people living in poverty-stricken areas of India.<br /><br />As the credits roll, look out for the pulsating dance sequence that brings some cheer. Danny Boyle and AR Rahman deserve whatever accolades bestowed upon them thus far. (A+)

0143038583|4.0|As the granddaughter of a farmer, I always thought that I truly understood the world of agriculture and FDA labeling.  Turns out, I was incredibly wrong.  This is a well-written and entertaining read while informative and thorough.  It has opened up my eyes about the realm of 'posh eatery'.  I'm an avid Whole Foods and Central Market shopper, but have since learned that not only isn't it always the best option, but may not truly be what we have come to think of as 'organic.'    It won't ruin your appetite, the author isn't spreading a great message about the culture of food.  Rather, it's an explorative and entertaining journey through the world of food and nutrition.

0545128285|4.0|\\"The Tales of Beedle the Bard\\" is a collection of five short fairy tales from the world of Harry Potter.     The stories are a quick, entertaining read. Among the stories is \\"The Tale of the Three Brothers\\", which has particular significance in book 7. At the conclusion of each fable, commentary is included by \\"Albus Dumbledore\\" which adds a little bit of often humorous back story to them.     All in all, the book is this and nothing more. I admire J.K. Rowling for her decision for the proceeds to support a charitable cause. Like Fantastic Beasts and Quidditch Through the Ages before it, the book is nonessential to the main series, but is fun as side reading.

0385341075|4.0|The basic plot has been described in detail in other reviews.  My description will therefore be brief.  The setting is the early 1990s on the island of Bougainville that fought for independence from Papua New Guinea.  I had never heard of Bougainville before and honestly knew PNG only in the context of pointing it out on the map.      The capital of PNG, Port Moresby can be summed up in the next paragraph which is a direct quote from Wikipedia.    In 2004, Port Moresby was ranked the worst capital city in the world to live in the Economist Intelligence Unit's ranking of 130 of the world's capital cities . High levels of rape, robbery and murder and large areas of the city controlled by gangs of thugs, known locally as \\"rascals\\" (raskol in Tok Pisin), were cited. According to a 2004 article in the Guardian newspaper, unemployment rates are estimated to be between 60 and 90% and murder rates three times that of Moscow and 23 times the rate in London.    So, this area of the world can be very barbaric which sets a good context.    The story begins in a village where life is simple and though people have fled due to the war, it is a friendly place.  The only white man in the community begins to teach school and uses Dickens' Great Expectations and reading it aloud as his primary tool.  This makes a big impression on the children and is a very sweet depiction of how imagination can elevate.  The novel is narrated by 13 year old Matilda who is entranced with Great Expectations and relates to Pip almost as a real person.    The second half of the book changes dramatically as the horror and cruelty of war visits the village.  There are barbaric events, bravery, friendship and sacrifice.    This is a good book set in a place not many of us know about.  It is also original, moves quickly and deals with the heart.  Most people I know that have read it have generally positive things to say about it.    As it is told from the perspective of a 13 year old girl, it is very simplyworded and describes unsophisticated people who strive to survive and help each other.    I liked the novel.  It was a quick and enjoyable read.  It was shortlisted for the Booker and while I don't consider it to be a masterpiece, I enjoyed it far more than that year's Booker winner, \\"The Gathering\\"

B000A2H8WQ|5.0|Everyone knows Quincy Jones' contributions to making \\"Off The Wall\\", \\"Thriller\\", and \\"Bad\\" for Michael Jackson, but what a lot of jazz fans know is that Mr. Jones also knows how to put together a excellent album!! This album, from 1989, shows Jones at his finest: while incorporating the latest (for 1989) contemporary sounds and Hip-Hop elements, while keeping the music listenable and timeless for all to enjoy, whatever their age.  I would also highly recommend the album that Jones did in 1980 with George Benson, \\"Give Me The Night\\", for another fun jazz album.
0765318741|4.0|The novella \\"I am Legend\\" holds up very well after half a century.  (FYI, I have not seen the movie or read the other stories in the book.)  The writing is fast-paced and lively.  The character emotions are a bit dated.  Our protagonist is a classic White male who demands \\"reason,\\" balls up his fists when he gets mad, belittles women, and so forth.  Despite our blockish hero, we can immediately identify with this man who finds himself alone in a world of vampires.  He suffers the loss of his wife and child, and wonders about his existence.  The science of vampires he uncovers is original and sometimes compelling, and his changing moods--sometimes purposeful, sometimes forlorn--are captivating.  The terrible alienation of this hero makes for a surprisingly fun and fast read.
B000002KLG|5.0|Produced by Music Genius extraordinaire Quincy Jones, \\"Give Me The Night\\" is one fun, engaging album that keeps the rhythm from the first cut to the last.  Of course, the title track is the main highlight of the album, but the other tracks, especially \\"Off Broadway,\\" \\"Midnight Love Affair,\\" and \\"What's On Your Mind\\" make this album worth getting for your collection.
0152048049|2.0|I read this book in German (Der Kleine Prinz), I liked it and thought I should order the English for a friend. The Little Prince went there ... but I don't know what my friend thought about. All I know is: Language is culture, e.g. a book originally written in French, later translated to German and also to English (British or US-English?) may or don't make the same \\"good\\" impression any reader. So I'm not able to create a review for The Little Prince.
B001LF4IA6|1.0|This CD is a vast disapointment.  Other than the opening track, the songs are instantly forgetable.  Not a worthy effort from the Boss (or in this case the Toss - as in throw this CD away.  Not worth the price of admission.  A few of these tracks could have been added to Magic and not kept out for a separate release.  Rather than working on a dream, Bruce and company should be working on making better music (and taking the time necessary to do so before cobbling together another album).  Been a fan since 1975; saw him in his glory days at the Paramount Theater in Seattle in 1978; and dug him up through Tunnel Of Love.  Since then he's been hit or miss (outside of the excellent single Streets of Philadelphia and the CD The Rising).  I think my buying days are over for this artist.
0307346617|5.0|The book was well written. The story flowed and though you did have to suspend belief in some parts the book overall was great. I do find it hard to believe that the military would not bring enough ammo for their big battle with the dead. Even if there were military spending cuts, that's just hard to believe. It is great to read all of the different points of view that the book covers. There are parts that you could truly see happening just due to human nature. I have read the book quite a few times and I enjoy it each time I do so. If you like the undead genre buy this book. You will enjoy it. I would just keep away from the up comming movie, b/c I can't see how they could squeeze a complex story into maybe 2 hours.

B0017098GO|5.0|This is an absolutely excellent piece of modern fantasy that rivals Martin and Hobb.  Sanderson absolutely hits a grand slam with the first novel in his trilogy.    What is so good about it?    1.) The magic system is coherent and constant.  His rules of Allomancy are very in depth and well thought out; they are consistent and the imagery used to describe it all left me with a lot to picture and imagine in my mind.  It would make for a hell of a good video game.  Excellent job on the magic system.    2.) His descriptions of using Allomancy are very vivid.  He sticks to his own rules and describes the fight scenes involving Allomancy run like a movie.  It is very well described.    3.) The main character developes really well.  Vin's character development is 2nd to none including the works of Hobb, Martin, and the first few Jordan books.  Excellent work on imerssive and enjoyable main characters.    4.) Excellent pacing.  This book doesn't drag at any point.  I put the book down each evening excited to get home from work and pick it up again.  His description give excellent detail and not oppressive, unlike some other fantasy authors.    5.) Ties up a lot of loose ends.  I think a lot of fans can really appriciate an author that cleans up his own story.  Sanderson ends the book explaining almost everything except a few historical plot points, a perfect spring board into his next novel.    Summary: Sanderson has done a tremendous job on the first book in his Mistborn series and I am very eager to start the next one!
B001LF4IA6|4.0|There's not to much to add to the diverse discussion that's posted about this disc - other than to say after living with it for awhile, it has really grown on me.<br /><br />I too, was very disappointed after the initial listen - especially with the opening Outlaw Pete. As many have noted, it just didn't seem to be up there with the classic Springsteen openers (although beware those Springsteen pundits who, when asked to identify those great Springsteen opening tracks reply by saying \\"Thunder Road, and uh, Badlands, and uh...uh...y'know - - -\\")<br /><br />This disc has really grown on me. Even Outlaw Pete. OK - it's still somewhat insipid and the lyrics don't really make a whole lot of sense, but I gotta tell you - that phrase \\"can you hear me?\\" keeps going through my head. As does the rest of the song. As do many others from the disc - especially the title track.<br /><br />At this point, I enjoy this material enough that I'm looking forward to singing along with some of them - alongside my son - at The Boss's concert on this year's tour.<br /><br />How many artist's can you say that about? Enjoying a concert together with your college age son; singing songs together? Isn't that what Bruce has always been about?<br /><br />It's been many, many years since I dragged my friends to a small venue to hear this new guy (\\"Bruce who?\\") promising them that he would absolutely blow them away. He did.  And he still does.<br /><br />Bruce has gotten older, and so have I. And the music has matured as well.  I no longer expect Thunder Roads from Bruce. But along the way Tunnel Of Love literally changed my life (\\"God have mercy on the man / who doubts what he's sure of\\"), and The Rising somehow offered a catharsis after all of our lives changed.<br /><br />Working On A Dream is another gift. Perhaps not up there with Springsteen's greatest, most enduring work, but he has earned that privilege at this point in his career, like precious few other artists.<br /><br />Many have been taken from us.  I'm just glad that Bruce and I are growing older together.er together.
B001KEGRCA|3.0|I have several IMAX dvds and had high expectations about this new Blu-ray product. I especially liked the Ganges and Mysteries of the Nile productions and expected even better footage here since they were filming the Colorado River and landscape of the Grand Canyon.    I think as a conservation film this was okay. However, if you are interested in landscapes and river rafting, I've seen so much better out there and I was disappointed in the quality and coverage. I have a new Blu-ray player and expected better from this film. I guess it loses something once out of the IMAX, 3D environment it was designed for. It almost seemed over-exposed. Too much time focusing on clever graphics. After all, this is the Grand Canyon - it is not needed and I found it slightly irritating.
0765316897|5.0|i cried at the end (tears of happiness and sadness)  it was a fitting conclusion to the series and i felt like i was reading about good friends.  brandon sanderson's writing and imagination are superb.  there was nothing that felt contrived or just thrown in at the last minute.  you could tell everything was thought out to the last detail.  loved it.

B001M0B740|4.0|I listened to this audio book last week. The science and insights are fascinating. I can see how having a stroke would be much less scary if you knew exactly what was happening and had faith in your brain's plasticity to heal itself. Also, hearing the author talk about her experiences in terms of right brain, left brain was intriguing.     But, even though this is a fairly short book, Dr. Bolte Taylor repeats many things too many times: how much sleep she needed after the stroke, how she needed people to be really nice to her, how she was overstimulated at the beginning by almost everything - especially loud voices, how a pure right-brain experience is blissful, how we all can access our right brains any time we want. Those are all useful pieces of information, but hearing them two or three times would have been plenty.     Also, this book is so good the publishers should have invested in a professional reader. Dr. Bolte Taylor is a competent reader, but her voice can be monotonous and nasally. I found it hard at times to put the next CD into the player - not wanting to hear her voice any more.    Over all, I really, really liked this book. The author's experience and her ability to describe it are informative and ultimately reassuring. But I would recommend reading a hard copy of the book rather than listening to the audio book.

0307454894|4.0|The Reader is a spare and incredibly haunting book that offers a unique reading experience. Its modulated, precise, and tightly-controlled prose sets the perfect tone in telling a story that is by turns erotic, regretful, and flat-out sombre. It is ostensibly the story of a young man who had a sordid affair with an older woman, falls in love, and the psychological shift and moral ambiguity he feels when, years later, he is privy to information that could desperately help her while on trial for crimes commited during World War II. Michael is a well-written character, and Schlink's style offers us a deep look into his mind and heart when faced with his tough decisions. The character of Hanna is almost maddeningly mysterious, and while I am sure that that is done on purpose, her inevitable fate did not ring home to me as much as I felt it should. However, this novel is a striking moral parable, and what does stick with you is the overall theme of regret and responsibility, an attempt at absolution by a society that simply did not know how to atone. This slim book is wise and fascinating.
1594481784|4.0|Rob Fleming would be pushing 50 today, a sobering thought for those of us who delighted in his arrested adolescence as presented in \\"High Fidelity\\", Nick Hornby's 1995 breakout novel.<br /><br />\\"I want to go back to 1979 and start all over again\\", is how Rob puts it to us late in the story, and it's not just bell-bottom nostalgia he's thinking of - though you do get that, in a hilariously sent-up way. Its the menu of options that have since become closed to him, especially regarding love. Rob has just been ditched by his latest love, and he spends the first thirty pages going back to his youth recalling past dumping dames from his first kiss to his last roll in the hay.<br /><br />He also is stuck in a dead-end job, selling old LPs at a tiny North London store called Championship Vinyl, where most of his day is spent listening to his two employees argue over whether the Righteous Brothers or Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels did the better version of \\"Little Latin Lupe Lu\\". If you care anything at all about pop music and its various offshoots over the last 50 years, you will find plenty of recognition comedy in \\"High Fidelity\\". For others, the send-up of nerdy one-upsmanship translates easy enough for laughter.<br /><br />For most people, \\"High Fidelity\\" the book will be used to compare with \\"High Fidelity\\" the movie. The latter is a good one, definitely making my Top Five All Time John Cusack Movies list, but I wonder if the novel will similarly be on my Top Five Nick Hornby Novels in a few years' time. Not that \\"High Fidelity\\" isn't splendid company - it just goes on for a while longer than it needs to, and its narration seems a bit self-aware for someone whose life is supposed to be such a mess. Suffice it to say I don't want women thinking Rob is a typical male loser - he's a little too clever and sympathetic.<br /><br />The novel does score points over the movie in some departments - Rob visits his parents in one chapter, and gets roped into a neighbor's wine party that brings out his self-pitying best. At one point, dragged to see a movie, he sees another young man in a similar predicament. The young man smiles sheepishly at Rob, who struggles to swallow down his disgust.<br /><br />That gets at the heart of the message of \\"High Fidelity\\", that Rob's problem is one of snobbish selfishness, a desire to see himself as too important to accept the reality of his life for what it is. His relationship with ex Laura is not one of bitter feelings, but a dim sense of being cooped up by social expectations. Finding his way past his own narrow sense of self-satisfaction is the novel's central struggle, and its source of light. It's a common theme with Hornby - the main character in \\"About A Boy\\" later on will also need to get past his ideal of \\"island living\\" to find what it is about life that's really worth living for.<br /><br />I like the message well enough. What I like more are the snappy one-liners. Maybe there's too many of them, and maybe Laura feels a bit too much like an echo of Rob's narration. But Hornby's often-unremarked gift for plot structure is well in evidence, and try not being entertained by it all the first time round.<br /><br />\\"I get letters from young men, always young men, in Manchester and Glasgow and Ottawa, young men who seem to spend a disproportionate amount of their time looking for deleted Smiths singles and \\"ORIGINAL NOT RERELEASED\\" underlined Frank Zappa albums,\\" Rob says of his clientele. \\"They're as close to being mad as makes no difference.\\"<br /><br />Paying Rob a call may seem mad to him, but it makes a whole lot of sense where \\"High Fidelity\\" is concerned.pitying best.

B001IAOEXU|5.0|The RealTriggers attachments are outstanding for a more positive control of the back shoulder buttons.  They don't feel cheap and keep you from slipping off the buttons; this is especially useful for games that require a lot of use from these rear shoulder buttons such as FEAR 2 and Brothers in Arms.  Assembly is simple, just remove packaging and click accessories on to buttons, that's it.

B0006213WG|5.0|Getting this album on Itunes (sorry Amazon) I expected Sum 41 to be a similar punk band to Blink 182. They're not. This album isn't punk or anything like AKNF, which was kind of like Blink's Enema to the State. Sum is a great well rounded band that can play punk songs, metal songs, and ballads all equally well. The only thing that can be criticized for on this album is that a lot of there songs sounds like other songs done by different bands. If you don't know Sum very well then if you like System of a Down, Linkin Park, Green Day, Metallica, and Breaking Benjamin then you will like Sum 41.  1. Intro: 6/10 It's a cool build up to the album, but again it's just an intro.   2. No Reason: 9/10 A good leadoff song with a catchy chorus. The drumming is very good.  3. We're All to Blame: 7.5/10 Sounds a lot like \\"Chop Suey\\" of System of a Down. Good mix of slow and fast paced music. Shouldn't have been the first single.  4. Angels With Dirty Faces: 6.5/10 This is not a great song. Probably worst on the album.  5. Some Say: 9.5/10 Most punk song on the album. Has that kind of \\"sketchy\\" guitar if you know what I mean. Frusciante does it very well for the chilly peppers.   6. The Bitter End: 10/10 This song has a killer thunderous riff and excellent guitar solos. The drumming is fast paced and the lyrics are also very good.  7. Open Your Eyes: 7.5/10 This song sounds like it would be in a dumb teen fighter movie(ahem Never Back Down). The beat is reslly good as it gets faster and the guitar solo sounds like Tom Morello which is pretty awesome.  8. Slipping Away: 10/10 This is the softest song on the album. As soon as I put it on I just mellow out completely. It is a depressing song, but strong emotions make a strong song.  9. I'm Not the One: 6/10 This song is boring and sounds a lot like There's No Solution and Angels With Dirty Faces. It starts strong though.  10. Welcome to Hell 9.5/10 Upbeat with the best bass playing on the album. Now you have to take a guy named Coneseriously.  11. Pieces: 10/10 This is the best song on the album. I remember breaking up with my girlfriend and then listening to this song. It kinda made me upset, but that's just how moving this song is. I guess that's what this songs about anyway.  12. There's No Sloution: 7/10 An ok song. I like the guitar, but the chorus is annoying. Very Linkin Park esque.  13. 88: 9/10 This song puts all Sum 41 styles in it by going punk, hard, and soft. This song is like a war. It starts kind of tough because the idea of war isn't light. Then it get's soft so this would be where people are afraid of the war. Then the punk starts coming in as the soldiers get ready. Then the metal starts and so would the fighting. Then it gets soft again so the war would seem to be over, but people are in too much of shock to be sure.  13. Get Back(Rock Remix): 9/10 Ludacris kills it on this one. He didn't need Sum, but they still sounded good in the background.
B001AMWTAG|5.0|I heard Volbeat on Sirius for the first time back in January. I am completely into heavy/black/death/thrash metal, although i dabble in a little bit of everything. When I first heard VB, I have to admit that I was not sold. The second song I heard the last week of February was The Human Instrument. This song made me dive head first into what VB has to offer. A few days later I downloaded Rock the Rebel album and have been impressed ever since. I love the sound the group has. It's heavy yet has a punk blast feel to it on some songs. The track Sad Man's Tongue just kicks A$$ all the way. From the start of sounding like a country Elvis/Johnny Cash tune, to exploding with a kick-your-a$$ punk attitude and heavy-as-hell feel. You are missing some excellent music if you don't take the time to listen to Volbeat. They definitely have something to appease the metal palate.

Dylan would craft something beautiful, melodic, eloquent, twisty, like \\"Simple Twist of Fate\\" or \\"Shelter from the Storm.\\"  On \\"Nebraska,\\" Springsteen adheres to his \\"working-class hero\\" formula, minus the salvation, plotting ten tales of hopelessness brought to life through ghostly vocals, weepy harmonica, and stark guitar.  The crown jewel is \\"Atlantic City.\\"  Other draws include \\"Johnny 99,\\" a sharp homage to Chuck Berry, the bitterly sarcastic \\"Reason to Believe,\\" and the expected \\"troubles with father\\" tune (\\"My Father's House\\").  Even if these pieces don't excite you--and they certainly strike me--this man certainly has stories to tell.

B0013FYTAI|4.0|I think it was worth the money I paid for it. Besides the hit \\"Not Meant to Be,\\" it's a nice mix of refreshing music. Any age group should like this, but you do have to make sure you pick the edited version for younger kids or older \\"kids\\" like me.
B001G8WU4Y|1.0|The book is always better than the movie? Not in this case. This was the most boring, empty book Ive ever read. It was like reading the same chapter over and over. You would be hard pressed to find any substance in this book. There was no depth in the characters, even the little girl who should have been easy to enjoy and adore, there was just a void. Im not usually so critical, its just surprising how badly written and disappointing this book is.
0061684384|5.0|This book is awsome, kat von d tells all from begining to end and it is really easy to read. I have re read it numerous times now. I love to look back at the pictures and show it to my friends!
B00007H1Y2|5.0|This is an album full of inspiration from the tropical western world. It is obvious in every second of the music. I had no idea who these composers and musicians were when I bought it at Target in San Diego a while ago. I was searching for something different in the store and I thought \\"Why not, it's mainly instrumental and it has mambo on it\\", so I bought it. And I got excited when I heard it when I got home and started to work on a painting. It took me to another world. Some of the songs make me feel like I'm at a retro 1960's underground Cuban strip club with beach babes dancing around in poles... This is not an album for background music at a party, or with your friends. This is for inspiration and to appreciate the talent of certain music experts and open up your ideas of what music really is. I don't think the everyday person will appreciate it but I certainly did!

B00000099Y|1.0|I was listening to a metal radio station and the DJ was talking about how awesome Tool were so I downloaded this album to check them out. WOW. They're awful. \\"Pretentious\\" and \\"tedious\\" would sum up this album. The only cool thing is the computerized vocals. All of the musicians, especially the drummer, sound like they just came out of their first instrument lesson. Horrid musicianship. Skip this lame poser metal and listen to 30 Seconds To Mars, new Metallica, Staind, System Of A Down, etc.
B00009W0U4|4.0|This movie is regarded as either redeemable art or as a reprehensible freak show.  That depends whether you think that the filmmaker demonstrated sufficient pathos for Alex, Pierre and Marcus.  Or whether this movie is just a clever gimmick, as an excuse to show relentless cruelty.<br /><br />For me, that answer is yes:  this movie is art, and there is pathos.  For many the answer will be no.<br /><br />I actually watched the second half of the movie (the \\"good\\" half) twice.  It became more poignant and revelatory.  The theme of premonition, and dreaming the future into being, became clearer.  Also, Marcus and Pierre are in a real sense two different parts of the same male soul.  Ironically, their respective roles as savage and intellectual switch at the beginning (chronological end) of the movie.<br /><br />As things unravel and become more chaotic at the party, you can sense these characters' dsscent into hell. It's not as simple as saying that Alex' behavior precipitated the rape.  It's not that simple.  Actually that is not what is being said here at all.<br /><br />Most movies start with order and reason, and then create conflict and pain, only to return back to order and reason again.  This movie says the exact opposite:  That love and goodness dwell on a fragile island surrounded by pain and evil.  The final camera shot that spins out of control, with a disturbing flashing and throbbing buzzing, reminds us that all is madness outside of love.
B000002UJQ|1.0|Hey I think the loser 19 year old college student at the record store called and wanted his album back LOL! This album is probably the most overrated thing I've ever heard. I wanted to check it out because Thom Yorke is pretty sexy (lovin' the lazy eye) so I figured that he must make pretty good music because he has a face for MTV. So I listened to it and BOO. This album was, frankly, putrid and one of the worst things I've ever heard. You can't even understand what Thom is whining about! It's really frustrating. The music itself is also dull and boring, they obviously ripped off Slipknot on the song \\"Electioneering\\". Check out Norah Jones, Jewel, Nickelback or Disturbed for some cool tunes.

B000A7Q2DM|5.0|Well, maybe not THE best album ever, but DEFINITELY in my Top 10. Jared Leto is a way better musician than he is an actor! Requiem For A Dream was horrible. He and his bandmates look totally sexy in eyeliner and really know how to rock out. I really FEEL what he's singing about. \\"From Yesterday\\" is an incredible song. They're way better than poser bands like Tool and Nine Inch Nails.
1594201927|3.0|Wow, can Niall Ferguson write like an angel.  Ascent of Money really carries you along, combining great stories with nitty-gritty financial details.  It's even more impressive given that Ferguson seems to churn out at least one book and several articles every year: maybe he doesn't need to sleep.<br /><br />Or maybe he needs to think a little more deeply.  The Ascent of Money is full of fascinating details, and if you don't know anything about finance, it's incredibly informative.  Ferguson probably thinks you DON'T know anything about finance: his first chapter concerns how little Americans do know about it.<br /><br />But if you want to go deeper, then there's not much here.  Ferguson teaches financial history at Harvard, and it's not too much to suspect that he is lifting from his lecture notes, which are interesting but not really substantive.<br /><br />At times, his ideological biases get the better of him.  Ferguson appears to be something of a conservative in this book, and he advised John McCain in the 2008 Presidential campaign.  Fair enough.  But when he takes on progressive thinking, he really falls short.  For example, he notes that east Asian economies grew rapidly after 2000, and thus concludes that Paul Krugman was wrong in his prediction of the return of depressions.  But Krugman didn't quite say that: he said that the growth of international capital flows eroded the \\"Keynesian Compact,\\" making severe recessions more likely.  The point was that we have returned to Depression ECONOMICS, not the Great Depression.<br /><br />Similarly, he dismisses Joseph Stiglitz' critique of the IMF by quoting Kenneth Rogoff's infamous cheap shot \\"open letter\\", which itself distorted Stiglitz' views.  Rogoff ridiculed Stiglitz for allegedly saying that developing countries should run up deficits if they were facing inflationary pressures.  He said nothing of the kind: rather, Stiglitz said that the IMF was forcing developing countries to deflate and bring on recessions when their only problem concerned international monetary speculations.  Many countries forced to austerity had balanced budgets.  And he makes the elementary mistake of claiming that US entitlement programs face collapse by conflating Social Security and Medicare.<br /><br />So you should read this book if you want an excellent and at times bracing narrative of the history of many financial institutions.  The accounts of the Rothschilds and the Napoleonic Wars are alone close to the price of admission.  Few, if any, scholars have the range of Ferguson.  And you'll learn something.  But look at books like the Trillion Dollar Meltdown, or, yes, The Return of Depression Economics if you really want to have an understanding of the current crisis.

0316067601|5.0|If you enjoy stories about Navy SEALs, Special Ops, or just small unit fighting, this is a very worthwhile read.  I'm a spec warfare junky so I've read hundreds of books around the subject.  This is near the top.    The author's description of BUD/S training and hell week are consistent with other accounts.  Despite having read the same general review of SEAL training in other books countless times, his description did not come off as boring or repetitive.  Perhaps it's the extreme nature of the training that always seems to make it interesting but I have to give the author credit for making it personal.    Where this book really sets itself apart from other combat books is the telling of his team's ordeal in the Hindu Kush mountains.  Obviously, the account is unique and only he can tell it, but it goes beyond that.  Mr. Luttrell had me riveted and by the end of the book, quite emotional.  I don't ever get emotional reading a book but this one got to me.    The writing style is interesting.  It's a little choppy -- the writing jumps between thoughts and occasionally gets sidelined with commentary.  However, that's appealing to me in that it seems to be more of the authors direct thoughts and words as opposed to a being a 'scrubbed' tale made more dramatic by a professional writer.  It would be hard to make this account much more dramatic.  Frankly, I can't imagine how Mr. Luttrell survived.    As a warning, Mr. Luttrell does make his political feelings known.  I appreciate that he doesn't go beyond his immediate area of expertise (i.e. he comments on the politicians impact on soldiers and our ability to wage war effectively).   I generally don't like political commentary mixed into these accounts but in this case, I couldn't agree with Mr. Luttrell more.  I'm glad someone is saying it -- particularly someone with as much credibility and first hand knowledge as the author.      As an aside...  I keep a pretty close eye on the news coming out of Afghanistan and Iraqand I can't recall ever seeing this story anywhere else.  Why not??  This one should be retold over and over and over.  It's a great tribute to SEALs, sailors, soldiers and Marines.  It's also the best description I've ever seen of the Pashtun tribes and their traditions of providing shelter to strangers.  It's flattering to everyone but the Taliban or al Qaeda.  Perhaps I just answered my own question...    Bottom line: Buy the book.  You won't be sorry.
0887308589|4.0|The \\"Peter Principle\\" says that competent people are promoted until they reach a job they can't handle, where they stop.  As a result, we are surrounded by once-competent but now-incompetent people (including ourselves).  The Dilbert Principle provides a less optimistic view of organizations: we promote incompetent people to get them away from where the real work is done.  As a result, we are ruled by incompetent managers, who continue to be promoted, and who earn large salaries and stock options.  Competent people at the bottom have to figure out a way to make the organization work, despite management.<br /><br />This book gives us a bunch of Scott Adams' \\"Dilbert Cartoons,\\" stories, short essays, and emails from fans, organized into a bunch of chapters around \\"Business Communication,\\" \\"Performance Reviews,\\" and \\"Swearing.\\"  It's funny, but choppy.<br /><br />Lurking behind all the fun is a serious critique of modern business management.  Adams draws this out in a brief conclusion, where he (seriously) lays out how he'd run a company.  There is Much To Be Learned here.<br /><br />Historians of the future will be shocked by it all.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|This is one of those movies that really hits home. It is a true story about the abolishment of the slave trade in all British Controlled areas in the early 1800's and the struggle of William Wilburforce to be a moral compass to the Parliment. A true story of determination, faith and walking the walk for a man's belief in God and the freedom of all men. John Newman's song is as true today as it was back then.

Angela's Ashes was not what I expected, but from the first few chapters I was pulled in and found this hard to put down.<br /><br />Angela's Ashes is a harsh look at Frank's upbringing and family life.  You'll sympathize with him, you'll root for him, you'll cry for him.<br /><br />I plan to read Tis in the near future.  This book is a MUST READ!  Go out and get it!

031606792X|4.0|Breaking Dawn is my favorite of the Twilight series.  Why??  Because FINALLY, after 1500 some pages read, (from a NON TWEEN might I add, trying to grasp this national obsession), a pay off!  We moved somewhere!!<br /><br />Ok, maybe we all have different opinions on where this book too us, or how creepy certain aspects were, how confusing others were...but at least we got to where we thought we were going from Twilight.  What we were all waiting for, I suspect, at least I was.<br /><br />The ending, pretty satisfying, if there is in fact another book added to the series, I will read it, at this point I feel somewhat invested in the characters to see how this will end.  I just hope that the pace will be akin to this book, and pick up.  I say, well done!  Anything that gets our kids reading, I think is wonderful.  And being honest, while I'm not on the obsession bandwagon, some of my friends are.
B0000068BZ|5.0|This is the only filmed version of the Robin Hood saga that I know of that sticks to the traditional legend and does not offer a new slant on the story. Cast, music, color photography are all like a child's picture book come to life.
B0010V4TZU|5.0|This self-titled debut album quickly became a critics' darling and then just as quickly suffered from a backlash when indie fans decided it was cool not to like it.  Nevermind.

0316168815|5.0|Wow!  There are close to 3,000 reviews already.  That is heartening to see because this is a book that deserves to be read and Alice Sebold is an amazingly good writer!  I loved this book.<br /><br />This novel is about a young girl who is brutally raped and murdered in a field close to her house.  The impact on her family is devastating and  her parents end up separating. The grief is unbearable. Her mother leaves and, interestingly, the grandmother (mother's mother) joins the household to help the father care for the other two children, one girl and one boy.<br /><br />The murdered girl is in a state of limbo.  She sees the unbearable grief of her family and is unable to move on to a different place.  She watches over them, flickering as a light in their lives that they really can't be sure they are experiencing.<br /><br />She watches her murderer, too, observing what he is doing and who he is killing next.  We get to know him through his victim.<br /><br />This is an amazing story of grief and love.  As a clinical social worker and marriage and family therapist, I have given this book to clients with unresolved grief.  It is one of the best books I have ever read about the effects of violence and loss on the family system.
B00127RAJY|4.0|WOW! I am 44 years old and need to lose about  20-25 lbs. I am terrific on the treadmill but  knew I had to do more than that.  I love Biggest Loser and figured I would give  this DVD a chance not knowing what to expect  when I ordered it. I finally tried it this morning.  I don't know how many lbs. her weights are but   I only had 5 and I think I need to pick up 2-3  lb. weights.  I managed to get through Level 1. I felt like I  had to push myself and I did. The only part I  had difficulty with were the push-ups. I felt like my heart rate was up the entire 20 minutes.  I do feel this DVD will be effective if I do it everyday  or even 4-5 times a week.   I sweated and used parts I haven't used  in years. I can't imagine how long it will take  me to get to Level 2...but it all must begin somewhere.  Thanks Jillian!
0156030209|5.0|Wow!  I just noticed that there are close to 2,000 reviews of this book.  I'm glad because this book is amazingly good!<br /><br />It is a story of how the truth of life surpasses fiction any time.  After Pi's boat sinks, he manages to get onto a life raft only to find out that a tiger from the ship is on the raft with him. Pi travels across the world's oceans with this tiger as his companion.  He meets up with sights and scenes so unusual and unheard of that he is disbelieved by others as he tells his tale.<br /><br />During his travels he becomes a more spiritual being. He feels the presence of God as he views the deepest depths and the highest heights of life.<br /><br />This book defies categorization.  It is very well-written and the character of Pi is so well-developed that I often felt I shared the lifeboat with him.  I hated to put the book down so in that sense it is a page-turner.  I can remember all the details though it has been two years since I've read it.  That makes it a memorable piece of literature.<br /><br />I hope that you read this book.  It will be fun, engaging, and you will be enriched.

0930289234|4.0|I'm torn between a 3 and a 4 because frankly, I was sorta engrossed, but sorta bored. The characters are certainly fleshed out and interact interestingly but I never felt it went anywhere. Obviously it appeals to many people. I changed my three to a four because it has struck such a strong chord with so many that the writers have plainly connected with an audience. Ofcourse I was bored with Blade Runner when it first came out, less so with the second watching, less so with the third, and fourth and fifth, etc etc. Maybe it will grow on me.<br /><br />spoiler<br /><br />I liked dr. manhattan but I feel he spoiled the exploration of superheroes as regular people.
B001DJ7PR8|2.0|Woody Allen's best movie in years? Hardly. \\"Vicky Cristina Barcelona\\" is a familiar comedy-drama that coasts on the good will of its actors (notably Oscar winner Pen&eacute;lope Cruz) while offering picture-postcard views of Spain. Despite the change in locale, there's really nothing new under the sun. The pretentious narration might have worked better if spoken by Woody himself. A definite improvement over \\"Scoop\\" but certainly no \\"Match Point.\\"
0143038583|5.0|\\"The Omnivore's Dilemma\\" is an important and thoughtful book. The author, Michael Pollan [...], addresses the topics of food and eating in a unique, unobtrusive and non-judgemental manner.<br /><br />While the topics of food and eating may seem somewhat mundane, Pollan gives life and meaning to these topics such that their influence on life becomes clear in ways that I did not consider before reading this book.<br /><br />[...] I recommend this book to all readers.  The engaging story which sits on top of Pollan's extensive research and historical coverage flows well.<br /><br />This book has changed the manner in which I view the politics, science, marketing and consumption of food.

0321356683|5.0|I am thoroughly enjoying this book and learning a lot in the process.  The author is responsible for many of the successful APIs in the Java language, such as the Collections framework, so he certainly knows what he is talking about.<br /><br />I am still a student but I can relate to some of the things he talks about, and see where I have deviated from his suggestions in the past.  The author is clear to point out why these things are problems in terms of either code reuse, extensibility, type safety, or some other aspect, so even though it wasn't necessarily an issue in the context of a school project, in the real world it certainly might be.<br /><br />The author borrows the format from Scott Meyer's Effective C++ series of books, and it works very well in this context.  While the chapters are logically organized, they are set up in such a way that you do not need to read from start to finish; you can jump around and read the interesting bits at will, and often items in one section of the book refer to later (or earlier) items.<br /><br />Finally, I appreciate that the book explains some of the less well known or understood features of recent versions of Java.  For instance, I had never heard of the annotation feature added, but he goes on to show a great example of how you can use annotations to build a simple test framework for a class.<br /><br />Even if you are not yet a software professional, you owe it to yourself to get a jump start by reading this book.

B001EO748M|3.0|Showtime's second season of the historical soap opera \\"The Tudors\\" is a spectacular sequel to its popular and award-winning first. While season one flashed forward through ten years, the season two stretches out four years worth of history when Henry VIII divorced Katherine of Aragon, married and executed Anne Boleyn, and became engaged to Jane Seymour. The season begins in 1532 before Henry VIII reaches a break through in his \\"Great Matter\\", the annulment of his first marriage to Katherine which had stagnated for six years under the consideration of Pope Clement VII. This season brings new beginnings - new cast members, new characters, new plot lines, all culminating into a tragic, bloody and thrilling conclusion when the season ends with the execution of Anne Boleyn - May 19, 1536. It's a juicy drama adapted from enthralling history.    The second season is predominantly concerned with the rise and fall of Anne Boleyn but also the rise the Anglican schism from the Roman Catholic Church. In this season, Henry VIII turns from a monarch devoted to defending the Church from the likes of Martin Luther to a theologically flexible tyrant. Although the series as a whole gets numerous justified criticisms for propagating historical inaccuracies, most of what the series touches upon regarding the dissolution of the monasteries, the role of the King in the English Church, the pervasive and divisive role religion played in Tudor England is true and very powerfully portrayed. This series and any other drama or historical fiction should never be mistaken for a documentary and \\"The Tudors\\" has never been advertised by its creators as an entirely accurate work of historical scholarship. Therefore, if seeing a man who is brunette, 5'9\\", 31 years old, skinny, with lack of sufficient facial hair playing Henry VIII emotionally disturbs you, than you are probably better off not watching this series at all. (see instead: Keith Michell in \\"[[ASIN:B000EBD9VM The Six Wives of Henry VIII]]\\" or Robert Shaw in \\"[[ASIN:B000LPR6GA A Man for All Seasons (Special Edition)]]\\"). But if you can suspend disbelief and just take \\"The Tudors\\" for what it is, good entertainment, then you will find much to enjoy.    The DVD set of the second season itself, like the first season, disappoints. The special features are meager - two three minute featurettes, one about modern day descendants of Henry VIII which was more random than informative, and one mini documentary of Natalie Dormer visiting the Tower of London and revisiting the last days of Anne Boleyn which was good but has been available on Showtime's website since the season finale aired. There's also cast biographies, photo gallery, free season premiere episodes of Californication and This American Life, as well as additional features which you require internet access to view (premiere of season 3 of Dexter and two episodes of United States of Tara). Other than a Spanish dub there are no additional language or subtitle features, unless your DVD player is equipped for closed captioning there are no subtitles even in English. I would have liked more special features and language/subtitle options and I don't want to have to get on the internet to access them. Some cast or director commentaries would be a major improvement and maybe even an optional historical commentary feature like HBO has for its miniseries [[ASIN:B000WGWQG8 John Adams (HBO Miniseries)]] and [[ASIN:B000FJH4X2 Rome - The Complete First Season]] . \\"The Tudors\\" is presented in widescreen on four discs, unrated but contains nudity, violence, and explicit language. The second season itself gets four stars, but the poor features in the DVD set knocks off one star - THREE STARS.

0316017922|5.0|\\"Outliers\\" is an interesting, meaningful and well-written book.  The stories/vignettes covered by Malcolm Gladwell cast a unique, and often unexpected, light on a wide array of topics, such as education, technology and airplane accidents, among others.<br /><br />A significant portion of the logic and story arc in this book is based upon numbers and mathematics.  This book is enjoyable for a wide audience...despite a logical foundation built on mathematics and statistics, there is no need to understand these topics at a detailed level.<br /><br />For those with an interest in mathematics and statistics, the coverage of a number of topics may raise questions, but this does not interfere with an enjoyment of the material.<br /><br />For those curious about the \\"story of success,\\" this is a fascinating read.  I highly recommend this book to all readers.

This is still an excellent DVD and I'm glad to have it and recommend it to any \\"Floyd\\" fan for their collection. The more I watch it, the more I like it. I think most of those who don't like it aren't willing to get past the technical issues and struggles to digitize this production. To each their own. OK, OK, you can argue that it's not \\"Floyd\\" without Roger Waters. It's too bad he's not with the group here, but he is the one who quit. As far as this DVD goes, all I can say is--- Roger who?
B0000258CK|5.0|Tapestry was the album everyone in my Junior High school owned when it came out.  As I recall it won the Grammy for best album. Nearly 40 years later, it is still a great album, it shouldn't be, but it is. First it is weird that it is probably the only album ever, where a songwriter covered her own songs made famous by other artist \\"Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow?\\" is a great example of why she should do this.<br /><br />The songs new for the album include an homage to a mass murder and lynching (Smack Water Jack) and two very world weary songs (Way over Yonder, and Tapestry). Which give part of the album a somber feel.<br /><br />One song (Where You Lead), Ms. King didn't perform for many years because she felt the message was dated and \\"Anti-Liberated\\" but became a popular TV Theme for Gilmore Girls with a small revamping.<br /><br />\\"Along with Where You Lead\\" is \\"I feel the Earth Move\\", and\\" Natural Woman\\", to give an upbeat balance to some of the Darker songs. Finally, \\"You've got a friend\\" is one of the greatest songs of loyalty ever. Overall this is one of those gems that define an artist and a genre. Tapestry remains one of my favorite albums and has been for most of my life.<br /><br />Highly recommended<br /><br />5*
B001EOQWEO|5.0|Wall-E in parts:    Musicals  If you know me, you'll know that I hate musicals - mostly, not entirely, but musicals are basically not my thing.  The first time I saw Wall-E, was the week the DVD became available for sale.  I promptly bought it (and subsequently bought the 3-disc package through Amazon), because so far I had loved all Pixar product released (I have some issues with Incredibles and Rata-tool, but I mostly love them also).  And, lo and behold, if my heart didn't sink at the beginning of the movie...I went a little cold, and started thinking that Pixar had gone the way of Disney animated films of the 80's and 90's - I thought that Wall-E was going to be adopting the musical format of the parent company.  But nothing could be further from the truth (thankfully).  The musicals and/or musical love/lover concept was injected into the story in the best most imaginative way I could never have imagined.    Story Arc  The story is the reason why I feel Wall-E should have been considered for an Oscar nomination - much more deservedly than Beauty and the Beast.  Because for me, a good story is when the main character's journey is really and truly well told, and when you can palpably see the evolution and or growth of one or more characters - one palpable moment is the scene where Wall-E is busted up pretty badly, he gives Eve the plant and says \\"Directive.\\"  Not only do you actually see Eve's growth and transformation into an emotional being, but Wall-E persists and reveals for her the grander and mor important ultimate \\"Directive\\" of going back to Earth.  I compare this with the growth and transformation of two sisters in Sense and Sensibility (Emma taking the cake with her virtual climax of emotion near the end), and Amy Adams in Enchanted when she convulsively realized that she is capable of feeling anger (that scene made the movie worthwhile for me).  Animation  Hayao Miyazaki is a master animation director and most of the Pixar directors are master animationdirectors (I will include John Kricfalusi, Tex Avery, Bob Clampett, and Hannah & Barbera to the master animation director category - I'm sure there are others, but their names escape me right now).  I believe that a sure-fire way to make fluid animation look crappy and ultimately turn out lousy is by doing a formula or format type of animation direction. I've come to loathe and practically convulse when watching characters make strange and unnecessary emotive motions, hand movements and gestures - if you know Futurama, it is probably the type of motion that Harold Zoid would actually like.  The joy of joys for me in animation, are moments like in Ren & Stimpy where a lot of their emoting is done mostly with their eyes, but then Stimpy manages to anger Ren and all hell breaks loose.  One might wonder why directors, if they truly want to take their craft seriously, can't see how the drama is intensified when things are mostly static and motionless until the moment is right and everything goes wild - or just the mere fact that if you were to see the same movements that you see in a lot of animation, translated to live action, you might think that there was some sort of weird Ed Wood revival of directing going on or something.  Bob movements.  I hate bob movements of meaningless, head, hands, arms, and body motion.  Andrew Stanton has just about perfected the elimination of bob movements in animation with his work in Wall-E (the same can not be said for the Rat-a-tool guy).    Animation studios  Of course, I don't hate everything that comes out of Dreamworks animation, but as far as I'm concerned, Katzenberg is heavily involved with a lot of what I hate in modern animation.  I'm talking about formulas and forcing every single gwad-lovin' animation feature idea into a musical format...did I mention that I hate musicals (for the most part)?  It doesn't stop there though.  There's something about using or misusing pop-references (in all movies, not just animation).  The way that a lot of studios use pop-references (including Disney and Dreamworks) pretty much guarantees that the particular film will become dated, and not a timeless classic.  And not only does the film become dated, but I hate that feeling when I get into a movie and try to loose myself in the film's fantasy, but all of a sudden I get the cold-water-splash of a pop-reference that lets me know it's only a movie.  I mean, how can I loose myself in a film, when the characters start quoting popular movies or making reference to the Terminator or something similar.  To me that's like the pin-prick popping the balloon.  There's hope though, I think, because I feel the Madagascar movies and Kung Fu Panda had some great stuff in them.  I pretty much hate all their other stuff.  It really broke my heart to see all those beautifully designed Aardman characters move in those god-awful bob movements that Nick Park would never do...well, I guess I would add Chicken Run and Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit to the love category, although I don't strictly consider those 2 films as Dreamworks movies.  Plus, add to the \\"there's hope\\" in animation, the movie Happy Feet from Warner Bro's.  A moment to shed a single tear for the death of trad/drawn feature animation in the U.S....  But anyway, in my opinion, Wall-E re-certified Pixar, as the top feature animation studio in the U.S.

0321525655|4.0|\\"Presentation Zen\\" is a good book on presentation design.  Garr Reynolds covers a number of general principles to take into consideration to improve a presentation.<br /><br />This book is not prescriptive, which I found refreshing...it does not answer questions such as, \\"what template should I use for a sales presentation?\\"  Instead, Reynolds covers general design principles, such as the value of utilizing images as opposed to reams of small text on a slide.<br /><br />If you deliver presentations, this is a good reference for general design principles.
B000002B30|3.0|I'd never known much about Springsteen so I decided to buy one of his CD's because of all the hype about him doing the Super Bowl.  I got a recommendation from my BIL (who has seen Bruce in concert a zillion times) to start with this CD.  It was ok, but I would not buy anything else Bruce did.  I guess he's just not for me.    I couldn't understand all the lyrics and the music seemed somewhat trite at times.  He does display enormous energy.
B0013FXWU6|3.0|When There Will Be Blood came out I was very interested in seeing it. My family was involved in the oil industry in one way or another from 1959 to 1987. One of the first places the film names is Signal Hill in Long Beach CA where my mother was a dispatcher for many years, and my father was a scientist that developed the project to inject steam into the tar in Yorba Linda Ca, that was later adopted to Kern County and other places that provide a majority of domestic crude oil. I myself worked for many years on oil rigs in Kern County (Oildale, Belridge, Taft etc. until my last day when I nearly lost my hand in '87) So.... I thought a film about the early days of California's oil industry would be fascinating.<br /><br />But here is the deal,<br />Every character in the film is  so narcissistic and amoral that the great acting and stunning cinematography was just wasted. I didn't care about any of the characters in the story (with the exception of the wife of the son) enough to enjoy the film at all.<br /><br />So if you want a movie that is well acted, and well filmed, but is unmoving and dull with an annoying soundtrack, this is for you. Otherwise, find something a bit more upbeat.<br /><br />2 1/2*
B000JK8OYU|5.0|after seeing all the stuff on tv and hype about the show, i figured the show would be overdone and ruin the best music ever written like everything else---but i actually liked the show. yeah the song mixes annoyed me a little, but you have to take it for what it is. its for a show obviously... and the show wasnt disrespectful or flakey. My fave was \\"here comes the sun\\", such a nice part in the show.  i was glad i saw it while in vegas, ide definatly see it again...maybe twice... even though the show made me sad. just knowing what we have lost and whats in the past, never to be duplicated. wishing john and george were still here and still playing. i grew up with the beatles playing in my apartment everyday by my dad... its the soundtrack to my childhood(im 33 now).  if i had a few wishes one of them would be to experience beatle-mania and hang with the beatles ofcourse...oh and that john's killer be stillborn at birth.  but anyway, im gonna get this CD BUT ide recommend just seeing the show in vegas.  maybe see it 2 times --its the best show there now.

B0017ANAZO|2.0|I do not like gimmicks.  Here is a movie where the main plot is about a cheating husband.  However, the dude never appears.  It is a cute little gimmick but it destroys all of the drama.  The acting is very good, the cast is all-star but the net effect is boredom.  The musical score is basically non-existent.  Whatever you do, do not buy this movie without renting it first.  I rented it at our neighborhood supermarket for a dollar.  That is all it is worth.
B0017ANAZO|2.0|AARP proudly presents.... (just kidding)<br /><br />Anyway, I like female oriented films. And I definitely love Eva Mendes. But, all the other women of this film were really too old to me to be able to embrace as an enjoyable film about women. Even Meg Ryan has lost her appeal to me and yet she is younger than me. I've always thought Jada Pinkett Smith was hot, but in this film, playing a bad-tempered lesbian kinda put me off. I've never understood the appeal of Debra Messing even when she was younger, and I've seen Annette Benning in a few films, either mature themed (The American President), or just in bad taste (American Beauty), so seeing her again (and older), just didn't capture my appeal very well. We never did see Meg Ryan's husband in this film. So, since no character development of him could be established, I guess it's easy to just make him the \\"bad guy\\" in this failing marriage. Meg Ryan even showed that she was too busy to help her own daughter with a school project so I had no pity for her role even if her husband did find a young hottie (like Eva Mendes) to fulfill the emptiness in his life. A neglected husband (or even a neglected wife) can easily stray towards someone who also needs some temporary affection. And, if a man's got money, there's no reason to resist temptation. I've heard it said: \\"A man is only as loyal as his options.\\"<br /><br />For the age of these women who make up the star cast, even Bette Midler, Carrie Fisher, and Candice Bergen aren't all that much older than the main cast. If they needed an older woman in here for some kind of elderly influence, they really needed to seek out a silver screen dinosaur. That's where we get Cloris Leachman. For all we know, she could have been in the original 1939 version.<br /><br />This movie's appeal is right there between \\"Designing Women\\" and \\"The Golden Girls\\". Anyway, I saw it, and I wasn't too impressed, probably because I'm still too young to relate to any of these women's problems. They were all rather old, cold, and shallow. Of these women, what man could possibly be proud to say: \\"This is my wife!\\" ? Not me. I couldn't care about anybody in this film, and I tried. No wait, I did like Eva Mendes. No doubt about that! She gave the movie some hope, and represented the closest you're gonna get for the man to have anything to support his inevitable desire to stray.<br /><br />So, if you're someone over the age of 60, this film is probably for you. However, if you are a younger male and if you want a good fun \\"babefest\\" film, watch \\"Chasing Papi\\", \\"B!tch Slap!\\", \\"Man of the House\\", \\"So Close\\", \\"D.E.B.S.\\", \\"D.O.A.\\", \\"Cloud 9\\", \\"Alfie\\" (with Jude Law), or even \\"Bride and Prejudice\\" (the one with Aishwarya Rai).were all rather old, cold, and shallow.

0765318741|3.0|Though the first half of this book was very good, I was definitely disappointed that only the first half of the book was actually 'I Am Legend'.  There wasn't anything indicating that the book was written this way. It took me a while to realize that the last half had nothing to do with the first half because I haven't seen the movie yet.  I just kept thinking \\"what is going on?\\"  I also was quite disappointed in the short stories at the end too and don't think they should have been there.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|The BBC/A&E production of Jane Austin's Persuation is a masterpiece (perhaps the reason it was shown in America by Masterpiece Theater) that should not be overlooked or left unseen.  Persuation is one of Austin's best works, surpassed only by her Pride and Prejudice (her coup de grace of any idea that only men could write great literature).  Unlike Pride and Prejudice, Persuation starts a little slow, which may cause viewers to think about turning it off -- Don't!  The ending is well worth the early wait, which establishes the setting and circumstances that the latter romantic comedy, the play of misunderstanding and morals depends.  Stay the course -- it will reward you well enough that you will return and watch Austin's work again and again.
B001TH16DS|5.0|You know us Trekkies will all have to pony up and buy it so you might as well do it. This will have the best available re-mastered AND original versions of season 1. Hopefully, season 2 & 3 are coming soon. I have been waiting for this moment since HD-DVD tanked and my order is already placed to Amazon. Best price around!  At about $2.75 an episode, it is a steal considering what the original remastered sets were sold at. These original re-mastered sets had only one HD season and 2 seasons in SD!.  TOS was the first Star Trek and still the best. Just order it and enjoy.
