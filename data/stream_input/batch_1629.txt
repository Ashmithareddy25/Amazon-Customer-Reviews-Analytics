B008Z9YGEE|4.0|Good movie, but very dark background. Wasn't completely brought to the forefront, but it was there. Come on, you have kids ages from 12 to 18 battle to the death as a \\"form of control.\\" Not exactly a kid-friendly movie, in my opinion.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I am enjoying reading this book. I think it's better than the first one. This book let's you see the more sensitive side of Christian Grey.  Hopefully the last book will be the ultimate love story. I can't wait to read it!
B00845MRKE|5.0|Purchased the BR 30th Anniversary box...this is the 1st Sci-fi movie that I was old enough to appreciate upon 1st viewing...and one that I was truly engrossed with, and impacted by. Let it mean to you what it means to you. But for me it said so much about life and finality and love...I dunno...hard to put into words the I felt watching it...I can't wait until my kids are old enough to watch it and talk about it...<br /><br />Anyhoo...I don't have it yet, but I anxiously await its arrival so I can relive it in Blu-ray...
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I really enjoy Fishdom.  I have the free version and play often.  I just wish it was less expensive.  $4.99 is a lot for a Kindle game.  I would pay $1.99, but not what they are asking.  I find it relaxing and I like building the tanks.  Would recommend.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|My daughter (who turned me onto the books) had to have this (after seeing it 3 times in the theatre). I do think the movie nailed the casting (Katniss and Haymitch in particular).<br /><br />In regards to the BR version...This is one of the 1st movies where I didn't notice a big difference between the DVD and the BR (not sure if that says more about the quality of the DVD or the the BR).<br /><br />It's not bad...My kids are glad we have it...Plus, it allowed us to stream it on the release date...
B006MPKAOI|2.0|I read a review of this book which said that the author was acclaimed widely as a new auther.  I have been rather bored by it though.  It features alternating chapters concerning two stories which eventually merge - but it just goes on and on and on. It could have been half the length and still told the story.  It also features an annoying tendency to NOT capitalise proper nouns - people's names and place names ... but perhaps that's just OCD on my part?
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I can't get into this too much, as I have not personally read this book. What I do know, and can speak to, is the fact that my daughters librarian raved about this book and it counted for \\"2\\" on her required reading list (there are 2 of the motivating factors into my daughters choosing of this book). That aside, she's tole me that she's glad she chose it, because it's \\"...a really cool story\\", \\"...kinda creepy, but you want to keep reading...\\"<br /><br />Take this 3rd hand review, and do w/ it what you will...\\"some guy on the internet's, daughters, librarian said...\\"
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Not a bad read.  There is actually an interesting story between all the sex going on.  I'm interested to see how the story ends.  I'll definitely be reading the other two books.
B004742Y40|4.0|My daughter has been watching the Teen Wolf on MTV and I thought I'd show her what the original was all about...She said it was kinda hokie (hard to argue), but that she thought it was cool and she liked that there we \\"minor\\" hommages in the NEW one to the OLD one...
B0087HT36U|4.0|this game is relatively good. it has enough realism to make sense but its not too much. you should get it.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|After being an avid reader into my twenties, I went the next 2 decades w/o ever REALLY reading a book cover-to-cover (hard and sad to admit that), or at least one that wasn't a school assignment or training/study guide.<br />HOWEVER, this book lubed the cogs, and broke down whatever barrier had been built. Since I finished this the second time, I ALWAYS have a book I'm reading (A Song of Ice & Fire series, ATM)<br /><br />This is a super fast read. So much different style and voice vs other books (short stories, articles, etc...) I've read in the past, I couldn't put it down. In fact, it's the only book I've ever finished and immediately re-read.<br /><br />Not all of the \\"interviews\\" are winners, but SO MANY are, and so many characters are deep, and well constructed and real feeling and dramatic that the words fly by. I loved it. I have the HC and the kindle version so I can jump back into it whenever I want. I honestly may end up reading this 5 times before my days are done, that's how much I enjoyed reading this.<br /><br />On another note: I'm cautiously optimistic that the movie may not stink.
B0088WGBC8|5.0|Anything with Denzel Washington in it is great. It was not his best but that is better than all the others. The photography was amazing but I am trying to remember the plot and right now it was not strong enough for me to remember.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|After reading Book One of Fifty Shades I formed an opinion that the book was simply a Harelquin romance written with explicit and erotic language/scenes. Character development is weak beyond Ana and Christian, the plot is predictable and not much suspense (until the last chapter). The one redeeming feature was the sense of humour wound throughout the book, particularly in the email exchanges between Christian and Ana. Book Two was more of the same. All this being said, I am conflicted. I wanted to read Book Two to explore the next chapter in the saga and after Book Two have purchased and reading Book Three. Go figure...<br /><br />Bottomline, if you enjoy high quality fiction characterized by strong character development and a complex tale, Fifty Shades is not for you. However, if you enjoy television soaps like Revenge and Desperate Housewives and secretly keep a copy of Penthouse Forum under your mattress the Trilogy is for you!
B003QS9WIE|3.0|This movie was ok. A lot of people gave it great reviews so i decided to rent it. I would say the story line is very interesting, but when you find out what actually happens it was stupid.  Someone said that this movie was better than The Illusionist so that was the other reason I rented this movie.  It is similar to The Illusionist because both men are magicians and there is some suspense. Overall, I thought it was about revenge, and had a hateful ending. The Illusionist is WAY BETTER!!
B0063B2BNE|4.0|This season was a bit uneven, with some high moments and low moments, but in all the 13 episodes continue the story of Brennan and Booth forward. Obviously, the shortened season resulted in a few things feeling a little bit rushed, but that's the nature of it. That happened to season 3 as well.<br /><br />Some of the episodes were truly off the wall, but what do you expect? Normal murders don't get a forensic anthropologist, do they?<br /><br />And then there's the way the season ended, with Booth watching Brennan drive off with their daughter. Not a happy moment. Not at all!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|There is magic from page one to the end.<br />Erin Morgenstern is a wonderful writer with<br />a magnificent choice of ideas and words to<br />back up the author's imagination. Great<br />Reading.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Was not expecting to enjoy this tale because I am usually not interested in hiking stories, but this book was very engaging from the first page!  It was easy to read and pages turned very quickly!  The descriptions of the PCT were very interesting and made me want to see it for myself!
B008XBCJ34|1.0|i truly despised this movie when i saw it in the theaters.<br />it's completely cliche... and RATHER offensive. american white male saves primitive jungle folk. boooo! i'm done.<br />the visuals were amazing... but isn't this like the 5th time this movie has been released on Bluray in a different incarnation. GIVE IT A BREAK!!!!!! IT WASN'T GOOD THE FIRST TIME!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very well written.  I knew very little about these brave men and now have a tremendous respect for them.  Again our superficial president didn't follow thru with the promised \\"beer at the residence\\". But I think they preferred it that way.  Loved the book for it humility, it's strength of character and  general education for those of us uninformed of the life of a seal. No Easy Day; The Firsthand Account of the Mission That  Killed Osama Bin Laden, will be recommended to all my friends.
B001VNB54A|5.0|THe gretest historical War movie ever produced. Realistic and based in true stories. A must have for History buffs!I have read the books that the movie was based on, and this movie reflect the sacrifices and horrors of the War in the Pacific. I highly recommend it.
B007SNMYNS|5.0|This book written by a Doctor is trying to wake us up to the truth. I only hope Wheat Belly will receive the followers it deserves. My journey to a health way of life has been long and at he age of 67 there have been many subjects and items that have peaked my interest and this was one of the best and it made so much sense. All we need now is the courage to put it to the test. I have been following the wheat free direction it is indicating and have seen the truth for myself. Thank you Dr Davis for all your research and hard work. Now lets see who amoung us is not afraid to learn and practice a healthier way to live. I see every day on TV and read in the papers how obese we are getting. What I don't understand is why is the Government still advocating the food triangle that is leading us in the wrong direction. Let's wake up together, read the book and make a conscious effort to see where it leads us.<br />To our good health.<br />Bill
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This was a well writen book,could not put it down,it made you feel like you were in it and was impossable to second guess.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|The Walking Dead is a surprisingly interesting show! I say this because I don't usually enjoy a show with so much graphic violence. And this show does have that, albeit is usually \\"zombie\\" slaughtering! That being said, my husband and I come back to it every week! I believe the real draw is the message that comes through regarding the human condition. How far would any of us go to protect our own??? Can't wait for Season 3!!!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|this is an easy book to read..think the author gave us that inside look at some of the exciting things our servicemen do....probably need to say thanks for all that you do on the job and thanks for writing about it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and learning the truth about how the OBL raid actually occurred made it so real. I admire the courage of the author in light of the fact that he knew that the book would be frowned upon his comrads in arms.  The author's style makes this book a fast and engrossing read!
B00881VLCE|5.0|this is a very relaxing game I enjoy that you can choose how many Leicester you want to play with and if you want to rotate pieces or not. I love doing puzzles and this sure beats having to find missing puzzle pieces
B004XGN8W4|5.0|works great, great sound and picture, fits great inside case and is secure. case seems to be well built, can take console any where and game anywhere as long as you have an AC power hookup. great investment if you game a lot at friends houses and take your console with you.
B006VJMZXY|4.0|If you like mediaeval historial fiction, and are a fan of Philippa Gregory--this is another hit, re Anne Neville, wife of Richard III--he of ill repute.  The characters are well written, and settings well researched, and the tale quite believable.  However, you still don't know whether in the author's opinion, Richard III was responsible for the deaths or disappearances of his two nephews,  (the princes in the Tower).
B000KE5JDY|5.0|I like the stories Jane Eyre wrote, and the films that came after. This depiction of this part of Jane Eyre's life is very well done and very interesting.
B005NKGEP2|3.0|I found this book to be hard to follow, the writer was all over the place.  She skipped around between places in time and actual places.  The idea of the book I found to be quite interesting but I had to force myself to actually finish this book!
B004H4XAXO|5.0|Yarr maties, by my reckoning this do be a fine piece of work, truely keeping to Mr Sandersons high standards of work. I do recommend you give it a read, if ye be literate. Yarr.
B005FPT51K|3.0|UPDATE #2:  Another software update has improved the two way voice. Not perfect, but getting better.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Latest software update has fixed most of the problems with the app (still some issues with two way voice).  Still not five star, but a good product as long as they keep the software working.  Also, after my initial support email response, I got another email from an executive with the company apologizing for the issues and promising a resolution soon. She also followed up with me numerous times, including making sure the new update solved my problems.<br /><br />While I know this is technically a review of the camera, the camera is useless without the software, and the software is absolutely terrible.  The camera is excellent.  The quality of the picture is excellent.  The software is, quite simply, awful.  With the latest release of the iOS (iPhone/iPad) software, the app either shuts down or freezes within a few seconds.  I am not to the point where I know I cannot trust it at all without completely shutting it down and restarting it.  The two way voice is really a crap shoot.  Works sometimes, others all you can hear is feedback.  I bought this product after reading some of the same reviews about the software.  I was hoping they were wrong; they were not.  I contacted their support group via email and all I got was a standard \\"thanks for your time, our technicians are working on it.\\"  Although the ability to move the camera with your phone is nice, I really wish I had spent the extra $100 for the Withings product.  Do yourself a favor and stay away from this product until they fix the software.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|This book was for a book discussion club selection.  Since I prefer non=fiction, this book was not a favorite selection.  Although I was wrong about the murder plot, the emd was no surprise.  I guessed the outcome long before.  This was a book I COULD put down.
B000HEVZ6W|3.0|The movie was intriguing in theme.  It would've been stronger with less narration.<br />It was visually and conceptually interesting.  The deleted scenes helped me understand<br />some of the plot.  Ernest Borgnine's part suffered from the deletions.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was the best book. I am starting the series all over. This is one of the best books ever.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|it was good. nice graphic. the game play on it is nice. the game does it harder though. overall it was good.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was just plain fun to read.  The characters were perfectly crafted and the format was intriguing.  I preferred reading the first half of this novel, though I enjoyed the entire experience.:-)
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Well written. I could not put it down. Do not start this book late at night if you have to get up early
B006LSZECO|5.0|One of the best books I have read. It is so well written and every chapter has a surprise entity in it. While I did not like the ending, it was one of those books that is hard to put down. I would definately recommend this one.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I can get lost for hours perusing Pinterest. There are so many wonderful ideas on there, I just can't get enough. Love love love Pinterest. Give it a shot.... you will too!
B007KZY1YY|3.0|Somewhat better than the first two with some suspense thrown into it and we were spare the descriptions of \\"ordinary\\" \\"usual \\" sex scenes.
0525953728|5.0|I knew I wanted to read the book as soon as I heard it was written and even more so when I heard that there was different information in the book than what other people knew. The book reads like a Realistic Fiction but with the facts and background that you know it's true. I strongly recommend reading this book no matter how you feel about the political issues with it. You will not be disappointed with it.
B000V63BN6|5.0|I have purchased other compilations of Wonder's works. This is one of the best compilations of Stevie Wonder music I have ever purchased.
B009157BWU|5.0|Enchanting!  This production was so very well done.  The incredible expertise and talent of all involved in the project created a beautifully crafted bird's-eye view into a never-before-seen world.  The \\"story\\", if you will, was superb as it had to have taken form after hours & hours of filming the chimpanzees as they live, love and survive.  \\"Oscar\\" stole my heart from the onset.  I cannot recommend this film in glowing enough words.  It must be seen, felt and enjoyed to capture its glory.
0307960471|5.0|Phantom is another fantastic Harry Hole adventure.  If you are a fan of the Dragon Tattoo series, then you will appreciate Jo Nesbo.  What makes this series great is not only the plot twists and excellent characterizations, but the fact that Harry Hole does not always have clean and simple resolutions to his challenges makes this a little more complex than the average crime novels.  I am a huge fan of Nesbo's and I highly recommend this book.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I like the app. It does work really well. The only thing wrong with it is that it pops up any time you plug in your kindle fire.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pintrest is amazing! My favotits bar is now unclutterd. Its great being able to put all these great ideas in one place.<br />just love it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Very boring reading, the story takes to long to go any where.<br />Who wants to read over and over about all Ana's orgasm.<br />Once in a while is ok but all the time is to much.  I have<br />read 57% and it has'nt gotten any better.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest and all the interesting ideas, recipes, funny jokes etc. that are on there.  I was happy when an app was developed and use it frequently.  If you enjoy Pinterest I think you will be happy with the app.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I enjoyed this book.  It was well written and gave a perspective not seen in the national and government media reports of this incident. I would recommend this book.
B003TXS5AC|5.0|Only a vinyl record could be a memory like that.<br />Wonderful Iron maiden<br />Hope anxiously new picture disc to be released soon
B00932A2MC|2.0|I have always enjoyed Neeson's characters.  If it wasn't for him this movie would get 1 star.  Formula \\"screw off officer\\" evolving into a \\"hero\\" is just too overused.  I even skipped some of this.  Give us some more intellect please.
B008XG1X18|1.0|I love pinterest but the app for the kindle fire is horrible. only works 25% of the time. please fix
B005ZC0SYQ|5.0|About the Movie:<br />When I was 19 years old, I saw The Crow at the theater with my mother.  It... Was... Epic!  We both really liked it a lot and I became a fan for life.  I was deeply saddened that Brandon had died due to an accident with the prop guns, he was such a wonderful actor and a really nice guy.  But this movie was probably his best work, and the irony of the story and how he died was not lost on a lot of fans.  Among the Goth set, it became a cult classic pretty much as soon as it hit the theaters and I purchased a VHS copy of the movie as soon as it was released.  I now own it on DVD and on Bluray as well, it is that good.  The sequels were mediocre at best and tried too hard to live up to the original, failing to varying degrees.  If you are a Brandon Lee fan, you must get this movie.  If you are a James O'Barr fan, you must get this movie.  If you are a Goth personality, you must get this movie.  If you love a good dark thriller and revenge movie, you must get this movie.  The acting is well done and the post work for the four scenes that had to be cut together after Brandon's death were well done for their time.  This is 1994 we're talking about, and while CGI and special effects have come a long way in the last 18 years, this was still very well put together for its time and very much well worth an attentive viewing at the very least.  As dark as it was, there was still some humor that was cleverly scattered throughout the movie which kept it from being too dark, yet even the humor was dark, which was very fitting and nicely executed in the script.<br /><br />About the DVD:<br />Disk 1 has an audio commentary track by Producer Jeff Most and Screenwriter John Shirley.  The Special features on disk 2 are pretty cool.  I loved the Behind the Scenes Featurette with interviews of James O'Barr, Brandon Lee, Ernie Hudson, and others gave good insight not only of the movie but of the characters from the actors point of view and the story from an inside point of view.  The Profile of James O'Barr gives a lot of first person insight into his life and how The Crow and Eric Draven came to be.  The three extended scenes are fun to watch, but of the three (The Arcade Bombing, The Funboy Fight, and The Shoot-Out at Top Dollar's), I think the Arcade Bombing should have been kept as it was rather than being cut, while cutting the other two down actually benefited them.  There are some pretty cool bits in the Deleted Scenes Montage, and some of the Original Poster Concepts were pretty cool too.  The Production Design Stills and Storyboards look like they came straight out of the graphic novels, so those were fun to see as well.<br /><br />About the Bluray:<br />The Special features on this are the same as on the DVD release except that the audio commentary is done with Director Alex Proyas and the Theatrical Trailer is included, all of it on disk 1.  Disk 2 features a digital copy of the movie.  And like with any Bluray, the video and audio quality is better than on DVD.int of view.

B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was clever and different and fun to read and I'll be recommending it at the library where I work.
B007RI56NY|5.0|Another great album from Train. I love every song from beginning to end! My only regret is that there aren't more songs on the album, but I will always take quality over quantity any day.
B008QZ1ZYQ|3.0|The game starts out good but then gets very frustarting and becomes agverating. Would not play this game ever again
B008MG1E4A|5.0|read it in one day it is an outstanding book with a very unique look at our special forces and how they live would recommend it for everyone !
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app! If you love the website then you will love the app. No problems to report! Download now!
B004J1DBJI|5.0|i have had this app for only two hours and it had made my life easier. College calculus is intense and this app helps immensly. Works wonderfully on my Kindle Fire.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Really thrilling to the end. The ending wasn't as expected. Totally recommended for everyone. Will definitely be one of all -time favorite trilogy
B003FGRVHG|5.0|Great show, Great episode, and Great quality streaming from Amazon.  We watched the episode before this on Netflix, and the quality doesn't even come close to comparing to Amazon.  Awesome! Thank you!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|As a Mitch Albom fan even before his first book I pre-ordered his latest as soon as I was able.  Absolutely well satisfied, knew before the first week was over it would be # 1 in the ratings.  The same hIgh quality is evident as in his previous endeavors.  My only unhappiness comes from the long wait until he is published again.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Easy read, well written, no chest beating or long envolved detail about training.  Just solid factual story of the event and how he evolved to that point.  Has some significant personnal insights.  No Top secrets here. Probably WEB gives away more than this story does.  Military just upset did not get to control.
B007XIC1GI|1.0|What a piece of self indulgent crap. Manson seems like the boy who was beat up often at school and never quite rose above it.
B008XG1X18|2.0|As much potential as this app has,  I had to give it 2 stars. It freezes and forcecloses so much at times that it's unusable. It seems to experience a lot of problems at startup as well. I guess I just have to stick with using the site instead. Major disappointment with this one.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|It has been a long time since I got surprised at an ending. Great action and storyline and I was delighted to see hardly any cursing and no sex scenes. A little gory for kids but thoroughly enjoyed the chase. This one is worth a part 2.
B000ICRKLM|5.0|Stargate Atlantis in my opinion is the best of the SG franchise.  The characters are excellent...lots of action, wit and even wisdom!
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|Great writing!  Very quick read!  Had started years ago and knew the story but wanted to read it.  John Steinbeck does great character development!
B00633W614|5.0|This second book  in the series was  very good.  Did not like the ending, but more must be coming.<br /><br />Despite my  numerous complaints you have billed me twice for this book and now the  proof is in this email that shows the same book two times ofr review.<br />I think amazon customer service is as bad as it can be.......maybe even worse than that<br /><br />2 hours speaking with  persons in Costa Rica, Phillipines and  God knows where else left me unhappy
B00112GVFO|4.0|Without a doubt one of the best action movies around.  Good plot, good acting and no gratuitous sex scenes.  Follows a nice clean formula.  Kind of movie you can enjoy with the family but which also has some substance.
B003PTP4S6|5.0|Stumbled across Yo-Yo Ma on a morning news show playing a selection from this CD. It made an impression, yet I forgot about it and stumbled across the CD at a listening station, somwhere, waay back then. As I listened through a stereo headset, the beauty of the music nearly brought me to tears. This music moves me to this day!!! Yo-Yo Ma's spin on these old show tunes (The Mission, Cinema Paradiso, Malena, and others) by famed Italian compser/conductor Ennio Morricone is SUBLIMELY BEAUTIFUL!!! If you are longing for some soothing and majestic music... let Yo-Yo Ma and Ennio Morricone move YOU!
B0091XRTTM|3.0|This movie was mildly entertaining, not really all that funny.<br />It was different than I expected, the preview made it look like a hilarious laugh out loud during the entire movie funny.<br />It was more of a entertaining adventure story than a funny story.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I have played a few mystery games on my fire and so far this one is the best. Can not wait for part 2. Great job!!!
B005FFW46S|5.0|I'm a Terry Pratchett fan so you'll have to accept the obvious bias but it's definitely one of his best.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Poor writing and no plot. There is nothing to make you care about the characters.<br />The entire book is about getting the girl into S&M. I am not a prude but the sex is way too explicit and not necessary (unless this is the whole point of the book).<br />Sorry I spent the money to buy this and worse yet, wasted my time to read most of it. I could not finish it because I just didn't care what happens.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love how she loved him through his issues. We all have them. Love is a powerful thing! I enjoyed reading the trilogy
B007FG9LIE|4.0|This book was suspensefull and I could not put it down.  It was thrilling and kept me interested in the story linr. The end of the book was spine tingling. I will keep reading books by Blake Crouch.  I would recommend this book.
B005KELWJY|5.0|After reading probably every set of reviews for every Kindle cover, I decided to give this one a try.  I'm really, really glad that I did.  It's super light, and the little pocket on the inside of the cover flap is really convenient.  At first, I really wanted Amazon's case with the built in light, but I read about all kinds of issues with that light, so I figured I'd just buy a separate light with the folio and still save some money.  I definitely did, and it's nice that I just have the Kindle Touch when I don't need a light.  Perhaps my favorite feature on this folio is that if you fold back the front cover, the magnetized tab on the side will hold the cover in place so that it's not flapping around while you're trying to read.  I don't know whether that was intentional on Belkin's part, but it works, and I'm glad.<br /><br />To accompany this case, I bought one of the Verso clip-on lights, which works just fine with this case.  It's also light as a feather, making the entire setup still pretty weightless.  I'm really glad I went this route instead of getting the built-in light case.
B008YRVW0I|4.0|I really enjoy the game.  you can play as long as you like.  I noticed though that after I got up over level 100 it started to freeze my screen.  Still I highly recommend this game.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|George RR Martin is a genius.  Always leaves you wanting more.  I could not believe that I would have to wait another year or two for the next book.<br />Hurry George!!!!
B007JM4CWY|4.0|I had never heard of these sort of puzzles before I picked up CrossMe Color as Amazon's FAOTD.  When I played that and liked it I decided to get the original.  The fame is somewhat pricey at $4.99, but it was wozrth it to me.  The game involves filling in squares based on clues about the number of filled squares for the columns and rows.  You use logic and deduction to fill in the squares to reveal the picture.  If you like logic type puzzles, then this game may be right for you.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Clear and easy to read. And as mentioned by other reviewers, the last value calculated is kept displayed. well worth the money and highly recommended
B000FBJHEO|5.0|Great book! I enjoy his writing and thought the movie was very much in line with the book. This is one instance where you do need to read the book before the movie
B0061S073A|4.0|This is good for Kindle Fire owners who don't want their kids reading books.  (Keep 'em playing video games, so they can develop better hand-eye coordination, but don't let them near books.  Too dangerous.  They might actually learn stuff and become smarter than you.)<br /><br />There is no way to access the books in a Kindle Fire from the Kids Place home page, but that isn't really the developer's fault, so I'm not going to give this a low rating.  For what it does (i.e., limiting access to apps, web and phone functions), it works well enough, and that would be fine for a smartphone, but it really doesn't work for the Kindle Fire because it's an e-reader that happens to do stuff that Androids do, not a smartphone.<br /><br />The real blame lies with Amazon itself.  You'd think that Amazon would actually have designed the Kindle Fire with a more flexible Parental Control system that makes it possible for only certain apps and certain books to be password-protected or even one that makes it possible to turn of Parental Control without navigating through 500 screens.  I think that would not be hard to program at all!
B008XG1X18|3.0|This app frequently freezes or will not open at all.  Love it when it does work though.  It is easy to manage your pins and boards.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I could not put it down (thanks for making the Kindle so portable)! You would never get the real story from our government. I like how many people took credit for the success of the mission, when only \\"Jen\\" and her hard work for five years paved the road for everyone.
B008MEM24S|4.0|Fun puzzle game. Worth the time and money, but it seemed a little short. Great for fans of Phineas and Ferb.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|This is not a book for everyone as the bizarre yet search for a man's past, is certainly like no other. If you like to travel in and out of the world with a huge gulp of fantasy you will enjoy the trip.
B007W1BLN0|5.0|First of all, Into the Wild has all the makings of a fantastic documentary-esc movie.  Regardless of your views on society, politics, and whatnot.<br /><br />That being said, it's a well-told coming of age story that tracts through the areas of family, loneliness, and, above all, freedom.  The term freedom itself has become quite muddled with propaganda that this type of freedom is as refreshing as the open lands of Alaska.  This beautiful extent of freedom is portrayed from every angle ranging from pure optimism to the coldest of misery.<br /><br />The movie is supremely acted and well thought out.  It may get a bit slow in the middle, and the multiple stories itself can become a bit confusing with the extent of the overlapping, but overall it is a laid-back story of a kid breaking away and embracing his own plan; no matter what.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|As with his other books Albom takes us to a place of reflection and honesty about things we take for granted. His special words  about something we all have \\"time\\" will help you treasure something only humans are concerned about. This is certainly a book to share with those wrapped up in this crazy busy life.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Lots of fun, everyone should try it...even if your not good at drawing, it makes your mind sharpe which is always a good thing.
B001EC2J20|1.0|Not entirely sure you could get more disappointed in a sequel, Caddyshack 2 maybe?  Pretty painful anyway, I had high expectations given the continuation of original cast and director.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Absolutely love angry birds and all versions that are on the market. I must confess I play this game more than my daughter. Even though I have had to restart the game multiple times, I never tire of playing it. The reason for having to redownload has been my error not an issue with the app. Lots of fun and clean entertainment!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|very similar to the arcade style ticket game. lots of fun! I could see it burning a hole in your pocket if u get addicted to coin shopping 8)
B006S8QB2O|5.0|I had seen and liked the movie.  I ordered it as a streaming video and it did very well.  What I loved about the movie was the story of a husband and wife learning about each other after years of marriage.
B002KFGNKE|1.0|This 'version' of \\"From Genesis to Revelation\\" is not complete, but is short four songs available on one of the CD releases I checked.  There is another set available for download that has the whole album plus some bonus tracks, and it can be found at http://www.amazon.com/From-Genesis-To-Revelation/dp/B00491C702/ref=sr_shvl_album_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1348191961&sr=301-2<br /><br />Otherwise, this is one of my favorite Genesis albums, especially the chilling song \\"The Serpent\\".
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is so well written and such a nice easy read. The story is so real but refreshing, I cannot put it down. This has got to be one of THE BEST Nicholas Sparks books EVER!!!  I am so impressed and I don't want it to end. The characters are so real and I found myself caring so much about them.<br /><br />Maybe this story hit so close to home because I was an abused wife. But whatever the reason, the story is VERY well written and VERY real!  Katie is a very brave girl trying to escape an abusive marriage to a cop, of all people.  Thank God she found her \\"Safe Haven\\".
B0027MJU00|4.0|After reading Gillian Flynn's, \\"Gone Girl\\", I was anxious to read other novels from her as well and \\"Dark Places\\" was just as intriguing and suspenseful as the former.  The title is befitting and the story line keeps you guessing about who really committed these heinous, horrific crimes.  It was definelty a \\"Who Did It\\" thriller.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Mitch Albom's books always make me cry. I read this one in one sitting, and it is still with me.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The story line was interesting but it just seemed to drag in a few spots.  In the beginning and then it really drug toward the end.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book is very well written and tells a real and accurate story, unlike what the media tries to sell us. I applaud the need of this Seal to want to give credit to those on his team and to all Seals everywhere.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The book is a well written firsthand account of not just the killing of a terrorist (I refuse to use his name,) but the trying life of being a SEAL. I recommend this book to everyone.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|By the end if the 2nd book you had ideas of what wsd going to happen. ANA had to stop worrying she pissed me off.  She worried about everything and drive Christian ad crazy as Christian drove her with his past.
B008QE9VJI|3.0|I've been a Tim Burton fan since Pee Wee's Big Adventure but I'm now starting to see that half the time he just thinks you absolutely need to end a film with an action sequence, even....Alice in Wonderland. Dark Shadows is no different. The film has a fantastic cast but Johnny Depp as a man cursed to be a vampire and Eva Green (Casino Royale) as the witch that cursed him are the only ones that don't seem bored.<br />  I always found the Addams Family film to be fun despite a thin plot and with Dark Shadows the plot is much thinner and not as near as enjoyable. I only give it a positive review since Burton at least handles the 70's setting well even if he could have done more with it. While Depp is of course ingenious in the lead role. Still, as a Burton film it's his weakest since Planet of the Apes and it would be nice if we got more of the Burton who did greats like BeetleJuice, EdWood, Sleepy Hollow, Big Fish and Sweeny Todd.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I'm not that religious of a person, but reading the background story about Adam and his fighting his drug addiciton demons over and over again was inspiring in that he was able to tackle a lot of his problems through his faith.  What Adam achieved in his life was a worth the telling.
B003VPWXRO|5.0|This book is a gripping read. I was shocked at how familiar her thoughts and beliefs were. The book isn't preachy, braggy, or some sort of pity-party. It's an inside view of a logical step-by-step path toward an eating disorder. That path is littered with all the common lies and misinformation about health and beauty that are fed to all women but it was spurred on by her fear of her true nature and the possible consequences that would occur if that true nature became public. I rarely reread a book. But I would reread this one. Added plus: The tiny glimpses of her life with Ellen are a magical contrast that keep one reading to see how Portia could have possibly gone from where she was to where she is today.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I actually was put off by the trailers for this movie and I thought it was gonna be bad. But, the Chris Gore said this movie had a bad rep from that, but was actually good. So, I gave it a try and it blew my mind. It's sad that there might not be a sequel to this because they didn't market it well. Hollywood makes sequels to all the bad movies and one of the best ones might get overlooked. Come on guys, take me back to Mars.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|The book is OK but seemed to be all over the place and disjointed.  I must admit that as an avid reader of the author I was a bit disappointed in this book.
B006HTUZ1C|4.0|The only thing I have to say is I really, really, really, really this game a whole, whole, whole lot.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is the best book of the three, it had suspense  and more of a story to it than the first two.
B001VIMCW4|5.0|When I first saw this movie in the theater I was less experienced, hadn't seen Casino Royale in years, and didn't really \\"get it\\".  Now, many years later I've grown in understanding and also have very recently seen Casino Royale.  My opinion of the film is practically the opposite of my first impression.<br /><br />*Mild Spoilers ahead*<br /><br />The Illuminati theme to the organization Mr. Greene is with originally felt like a huge cliche, the action was so good it seemed cliche, and that's all I could tell was in the movie.  Now upon revisiting, I see a truck load of character depth I never saw the first time, impressively real-looking action (even though I know it's over the top, it's very well done), and an enemy group who is still larger than life, but only by a margin of reality.<br /><br />Excellent movie, looking forward to Skyfall, and don't let the negative reviews turn you away if you can relate to my review even a little.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great read with unpredictable plot twists. I'm not usually a fan of the mystery genre but I would highly recommend this book.
B000SGSU58|5.0|Michael Connelley is one of the best present day writer of our time.  The Harry Bosh series is my personal favorite.  As for this specific book its my second time reading it.  That in itself say enough.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. I must say that I bought the book just to see what all the fuss was about. I have, however, read many seal memiors (along with other special operations units in other branches) and did not think this book gave any more insight about special operations that other books have. This is a well informative and well written book that gives the reader the general layout of how the operation happened. There is also some background of seal training and the writer himself that sets the story up. This is to be expected. The book shows the tireless effort of countless people who sacrificed an enormous amount of personal time to capture UBL. The men that share the brotherhood of the teams do their job and return back into the shadows. They do not do it for political gain or notoriety. If you enjoyed books like \\"Lone Survivor\\", and \\"American Sniper\\", then you will enjoy this book.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|This is only the second novel I've read by this author, the other being Gone Girl. While I liked this one better, I'm not sure I would rush to read another of hers. The plot is good with enough suspense to keep the story moving, but the characters themselves are odd. Aspects of their personalities are hinted at but not fully revealed leaving the reader wondering if maybe the author wasn't quite sure what she would do as the story unfolded so she left some things \\"open\\"--almost like a bad tv show where they might want to come back around later and have a character reveal or something. None of the characters are particularly likeable, which is ok but gets monotonous after a while. The main character, Camille, has some deep issues which are stated pretty matter of fact. Some might find this ok but I found it uncomfortable having some knowledge of how issues such as self-harming are addressed and how difficult they are to overcome.
B0087HT36U|4.0|good and now I need a few more words to make the limits and fourteen and fifteen. and sixteen done!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The second book was better than the first. It had a good plot. I loved this trilogy. Couldn't put it down.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is great on the Kindle! Very easy to use! I'm addicted and actually prefer to use it on my e-reader now!
B001NLKT60|5.0|This is one of those books you hate to have to put down.  Intrigue all the way.  I can hardly wait to read the others in this series.
B0083EW97W|4.0|Despite the paparazzi and relationship mishaps this album confirms John is not the shallow cad the gossip rags have made him out to be, (though I never read past the headlines).  Born and Raised is a very listenable and introspecttive album from the artist.  Some may complain that it all seems too effortless, but maybe that's just the way it is when you have talent.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|If you have the time, you may read this book in one day.  Laugh, cry, and gain insight into the remarkable, genius of Tina Fey.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Interesting concept.  The ultimate survivalist compound surrounded by electric fences protecting the oblivious.  A fitting end for humans who have no respect for the earth.
B002U9NHBS|4.0|I really like this album.  The song \\"Stuck\\" is reason enough to buy it.  I feel Norah is really breaking boundaries with her music and it is evident here.  I think this record has the best of what we all love about Norah Jones and some ground breaking stuff that is fast becoming her inventive style that is just too cool!
B005HJU7HA|5.0|Excellent. Great buy.  Saves at least 2 linear feet of shelf space in my nearly 300 ft library.  Several stories I do not have in my collection of Doyle books.
B007T2XC7A|5.0|I had the opportunity to see Norah Jones live on her Little Broken Hearts tour. (Great show). I think her new band and collaboration with Danger Mouse has produced an incredible record.<br />It has to be one of the best break up records of all time.  If you like \\"ear worms,\\"  buy this album.  The melodies will go round and round in your head for weeks on end.  I think it is her Sgt. Pepper like work and effort. It is incredibly creative. It breaks the mold of her previous works.  That said, give it a chance.  I promise it will grow and grow on you!
B007STBUIW|5.0|There really is no need to review the movie - so much has already been said.  Given the age of the movie and technology available at the time the movie was originally filmed, the blu-ray print here is superb compared to previously released DVD prints.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very informative and you feel like you are part of the story. It does not take a political stand but it shows the frustration with bureaucratic decision-making.
B003O86FMW|5.0|As an adult (over 50) I very much enjoyed this trilogy.  The writing was sophisticated enough to enjoy an adult yet simple enough for young readers to understand it.  The story was compelling and suspenseful.  Thoroughly enjoyed the read.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The book initially sets the stage about the training and life of a SEAL and includes facts about various SEAL missions leading up to the selection and training for the most important mission ever.  It details specifics about preparation for the mission, the thinking behind the SEALs taking part, the information that led to the raid, and the actual movements and actions taken during the mission.<br /><br />I found the book gripping and could not put it down.  It also served to point out that there are some individuals whose lifestyle is totally unknown to the average US citizen. Thank God there are such individuals willing to protect us.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|As an adult (over 50) I very much enjoyed this trilogy.  The writing was sophisticated enough to enjoy an adult yet simple enough for young readers to understand it.  The story was compelling and suspenseful.  Thoroughly enjoyed the read.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|Love it. I also have the Life Application Study Bible for Kindle and the MacArthur Study Bible for Kindle. The ESV Study Bible for Kindle provides additional perspectives of scripture. It is EXCELLENT.
B007SSEBCU|1.0|I found the movie to be very boring;you made her life seem so small. She was a wonderful lady with amazing accomplishments. Sorry,but you had so much to work with and came up with so little.
B005LAJ1HW|5.0|Boardwalk Empire is a fantastic series.  The DVD comes with loads of commentary and a nice \\"Making Of\\" extra making the DVD worth the price.  Streaming is nice and convenient but the extras are not to be missed.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Not what I expected, however a very rewarding read. Story takes numerous twist and turns guiding the reader into an abyss of moral pain and reward. Reminded me somewhat of the Road.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book is a fascinating look at life as a member of the Navy Seals. With each page, my admiration for these brave warriorers grew. Their selfless sacrifice exemplifies the best of Americans. The story of taking down Bin Laden was straight forward and without political overtones.
B005OP7162|5.0|I sat and watched all of season 1 in 3 days...I couldn't stop...it is fantastic.  Can't wait for season 2 to start
B0090EHVMC|3.0|Not as i expected. Picture quality was not that good. I would not purchase this movie. I would want more out a company.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is wonderful! I didn't think something would come along and beat my interst in youtube or facebook. With this Pinterestkindle app, I am able to post photos of my interests, follow other people and have other people follow me -- similar to twitter and this app makes it easy to use my kindle fire!
B004VMUS9G|1.0|Didn't work for me on multiple levels.  I uninstalled it within about an hour and went looking for another \\"reminder\\" system that would meet my needs.  Not worth the effort from over here in my world.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This work is as complete a story of special ops as has ever existed. Developing the story is done very well, as well as character development, could not have been better done.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|With 32 land escapes, 3 possible enemy, 3 levels of experience, there is plenty to keep tower defenders happy. I have had no problems with this game on my kindle fire. Other than maybe playing to much.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Intriguing description about SEAL training, and how they are conditioned.  Contrary to some reviews of the book prior to distribution, I did not read any secret disclosures that would put anyone in danger. Names have been changed to protect those who were on-the-ground during the operation.  The media, however has divulged the author's name and location which is unconscionable, regardless of the fact that he is no longer a SEAL.  The book clearly shows how dedicated the Special Ops and SEALs are to the mission of defending our country, and who really killed OBL.  Great book!  God bless our military and their families.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|cant get enough of this game. play it till I go to bed and wake up playing this game. love it
B000N8LWHE|5.0|Great performances<br />Great scenery<br />Excellent plot (tried n true)<br />One of the best fight scenes ever<br />Simply the western that set the standard for all others
B001CDZZI6|4.0|Gallup's StrengthFinder assessment is an excellent resource for personal, professional, or corporate team development. Recognizing your top strengths helps free you to optimize how you work and relate, and who you need to bring along side you to complement your lesser talents (what many call weaknesses). I recommend the system highly and it can be accessed by searching for Gallup StrengthFinder where you can purchase an assessment for 9.99, which is cheaper than this book. The book tells you very little more than what is made available to you on the website after you take the assessment. The book comes with a code for an assessment of your top 5 strengths (again, top 5 on gallup is 9.99, all 34 strengths (full profile) is $89). After an introduction, the rest of the book are descriptions of the strengths that are the exact same descriptions on the resource page of the gallup website provided to you after you complete the test. So, unless you really want a hard copy of all the strengths plus the code for the test, buy the book. If you want to save money and get access to the test plus the same resources online, go to the gallup website. 5 Stars for the assessment, 3 stars for a weak book that should be somewhat different from what's available online.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|this book this book is captive and very well written. I had a hard time putting it down. It is a great book about Washington and romantic with fun details.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|goood game! I love playing this! good for long car trips when your starting to get board. just get the game!
B00913DPW2|5.0|Great game. Cant wait for the next one to be out!!!!!! Enjoy playing the puzzles.awesome graphics!! Story line is good.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|Thought the games were dumb. Some games just didn't make sense to me. Didn't make enough points to keep going.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|Contains all the ingredients that make up the perfectly smooth Reacher recipe. Like a properly done Wienerschnitzel. No big surprises and no exotic spices. However a very satisfying meal.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|This is the second in this series and it continues on with Kvothe narrating his life story to the \\"Chronicler\\". I think the author had determined his stride with this one. Can't wait for number 3 to come out.
B008XG1X18|5.0|so glad this is finally on kindle! biggest problem? i prefer pinning to reading, and my pile of books just keeps getting longer!
B0010SKUYM|4.0|Interesting approach. The author tells a story of a man telling his story, which is kind of a mix of Harry Potter and David Copperfield. I enjoyed it so much I bought the second in the series.
B006HTUZ1C|1.0|It's ok as it is graphics-wise. However, the gameplay could be enhanced immensely if only you could: 1) remove all numbers that are touching that add up to the &quot;awesum&quot; by tapping them. 2) include horizontal and not just vertical sums. 3) remove by tapping throughout the game. 4) use more than two numbers to add up to the &quot;awesum&quot;. Then this game could truly be awesome!
B0086700CM|5.0|Most games after a little while of playing I usually get bored, but with temple run I can play this game for hours. So addictive I love this game.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|easy to use interface. nice looking screens. great information. I can set multiple locations so as to monitor the weather in advance of travel or if I just want to see what is going on in my favorite places.
B0052RDHTM|3.0|Had hoped it would be as good as The Pillars of the Earth but was a tad disappointed as it certainly doesn't flow like Pillars.  Fine read nevertheless.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|This is a classic \\"kitchen revelation\\" tale about the truth behind the scenes at your favorite upscale restaurant in NYC.  Often shocking, frightening and hilarious, there is no cover-up here.<br /><br />I suspect that this scene is repeated all over in all level of restaurants---hopefully in a little milder version. The pressure,tension and frenetic pace of a kitchen staff to produce quality food for many diners is a challenge and best done when the staff choreographs their movements. Enjoy this read & hopefully you'll still want to go out for dinner after reading it!
B002Q1YDLI|2.0|Kind of a good book, not as good as Something Borrowed cause everything seems to be so easy to work out, Darcy decides to be good at night and when se wakes up magic is done.
B001F0WXY0|1.0|I'll start by saying that I LOVE the book Dune and have for years.  The story itself is magnificent and should get five stars.  The only reason I'm only giving my review one star is because the Kindle version is so full of typos and formatting errors.  I can't believe I paid so much (more than a print book!) for a Kindle version that is so appallingly badly edited.<br /><br />If this were a physical book, it would never have made it to the printer.  I can't imagine that this version was even proofread.  It's distracting and disruptive, and ruins the flow of the story to be correcting things in my head as I read.<br /><br />Awful.  DO NOT buy the Kindle version.  Save your money and buy a $2 used paperback copy.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|This is the first album I bought for this band and I really love most of the tracks. Great buy!!!
B004XN3FHA|4.0|I have been using this flashlight for a year now under a variety of different situations. Yea we all know the light is bright but im not getting the battery life that was listed on the Fenix website. I'm using eneloop batteries and usually average between 2-5 hours less run time than what is expected. The eneloop batteries I have are all in good shape. The other small complaint I have is that the battery holder is flimsy and I have to tape the batteries in. Would I buy this again, yes especially now the price is coming down but still a 100+ dollar flashlight they should have put more effort into the battery holder.
B0086900TI|4.0|I had never heard of this film before, and being a fan of Adrian Brody over the years i had seen this on Netflix and decided late one night to check it out.  By the first half hour i knew this was going to be a gem that i would recommend.  It has a very strong cast, and is very raw.  Personally i love movies that pull at your heart strings and give you a reality check.  I have now shown and told two friends about this film and they has said nothing but positive things about it as well.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|The second season has quite a few twists and turns we didn't see coming!!  It seems that every episode just gets better and better. My husband and I chose not to watch season three on tv and wait for Amazon to offer it on instant download so we don't have to sit through commercials. As of yet I have found NOTHING on television that compares to The Walking Dead series- raw drama and intense action make this show a must see and must follow!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|i couldnt stop reading the book. i didnt even want to go to work several times to keep reading. if i had something to do i would have to finish the chapter i was on, but i would just being imagining what was next in the book. buy it!! totally worth it
B008MG1E4A|4.0|As a former special ops diver, it was interesting to read about the amazing training that goes into the world of the SEALS. I enjoyed this book immensely.
B0036SUQWA|4.0|This film gathered a great cast and created a Coen Brothers-like satire that left me laughing at the jokes for several days. If you like Joseph Heller or Kurt Vonnegut or even Pynchon, you will love this offbeat comedy. The acting is great and the story hangs together to make fun of the very idea of military men knowing anything at all about the world, especially the mystical. Mostly it was just great fun to watch Jeff Bridges and George Cloony do what they do best.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  It's very addicting. The time seems to fly when I am playing it.  The only drawback I see is with the tap and drag function.  I often need to tap and drag another time to get the correct markings.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book was similar to 50 shades but better in my opinion. Once I started reading this I couldn't put the book down. Honestly even if u didn't enjoy 50 shades u just might like this.
B005OP7162|5.0|I loved every minute! It keeps you on the edge of your chair all the time! Can't wait until season 2.
B006LSZECO|5.0|One of the best books i've read in awhile. I can't wait to read another book by Gillian Flynn. I'm very excited to see the movie.
B0096DZKZC|4.0|I didn't buy this version (will do after I get my KF 8.9 in November), but I have the Steam and Xbox version. Big price tag? Totally worth it. The graphics are realistic and absolutely stunning, the gameplay takes me back to playing Sonic all day long as a kid with my friend in the 90's. However, it is probably the hardest Sonic game to date, and that's just at the first zone.<br /><br />The controls are AWFUL by the way, and that's across all platforms. You have to mash too many things just to do an action with Tails. But the thing that will really get you is that the first boss is TERRIFYING and will easily have you waste about 10 lives before you master it because of the different moves you have to do, how many times you have to hit it, and the fact that more legs pop out.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Once I started reading tbis book, I could not put it down. Made you feel as though you were right there.
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|I did not have high expectations for this movie having heard so many negative critic reviews but I found this movie very entertaining and funny at times.  I recommended it to friends and they also enjoyed it. I thought it was very different in how it was presented and had a very interesting ending that pieced everything together.  It turned out to be a feel good movie and very action packed.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|the day i started reading this book, the author was on tv<br />all day.  he more or less told his story in person and<br />for a while i put the book down.  then, after consideration, i continued reading about the methods used<br />to train men into mentally be ready to be put into mortal<br />danger and having the physical ability to carry out their<br />mission.<br />the general public needs to be aware of how much is<br />asked by the government of these people.  i am now aware.<br />there were so many people who prepared the information<br />about this mission. in one case, there was a woman who<br />spent ten years of her life tracking down information and<br />checking every detail. amazing!<br />the author earned his retirement and i hope he can find<br />peace.
B009329ZF2|3.0|I was a bit disappointed with the movie.  The plot was pretty weak and the ending left me scratching my head as they really did not try to offer any explanations as to what had occured.  I will say that the special effects were awesome and maybe that was really just the point of the movie.
B009329ZF2|4.0|Awesome movie 1 of the best ones of the year if you like Transformers you're gonna love this. a little slow starting out but really kicks b*** at the end
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is the 2nd book in the hunger games series. It was great the price on kindle is very reasonable simply awesome.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Adobe reader is always a must have, and never a let down. Mostly use it for school work and works all the time.
B000ICXQXI|5.0|For years now I have been trying to find this movie because I had yet to see it. I heard good things about it, and I love horror movies, especially the classics. But I could never find it in any video store or any other store. That was before I got into Amazon.<br /><br />Now I know this supposed to be a review for the actual movie, but I'm not going to do that. Because, you already know I gave it five stars, so what more is there to tell. JUST KNOW THAT IT WAS WORTH THE PURCHASE. For me...<br /><br />p.s. Norman Bates has become my all time favorite character in the horror genre.
B007W1BLN0|2.0|This is a powerful film, well directed and acted and of course the wild and beautiful scenery of Alaska. The viewer is drawn into this young man's world, albeit reluctantly, as we follow him on his personal journey of discovery and \\"spiritual enlightenment\\". His materialistic parents try to give him all the benefits that life can bestow on him, he rebels and the last straw is when his parents give him a car for his graduation gift. He shuns all of it and I mean all of it. The car, the money ($100 dollar bills that he burns), the home, the chance to interact with society and be a part of his community. He does interact with various people along his journey, but the moment they try to get to know him, he runs away. Hal Holbrook gives a memorable performance and his character wants so much to be a part of this young man's life and they begin to help each other because both are social misfits. He tries to leave the house at 3am or 4am without saying good bye but the old man confronts him and offers to give him a lift north of San Diego to get him on his way.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i got this for y birthday (today) and it is just amazing.i love it. the only i thing that bothers me is that is frezzes every once in a while but thats probably because i droppd my tablet. but good and worth the 6.99$
B008MG1E4A|4.0|No book I read is ever perfect nor any product I buy, and thats why I rated this one 4 stars. Absolute awesome book, I admire the personality This gentleman has and how he felt it was the right thing to do of letting the public know what had really happen on a mission thats so important to the history of this incredibly built country. Profanity isn't always needed and there certainly wasnt more than needed in this story, I personally enjoyed the description of SEALs having legs like gazelle's and no waist because every Ex or active duty SEAL I know also doesn't fit that description. All the details I think at least were right as they should be. I highly recommend this to anybody that wants a good read and more importantly wants to know what really had happened. I have a close friend that is spec ops in teh army and he said that he knows SEALs that were on this raid that said alot of similar things so I know this story isn't BS. May god bless each and every soldier, Spec Ops or not and the idea he gives at the end of this book to donate money to families that have lost children and parents is one of the greatest deeds civilians can do.
B0017SWPXY|1.0|I can't review it because it was never downloaded to my Kindle.  And I have paid for it.  Don't understand why Amazon can't download it again so I can read it and review it.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|What a great third book in the trilogy. Yet again very entertaining.  Definetely a great ending to the three books and very educating.  I am missing the fifty shades as well as Ana so much after reading the last book and definitely hope EL James will write more books in this genre.  The last book ensures that you read into the early morning hours yet again.  Loved it, and so did my husband;-)
B005IQZB14|4.0|I read this book on the rx. of friends who had read and enjoyed. Both male and female.At first I was not impressed but as the book goes along I finally figured out what motivated her to take this incredalble journey. Pretty awesome that she stuck with it after all the pain and obstacles she endured. I am in total admiration of her bravery and determination to finish the journey. Very well written and factual.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book is great. I could not put it down. Defiantly one of my favorites and I plan on reading it again. The sequel to the book is very good as well.
B008D28HYS|5.0|Love CrossMe Color.  Great way to destress and still excercise your brain. Works great on the Kindle Fire. No problems or bugs.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This author is a wonderful writer! Brings the story to life.  Uses great descriptive words.  Can't wait to read Book 3!!!!!
B00023B1AS|1.0|The video portion was grainy and not the quality that used to be available on Youtube. The editing was bad and unorganized, and the sound was of rotten quality. The whole disc actually only contained parts of about three songs.
B009329ZF2|4.0|Great Movie, not over the top just enough to keep you going. Great effects and story line...Top on my sy-fi list
B0084YCKMU|5.0|Great follow up to season two. Character development continues in a dynamic fashion. The script and story line continue at there sharp, intelligent and witty pace. Don't let the price per episode dissuade you - Each episode in the season could be a stand alone movie (both in production quality and the averaging episode length of an hour and 45 minutes). The only major disappointment.... Season three won't air until summer 2013. Big sad face :(
B00932A6G4|2.0|Did't like it, it was a cartoon not the real thing...I didn't realize it never noticed it on the intro..!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  Didn't realize how Navy Seals trained and executed their missions. It is a shame that their family life is so strained because of their committment to keeping the United States safe.
B006IYG5HE|5.0|Jo Nesbo is officially now on par with Stieg Larrson (in my opinion) as a detailed mystery author.  Redbreast is one in a series of Harry Hole books (I don't know which came first, and know I read Snowman out of sequence).  It is spell binding; a real page-turner.  I am now almost finished with Nemesis and looking forward to moving on to the next in the series.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved the book, it wasn't exactly what I was expecting but it ended up being a really good read. The ending definitely makes you purchase the second book, a real what the heck moment.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|As a fan of farytails, this movie is a treasure. I wold buy this again and will watch it several times.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I gave this to my husband and had it sent to his Kindle. It was a very fast read. He thoroughly enjoyed it and he highly recommends it.  He does not feel that it gave away secrets.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|When I have an overload of stress in my life,which is usually daily,I play Angry Birds. It gives me my escape from reality and a great temporary sense of accomplishment.
B007HNG0ZM|5.0|No problems with streaming at all! I would definately use this service again. Picture Quality was very good and love that I can purchase individual episodes.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I can't say I loved this book because I was so appalled, angry and sad alot of the time. The survival of Jaycee was uplifting. This was a interesting read. All I can say is that while I don't believe in taking a life, I will make an exception in the case of Phillip and Nancy Garrido.
B008458O3S|5.0|I loved this game. It starts off relatively easy but ramps up significantly. I am stuck on a few of the bonus levels but I enjoy the challenge.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|does not follow series.<br />Author missed the boat on this continued saga. It is an attempt to sell more in the series. Last one I purchase.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|We have downloaded this onto a galaxy tablet, droid phone, galaxy s3 phone, 2 kindle fires.  This app gets used everyday.
B0081KTI0E|5.0|My daughter and I just loved watching this move. One of the best we've seen in a long time.<br />The Woman in Black is good at keeping you on the edge of your seat it leaves wondering whats next to scare the crap out of you LOL.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Not much to say...I get a lot of ideas for fashion, food, and home decor, plus I have found great blogs and products through it.
B008WU02HG|5.0|Exiles at the Bay: The Best of Man&aacute; is a great album for those who like Man&aacute; but don't know where to start. It has a lot of classics from them and even a cover of a Juan Gabriel song \\"Hasta Que Te Conoc&iacute;\\" (\\"Until I Met You\\").
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The best thing about this book was it was in no way political.  It told the honest to goodness story of the Navy Seals, other military groups and the brilliant and dedicated CIA Analyst who pinpointed with accuracy Osama's hiding place.  Mark Owens does a great job of describing the rigorous training of the seals and the honor among them.  Without fanfare and fluff he describes exactly what happened at the compound from the helicopter going down to the successful killing of Osama.  He acknowledges that President Obama was the person who happened to be the sitting President when the killing occurred but in a respectful manner Mark Owens informs that the credit went to those who were there and those behind the scenes who got the team there.  He could not say enough about the expertise of the 50 something year old pilot of the helicopter that went down.  Not to be corny but the \\"Home of the Brave\\" certainly includes these people and these are the people who help us to remain \\"Land of the Free\\".
B008BIN9EW|5.0|I can't get enough of it. The campaign was interesting and the online games are great.<br />Definitely recomanding it to everyone.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|Its well written, but the storyline is very bizzare. It's was not my cup of tea. I did soldier on to the end.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Excellent book written in an easy-flowing manner.  The descriptions and the narrative were all very well written.<br /><br />The story takes the reader from the author's induction into the elite SEAL team 6 up through the historic mission to reactions of the author's family as they figured out who did what.
B009AHWLHE|5.0|Ordered this for my son who's a fan of Resident Evil series.<br />Great CGI, storyline. Not my style, But he says its awesome!!<br />Great transaction!
0385337388|5.0|This book happens to be one of the assigned readings for a class that I am taking.  I was very relieved when it arrived so promptly in the mail!  Thank you so much!
B008XCF7Y6|5.0|I love seeing movies made in CGI. It held my interest and had a good story line.<br />I look forward to seeing a sequel. Anyone who likes cgi movies and likes scifi's<br />will like this show.
B007ELN8Y8|3.0|It was interesting to watch but after a while it was too much of the same and literally fell asleep and didn't finish it.
038572179X|3.0|I read another review that said the reader gave up on this book on page 80. I nearly did too due to the dragged out descriptions of everything but I'm happy I decided to finish that chapter because that's precisely where the plot got intriguing! My interest in history was satisfied too by the description of the war. Some reviewers felt let down by the ending but I quite liked it.<br /><br />I need help understanding one thing though - in the book, one of the characters is killed in September 1940 in the Balham Tube Station bombing - but in real life this event occurred in October 1940 - is this discrepancy intentional??
B008MEM24S|5.0|great game keeps me thinking and on my toes. I have it on my kindle fire and it works great. I like that I don't have to buy power.
B0092MKTL2|5.0|this is a great album, i bought their EP and couldnt wait for the whole thing, i listen to it all the time!
B007PVHANM|5.0|This was the most imformative documentry ever on Bob Marley. I recomend it to any and all Marley fans. If you love his music and wanted to know more about him personally and the origin of Reggae this product is for you.
B00005N6KG|5.0|If your looking for a great set of ear phones then loook no further..These headphones are very lightweight and easy to fold up and carry in my purse.. The sound quality is great and very comfortable in my ears.. I can't wear the ear buds they hurt and are too big.. LOVE this product. I bought two..
B0087HT36U|4.0|This is similar to other physics puzzle games but has some unique features.  The game kept me busy for hours and I look forward to additional levels.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|love the two first books of Fifty shades Of Grey.  Couldn't put them down. She keeps you interested all the way and in need of the next book.
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|Before I start with my actual review, I would just like to thank NOMAD Apps for creating such an amazing game that is not only fun, but doesn't use any unnecessary permissions or third party spy/bloatware.<br /><br />AWEsum! is a really awesome (I had to do it, please forgive me) game, the object of which is to (vertically) line up numbered cubes and make them add up to create the game's current AWEsum!. These blocks fall two at a time and can either be rotated (by tapping the screen), or moved (by dragging them across the screen). They can also be forced into place faster by dragging them down (this also nets you a higher score).<br /><br />Speaking of scoring, you are awarded bonus points for using blocks of a similar color to create the AWEsum!, and there are multiple power ups included to spice up the gameplay. Getting two AWEsum!'s in a row (from the same pair of falling blocks) earns you a \\"Swap\\", which can be used to change the numbers on falling blocks, giving you more chances to score.<br /><br />The best part of this app is that there are no permissions, IAP, or bloatware included.<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />- Simple yet effective graphics and a great UI. Everything you need is right there on the screen, with nothing to distract you from gaming.<br /><br />- Good sound effects, including the announcer.<br /><br />- Creative power ups.<br />Number Bomb that will destroy all the cubes that match the number it falls on (usually resulting in multiple AWEsum!'s if done right).<br />Double Arrow that will destroy all cubes in a row (either vertically or horizontally).<br />Colored Star that will destroy all cubes of a color it lands on.<br /><br />- An EXTENSIVE help option. Everything you could ever want to know about the game is here.<br /><br />- Great option menu that will allow you to adjust your starting block height (turning the game into an instant math puzzle) and level (to increase the speed at which the blocks fall), as well as a myriad of otherchoices that can impact the game (even the controls).<br /><br />- Well programmed and runs on a wide variety of hardware without a problem or issue.<br /><br />- NO IAP, PERMISSIONS, or SPY/BLOATWARE.<br /><br />- No useless social media integration.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />- Peppy music does get annoying after a while, thankfully it can be disabled in the option menu.<br /><br />- The AWEsum! is only calculated vertically, not across (side by side). I would really like this implemented in the future so that we can line up massive board clearing combos.<br /><br />- Questionable reviews - There are still five star ratings by users with one or two reviews under their belt. Sadly this is now becoming a staple on Amazon. However, in AWEsum!'s defense, I only found a few of them so I won't be marking them as 100% fake.<br /><br />- Aks you to review it in order to unlock a new (and very powerful) power up block.<br /><br />The Ugly:<br /><br />- Absolutely nothing, I couldn't find a single glaring issue with this app.<br /><br />Score:<br />The Game: 5<br />Permissions: 5<br />Combined Score: 5<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />AWEsum! is an amazing game and a superb FAOTD! It is also completely worth its $.99 price point. I can't recommend it enough. If you miss this as a free download, just go ahead any buy it.<br />Apps like this are getting rarer on the Adnroid OS and NOMAD Apps (the developer) should be rewarded and encouraged for releasing such a great game.<br /><br />NOMAD Apps, I can't wait to see your future software.
030758836X|1.0|I hated this book.  Clever, yes, but there is not one character in it to love or admire.  Has our society gotten so manipulative that marriage has become a total farce.<br />What a waste of my time and money, hoping that the clever plot will finally lead to a transformation of character.  But no, the people just get more and more despicable.<br />This is not why I read, to be disgusted by manipulative and hateful people and their behavior.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was better than the 1st. It had more of a story plot to it. It does have over use of certain words when she is describing \\"down there\\", but all in all its a great book. I couldn't stop reading it!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Works. Sound volume seems fine; limited only by the volume of kindle fire.  Starts off low volume and slowly increaseses so as to wake you in a more natural manner than a suddenly blaring alarm.
B004132I4S|5.0|This is not only Sufjan Stevens' best album to date (and I'm a long-term fan who has them all) but its one of the best albums of all time (in my opinion!)<br />It seems like a very natural progression for his work. It has a harder feel than his other albums but there is this crazy fire to it, almost aggression. I couldn't have imagined him we cursing in a song but at the end of this album it seemed not only natural and fitting, but beautiful in its raw passion. I love this direction!
B003VDZK8K|4.0|This is a good effort but not the best I have from Avenged Sevenfold. Still, nice to have some variety.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Best book ever. I would recommend this book to anyone. 10 stars. I hope she continues to write Anna and Christian's story. We all want more
0345803485|2.0|With all the raves about this trilogy, I was so curious to find out what it was about.  But I wouldn't want to be caught dead buying printed one. So I got the ebook.<br /><br />It started out innocently enough: girl met boy; boy fell head over heel in love with girl, but girl didn't know it yet, she just thought he was hot (the author's word, not mine.)  But then the boy offered the girl a contract to be signed before they'd have any kinky sex, I mean tortured love, to be pc.<br /><br />By this time, I've had enough. The writing is on par with... \\"Twilight\\"'s series. Even the characters are almost identical: she is of clumsy beauty type, he is smolderingly hot, super-talented, perfectly handsome, obsencely rich guy. That's why my wife gave me dirty looks when just a while ago her eyes were all dreamy reading the book.  I mean how am I going to compete with all these superhot charaters when I am short, average looking, with barely enough salary, and most importantly, I don't have long index finger like Christian's. It's bad enough that I can't measure up to vampires, I have to feel degraded by human love machines as well?<br /><br />Two stars for the first couple of chapters. The rest, read at your own risk. By the way, since the female character blushed so much, the author should have named her book \\"Fifty Shades of Pink\\".
030758836X|3.0|Loved the book right up until the end. But the end was horrible and it seemed to end so quickly and it was so unbelievable. Ugh!
B000RHLY7O|4.0|The performances are worth the price alone, and the challenges of performing and interpreing of shakespeare are just as engaging.  The side plots are nasty and dark and not all that interesting, but the pleasure of the plays and the performances make it worth watching, even more than once.
B0087HT36U|5.0|It is good strategic game.They need to hurry and get the new levels done. Good game and time consuming. definately worth playing.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I absolutely loved being consumed by this story -- while a bit dark and disturbing, I found a little of me in each of the characters... :)
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|so much fun its hard 2 put it down the kids love it 2 I cant get them 2 give it back so I can play
B007IXWKUK|1.0|First off I have never read Book one of this series. In fact, my brother put it on my kindle as a complete joke and what a joke it was! I decided to see what the fuss was all about and I got through a couple chapters before I gave it up. Each time I read about her \\"inner goddess\\" I laughed but when she referred to her female genitalia as \\"down there\\" I rolled my eys. How old is this author?
B0090EIC3Y|4.0|Much better than that bruno thing he did,i love all the cleche's. Ben kingsley is the icing on the cake.
0062202081|5.0|This is a great book that takes a look into the heart of Justin Bieber. Judging from this book and his chart topping albums, he is going to have a life long music career.<br />The book title is very appropriate.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Really wasn't sure I wanted to read this book and thought maybe it was more appealing to women then Men. But after I got going I could not put it down! My Brother is a divorce attorney and he says that he has seen almost all of this over the years, Scary Thought.<br /><br />Bottom line, I hugged my wife of 30 years and told her how \\"AMAZING\\" she was!
B003XCJKPS|4.0|Psychological studies tell us that sexual identity is well formed by the time we are 4 years old, at the latest. Well, what happens when sexual orientation is messed with to such a degree, that a person really has no idea who or what he/she is? That is the premise of this interesting and generally historically accurate film. The acting by all the players is uniformly great, the story is very interesting, and the conclusion by the skillful actor Billy Crudup, is that he has little idea of who he is, sexually or otherwise.<br /><br />Actors that are truly great are able to inhabit a role to such a degree that they become the person they portray. What I have often wondered is if the role that they played lingers in their life outside of their portrayal, and informs them of another aspect of their personhood that they were not previously knowledgeable of before their role, in the film, play etc. And does it happen that they are unable sometimes to let go of the role they were playing in real life?<br /><br />There is lots of humor in this film, great costumes,and from what I understand from the time period that the movie portrays, the language is actually the way people talked at the time. Lost of swearing and bawdy language. It is interesting that Billy Crudup and Claire Danes, who plays his sort of quasi love interest in the film, were indeed and item in real life during the filming of the movie. That seems to add to how well they play their roles together.<br /><br />All in all, an interesting, entertaining and enjoyable watch.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Good book.  I am glad that i had the opportunity to read this book.  I appreciate the sacrifices and risks these men make for us.
B008TMA1LY|3.0|this is not the best app because its a little hard but it keeps u busy so I say 3 stars!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|It was a wonderful book!Another great book by Nicholas Sparks. I really enjoyed reading this book, I had a hard time putting it down.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I just cant get enough of this app! don't bother buying the three buck version... this ones just fine. hopes this helps anyone wondering if they need the 3 buck version! :)
0525953728|5.0|Riveting!  Hard to put down!  A well written book outlining the mission that lead to the killing of Osama bin Laden.  A good, quick read, that is both entertaining and informative.  A book that dispels a lot of rumors and media scat; a book that gives you a better understanding of just what it is that we as a nation of free-peoples are up against; a book that gives us a general profile of the highly dedicated tens of thousands of brave men and women, in uniform and out, who fight this War on Terror on a daily basis; a book that makes this American both grateful for, and proud of, each and every one of them.  Thank God for these soldiers of freedom and democracy!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Watched entire second season on a Sunday afternoon.  Characters are unforgettable-a great history lesson regarding WWI-costumes and scenery at its' best-hopefully there will be a season 3.
B000WCDBKM|5.0|This is well acted and the filming is almost perfect. The sound track is astonishing because the composer was one I hadn't really heard before.  Filmed in various places the level of effort shows and Polanski manages to 'whip us up' in the a completely fantastic belief structure and leads us to a conclusion we cannot have foreseen.  The sound track alone is worth having. This is, once again, based on the notion that there are 'dark forces' which are ever present, but only visible to those who know where to look. Approach evil and you will be sucked into it. Don't think that this won't work, it does. Buy it! It's just what you need for a Saturday afternoon. If nothing else it's a lesson in the brain's ability to believe silly things . . . if only for the duration of the film. The excellence of the filming, editing, acting and music help to make the experience complete.
B000W178XO|5.0|I love every song on this album. If you like Johnny Cash even a little bit, you'll love this compilation.
B008CB9JJ2|3.0|Auster is much better in other books. This is disapponting. Too much of an address catalog, too little of the author`s own winter
B00913DPW2|5.0|A very interesting game. The puzzles possessed an appropriate amount of difficulty to keep this 23 year old thoroughly engaged for the 5 or 6 hours it took to complete the game. Would definitely recommend to anyone.
B0083EW97W|5.0|I really enjoy John Mayer's music.  It is worth buying.  Easy to download and will help you relax.<br />I will burn to a cd and take with me in my car.
B006LSZECO|5.0|An entertaining mystery that pulls the reader in from the outset.  Just complicated  enough to be engaging, but not dumbed down.  Loved it!
B007ORU2BY|5.0|I love Mad Men - every single episode gets 5 stars from me.  I can't wait for next season!<br /><br />Especially for those of us who lived through the sixties in New York...what more can I say??  Great series!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Interesting, wicked plot! Hard to put down and hard to stop thinking about. A good story that keeps the reader guessing. Not entirely pleased with the ending...it wasn't quite satisfying enough. But certainly a good book.
B0096DFBZQ|4.0|works great on my razr.  the controls are not the best but that makes this simple demo hard enough that u dont win every time and get bored with it so fast!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|A charming story of (slightly) more mature singles looking for companionship, with a surprise ending. Great description of bachelor-type life, and vivid Irish settings. The only parts I found difficult were the sometimes graphic nature of the hero's troubled upbringing. Recommended.
B008M34INW|5.0|DONE IN TRUE GIBSON FASHION - A NON STOP ENTERTAINMENT MOVIE - ACTION, FUNNY, TOUCHING, RROMANCE, SCANDAL, AND A TWIST ITS ALL YOU NEED FOR A MOVIE NIGHT - WATCHED IT TWICE.
B008X0TC58|4.0|So, the big deal about streaming is....streaming. What I miss is the behind-the-scenes \\"making of\\" pieces wherein the creators talk about what's going on. And getting to hear Claire talk about what's in Carrie's head is nice, not long enough, and nice.
B008E77AEK|5.0|It's very refreshing to read a book that is so exciting, yet manages to be technically correct(enough). Keep up the good work Mark!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great Read, very interesting to see how our Hero's protect us everyday all around the world allowing us to be safe at home.
B0091XRL86|3.0|We usually like Aardman films but this one didn't fly.  It was just \\"okay\\", the story line being weak.  I wish, too, that the girl pirate twist was handled a little better.
B001NLKZZ0|4.0|I very much enjoyed this book.  As a single digit handicap I find that the most common problem I encounter on a golf course is the interference I create through negative thoughts.  When my mind and body are left free to perform without the creeping self-doubt, I tend to play very well.  When I hit a poor shot, my negative thoughts begin to build upon themselves until I am a shadow of the player I can be.<br /><br />The ideas and drills presented in the book have helped me to \\"stay in the moment\\" on the course and have allowed me to let go of neagtive feelings immediately after a bad shot is hit.  While I still have a lot of work to do, I know that I will be referring back to this book to improve my play on the most important part of the course, the nine inches between my ears!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|If you're interested in classified secrets or polltical agendas, this won't be the book for you. If you're interested in the evolution and capabilty of our Tier One militiary assets and the kind of operators who man them, this is the book for you. Very imformative and readable, you will have the best insights that are available in open source publications. If you were associated with former Special Operations, you'll find the increased capability fascinating and reassuring.

0380715430|4.0|This fascinating subject raises some very interesting concepts (like the fact my grammar and punctuation problems are not my fault, but the fault of inconsistencies in English, and I have to tell you I'm glad to hear it.  Take that with a raspberry I blow in your general direction every teacher I ever had trying to make me conform to their ideas of correct grammar and punctuation.).  The writing was well done and densely packed with information.  I'm usually a fairly fast reader, but with the amount of information this book conveys I found myself moving at a much slower pace and I believe it may take a few readings to really grasp all of the ideas.  Also be aware of the fatigue factor as your brain tries to absorb the information; this is not a book you can just breeze through.  The Mother Tongue has been touted by many as witty-particularly those trying to sell it.  While I did find it very intriguing and marginally amusing, Bryson's anecdotes never crossed over to outright funny for me.<br /><br />It should be noted some controversy surrounds Bryson's conclusions and examples.  Several other reviewers claim The Mother Tongue is full of inaccuracies; I cannot either validate this opinion or dismiss it.  I just don't know enough about the subject to weigh in.  I would, however, be very interested in seeing an updated version of this book to see what changes of opinion Bryson would make with more current information or the inaccuracies he saw fit to fix, if any.  My advice would be to not take everything he says as the gospel truth (skepticism if used properly can be a friend).  And as with any vaguely scholarly subject, if you are really interested, do your own research.  Ask questions like, does his information match up with what you already know?  Look at the validity of his source material, read more recent articles and books on the subject, and figure out whether you would come to the same conclusions as Bryson (remember critical thinking from your college days, yeah it can apply to real life) .<br /><br />For the full review and others visit whymsylikesbooks dot blogspot dot comyeah it can apply to real life) .<br /><br />For the full review and others visit whymsylikesbooks dot blogspot dot com

B008MG1E4A|5.0|I think it was a good factual account of what and how Osama Bin Laden was taken out as well as giving insite into our Special Ops units and fine character of people in this part of the military.  This truthful information is not be avilable from the Media and especially not available from our current administration.  Thank you Mark Owen for sharing this with us.  You are my hero.... RN
B0031RS44S|2.0|I had trouble getting into this book, all the way through. Yes, this is a true Reacher novel and as such not bad, but the storytelling never really gets going. It's a little flat...a little disinterested even. I have read all the Reacher novels, some twice, one three times (The Enemy), but I will not read this book again.
B0090EIC3Y|1.0|This movie's not very funny and 95% of the time goes for the lowest of low brow jokes. I genuinely laughed a handful of times, but for the most part was watching this hoping it would get better. It never did.

This film wasn't created using anything special, but you do get a decent transfer onto Blu Ray with a good audio track.  Some OK extra material.  Anything else is fun to see.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Great game with cute music and graphics. The crazy upgrades are awesome. The fact that the Game is free makes it a no brainer! Very challenging and rewarding.
B002X3V4P2|5.0|I like Enya and this collection has a lot of songs from a number of albums.  The album has 24 songs and since I have most early albums it seemed to fill in some of the songs I was missing.  If you like Enya and don't have most this music on this album, then this is good album to get, no complaints about quality, I got the MP3 not CD. Very happy
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I have no idea what all the hype is about. This is just your typical romance novel. I didn't find this story anymore \\"erotic\\" than any other romance novel. And seriously. Two girls just graduating from college and one says to the other \\"I think he likes you\\" Really? I did read that they were graduating from college not kindergarten right? In this day and age a 20-year old would say -He wants you, wants to get with you, or at the very least he wants to go out with you.

0345803485|5.0|I loved this trilogy. I don't normally read, in fact the last book i remember reading because i wanted to was probably Matilda at the age of 10. I was forced by my sister to read these books and im so glad...i found myself reading every spare minute i had. Yes it was a little repetitive in some places and i did find myself skimming over some of the sex scenes but it's a lovely love story that had me hooked. Read it! x
B0087HT36U|4.0|its a shame that its so short though. i enjoyed figuring it out and i also enjoyed the challenge. moar pleez!

B002LC8HF0|5.0|As always Brandon Sanderson captivates. The suspense has built through the three volumes of Mistborn. Often when I think I've got it all figured out he drops in another clue that changes my mind. His subtle forshadowing did allow me to see far enough ahead to be entirely satisfied with the conclusion; and to immediately start looking for anything else written by an author who has earned his place in my list of favorites.

1439156816|5.0|Having just finished On Writing, Stephen King's memoir of the craft, his nearly final words-- before And furthermore--at first seem to encapsulate the book's purpose: `Writing is magic, as much the water of life as any other creative art. The water is free. So drink. Drink and be filled up.\\"  <br /><br />Even though this captures King's emotional tie to writing, a tie that helped him recover from a near-fatal accident, this doesn't seem very much like the man I met in this book. King doesn't come across as a poet; instead, he seems to be a rather coarse guy; prone to swear; clearly a person capable of conjuring up repulsive characters. But I learned to like him. I may even read a second SK novel--my first was 11/23/63, one I only read to compare his treatment of bygone time travel to my own.<br /><br />What I appreciated most about this book on writing is its focus on honesty: writing truthfully--writing in ways that define your voice as distinct rather than a chorus of authoritative voices. That's precisely what King models. He doesn't just rise above the din of countless authors who've written eight or ten or 30 rules of writing.  He cuts his own path. Maybe that's why this book is called by The Plain Dealer \\"the best book on writing. Ever.\\"<br /><br />What are the differences between Stephen King's \\"rules of writing\\" and those I've read or heard at conferences and workshops? Here's a few I highlighted in the book:<br /><br />1. On vocabulary: Use the first word that comes to your mind if it's appropriate and colorful<br /><br />2. On paragraphs: Let nature take its course--the turns and rhythms of the story dictating where each paragraph begins and ends. The object of fiction isn't grammatical correctness but to make the reader feel welcome and then tell a story.<br /><br />3. On description: Good description usually consists of a few well-chosen details that will stand for everything else (your first visualized details will be the truest and the best). Figurative description--the use of similes and other figurative language--is one of the chief delights of reading and writing fiction.<br /><br />4. On a first draft: Don't stop and don't slow down unless you absolutely have to (or the characters will begin to seem like characters instead of real people). Once your basic story is on paper, you need to think about what it means and enrich your following drafts with your conclusions--the vision that makes each tale uniquely your own.<br /><br />5. On the second draft: Wait approximately six weeks, then go through your manuscript all at once, if possible, adding scenes and events that reinforce the meaning.<br /><br />6. On reviewers: Name the one person you write for your Ideal Reader (IR), the person who, in spirit, will be in your writing room all the time. When you finish your second draft, it's time to let your IR (and maybe a half-dozen other people you know and respect) read and critique your work.e description--the use of similes and other figurative language--is one of the chief delights of reading and writing fiction.<br /><br />4.

1401233384|1.0|Following his return to life, the Silver Age Flash, Barry Allen, has been stuck in a rut, struggling to find his footing as he resumes his careers on both sides of the law and struggling to come to terms with how his evil doppleganger, Prof. Zoom the Reverse Flash, murdered his mother and framed his father for it (a controversial retcon in a time where hating writer Geoff Johns is the cool thing to do). Barry's attempt to undo this goes horribly wrong, creating a nightmare world that he must ultimately fix... but at a cost. The cost: a quarter of the DC universe that DC head honcho Dan \\"The DiDiot\\" DiDio hates (the biggest victim being Wally West, Barry's nephew, former sidekick and successor).<br /><br />I consider myself a Geoff Johns fan and was probably in the minority of people who was supportive of his handling of Barry Allen's return, but here Geoff sadly goes a bridge too far, creating negative ramifications not only for Barry but for DC in general. When I first read this trade I found it engagingly weird in an almost David Lynch-ian kind of way, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized that this poorly thought out story, a springboard for DC's bloated New 52, ultimately relied on taking the character of Barry Allen, the affable mild mannered hero who jump-started the Silver Age, and basically turning him into a murderer of sorts unto himself, as efforts ultimately led to the destruction of the world we know and then leaving us with a new one we didn't necessarily want, a world where at least a quarter of the characters we knew and loved no longer exist and bastardized versions now reside in another world (a Silver Age concept that was better left in the past where it belonged). The most obvious victim of Barry's involuntary manslaughter is his own nephew, Wally West, who had been the primary Flash for about 20 years, and disappearing with Wally is his wife, Linda Park, and their kids. Other legacy heroes who no longer exist include Jesse Quick and the Spoiler. Yet somehow Bart Allen, a character who was never particularly engaging, still exists, while the beloved Wally West has been erased from existence. Yeah, thanks a lot DC.<br /><br />Whether this is entirely the fault of the normally reliable Geoff Johns (who keep in mind had a very successful run on Wally West's Flash a few years ago) or the fault of DC as a whole is anyone's guess. One can only assume and at least hope that this really wasn't Johns idea, since his original plan was to create spin off titles for the various speedsters - Jay Garrick, Barry Allen, Wally West, Bar \\"Impulse\\" Allen, etc. But apparently someone upstairs didn't see eye to eye with that.<br /><br />It's very disappointing. After the successful return of Hal Jordan and the expansion of Green Lantern I was really excited and hopeful that Barry Allen's return would work, but sadly, it has not, and it seems the only real reason anyone likes the post-Geoff Johns Barry Allen is for the simple fact that he's no longer written by Geoff Johns. Now that chunk of the DC Universe that Dan DiDio apparently didn't like is gone despite the fact that there was more than enough room for Barry, Wally and all the other speedsters to coexist. Instead, like a Marvel event, Barry Allen was forced into being out of character and turned murderer just so DC could have a reboot that wasn't even necessary.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|These guys are true heroes. Then it comes down to who do you believe? I believe these men have far more integrity than any Washington politician, my vote is with the Seals!
B00846REIS|1.0|This book is very similar to the \\"Fifty Shades\\" trilogy.  Both have a fairy tale plot, and tedius and repetitive explicit sex.  The sex is hot until it gets boring.  The heroine is naive.  Actually, I found the both to be grown-up fairy tails that might appeal to adolescents, who would not be mature enough to deal with the nuances of adult relationships.

B005FITIDC|5.0|This is an excellent true story about a man who was on a 'one way trip to hell', and how God reached out and saved him.  Grace undeserved, as it is for all of us. This man's story shows that God doesn't give up on us, no matter what.  It also shows some of this \\"Machinegun Preacher's\\" fearless accomplishments rescueing enslaved children in Africa.<br />I highly recommend it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Absolutely loved the trilogy.  Not just about sex and bondage....it's a great love story and mystery all tied up in one. (no pun intended).  Highly recommend.  Disappointed it's over:(
B006P4FBUE|3.0|It's really nice to have 2 octaves, but there's a lag between notes so if you're trying to play a quick rhythm then it just doesn't work.  Also, it's not a true piano sound, it sounds like you have one of hte pedals pushed down.
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|This is a good brain work out. I'm starting to get the hang of this game. It keeps me thinking and can take up a lot of time as I try to get a better score.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I only read the series because a friend wanted to discuss it. It was hard to get through all of the three books. I think the book is overkill on the sexual scenes, the reference to 50, and it's hard to relate to the characters. I think all three books could have been combined into one.

B008FC4WA4|3.0|Nick Hornby, the master of the man child story, has a real knack for writing the kind of male twits that we are all capable of being. It's a real talent, that when you're reading 'Bastard' that you can identify (as a male reader at least), with what's driving those rather questionable choices. I always feel true empathy for the characters, and this Single has that in spades.<br /><br />Where it loses for me is that it feels slightly incomplete- I realise that this is by nature a short story format, but there's a curious sense of 'That's it?' when you get to the end. The resolution feels a bit empty and premature, and despite my preference for succinct and punchy writing, this was a case of wanting the whole thing expanded somewhat.<br /><br />The second issue, and what really cost this Single a star and a half was the casual air of misogyny. It just felt like Hornby was exorcising a few demons here, but not in a terribly sympathetic way. It's not that the female character is pure evil, but just that in a story that is only told from one perspective, it is tricky to present characterisations as 'voiced' by the protagonist. Somehow this didn't ring true in this book. I got the impression that there was a very specific target in Hornby's life, and that was in the end too distracting.<br />Certainly a fair read, and okay value, but not in the same league as [[ASIN:0753808625 About a Boy]], or [[ASIN:B0051BNRTO Juliet, Naked: a novel]].
B0087JTAKW|4.0|This book was a little difficult at first as the chapters jumped between characters, however like all of Mitch Albom's books gives a good message and is thought provoking.  Definitely worthwhile to read.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The most important it was not a repeat of the first two books and it is full of surprises, all in all good entertainment
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I've talked to people who read the first book and were disgusted and they refused to read the other two books.  This is sad, because the story evolved into more than just a guy who likes erotic sex.  There is so much more to this story...understanding, unconditional love, patience, and romance. I loved the characters and felt like I knew them.<br /><br />I'm hoping E.L. James writes a follow-up book, as book 3 leaves possibilities for a 4th book.

B001CDZZI6|2.0|I got the book and took the test for a class. I guess I can see some application of this test being useful. The main complaint I have is that it's supposedly built off of 40 years of research, but its basically a modified personality test. Those quizzes are everywhere. I don't really see a substantial application unless you plan on going into business.
B0009UC810|5.0|Great movie. Nostalgia to the max! The Anniversary edition has some great additions to it. if you have an uncle who grew up in this era, this is a great present.
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved reading these books.  Everyday that I had a spare minute I would be reading a page or two I just could not stop wanting to read it!  I read all these reviews and heard girlfriends talking about the sex and how descriptive the author was and yes there are parts of the book that are pretty pornagraphic, but the story and lives of the characters is what entrigued me!  Definitely worth the money and time to read this series!! Can't wait for May 2014 for the others.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Well written narrative of his career. Being former Navy, and having been stationed at Coronado, i was familiar with a lot of the story.<br />As to revealing secrets, i found nothing in the book i didn't already know.
B0091XRL86|2.0|Kinda expected more from this...... our 9 year old didn't even like it.  The accents made it hard to follow a weak/boring plot.  We've watched a lot of animated movies in the past 6 years, usually multiple times  ;-)  this one gotta say not again.

B009329ZF2|2.0|Visually it's a stunning movie. Special events are great  Plot and acting are weak.  Storyline is  disjointed and military tactics and protocol is non exsisted.  Liam is barely in the movie (which I don't blame him for, I wouldn't want to be in the movie either). Find something better.

0547564651|5.0|This book discusses the emerging research on performance character as a particularly important indicator of success.  I would liken it to the breakthrough in brain research and babies from a decade ago.  The author makes research understandable, relevant, and fascinating to read about.  Some of the experiments that predict future success look at how long a child can be alone in a room with a marshmallow without eating it and how attentive a parent is to her child while playing Jenga with the child.  The author also connects the research to real-life case studies of schools and students.  There is a large section of the book on chess, perhaps more than I needed on chess, but he used chess as an illustration about performance character in general (and it convinced me that I ought to be playing more of it).  This book is full of revelations for parents and teachers and inspires introspection, too.  It's a quick read, which is no small feat for a book on research.

1400052181|5.0|This book, which is based on a true story is well written for the lay person. It is easy to read and understand. It contains photos of the Lacks family. I highly recommend this book.
B000W237RE|4.0|Awesome jam.  The music has to move you even If you are dead!  I hear new music every time I listen. Ive been listening to this band for over 25 years.
B000VDUWMC|2.0|Diamond creates a sweeping picture of the development of humanity. However, his book is Euro-centric, patronizing and bound by European concepts of time and space. He fails to consider native perspectives on Europeans, does not explore Native empires to an adequate degree, and entirely dismisses the importance of religion to both European and Native societies. The author does not discuss the role of human agency in determining the fate of society. Diamond also fails to explore the China questions: having had the same or more advanced resources and technology as the Europeans, why didn't China take over the world? He discusses germs in depth, but spends little or no time on guns and steel.<br /><br /> Having read this book side by side with Mann's 1491, I definitely recommend the latter
0520224787|5.0|Great package, with protection.<br />I receive it in a week. Take care about additionnal cost for TVA of your own country<br />Nothing to say, good job
B00846REIS|3.0|Bared to you is okay overall but, she copied too much off of 50 shades of grey. Plus this Gideon thinks sex is the answer to everything and Eva seemed kinda slutty to be honest. I was getting irritated with them & some of the other characters. (the gay room mate having an orgy in the living room?) Overall 50 Shades of grey is a way better read, with a better story & characters. I don't know if i'll read the sequels to this.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I have loud ringing in my ears that interferes with falling asleep when the room is too quiet. I saved several favorite combination sounds (like crickets and zen music) and I just choose a favorite, set the timer for 30 minutes, and turn off the light. I relax and fall asleep very quickly now. The premium version has so many beautiful sound and musical choices but the free version does the job too, just not as many to choose from! I recommend either one!
B008XFAT7S|5.0|This movie was one of the best action movies I've seen. It was so cool I give this movie a 5 out of 5 because the action was so cool.
0790737345|5.0|I was delighted to find the movie as it is an old one.  It brought back many memories of sitting with my beloved daughter who is in Cape Town, South Africa and I am in Arkansas, Usa, loved it.  The music is phenomenal and I am so happy to own it.  It was not available for purchase at Hastings - our only outlet here!<br />Thanks again.[[ASIN:B000NA1WDQ City of Angels / Michael (Double Feature)]]
1936891026|5.0|This is a great book. I was skeptical at first about how a book (especially such a small book) could really help me get out there and do my creative stuff, but this one really does. Can't really describe it. It just really kicks you in the gut and tells you \\"Stop your whining you lazy sonofabitch and start doing whatever it is you gotta do\\". And it works. Given you listen to what it says however. This is not a magical book that will grant you creative utopia. You need to do the work. And it's hard work. But it's worth it. I heartily recommend this book.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun game. Gain money fast. Frustrating at times that the game doesnt tell you what buildings cost and you cant see all the expansions. Otherwise fun.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This was an entertaining book, full of twists, turns and despicable people. Seriously, it would have been nice to be able to root for someone! But they did keep me guessing, I must admit, and that alone made the book worth reading.<br /><br />It wasn't a deep, heavy book, but it was a fun one (if you're slightly twisted), so read it in front of the fire with a cup of tea and be thankful for your life!
B0087HT36U|5.0|My son &amp; I have played this for hours. The average time is about 5 mins to decide if we like the game or not, most has been not...
B008FTAAG2|5.0|A lot of strength & rebellion in this album. Great energizing music. Vicious & yet soft vocals at the same time. Brilliant.
B000FC1MM8|4.0|This was the first Harry Bosch book that I had read (I have since read another).  Never quite figured out the symbolism of the coyotes except that it was all these old politicians who were still alive.  Michael Connelly can certainly weave a good plot.  I wonder if he starts off with one idea and then lets his plot change.  He seems to go back at the end and tie certain things.  Bosch's romantic life is certainly a complicated one as is his failure to control his temper.  Connelly seems to slip in all sorts of social comments yet does not follow up on some of them.  It is indeed a plot with a lot of twist and turns.  I like to find new writers on Amazon and I have been able to do that since receiving my Kindle in Dec, 2011.
B003O86FMW|4.0|For me, it was a slow start in the beginning of the book until the action began later on. After reading the end of the last chapter, Catching Fire seems like a \\"filler\\" between The Hunger Games and Mockingjay.<br /><br />Of course, as with the last book, the excitement came when the tributes were in the arena, but the end was anti-climactic: only because it was a HUGE cliffhanger. I have read in other reviews online (not just Amazon.com) that when you finish the 2nd book, you need the 3rd book on-hand, because the cliffhanger is so intense you will want to keep reading. Those thoughts are true.<br /><br />It was a good book, and I cannot wait to read the final (really?!) one soon!
B005K01VZS|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a long time.  A fantastic true story.  It will be one that you will want to read again.
B009329ZF2|4.0|Plot was so so but with 2 boys in the family, the movie was a hit. High action scenes and overall pretty entertaining.
B0091574VI|4.0|What else needs to be said? Disney sets teh bar yet again with this documetnary nature film about a baby chimpanzee and his struggles and adoption. Great cinematography, good narration, and happy ending.  two thumbs up.
0802473164|4.0|This book put things in perspective for me and my wife. We clearly didn't understand why the other was struggling with showing us they loved us.
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|This was a great story, filled with vivid characters and lots of action.  It isn't any surprise it won a RITA!  I'd highly recommend it.
B00318COS4|5.0|If you are a fan of non-violent adventure/mystery games such as MYST or RIVEN, then you might like this game too.<br />It is short, we played it in under 20 hours. I purchased this copy for my father because he does not download from the internet. When I looked for this game online I kept seeing that you could not get an English copy of it. The version I bought here, through Amazon, was in English. My Dad likes the game so much he's played it several times trying to beat his time.<br />If you like Robots, puzzles, and a side of love story it is really sweet.<br /><br />Sometimes the puzzles are extremely non-obvious. When that happens there is a way to get hints. You play a mini video game to \\"win\\" the hint.<br /><br />Anyway, I enjoyed it.<br />Also the people who shipped it were great about expediting shipping when I included a note that it was a present. They also responded to me when I asked if it was actually in English.
B009329Y30|4.0|I guess you kind of know from the beginning how it will end, but there are some unexpected twists and turns along the way ....
B006HTUZ1C|4.0|This is a pretty fun app.  Typical clear the board game but with numbers.  Controls are pretty simple.  Special blocks add a little more to it.  The change your numbers ball doesn't always change it to numbers that will give you a match.  I'd recommend it, especially if it's free
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Never thought I could get into a book like this but I was hooked from the first page. To me it was a beautiful love story with a kinky background. Had to order book three as soon as I turned the last page of book two.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have never liked romance novels at all, I have always been into spy novels or thrillers. But, at the printing company I work for we like to exchange books and get the each others opinion about them. Well, with this one; everyone was asking; have you read Fifty yet? At the time I was oblivious. And for the first time; no one wanted to elaborate on what the book was about. And they didn't want to share theirs. This book really draws you in from the first few pages, and now I have my own copies. You should get your own.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|WHen I first started this book I will admit that after about 20 pages I was starting to lose interest. The Author throws a lot of names and a lot of details right from the get go in this book and I was forced to reread paragraphs since it was difficult and tedious to follow. But after getting through the induction phase I started to gather speed to the point where I could not put the book down. I have never read a book so ravenous before since The Game of Thrones books. This book follows the life of Kvothe as recollects his legendary past to a scribe called the Chronicler. I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone seeking an epic fantasy book that is above the mediocrity that is all too common in this genre.
5558112204|5.0|this is a great cd. the music is fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best tracks on this cd are<br /><br />tracks<br />2. we're back<br />6. the re-up<br />8. jimmy crack corn<br />16. smack that(remix)<br />20. shake that(remix)<br /><br />if you have not listened to this cd then i recommend you do
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This was a well-written book that was - just what it was advertised to be. It told the real story by someone who was really there. It is recommended for everyone to read before they cast their votes this November. It was hard to put down until you read it all - fortunately it was short enough to do that. Bought the eBook version and read it on my iPad.
B0030DD9I4|5.0|this is a great cd the best songs on this cd are<br /><br />Disc 1.<br /><br />3 A.M.<br />My Mom<br />Insane<br />Same Song And Dance<br />We Made You<br />Medicine Ball<br />Bagpipes From Baghdad<br />Crack A Bottle<br />Underground<br /><br />Disc 2.<br /><br />Forever<br />Buffalo Bill<br />Music Box<br />Drop The Bomb On 'Em
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This game is very addictive. It is more intense than the version on my iphone. I couldn't find directions to explain why some things were happening but this didn't stop me from playing the entire 12 screen game.  I was used to playing a calmer version.  I would recommend this to anyone.  I will be playing again.
B000XTGU20|5.0|this is a great cd. the music is fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best tracks on this cd are<br /><br />tracks<br />2. we're back<br />6. the re-up<br />8. jimmy crack corn<br />16. smack that(remix)<br />20. shake that(remix)<br /><br />if you have not listened to this cd then i recommend you do
B0083ZRAJS|3.0|This is, of course, a classic of yesteryear. It is hard to read without seeing the movie in your head, but it is still a great tale. There is more in the story than there was on the screen, although in much more simplified form. a little old-fashioned for today's tastes, but still worthy of being read to youngsters.
555621767X|5.0|is a great cd. the music is fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best tracks on this cd are<br /><br />tracks.<br />2. Kill You<br />5. Who Knew<br />8. The Real Slim Shady<br />9.

B002MZZTUC|4.0|OK, this is a great, creepy old flick. Very sinister in its Germanic expresionist use of light/shadow/mood. I won't go into the plot or detail, but I love this film , despite the crude, unrestored nature of this print , which really didn't distract from my enjoyment of it, even though it is obviously a splicing of 2 different original transfers, ranging in quality from ok to very grainy. it is jumpy, disjointed sometimes, and volume ranges greatly. That being what it may, it's just such a great, creepy old film, that the graininess almost adds to its mystique. I only wish it was more well rounded as A whole.  I was more bothered by the Sinister Cinema \\"SC\\" logo that appears at the bottom of the screen for maybe 5 min in the beginning. It is slight, but still, in my eyes it is interferring/distractive, and an alteration.  other than that, a creap alternative, though i recomend the Criterion Collection version for the more serious minded.
B009BRTGNA|5.0|This was a pretty good cd. Eminem is a very talented rapper. The best songs on this cd are<br /><br />tracks<br /><br />1. Cold Wind Blows<br />2. Talkin' 2 Myself<br />3. On Fire<br />4. Won't Back Down<br />5. W.T.P.<br />11. Cinderella Man<br />14. Almost Famous<br /><br />if you hyave not listened to this cd before then i recommend you do
B005LLSNNE|5.0|This show is awesome I love it. Every season is exciting and makes u want to watch the whole season in one night
B003YL4LYI|4.0|One has to do a lot of reading to get to this one in the series, but it seems so seamless and so fluid that when I finished the fourth book,I was hungry for more. New narratives from new characters and even the style of narration evolves to keep the reader on the edge of his seat.<br />I am sure if you have read all the four you would want more!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Unbelievable story of courage. Well written. I could not put it down and then had to reread it! God bless you, Marcus.
B007KTBMAG|5.0|Fantastic music outstanding performer fast download with the ability to hear it immediately and replay over and over . Great price
B00846REIS|5.0|Love, love, love this book.  If you liked Fifty Shades of Grey you will love this.  Great story and fun to read.  Can't wait for the next one to come out!!
B0049J0DC8|5.0|I can provide all the dialogue for both Toy Story and Cars.  I have a 2 and half year old son....I also have a house full of merchandise to prove it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book was excellent- the twist of events kept you in suspense.  If you love the Hunger Games - this is a must read to complete the story!
B00846REIS|5.0|These two characters have become my favorite. So much love passion and sec! Cant wait for the second book to be released!
B004SBX112|3.0|great game love to play but glitchy.  Love all the levels but some levels have so much going on that it causes a skip effect on my tablet.  but overall great
B008MG1E4A|2.0|This could have easily been a badly written and edited novel, but instead, it is a badly written and edited non-fiction book. It suggests that in the future, anyone will be able to publish electronically and foist upon the masses poor literature. The editing staff at the publishing house should all go back to school.<br /><br />This spurious book spends more than half the pages developing \\"background\\" that is certainly unnecessary and not of relevance to the title of the book. Wasted trees is the result for those that read the print version. I also do not see what the CIA or the Navy would have issue with. I will not read this again, nor will I recommend it to friends.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Good, exciting read. I only wish the second half of the book received as much attention by the author as the first. Felt a little rushed and anticlimactic. But I would still encourage people to read this!
B008K8H9C6|5.0|Innovation and flawless execution.  Some levels have dozens of ways to arrange the pieces and solve the puzzle.  Avoids the score competition and makes the game just a great personal experience.  As a game developer ([[ASIN:B008T2TVNI Fred-X]]) it makes me jealous :)
B008TRUDAS|5.0|: )  Very good book.  If you are a crier the events in this book will bring you to tears..normally I do not like books that have too much lose but this book still pulled out a happy ending.
B0088WFZQG|5.0|GREAT FILM AND I LEARNED A LOT! Recommend to all who are interested in today's modern Seal Team methods and what is happening in the Middle East!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I struggled thru the first 200 pages. Would have put it down, but friends kept encouraging me to continue.  I didn't really care at all for the two main characters the first 200 pages, but then realized it really gave them depth. By the end of the book I felt somewhat familiar with them.<br />I haven't truly decided if I liked it or not.  Only time will tell.
B0012UOWBA|5.0|The movie Falling in Love was excellent. Just as I remembered it when I first saw the movie. Robert DeNiro was at his very best. Absolutely handsome. Meryl Streep as usual was flawless.<br /><br />The story line, just one of those things that happen to people who think their life and marriage are going along great. Then WOW, they meet someone who takes their breath away and an affair starts.<br /><br />Sorry, but they must buy the movie to see how it ends.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A great read for anyone intrested in becoming a Navy Seal. This book does not give any away any national security secrets. This seal loves his country and has taken every measure to be respectful of his fellow Seals and countrymen. Thank you Mr. Owen!
B006LG74R4|5.0|This is a much finer film than \\"Bean -- The Movie,\\" Rowan Atkinson's earlier film.  Atkinson is hilarious here and Ben Miller as his sidekick is also very funny in a subdued way, dutifully putting up with and attempting to gloss over Atkinson's absurdities.  Natali Imbruglia is the lovely heroine constantly managing to get Atkinson out of one jam after another.  I'm not completely convinced of John Malkovich's playing a Frenchman, but he was OK and funny at times.  Although you might not think it, the picture greatly benefits from being in Blu-ray having some, but not quite enough for me, beautiful shots of London.  An exceptionally  enjoyable picture as an updated Pink Panther type of movie but with really fresh ideas.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I'm now reading book 3, I kinda hate to finish it. I don't want it to end. I bought book 1 and sent it to my cousin, so she can become addicted like I am. Happy Reading!
B0031Q0XCA|3.0|The two principals in this cute, romantic comedy, Zooey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, are pleasant enough but Gordon-Levitt's acting ability extends far beyond the level of this picture.  In films such as The Lookout, Mysterious Skin and Brick, he really shows his stuff as a very professional and gifted actor.  I thought he was wasted in Inception, but I'm sure his salary was good.  Some crtics have said he was the best thing in The Dark Knight Rises.  His new film, Premium Rush, may be another substandard picture for him, but Leonard Maltin really liked it so I hope I'm wrong.  \\"Looper\\" may be a very good sci-fi film that is killed by a title that doesn't mean anything to anyone.  \\"Jaws\\" -- now that was a title that couldn't miss.<br /><br />(500) Days of Summer is structured in a way in which it keeps jumping around in time that may make it confusing to some viewers.  It reminds me superficially of Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five that does the same sort of thing except in that story the character actually is jumping around in time beyond his conrol.  The ending of (500) Days is a bit of a surprise.<br /><br />Sooner or later,  Joseph Gordon-Levitt is going to make a film of great importance that will receive wide acceptance.  An Oscar-worthy performance is something that should be well within his grasp.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|A fairly fascinating account of the actual raid on bin Laden's compound. It's pretty graphic but it's good to eliminate the controversy about the details. I fail to recognize that the author violated his oaths to the military. What's the uproar all about?
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I enjoyed the movie.  The acting was good.  Was it as good as the book? No.  However, I recognize the big problem with making a movie out of this book (and the big problem I see for the maker's of Enders Game for that matter) is much of the action in the book is happening in the main character's head.  To get around that, the producers decided to write into the script what was going on in the control room but in doing so, they took a lot of the suspense out of the story - the very suspense that makes the book such a page turner.  I also understand that there wasn't a large budge to produce the movie.  So certain bits of information that become more pivotal to the story later, such as what \\"mutts\\" are and how they relate to the mockingjay and the jabberjays, were completely left out.  Even the final of the Games themselves, becomes just a random dog like creature instead of a mutt. So overall, I'd give the movie a B+ but the books an A+.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Fast pace reading, enjoyed the trilogy.<br />Every girls dream to read about a Christian Grey.<br />Wouldn't you wish you were Anastasia.
B008B11R1Q|5.0|I just picked up their first CD a couple of months ago.  I read an amazing review in Rolling Stone, so I listened to the song samples and had to get it.  I've listened to the CD (previous album) a few times now, and it's great, really great.  It's perfect background music, and sounds amazing in headphones.  So, of course I had to pick up Coexist.  The best thing I can say about the new album is it's \\"more of the same\\".  11 more songs that sounds like part 2 of the debut album.  They kept what works, what makes the first one so good, the calm lyrics and hushed tones, the easy, brooding music, and made more of it.  If you like the first album, you'll like Coexist just as much.  And vice/versa, if this is your first time hearing XX.
0307341550|5.0|Not for the easily disturbed.  Yes, it was very dark, but I did not feel that it was too far fetched.  Each chapter kept me wanting to know where the story was going...and I was surprised at the end.  I usually like to bounce around and try different authors after just one book, but now I want to read more of Gillian Flynn.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|I picked this up on the strong recommendation of a friend who's musical tastes I have a great respect for.  I believe the quote was \\"buy this\\".<br /><br />I've heard \\"Hold On\\" a few times on XM Radio, and I've liked it, but I didn't listen to anything else on the CD till I bought it.  It was an amazing listen the first time through.  Lots of energy, great song-writing, music, lyrics, all of it.  The whole thing just \\"sang\\" to me, it's really an amazing album, in my opinion.<br /><br />I think the song that really grabbed me on the first listen-through was \\"You Ain't Alone\\".  It just sounds like something that could have been released decades ago, and was so good, that other artists picked it up to do cover tunes.  Of course, I'm reminded of hints of Janis Joplin in her voice, and that twang fits the style of music perfectly.<br /><br />Listen to the samples.  If this is your style of music, BUY THIS.
B001F3DY9A|5.0|This CD is beyond amazing ! Taylor may have been a young teenager when she made this CD,  but it sure doesn't show! Excellent work.
B008BDZOZY|5.0|If you're a David Byrne/Talking Head fan, and you're also a St. Vincent/Annie Clark fan, then you're tastes are eclectic enough to really like this collaboration CD.<br />The mix of both artists is evident throughout, from the just-plan-weird of \\"I Am An Ape\\" to the smooth-and-easy of \\"Optimist\\".<br />Of course the songs take different turns, as would be expected.  I'd recommend listening to the samples first and see if it's just the right amount of weird for you.<br /><br />I really wish I would have gone to see these two in concert, I'll bet the live show was amazing.
B009329ZF2|3.0|Good action, good cgi, but the story was really bad and needed much more to go on rather than just a premise of an alien attack and the old guys save the day.... Bleh
B005EGXNLS|4.0|Excellent recreation of Anglo-Saxon history. Unfortunately, for me, all of those names begining with Alf- were confusing. Still, nobody does historical fiction better than Bernard Cornwell.
B000VK7KVQ|5.0|What a a great additive story that has so much history.  Robert Downy Jr. played his character amazingly.  Very well told story.  I was heading to San Francisco for my first visit and other areas north, so I figured it would be fitting to check this out.
B007RI56NY|5.0|the wife and daughter are big Train fans so this was an essential purchase. No disappointments here. All tracks are good. The album trips along really well, making it great music to play in the car on a long journey. My daughter now loves Drive By
B0086QS7N2|5.0|Rush one of the bands that got me into playing the guitar. I had lost touch with them a while ago, but there were so many glowing reviews in guitar magazines about the new album I decided to pick it up. It is fantastic, and typical or Rush music, you have to listen to it a number of times to really \\"get it\\". But once you do, it'll be in your playlist rotation for a long time.
B000V6ACKG|5.0|what is not to like? Thin Lizzy were excellent and this is one of their best albums. The Boys are Back in Town is an absolute blast
B008IJTFYW|4.0|As a free app, I was expecting a few of the usual, thunder, rain, wind, etc.  But this app has so much more! You can mix and match the sounds, and it has a timer.  This is a really nice app to relax to!
B005LAIHPY|5.0|Finally took the time to watch this movie and was favorably surprised at how well done it  was.  Absolutely required viewing for the sci-fi and Battleship game fan base out there and highly recommended by this viewer!
B004EARTN8|3.0|As you can tell from the vastly disparate customer reviews, this movie is very polarizing. As a Libra, I'm comfortable taking the middle position. There are some really good and really bad dimensions. Depending upon what you expect or prefer to watch, you will either hate or love it.<br /><br />THE GOOD<br />The acting by the lead character was very good.<br /><br />Also, the voice actors --- WITH ONE MAJOR EXCEPTION -- were good as well.<br /><br />The movie was quite suspenseful. You won't be able to stop watching.<br /><br />The production value was pretty good. You will believe you're in a coffin with the character.<br /><br />THE BAD<br />The movie contained too many political and moralizing dimensions. I did not want nor did I expect these. They really undermined the entertainment value of the film.<br /><br />Some of the political statements were so contrived. For example, there is a recorded conversation in the middle of the film. Listen for \\"do we have permission to record this call.\\" That moment was an example of the film's excessive moralistic political commentary.<br /><br />The movie should have been marketed differently. It is extremely dark. It is also more of a social and political commentary -- rather than a \\"thriller.\\"<br /><br />The ending will disappoint many viewers. I can't say anymore on this subject, but many people will not like it.<br /><br />There is an \\"accented\\" voice in the film of a character who had some role in placing the lead character in the coffin. The voice does not represent the accent of the region. This is a major flaw because it is a prominent part of the film.<br /><br />Some aspects of the movie lacked credibility and felt contrived (see above).<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE<br />Depending upon your expectations/interests, you will either love or hate this film. Or, if you are somewhat flexible, you will come away in the middle, like I did. Either way, I think it's worth a look.
B000JMKRKC|2.0|I didn't love this book, for me it was overwritten, over wrought and s l o w. I read it because my book club selected it.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Wifi Analyzer is a must-have tool for teching out wifi networks. I use it more than any other network utility that I have.
B001O7JHVG|5.0|The story makes no sense.  The characters give the word cliche a bad name.  The script must have been written by a guy who has learned everything he knows about the cops, the courts, and criminals from watching reruns of Law & Order.  So why is this film irresistible?  I find myself popping it in my Blu-Ray player at the oddest times.  After listening to Romney tell me how he understands what it means to be poor.  After having dinner at my boss's house and praising him for losing weight when he still looks like a Volvo.  After telling my father in-law that I hope he lives forever even though I have a voodoo doll with a lock of his hair glued to its wooden head.  I guess this film just makes me smile.  The good guys are handsome and witty.  The bad guys are ugly and dumb.  The good guys win.  The bad guys lose.  And Kurt and Sly make it look so easy that they don't comb their hair even once.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Beat book of the trilogy I believe. Did not disappoint. First few pages seemed bleh but as book progresses story pulls you back in. Dell in complete love with it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Could have not been better written.  Have thoroughly enjoyed every chapter of this book. Looking dorward to the next book by this author.
B005EGXTL2|2.0|After reading the first two books in the hunger games series and being throughly impressed by both of them i was so exicted to read mockingjay only to find it is a completly story than the first two and nowhere near as good it is fair to say i was very dissapointed with mockingjay.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|good, really helpful. if you don't connect Internet, you can record off-line, and update it late.the bad thing is that you cant make it as a real notebook.
B008M34INW|4.0|Great movie, excellent cast and amazing plot. I guess thats why Mel Gibson is such a talented actor. I would recommend this movie to everyone!
0345528581|5.0|In \\"You are Your Own Gym,\\" Mark Lauren explains why \\"aerobic\\" exercises are pretty much a waste of time and how you can get a good workout without joining a gym or buying expensive equipment. It requires 20 - 30 minutes of strength training per day, 4 - 5 times per week and, for most of us, a few moderate changes in our diets. The majority of the exercises can be done with no equipment in a small amount of space.<br /><br />That's it. No magic pills, special supplements, or 5-minute-per-month workout gadgets designed using top-secret alien technology from the future.<br /><br />Seriously, this may be the most amazing thing about Mark Lauren's approach: As of this review, if you visit his (easy to find) website, you will NOT be bombarded with ads for more books, DVDs, branded supplements and gear, etc.--unlike every other fitness website I've seen. He seems to be genuinely interested in helping people get fit, not capitalizing on our wishful thinking or feeding his own ego.<br /><br />Nor does he try to indoctrinate you with his idea of the only right way to eat. His book does touch on diet, but it doesn't drone on and on with lists of \\"good foods\\" vs. \\"bad foods\\" and so forth; he simply makes a few suggestions and leaves it at that. If you're an adult, you probably already know what you're doing wrong with regards to your diet, so it's refreshing not be be lectured about it.<br /><br />The only down side I can find about his approach is that, though I'm probably wasting my time on the elliptical, at least I can watch a tv show while I do it and try to pretend the whole thing isn't happening. Mark's exercises require your full concentration so you don't hurt yourself, break your furniture, or both.<br /><br />Speaking of which, it may seem odd to say it, but I would've liked a few recommendations on equipment after all. I love not needing to spend another dime, but I can see where a few inexpensive items could make my home workouts safer and more convenient. While most of the exercises require no equipment at all, Mark demonstrates others using furniture, broomsticks, door frames, doorknobs, etc. to brace, push and pull against. That might be fine for a few reps now and then, but I worry that repetitively using your entire body weight against objects not designed for that amount of force, at that angle, might eventually cause damage or breakage, leading to an ugly exercise fail. Besides, who wants to travel from room to room, rearrange furniture, and so forth for a workout? I could use a few recommendations on what to buy to get the most versatility for the least amount of money. Having an appendix in the book would've been helpful, even though some critics would've said, \\"See! You DO need equipment!\\" You can't please everybody.<br /><br />Still, it's a VERY minor nitpick since Mark recommends you substitute different exercises within the same exercise \\"group\\" to switch things up. It would be easy to avoid those that require props if you wish and still work the same muscle groups. Besides, there are active forums on his website which probably contain helpful suggestions.<br /><br />Bottom line: The books is easy to understand, concise, and provides the information it promises. I can't take off any stars for grammatical errors or typos when the information is clearly there. Five stars from this customer.
B008BM9L72|5.0|Great descriptive writing - encouraging 'imagination explode'. Very educational, well researched relating to classical music, good books, authors, art, psychological aspects, and most grippingly DS relationships! Very liberating too, with the intimate, sexy moments shared! Loved the sub conscious & inner goddess!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is the story I had waited 11 years to read.  Finally the day came when UBL died, and now we can learn about his last moments.  Great book, and an easy read.  I finished it in less than 2 days.  Well worth the 12 bucks to get it instantly on my kindle fire.
B0090EHVMC|1.0|WAY too much liberal propaganda.  It was nauseating.  We had to have a big talk with the kids. Save your time. Don't bother renting this mess.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Excellent Book.  Very good read.  This is the type of book you cannot put down. I read this story in 2 settings.
B00881VLCE|4.0|beautiful. fun. and worth it. I play all the time at work and just relaxing at home. like this app a lot.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game I can platly hours on end. I fell in love with this game when I first played it on my uncles I pod touch I played all day till the battery ran out and then I had to charge it then play it again.
B005LAJ23A|3.0|I LOVED season 1 of this show, and raved about how great it was.<br /><br />I was disappointed by season 2.  Apparently they fired the producer from season 1 and maybe some of the writers too?<br /><br />Not sure, but the dialog is terrible here.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray looks and sounds great as expected.
B0087HT36U|4.0|this is a fun game really really really really really really really fun fun fun fun game I love it! a good way to waste time
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I have no idea where this author came from, but this is up there with the Wheel of Time and Way of Shadows serieses.  Can't wait for book 2!
B0088RQ4TI|3.0|Not a great movie but good.  Visual effects are good and it has an interesting twist on Edgar Rice Burroughs.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|its ok till u run out of coins=) some times you get board but other than that its fun! if you don't have patience...don't play=)
B004UNX1LS|5.0|good clear new music videos that you can view before you buy the songs you like and put them on your iPad or iPhone or other devices.
0553386794|5.0|Story telling at it's best.  I am lost within the world that Martin has created with this series. The multiple plot lines, which so beautifully intertwine, don't get lost amongst each other (a truly amazing feat). The story is brought to life, chapter by chapter, by different characters. Characters so real,so humanized that you will find yourself laughing, crying, or (if you're like me)screaming at your book and throwing it to the ground.
B00846REIS|5.0|Sexy! Romantic! This book was absolutely amazing. Can't wait until the 2ndday one comes out! I couldnt put it down and I've told all my friends to purchase this! Sylvia Day is a amazing writee!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|NORTH AND SOUTH  THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIE SERIES I WATCHED IN A LONG TIME ,YES PUT BY BBC BUT A MUST SEE MOVIE IF YOU ARE INTO THIS ERA ,MY GRANDSON IS READING THE BOOK AND HE HAS ENJOYED SO FAR .THANK YOU AMAZON FOR HAVING BOTH MOVIE AND BOOK
B00338QENI|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  The author combines science history with the sad history of African Americans in the early to mid 20th century.  I know that sounds dry and maybe off-putting but it's a really interesting read.  Good for any age but also a really good book for your middle or high school kid to read.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|I play this game for hours at a time .. I love it and my girlfriend does too<br /> The graphic are excelellent, and it even lets you shake it like a real pinball machine
B007VUA7VO|4.0|info provided is worth while and needed. but, it would be helpful to know how much power Battery HD consumes to keep us informed.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|This book was extraordinarily well written. The prose is presented in an odd way, through \\"progriss\\" reports, that was refreshing.  The author did a good job of relating emotions of alienation to the reader. I didn't have the privilege of reading this book in primary school and would certainly suggest this quick read to anyone that had this book similarly omitted from their required reading list.
0062082353|4.0|Currently reading American Sniper and find it a good yarn! I was part of the Navy Special Warfare Group from 65 to 69 (Vietnam) and maybe some of the language has changed but that wouldn't make sense! The Seal in the story calls his group a platoon not a detachment or TAD team as in Vietnam or TDY team when attached to the Army or Air Force. I was in several detachments in my three tours of Vietnam but unlike some I don't write books about secret missions.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This book was just as enjoyable to read as the other two, but I thought the ending was a little too cheesy!
B007STBUIW|5.0|Sure the extras are good.  But the point is this:  I don't think this movie looked this good on the screen.  It is immaculate, and the guys who did the restoring work on the original print deserve a Nobel prize.
B00913DPW2|5.0|would be a great game if it would keep playing.  it has frozen at the toy box and the dream catcher.  have had enough.<br /><br />Perhaps the designers fixed the glitches, because after waiting weeks, I played it again; it worked; and I loved it.  Have also played Haunt 2.  Give me more.
B00068TJM6|5.0|This is my first seiko..I h've a radio controlled ecodrive aswell,but i am getting more comments from my friends for this new chronograph..coz itz stylish and looking hard..My coworkers says its a beautiful  watch..I believe this is a great watch for this price around $220 as i 've paid double for the ecodrive...so great work from Seiko.The functions are quite easy.. easy to use stop watch and for other multiplications..I am a fireman working with Carnival cruiselines and this hardlex steel is really comfortable than any other watch while working...So this watch is really stylish and reliable..
B00136NVH4|3.0|What isn't questionable is the status of this album as a classic, and for good reason.  However, the sound quality of these tracks leave a lot to be desired.  It's  noticeable even to an untrained ear at louder volumes.  Sound quality is one-star, timelessness of these songs, five-stars.
B0091XRL86|4.0|This movie is a lot of fun. Wasn't expecting much so it was better than I hoped.<br />The animation is also really cool. Classical claymation.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love this game!! Its a great way to pass the time. I only wish that you did not have to pay for puzzles.
B0087HT36U|4.0|pretty good game, better than angry birds. similar type of play as it but significantly easier to play and get 3 stars
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A spellbinding first person account of a tragic happening in the lives of a middle class family. This book kept my attention right up to the last paragraph.
B00846REIS|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It's just as good as fifty shades if not better. Reading it over again
B004LQI0HE|1.0|What an awful piece of movie crap this was.  I Will never get that time back! Would never recommend this movie!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm so glad to have this app on my kindle fire. works much better than trying to use the website. easy to pin and repin items. can already tell I'll be wasting even more time on this now!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|simple fun free game with only a small banner ad on the bottom. runs just fine on my kindle fire.
B005K01VZS|5.0|Very poignant.  A friend of mine told me about this book because my mother has asked me to write and deliver her eulogy.  I am finding it a tremendous burden and probably the greatest honor my mother has ever bestowed on me.  Read it in one sitting.
B002P79KAC|5.0|I was not a previous fan of Big Bang Theory but watched it on a dare and am in love with this show!!!
B005K01VZS|5.0|All Mitch Albom's books are inspirational and this one is as well.  I thought it was comforting and enjoyed reading it.
B0090EIILU|2.0|I am a huge fan of his other work, but this movie was flat. It was not funny and seemed more like a contractual obligation film than anything. It was just a pale retread of his other (good) movies, like Borat. Don't bother
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book is direct and powerful  message to the training of both the mind and body to prepare for a very difficult and possibly fatal mission.  Being a member of a well trained armed force is not a Hollywood movie script with lots of action and instant glory.  The chapters that lead up to the great mission, shows the grit and determination to train for a nearly impossible task with the possibility of great failure.  I was enthralled by the clarity of the writing.  The strong pacing keeps the reader interested as to what will become of the mission.  Putting political leaning aside, this is great book showing what was in the head and heart of a true special combat soldier.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|This movie is so much fun.  This is the first movie my son showed an interest in when he was four. And he is 38 now and still loves it as do the rest of the family. Watch you'll enjoy it. It is bright, quick moving plot, lots of music and Dick Van Dyke.  What more can you ask?
B005NFW0U0|5.0|I couldnt stop watching it! The instant veiw was also great! I was happy to be able to watch it on my computer before it came out on DVD! I cant wait for season 4 to start!!
B009329ZF2|3.0|Though no masterpiece, this movie was not that bad. I would not have paid to see it in the theatre, but good diversion nonetheless.
B007HJ98XC|5.0|i bought this television series episode by episode. i wish i bought the hard copy so i could sell it after watching it a few times. i enjoyed this series a lot and highly recommend it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Liked the way it started, the movement to how he became a Seal, and then closing with what happened at the raid.
B007HJB55G|5.0|i bought this television series episode by episode. i wish i bought the hard copy so i could sell it after watching it a few times. i enjoyed this series a lot and highly recommend it.

B008ASLK8A|5.0|I quite enjoyed this movie, I thought it was very good. However, I did like the first one loads better.
0714845183|5.0|this book is large and contains a lot of written material.  i wish it would just have the paintings of J.W.Waterhouse grouped together alone.  i could tear out the written parts :D (art history is a bit boring to me) and have a perfect book.  just know that there is a lot of writing in it and it may take away the enjoyment of viewing the art work.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I loved this movie, I saw it in theaters and had to get it on my kindle. I'll probably end up renting it again soon.
B007HJB42U|5.0|i bought this television series episode by episode.  i wish i bought the hard copy so i could sell it after watching it a few times.  i enjoyed this series a lot and highly recommend it.

B007HJAJSA|5.0|i bought this television series episode by episode. i wish i bought the hard copy so i could sell it after watching it a few times. i enjoyed this series a lot and highly recommend it.
B00932A2MC|1.0|Sorry but I don't have any other words to describe this hunk of crap call a movie. Hollywood needs a makeover!
B007C6HHOM|5.0|i bought this television series episode by episode. i wish i bought the hard copy so i could sell it after watching it a few times. i enjoyed this series a lot and highly recommend it.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Pines.  It is creepy and interesting and the action is non-stop.  There is definitely a \\"Twin Peaks\\" feel to the book.  This was the first book by Blake Crouch that I had read, and I will definitely read more!
B007BVNW10|5.0|it is amazing to see how they created the game of thrones.  i never expected the armor worn by the actors to be made of rubber.  if u like the series u will want to watch this and get a more detailed glimpse of the story.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Having never read ANY BOOKS by Mr. King, this book was HIGHLY RECOMMENDED by family members.<br /><br />It kept me waiting to read the next page and trying to guess what the outcome MIGHT BE.<br /><br />I think everyone that reads it, will be kept in suspense.<br /><br />Ellie Tomberg
B0098VXE50|4.0|as long as you are not expecting a masterpiece \\"Snow White & the Huntsman\\" is fun to watch.  the special effects are amazing and the story take is good.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|great app it does what I need. quick and adiquit thank you still haven't fulling use all the features on it.
B007BVJSLS|5.0|watch this.  it will give you added details of the story.  i did not know the armor was made of rubber and that the other costumes play an important role in the story development.
B006HTUZ1C|4.0|The instructions are simple and it's easy to play. It would be better if you could make awesums in more ways than just stacking them, though!
B007HJ9JEA|5.0|i bought this television series episode by episode. i wish i bought the hard copy so i could sell it after watching it a few times. i enjoyed this series a lot and highly recommend it.
B004J4WN0I|4.0|This book was good fun, but not terribly deep, not that that is all bad. It just seemed some things just happened perfectly that he could handle and nothing more. But it's like a good action movie. You don't expect the bad guys to shoot better or the movie will be really quick. Him, Oberon, and the Widow down the road really won me over. I liked the angle of him being ancient, his magic had some good limits, Oberon had me laughing out loud. The bonus short stories at the end was a pretty cool extra.
B007HJ8RTI|5.0|i bought this television series episode by episode. i wish i bought the hard copy so i could sell it after watching it a few times. i enjoyed this series a lot and highly recommend it.
B000JMKNJ2|4.0|This wasn't the normal fantasy story. No wandering the roads, delving into dungeons, or snarks. It's a rogues tale, ancient Oceans Eleven, and a good one. I loved the characters and got attached to them. My only problem was that I wish there was a little bit more warning when jumping back and forth, telling Locke's past and future, there was a couple of times where I was a few paragraphs in before I realized it wasn't the timeline I'd just been in. Other than that a good book.
B007HJ9UHG|5.0|i bought this television series episode by episode. i wish i bought the hard copy so i could sell it after watching it a few times. i enjoyed this series a lot and highly recommend it.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|Loved this book. After watching Bourdain for years it was a treat to read his story of his coming up in the ranks of the food world. Language was rough but typical of him. Looking forward to reading the rest of his books.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It was hard for me to get into it.  I was shocked when it took a turn towards the middle of the book.  It just didn't hold my interest like I thought a number 1 book would.  I have not read any of Gillian Flynn's other books. I didn't like the back and worth of the characters talking chapter by chapter.  The surprise was the ending.  I was disappointed in the male character.  I loved his sister.  She was the bright spot in the novel.
B002DW92SE|5.0|His best work since High Fidelity, Juliet, Naked, is an engrossing, fast-paced, literate read.  The confluence of events is neatly packaged (perhaps a little too neat?) but the story grabs you and holds on.  Hornby's typical \\"gut-thinker\\" protagonist is present, but different enough from previous works.  His professional admirer character is present, but is not the main protagonist this time.  A great beach read, this will be in theaters at some point.
B007HJ96NO|5.0|This is the best movie you will ever watch. It's a classic that will make you laugh and cry. It's one of those movies you will never forget and watch over and over.
B008FC4WA4|5.0|I want this to the be start of a novel.  Hornby writes such great gut-thinkers that I was left wanting another 200 pages on this world and this character.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Enjoyed this game. Finished all available levels without purchasing anything extra. Need more levels to complete. Angry birds clone but still fun
B00973DDN2|3.0|This album left me...frustrated. And confused. And disappointed.<br /><br />I'm not quite sure what I was expecting here. I think that my overall opinion of the entire album can be summarized by my reaction upon listening to \\"Runaways\\" for the first time: it sets itself up to be great but doesn't carry through. Catchy openings, good sounds, but...nothing really *happens*. The songs either build and build to a disappointing (or absent) crescendo or they drone on and on. They lack depth of sound, the lyrics are weak (come ON...\\"don't want your picture/ on my cellphone?!?!?!), and it just....falls flat.<br /><br />I'm a total sucker for soaring, grandiose, borderline overly-soundscaped and over-the-top melodies (a la U2), but something doesn't mesh here...Flowers' voice just doesn't mesh with the sound in a lot of cases, and the result of the clash are songs that tend to drone and drone. I just finished listening to Sam's Town and Hot Fuss for comparison, and Flowers really does have an incredible voice. However, it needs a certain raw intensity in terms of instrumental accompaniment that wasn't present in Battle Born. I'm all for bands experimenting and I think that The Killers have the potential to take this new sound somewhere; I just hope that The Killers don't settle here. This isn't the right place for them.<br /><br />I wish I could put my finger exactly on what is wrong with this album, but I can't. It just feels a bit empty and leaves me dissatisfied. Hopefully The Killers can use it as a good jumping-off point for future albums. There is potential here, but this album in and of itself is simply not strong.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|its a really fun game with prizes and leveling up and theres alot of stuff to collect so im gonna stop writing this and keep playing Coin Dozer&reg;
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I have been unable to put this game down since I downloaded it.  I like that there are different puzzles at each level.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love this book, it is very enticing and kept me on the toes when reading through it. I would strongly recommend it and the series.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I have never played wheres my water, but am thoroughly enjoying the puzzles in this game. The Perry angle just adds to the fun. Works great on the fire.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this book, it is very enticing and kept me on the toes when reading through it.  I would strongly recommend it and the series.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Once I got to chapter 6 of the first book wow!! Very very very very very hot..by far best ever!! Made me uh well..it's great!
1932100660|5.0|Great info book.  Goes along with Rare Earth Forbidden Cures---- read that review.  Well worth the money.  One I won't pass along cause I refer to it so often.
B005XBKXV2|5.0|Loved this movie! It is a little scary for the younger kids but the music is awesome and keeps most children entertained! Definte must watch!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|It is a fun and interesting game. It could have more realistic prices to upgrade and decorate. Also make it where you can get gems easier without having to purchase them. That's ridiculous. Overall good game.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love always having my Bible with me!  The studies are great as well.  and I can compare different translations quickly.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was VERY interesting and kept me wanting to read more! The chapters kept getting more shocking. Easy to read and kept your attention.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Although the topic is a little  different for Mitch Albom, I really love this book! He is such a talented author, I've read his other books and follow his articles in the Detroit free press as well. Love that he's a Michigander as well!!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|What an interesting point of view---you are kept in suspense. The twists and turns keep you guessing. A delight to see the heroine go from The Kitchen House to The Main House.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book was incredible! Insightful, balanced, and well-researched. An empowering book for introverts to better understand themselves and the world around them.
B0049J2CKE|5.0|My children loved this movie. My husband and I really enjoyed it as well. The quality was great and perfect for family movie night.
B002MFV2IK|5.0|Love this movie!It was great when it first came out and it is still just as funny as the first time I saw it.
B007M45PMU|5.0|\\"Ho Hey\\" is obviously the most known track from this album, but after listening to the samples I couldn't pass up buying the whole album.  I didn't really find a song I felt like skipping over after my first listen and I feel like it gets better every time I hear it.
B0065CCM76|5.0|I have liked Bob Seger since I first heard \\"Old Time Rock And Roll\\". This album has his best hits on it (which are really great IMHO). I would recommend this album to anyone who likes good music.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|What a great book. Humorous at times as he told little pranks that the Seals play on each other to relieve stress and keep loose.  Serious in explaining the ops and the planning/execution of the raid on OBL.  I felt it was modestly written by a warrior that wasn't trying to pat himself on the back but seemed to spread the recognition and kudos to everyone else.  Being an old Marine the writer is the kind of guy I would love to sit and drink a beer with...or a case of beer...lol
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|What can make a kindle more functional than having a calculator? this is a pretty good calculator easy to function the only thing I wish it did have was a feature to square a calculation.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|The ebay app is one that I find myself going to frequently.  Whenever I ant to make a purchase, I find myself checking ebay to see what a good price should be.
B0090EIILU|3.0|In his latest opus, Sacha Baron Cohen offers his unique interpretation of a romantic comedy. Hilarity ensues as a dictator of a made-up Middle Eastern country is replaced by a body double, winds up in New York, and finds love in the Big Apple. It's the best parts of Coming to America and Trading Places, all in one movie.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|When I started reading the first book I thought this was not a well written book and from the perspective of the main character a bit juvenile.  However, it did pull me in to the point that I could not stop reading it.  I didn't know it was a trilogy when purchased the first book.  I ended up reading all 3 and if you read all 3 the story is really very good. I for one enjoyed the erotic side of the novel. Can't wait for the movie version but the books are always better.<br />I say buy all the books and open your mind to enjoy the whole plot.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|Truly a coming of age novel set in the early part of the 20th century. Not just coming of age from child to adult but from adult to old age. Beautifully written with insightful observations on ageing, class, life and the evolution of society. The characters are engaging and well drawn; the story a mystery well crafted and, told in flashbacks in first person from an assisted care facility. I could not put this down. A good read and I will look for other books by this author.
B002ZG980U|5.0|A movie has to  be pretty awesome for me to want to see it more than once, let alone own it. DiCaprio just keeps getting better and better!  One of the best soundtracks by Hans Zimmer!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I read this book in one day, which has moved Baldacci into my collection of popcorn authors. They produce books that I read quickly and immediately want more -- just like popcorn. I think I have read all of Baldacci's published works. He has an easy narrative style that takes you right out of wherever you are and into the plot.  I love his way of throwing it all out there and then tying the loose ends up neatly, but not so neatly that a sequel isn't likely.  It is generally easy to solve whatever mystery lurks in the pages of the story. In this one, by the time the protagonist figured it out, I was practically screaming where he should be looking. Of course, I am not going to spoil the read for anyone. It is too much fun to lose yourself in a work of this author.  As I was recuperating from a bum knee, it was great to get away for a while in this marvelous book!  This book is well worth the cost of admission, and the new protagonist and his cast of supporting characters are a welcome change!<br />[[ASIN:1455519006 The Innocent]]

B00571F26Y|4.0|I heard this author on a television morning show, and found the idea that all wheat used in modern cooking is toxic to be disconcerting and compelling as well. Could this possibly be true? It is an interesting concept, and may well be physiologically valid, but eliminating all wheat from my family's diet is pretty impractical for me at this time.<br /><br />The claim is based on the fact that the variety of wheat now being used worldwide because it is short in stature and therefore less vulnerable to wind and weather and because it produces much more grain per acre than the wheat used when I was a youngster.  Could this be the cause of obesity in America or just another addition to the growing list of food items thought to contribute to this very real epidemic? The author's logic makes sense, and I cannot dispute his claims, but I did wonder, and didn't see any reference to it, about the French, whose reliance on bread as a daily staple is well known. If it is just this variety of wheat that is toxic and causes weight gain and other health issues, then why can't we just purchase flour made from \\"old-fashioned\\" wheat to use in our diet. Did we totally wipe out the old varieties of wheat when this one came along?<br /><br />This book is an interesting read and an intriguing notion in a book that is well-written and includes a program one can implement to remove this item from our diets. For me, though, the jury is out on how practical eliminating wheat from the American Diet can be.<br />[[ASIN:1609611543 Wheat Belly: Lose the Wheat, Lose the Weight, and Find Your Path Back to Health]]
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Awesome follow up to Fifty Shades of Grey! I would highly recomend this series.<br />Loved it from start to finish.
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|I have been enthralled by all things Indiana Jones since Raiders of the Lost Ark came out in 1981.  When the last movie, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull came out a few years back, it created a new interest by younger moviegoers in Indy's adventures, and that was pleasing to me in itself.  I was curious, however, why it took so long for this series to be released on Blu-ray, and after an interminable wait to just get it done, here it is.  And the series has been dusted off, buffed up, and a good amount of bonus material involving the \\"making of..\\" these movies has been released along with the movies.  To Indy junkies it's like nectar from the gods.  To casual viewers, perhaps the bonus material is not all that big a deal.<br /><br />The series now takes up much less space than owning all four of the movies in individual cases; that in itself is a plus, as is the improved quality of the movies itself.  But after all this time, and all the hype, when you open the package you may wonder, as I did, why they had to make the case on the cheap and have you slide the movies into cardboard sleeves instead of mounting them on little hubs as is usually done.  It may be no big deal to the majority of people, but to me it's sort of like someone running their fingernails over a chalkboard to slide a pristine disc in and out of cardboard, which in itself is abrasive and is more so as it picks up dust over time.  I'm sure the movies will continue to play fine for a long period of time, but I am also sure that each time you slide one out, the disc surface will have more and more little micro-scratches marring the surface.<br /><br />A set such as this deserves decent packaging.  In short, the movies are great and worth the wait.  The packaging is cheap in order to save a few cents per set.  There is really no excuse for it, sorry.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A warm and touching story via \\"man's best friend\\". I shed tears more than once but also found a giggle here and there. Thoroughly enjoyed the read.
B0095R64AO|1.0|Why does this movie exist? I can't understand how anyone can sit through this and feel like it was worth a dime. Spend your time taking a nap or staring at the ceiling and you will feel more rewarded than watching this poor excuse for a movie... so horrible...
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I was tempted not to read this due to the size.  In order not to be discouraged I bought it  for my Kindle.  I have been quite surprised at the speed with which I am reading.  It is captivating from the beginning.  I can't wait to have a bit of time to continue reading.  I take my Kindle with me everywhere so I can read it even if it is a page or two.  Great read.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|Smash was my favorite program this season. I love musicals and drama so this was the best of both worlds. When the network was considering cancelling it for a second season I was livid! Thankfully they did not. Now if they would just develop a proper DVD for purchase I shall be in heaven.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This was a good read about the lives of our Navy Seals and this mission in particular.  Heroic events are described in modest terms by the author.

B008ER9QLK|5.0|Wagner championed the idea of reuniting the arts in his famous concept Gesamtkunstwerk (`a total work of art'), where the text, the voices, the music, the acting, the choreography and the staging would provide a unified new entity richer than the sum of its parts. During the last 35 years, there have been numerous new productions, but among them there are three that deserve to be called landmarks: Patrice Chéreau at Bayreuth (1976), Otto Schenk at the Met (1987), and the current one by Robert Lepage. These three different Rings are good examples of how to stage an opera.<br /><br />The \\"Lepage, Levine and Gelb Ring,\\" as Levine called it, can be judiciously considered one of the best achievements of the Met in recent years. Many skeptics have changed their mind after seeing the documentary about the preparation of the new production, \\"Wagner's Dream,\\" where its director, Susan Froemke says that \\"the stagecraft unimaginable in the 19th century has made what seemed impossible possible.\\" The cast, the costumes, the acting, and \\"the machine\\" provided an opportunity to see the Ring with new eyes. And he Blu-ray edition of the Ring and \\"Wagner's Dream\\" is breathtaking.<br /><br />It is important to highlight the large role played by Maestro Levine in the development of this new Ring. Even in his absence, everyone noticed his presence. Since the beginning he told Lepage that in spite of its cosmic dimension the Ring is a very intimate work and advised him to listen to the music and to follow the music. At the end, Lepage found himself completely transformed and said that \\"the Ring is a revolutionary work of art ... You're not the same person once you've done the Ring.\\"  Neither are we after seeing it!

B006LSZECO|3.0|Such a captivating book, page turner, couldn't put it down and I finally get to the end after waiting, waiting, waiting,,,,,,,,, and find that the author seem to run out of steam and instead come up with a quick ending.  I hated it, it didn't seem to fit with the rest of the story (in my opinion!)  I heard the same sentiments from my book club buddies.  Bummer!
B00571F26Y|5.0|This is a great book, so much information and quite eye opening!At times it is alot to get through and at times too much information, but keep reading, it could really change your life! I started reading because I have RA and a family member has celiacs disease. Contains recipes and lots of information which makes alot of sense to me!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Overall an ok ending despite the repeating dialogue that the author uses from the first two books. Since it was starting to get old I'm glad it's over but I must say the whole series was severely overrated
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I like this app more than sleepy time I like how easy it is to play more than 1 sound at once. I think my favorite part of this app is that is has a special sound that gives you dreams.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I wish she would have not edited out the wedding(s) and the other important things that happened later in the book. I hope there is a movie, and I hope there is another book!
B006LSZECO|2.0|Felt all the major characters were equally unlikeable and couldn't wait to finish this disfunctional book.  Kept waiting for something positive to happen (divorce, jail etc.) anything except more sad twists and turns of this pathetic couple.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The book was very intrigueing. I enjoy reading first hand accounts of events and this book was not a let down.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS GREAT. I ENJOY IT EVERY TIME I WATCH IT. IT SHOWS HOW SOME WOULD SACRIFICE A LOT FOR FAMILY AND FRIENDS AND WHAT THOSE SACRIFICES COULD BE. HOW FAR ARE YOU WILLING TO GO?
B008MG1E4A|5.0|If you hold our men and women in uniform close to you're heart, if you respect them and their mission, if you are grateful to all of our soldiers, past and present, then this book is for you. If you don't understand you're freedom in this country and how it became and remains you'res, if you don't understand our American Forces, what they do and how they, themselves deal with you're freedom, if you don't feel anything about our troops and they never enter you're mind, THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU! I would recomend everyone to read this book.

B0050DIWFC|4.0|I read the book thinking one thing all along and that last 20 -pages- BAM! Total twist that left me with a great overall impression of the book. Glad I purchased it.
B009329Y30|5.0|this movie was AWESOME! I LOVED EVERY SECOND OF IT! BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR! WAY BETTER THAN THE NOTEBOOK!
B002QRWJA4|4.0|I really enjoyed watching this with my daughter. They handled it so well, the sets were beautiful and the story was more touching than the older versions I have seen, mainly because the Phantom was so sympathetic.
B00571F26Y|2.0|This book is full of technical and scientific references, as well as charts and graphs. It was hard to understand why I should eliminate wheat from my diet, and how to do it.

B008MEM24S|5.0|I play this on my Kindle Fire on the train going to work.  It's not only fun, but gets the mind working.  I would suggest this for adults who want to keep their mind active and for kids to develop logical thinking skills.

B0064TVQ5E|4.0|It's a good, mindless game of Mahjong. It's a nice way to unwind in the evening. Works great on my Kindle Fire. As a free app I really recommend it.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|You will not regret reading this in the least. It's so full of life lessons that everyone should know and live. This book is food for the soul.
B008M36ER0|1.0|Waste of time and money. Mel must really need money after his troubles and divorce if this is what he is reduced to. I did not expect such a bad, bad movie! I only gave it 1 star because I had to for the review. In reality, it's a negitive 5!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was even more surprising than the previous one - takes a very interesting turn.  Character development is good - plot is not as predictable as one would expect.
B007JUWM64|1.0|This movie was a complete waste of time. It wasn't able to hold my attention for more than 5min. After the opening scene. Every scene was just missing something...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book illustrates and interesting look at what our future could be if the world doesn't make peace with itself.  Very thought provoking - should be on every young person's \\"must read list\\".
B0090EIC3Y|3.0|This movie could have been a lot better. Thus movie was played up to be much more than it really delivered. Glad I only rented it
B006VREN86|5.0|Pilots, by their nature, often tend to drag a little due to character introduction. Or the suffer from low budgeting since no one wants to spend money on a show that might not go anywhere. However, Boardwalk Empire suffered from nothing at all. It was truly a great opening episode from a show I hear continues on with great things through to its current episode. I love how the writers mix fact and fiction to create their vision of Atlantic City. It is so well done, that I often had to look things up to find out which side of the line they fell on! The characters are played well, especially Nucky. The only downside is, I can honestly say that Steve Buscemi naked may truly be one of the more horrifying things I have ever seen on television...
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|The kids like this game. I often times have to take it away from them because they like to keep playing it. I just wished it was a educational but you have to have different types of games when traveling and such to keep them occupied.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I needed this free Adobe Reader so that I can read my emails and attachment on the Kindle Fire. It is a plesure to be able to get this service free of charge.
B000UDNBQW|5.0|If your criteria for a book are \\"good writing\\" and \\"thought-provoking\\", Mr Pip will answer.  It is beautifully written and suprising with an unusual setting and subject (I had to do a google search to figure out where this little island village is from the hints dropped). The author is a master of evocation rather than explanation--I appreciated the small challenge the author allowed me at times of figuring out exactly what was happening and letting the picture come into focus.  While not overwhelmingly happy or depressing, it gives an interesting view into village life in war-torn places.
0375703764|4.0|I got this book as a gift, but I was intrigued the second I picked it up. As several reviewers have mentioned, there are several fonts, some different colors, and a few gimmicks in layout.<br />However hard it is, though, to turn the book over in different directions for a length of the book (there is around a sentence for each page for a while) the story itself gives some retribution to the slightly show-offy style of Danielewski.<br />The story itself is an exploration of madness, and you can feel it immediately with a shifting unreliability through the narrators. With narrations by Zampano (the author of the \\"Navidson Record,\\" the book covering the material of the book mentioning the book after which the title is named) you get the feeling carried in Pale Fire, that the person notating the book is untrustworthy, almost skeeving for money.<br />However, you grow to trust the footnoter (Johnny Truant) as you realize that he's beginning to go mad as you read.<br />Yet another layer is added as you meet the editors, who, as scarce as they are, still carry a resonance through the book worth noting.<br />The genre of the book itself is impressive as well, as there are few books that could be called horror and literature (the only other I'd consider is John Dies at the End).<br />The only problem is the slight level of cheesiness brought in with a small section of the book, consisting of around five sheets and containing a list of names, architectural styles, and engineering components not found in the labyrinth. However, this only goes on for a few pages, and we can almost chalk it up to Zampano's pompousness. This is thus of no problem to Danielewski, since, as most reviewers have mentioned, he is more like Truant or Will Navidson than Zampano.<br /><br />Overall, a good read, well worth the effort.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This a great book! Amazing facts,great detail. I couldnt put it down.<br />I believe these people are heros! Doing a job few of us could even do.<br />Yet the book does not seek to make you idolize the author.<br />It makes you aware of all of the people involved in the process.
B003UYUP58|5.0|This exacting tale of the history of cancer is for those who wonder about medical training hospitals, decisions during training and how medical treatments evolve.  It is a tale about all of us as well clamoring for better modes of treatment and blind trust in those who promote them.  The empathy that the author conveys for his patients and the way he blends their story into that of their treatments is nothing short of remarkable. I am not surprised that this book got the accolades it has - I frankly don't think anyone could have done it better.  The research comments are up to date and reveal a great deal  about why recent, but not past, approaches have led to such an amazing cadre of ways to combat this dreaded disease.
B006Y5FR80|4.0|I am very satisfied with instant video and Amazon.  My husband likes different shows than I do so I often watch mine on my computer and love the instant HD feature.  Smash is particularly a hit.  Thanks Amazon!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|The book is like a good war film. It demonstrate how brave the SEALs are and the sophisticated technology they use to achieve the main result of the mission that they are determinated to do.
B005FISBTO|5.0|What can I say. What initially looked like an issue was immediately remedied by clear responsive solution that resulted in a great customer experience.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|If you like the book series this is a great adaptation, and if you have never read the books it is just as enjoyable. The quality of the streaming was excellent.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|We created a \\"princess\\" bathroom in our home for our 3 year old grand-daughter, she LOVES it! The RoomMates work on the walls, doors, mirror or above the tub. She brings anyone who will go with her to her \\"princess\\" room!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Awesome. Captivating. I couldn't put them down. By far my favorite reads. They are so, I am reading them again.
034580404X|5.0|This book set was amazing!  During the first book I was shocked by how descriptive the author was, she even made me blush at some points.  Then she left a cliffhanger with the second book I had to start the third right away and when it came to the third book I didn't want the story to end.  Though some parts got quite steamy it was an exciting read with a great story line. Add it to your list of must reads!  And definitely buy the boxed set because as soon as you finish the first one you'll want the rest
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|reminds me of the machines at the fair<br />and the amusement parks very lifelike and the game tones are crisp

B003YL4LYI|5.0|I read previous reviews and thought maybe i wouldn't continue reading the series.<br />I am so glad i didn't give up<br />LOVED IT<br />Yes, there were more people added but that just made it more exciting<br />Hope this doesn't end<br />denise
B0013811CE|5.0|I had only seen the name of the program while flipping through the TV guide. It wasn't until a friend of mine told me about the show did I start tuning into season 4. I was so intrigued by the story line that I had to watch from the very begining to fully understand everything that had transpired. The transformation of Mr. White from the meek bumbling teacher to the kick-ass cook is what got me hooked. Not since Fox's Prison Break series have I been so captured by a TV show. Good job AMC!
B0084BMUFA|4.0|Enjoyed it completely. Read it on my iPad but it was easier to get the book through you. I am now thinking about buying your new kindle device as my reader.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I have to say I enjoyed the first book but the writing in the second book is just flat out bad. The sex scenes are boring and the storyline is dull. I will not be wasting my time with the third.
B007PVHMCG|4.0|From what many of the Lego sites are saying, Lego will be releasing more this October, so please do not be ripped off by the resellers. Wait for Amazon to have more in stock.<br /><br />It is a fun set, especially if you are a minecraft fan.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|A fast pace engaging read that kept one guessing througout. An interesting concept that gives one pause to reflect on the future of the human race. A fun read.
B007W7P5L8|5.0|I had a zippered case for my Kindle Fire but it wasn't a stand kind so I decided to give this one a try. I must admit that I love this one. It was so easy to \\"snap\\" the Kindle into place & the stand is very sturdy. The color is great & I like the textured feel of the case.<br />It shipped the next day & I had my new case in no time at all.<br />I would highly recommend this case to anyone who has a Kindle Fire & I so wish I would have bought mine a long time ago.<br />The only down side is that there is no pocket for my earbuds but that's not a huge deal breaker for me.
B0060FXDCG|5.0|I have always been a fan of the Transformers. Even as a kid I used to watch the cartoons with my older brother. I really really loved the movies & how accurate it was to when I was younger.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I am very disappointed in this book. The subject is a total turn off and the writing does nothing to encourage me to finish the book. I read a few pages a day. This book was purchased from Amazon where I buy all of my Kindle books and am usually not<br />disappointed, by what I receive for my Fire eReader.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|But that's OK. They do get to go on living. I usually avoid post apocolyptic novels like the plague (pun intended). I am pleased to report, however, that Suzanne Collins has the ability to manage a potentially gruesome subject with humanity and grace. Mockingjay and the entire Hunger Games triology is a good read precisely because it's \\"real\\". There's a feeling that the story could almost have been pulled from today's headlines, but twisted just enough to keep you off balance. This is a book, a series, that makes you think - about those in power, about how people are manipulated by those in power, and about how one person can change the course of world events. And then continue living their ordinary life (or as ordinary as anyone's life may appear to outsiders). I recommend it, and look forward to reading more of Ms. Collins' work.
B0058W74UY|4.0|It works, but with any programs, has its share of bugs.  Hard to replicate them so it's not too terrible.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I enjoyed it - against my better judgement. The thought of young people being forced to participate in a killing sport left me cold. However, I watched the movie, Hunger Games, and was intrigued by how well the true theme, over-throw of the entrenched establishment, was woven into the story line. I read Catching Fire to statisfy my curiosity -- what happened next? It's not the usual second book \\"filler\\" in a triology. Ms. Collins does an outstanding job of managing a difficult subject with grace and humanity, and continues to move the story forward in a logical, satisfying manner. When I got to the end of the book, I bought Mockingjay because, well, it held the answer to the classic question, \\"And then?\\"
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Even the last book was good, sometimes only the first one has the good story but not the rest but not here, all three books are pretty good.  I didn't want it to end but it was a good ending, sometimes you're left saying, \\"That's it?\\" But not here.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Started watching the  tv show and loved it so I decided to read the book series. Very good and so many twist and turns.  Lots of surprises.  Am excited to see the next season  on tv to see how well they follow the books. Kind fun to know what may happen to the characters.
B0085Z8F4A|1.0|\\"THE TRICK, WILLIAM POTTER, IS NOT MINDING THAT IT SUCKS.\\"  David Ex Machina ... The Magic Plot Robot    That statement succinctly encapsulates the psychological crux of The Apologists for this weak film, \\"Prometheus\\"; a film that never rises above being a paltry attempt at quality and sophistication by piggy-backing a money-in-the-bag, kit-bashed franchise with a tired, tawdry decorum of Greek mythology, quasi-Oedipal/pseudo-Shakespearean familial neuroses, and trickerated cookie-cutter stock characters. Basically, this is what happens when the conceptual and thematic becomes married to the pretentious and banal.This film is what happens when the story concept of \\"structure\\" becomes a deaf-dumb buzzword; this story is what happens when you become too comfy-cozy with the Big Hollywood Industrial Complex; when profundity becomes diluted in a rationalized 'Loud, Dumb & Obvious' school-of-thought; when a filmmaker apparently becomes intoxicated with the guaranteed myth of his own \\"Visionary\\" label; when said filmmaker's projected response to logical critique is his own precedental \\"Don't Try And Rationalize With Me\\"; when a film is made with an in-built, plausibly deniable, schizoid nature that simultaneously denies being a 'direct, solid' prequel (that merely has \\"strands of Alien DNA\\") while possessing a structure, idiom, and iconography that is not only wholly predicated on that first film, but betrays a shallow, derivative creativity.Apparently, the conceptual premise of \\"Prometheus\\" entailed the exploration of 'something' derived (or inspired) from the Alien mythos (or should I stress, in this case, FRANCHISE),but the result lacked any profundity or any actual 'exploration' (theological/existential discussions with disembodied android heads notwithstanding).I find it almost mind-boggling to what degree this film is rife with plot 'illogic'. There is a sustained stream of sappy, simplistic narrative, dramatic oddities and weaknesses that just keep on begging frustrating questions.  I think I'm going to refer to this film as \\"Plan 9 From LV-426\\" from now on.
B004PLT3TY|5.0|I was very happy to find a movie that didn't have bad language or inappropriate content.  My kids 9 & 11 really enjoyed this movie.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great book.  Waste of time prosecuting the author because nothing we didn't hear from the administration already.  Great read! Loved it!
B003XRELEI|2.0|Vonnegut's anti-modern world narcissism is a boring journey into little minds.  Difficult to keep paying attention to it.  The drawings / cartoons contribute so little.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|A gripping ground-level view of the experience of one SEAL who play a significant role in the death of Osama Bin Laden. Includes some parts of his selection and training for the SEAL team, as well as other missions. Missing is any connection between his thoughts and emotions on the job and how they connect with him as a complete person, because he made the decision to include nothing about any partner/children he may have. While I understand and respect the choice, the ground-level view is most powerful when you can more fully understand the author as an individual.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I served in Vietnam with the Underwater Demolition Teams, the forerunner of today's SEALs. NO EASY DAY is a reality check and a fast moving chronicle from the life of our elite warriors. It is not a political statement, nor does it appear to reveal sensitive or classified information. Nonetheless, it does demonstrate the disconnect between the \\"inside the beltway\\" mentality and the guy whose life, and those of his teammates, are on the line. My son served in Afghanistan for a year and I heard, first hand, about the ludicrous engagement protocols that are revealed in NO EASY DAY. Forgive my prejudice, but my sympathies lie with our warriors, not the super-wimps who overpopulate Washington DC. The ones who dictate policies that have nothing to do with breaking things and killing the enemy. Above all else, we owe our fighting men the right to win. Don't send them to war if that is not the endgame. This story lances a long-festering boil and desperately needed to be told.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book carries you along with it as it unfolds in unexpected ways.  Most original and intriguing.  Well thought out.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Describing the mission was riveting. But getting to it was not. I've read a number of Navy Seal related books now and they all pretty much follow the same format and script. That's not to say that I'm not totally humbled and impressed by all the Mark Owen's that fight for us day and night.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|An eye opening account of the mission to kill Osama Bin Laden, whose end was much more humane than the end of his 9/11 victims.  It is also an indepth look at the dedication, training, courage and determination of one segment of the warrior class, without which our nation could not exist.  These brave souls deserve our unfailing respect.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I don't need yesterday's weather. It appears this app tries to connect as soon as the Kindle is turned on, which is before the wifi has a chance to come on. This leads to a frustrating &quot;Connectivity lost, try again later&quot; message when the app is used. Without a refresh option, one can only wait until it decides to connect automatically, which is, like, twenty minutes later. Accuweather is a much better app.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Not the type of book I usually read, but it's nice to get a behind the media curtain look at what really goes on.  I admire him for putting this book out.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Has everything needed in a basic weather app. Wind can be displayed in knots, which is good for pilots. 15 day forecast is helpful.
0525953728|5.0|As many other reviewers describe... this book was hard to put down. The author is clearly a highly motivated self-less team oriented individual...I read it on two plane trips and found it compelling.<br /><br />So much has been said in other reviews that its hard to come up with anything original other than what I say above: Thank Heavens that these guys are on our side!!<br /><br />God Bless them!
B00005N6KG|5.0|I bought at least 5 different kinds of earbuds and over-the-head on amazon, ranging from $6 - $25, from SONY, Panasonic, Skull Candy, and Seinheiser.  This has perhaps the best price-to-quality ratio.  I can't speak to durability, but just on sound, this is quite outstanding.  It's ultra comfortable and super light.  For everyday, in-house use, it's great.  For airplane, at least get the earbud to isolate some of the ambient sound.
0399226907|5.0|This was one of my favorite books growing up. I think because it had so much food in it.<br />Really cute book for kids.<br />And the illustrations are great as well.<br />A true children's classic!
B007MJKOY4|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the entire production! However, my wife was bored through most segments and I doubt my adult children would even watch it. The story is 'old-school, cold war, spystuff.'  LeCarre is a master spy novelist and I have read many of his books, including this one. The movie settings are amazingly dreary and period accurate! The actors nailed the characters and were believable. The intrigue and tensions created were climaxed nicely and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie! There is very little computer generated special effects or razzle-dazzle, gratuitious action or violence etc. It is reminiscent of the \\"Spy Who Came In from the Cold\\" with Richard Burton . . . or the \\"Ipcress File\\" . . . type of movies. I love my old spy thriller novels and those genre of movies. BTW, Gary Oldman was truly perfect for this role! WOW!
B008CB9JJ2|1.0|Very disappointing. Paul Auster is eager to inundate his readers with details about his early years that even dedicated fans will find less than riveting. Long lists of his childhood sensations make for poor reading.  At some point he at last starts to tell a story (the plot of a  n movie) that demonstrates his skils as a raconteur. But alas, after a few pages, it is back to the lists.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This took courage to write the book and to live the book. We Americans have no idea what it takes to keep us free. This book gives a look into that world. I remember the information that we given on the TV news, newspapers, blogs and internet sites. As I read the book I knew what we were told and then what really happened.  Thank you for writing it. God bless you and your family.<br />PLEASE, every one read this book.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I had just finished \\"Gone Girl\\" by gifted author Gillian Flynn and immediately began reading her \\"Dark Places\\".  The author's organization of the story line and her style of writing are superb. Your interest is held to the very end of the novel. I have recommended both books to my family and friends.
B0090EIC3Y|5.0|I found this movie to be very funny and entertaining. If you enjoyed Borat then I would recommend this movie.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I normally spin hours on this app just browsing. It's great for looking for DIY projects, wedding ideas, and it has TONS of ideas for ways to do your hair.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|it helped me out a ton I recomend it because it is spectacular and amazing and fantabioulos and al that good stuff
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Angry Birds is my favorite game! I'm a young granny and don't care for the \\"running/fighting\\" type games. Angry Birds takes a tiny bit of skill and is a great way to kill time (and egg-stealing pigs!) This version, without the distracting ads, is far more enjoyable than the paid ad versions.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|i love the book the way it was told and it was the same as the 60 minutes interview which makes the obama bunch liars.i also like to go to taco bell for a seal meal, which i think could be as big as the chick filet day if taco bell chose to do it.just like mark said ubl was a creep that hid behind women when it came time to fight.a lot of great stories to get mark to that day.since barry got ubl why dont he go back to the middle east and talk to them instead of hidding be hind hillary oh yeah thats what ubl did.just in case barry is a mystery,its pebo or barry hussein oblamo!!5stars the book was easy to read and i couldnt put it down.i just wish barry would stop lying to the american people.wish u well mark.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I have read Gillian Flynn's other novels & instantly became a huge fan of her work. I was so excited to read her newest book. Unfortunately it was not on par with her previous novels.  Overall it was ok.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This book was recommended by Amazon and I liked the review so before I bought it I sampled the book and I really enjoyed it.  I went ahead and purchased it. I like literature and this book was well written with a good story.  It was a little sad at times but the story was very interesting and the characters well rounded.  I was sad when I finished the book as I had got to know the characters who were likeable. The story is pretty different which I loved - not pedicatble.  Definitely worth reading.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The author does a fantastic job developing the characters through their thoughts, journaling, conversations and clever prose, so you really get to know them - but wait! Do you really know them? You like them. No, you don't! Yes, you do! If you haven't read the book, STOP here. Nick, use your brain! Figure it out - don't fall into her clutches again! After I invested so much mental advice to all of the characters, the ending was just unacceptable so I was compelled to write my own ending! There - That's better!
0385344333|5.0|I couldn't believe some of the negative reviews I read here, so I had to give my own. Lee Child wrote a book that highlights the intelligence & instinct that Jack Reacher has accumulated from all his investigative experience. The story makes you \\"think\\" and follow all the situations that Lee weaves in this story. The negative reviews appear to want Jack kicking somebodys butt every other chapter, wreaking mayhem & shooting the bad guys. Jack is always analyzing the situation in putting some one else in danger or the odds in a successful attack in all situations. As I read the book, with all the situations occurring, all the different characters and clues, I became more & more engrossed in analyzing the clues as to what was going on. Was the waiteress really burned in the car or was it someone else? As I read the book I became more & more involved in the story to the point that I couldn't put it down. My wife had started reading the book before I did on her IPad and I had the hardback. She was way ahead of me, but I caught her & passed her up. Apparently low intellect becomes bored if Jack isn't constantly kicking somebodys butt. In the end Jack did his usual kick ass job of knocking off the bad guys and giving payback for the FBI agent he came to like. I have read ALL the Jack Reacher books more than once, so Lee Child, keep them coming, as \\"JACK REACHER IS THE MAN YOU DON'T MESS WITH\\".
B0085RZGYU|2.0|I get that this is not supposed to be \\"literature\\" and so should not be reviewed as such, but this book was really really weak.  There was really no character development to speak of, the setting and plot where just as weak and the whole idea was really pretty blah.  What really frustrated me was that the climax of the book took place in the exact same location s one of his previous books.  Seriously?  In a nutshell this book had the feel of being dashed off very quickly and from everything that I heard this not what Baldacci is known for.  Do yourself a favor and grab one of his other books.<br /><br />The only reason I did not give it one star is because I (for some reason) finished it.
B008I3R2VG|3.0|I just bought the new killers album. And its a good album. Runaways is the best song on the album. Flesh and bone-the way it was-here with me are really good. But i do admit there are too many ballads. And it does get boring after awhile. And it sounds too much like U2 and bruce springteen at times. So i give this album 3 stars.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|pretty cool game. worth giving a try. great time consumer for people with time on their hands. need more games like this :)
B0092MKFIY|5.0|IT's the best, I listen to the music everyday and brag about it to all of my friends.. Its great music to listen to that is clean and enjoyable to listen to!!
B008F5YDRI|5.0|Wonderfully inspiring. Beautifully portrayed. Parodoxical but believable (with a stretch), great imagination. Actors all superb. Outstanding cinematography. Want to see again soon.
B00555X8OA|5.0|This book is excellent. Well written with down-to-earth examples. It is thought provoking as to how you yourself think fast and slow, and also to situations in your life where you can apply the insights.
0525953728|5.0|After completing this book , this a.m., I'll start by saying that the current seventy three \\"one star\\" review writers, on Amazon, should be ashamed of themselves.  Not for giving this book one star, but for attacking the author, accusing him of \\"war crimes\\" , being a \\"criminal\\", being an \\"egomaniac\\", \\"cashing in\\", \\"revealing secrets\\", \\"endangering lives\\", etc. , etc.  It's clear that the vast majority of those reviews did not even read the book, and many of them fully admit it.  The concept of \\"buy the book, read it, review it\\" seems to be far too complicated for them to follow.<br /><br />While I have to give a nod to the fact that I am unclear as to whether or not Mark Owens could legally write this book, it strikes me as odd that these days there are racks of books written by SEALS and about SEAL operations.  In addition, you can flip around your tv dial and easily find documentaries about SEAL activities, such as how they train, what they do, what weapons they use, etc.<br /><br />Soon after this raid took place, we had details and photos of the crashed helicopter, the compound, the conditions inside OBL's home, blood stains,  the paths that the helicopters took, where they refueled, etc.  Within days of the announcement, we had all this detail, and countless articles.<br /><br />This book cleared up a few details for me, and answered questions that have been on my mind about what must have gone on inside that compound.  The book was well written, even toned, and the author credits everybody involved and takes no credit at all, other than being in the right place to get picked for the team.  People that insist otherwise, have not read the book.<br /><br />In comparison, this book is nothing at all like the fictional accounts that Dick Marcinko writes, and while enjoyable, they are a bit over the top.  This book is serious but moves at a fast pace.<br /><br />I think a lot of people really don't care to read these kind of details, (what was it like getting out ofPakistan, low on fuel, and Pakistan fighter jets were scrambled?), for me, it provided insight into what the mission was like, and provided non-essential details of the final moments when OBL was brought to justice.<br /><br />I think  you would be hard pressed to read this book and not take a moment to reflect on the heroic sacrifices that the military and groups like Team 6 make for us, so many can sit behind their keyboards and talk trash about a book they have not read.  I highly recommend this book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this game. Its very fun and addicting. You start and then you want to keep going to the next levels.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|As someone with a background in Law Enforcement and SRT, I was a little concerned regarding all the recent hype about the author divulging too many tactical or intelligence tricks-of-the-trade. The book is straight forward,informative and interesting. I don't believe the author discusses anything tactical that hasn't been previously put out there or openly speculated. This is not only a well told record of events, but sets the record straight on the types of men we count on to perform these types of actions. For all the rhetoric on TV, the major news shows/carriers and our elected officials have done for more damage educating our enemies on tactics and unit capabilities. It is \\"they\\" who have put our soldiers and operators at increased risk, all for the sake of the spotlight for a 30 second sound byte!
B00881VLCE|4.0|not crazy about the puzzles. offered. need to be able to upload your own pics and convert them into puzzles.  you have to buy additional puzzles
B0061PEAUY|4.0|Having read all the \\"Bones\\" books I was anxious to read the latest and it did not disappoint. Would like to see Tempe and Ryan get it on though....maybe next book.
B007RI56NY|4.0|Love just about all the songs on this album.  saw train in concert this week, and although I love all their previous albums too, i was bummed that they didn't play more songs off this one, considering bands tour to promote their current albums.  Definitely worth buying the whole album!!!
B0052RDHTM|3.0|his books are very long, I think they could be less pages but he is a good writer, gets the readers imagination going.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book has a great storyline and in this you go through all the emotions with the characters and a surprise twist at the end.  Very good book can't wait to see the movie.
0385040253|5.0|Book received as advertised, swiftly and in excellent shape. This has been an ideal ebay experience. I recommend this vendor for future purchases.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book kind of surprised me. It was every where in the stores so I decided to read it not knowing what it was about. Pretty shocked. It is like a train wreck....completely wrong but you can't help but keep reading. I seriously do not know how they will make a movie out of this book. I will buy the next one when I finish this one.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|yay!  I so happy. I have wanted this game to come out on kindle!!!!!! I love this game!!!!!!  its SOOO AwEsOmE!!!!!!!!!!!
B0087HT36U|5.0|This is a  nice game to play on a large screen TV, I'm using an MK802 Android PC  (ebay about 50.00) using a mouse. runs great, looks great and the game play is very good. Also plays nice on my Transformer tablet.
B0014EU5XI|2.0|Title says it all.  I was really liking their sound for pretty much all the tracks, but nearly half the tracks have disappointing lyrics.  Sometimes the music is too xtian, other times (more times) the music is too disrespectful to women.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I have been hooked on this for weeks.  my only issue is that at higher speeds the framerate dips noticeably.  To the person sayong you have to rebuy gadgets to recomplete achievements, that simply isnt true.  I'm on my third run through and haven't rebought anything.<br /><br />This is a solid fun game.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Tried this app to print something from my Kindle Fire to a wireless printer and was surprised that it worked as well as it did.  Neat app.  Well worth installing if you intend to marry your smartphone or Kindle Fire to your wireless printer.
B007FIY3VW|4.0|For $.99 it is pretty hard to beat. Compatible with Microsoft Office, read/create, syncs with Dropbox, Google Docs, etc...way better than dropping $15 for some of the others. I give it four stars because nothing is absolutely perfect.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|great white noise machine enabling and encouraging sound sleep.  Gave it as a gift and it was much appreciated by our friends who can never sleep.
B006HTUZ1C|4.0|but it's not! Once you get a screen full of numbers, you find out you aren't quite as quick with sums as you thought!  Fun and humbling.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|EXCELLENT OVERVIEW OF THE TRAINING AND ELIMINATION OF A KILLER/TERRORIST.  THIS SEAL DESERVES A MEDAL FOR HIS HONESTY AND DETAILING OF THE EVENTS THAT ELIMINATED THIS KILLER.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|LOVED all three books - wish there were more. I would love for the storyline to continue until they get old.
B0070NSPCU|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It fits nicely with modern epic fantasy somewhere between David Anthony Durham's Acacia series and Patrick Rothfuss' Kingkiller Chronicles. I enjoyed the first half of the book more than the second half, where the main character seems to be in a depressive mood and the comeraderie with his brothers is gone. Still, it is definitely worth the time.
B00846REIS|5.0|I had trouble putting this one down it was so good.  Can't wait for the 2nd book to come out in October & hopefully more to follow.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|If you're a fan of the Blues and Muddy Waters, you will love this CD/DVD combo.  I'm not a huge Stones fan, but it's cool listening to Mick and Muddy together.  Definitely recommend.
B008ZTVQLA|5.0|Ian Hunter continues to rock! Cogent and sensitive lyrics are supported by his typically pure form of rock n roll.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game really gets the blood boiling!  I would rather not run out of time.  You really get your moneys worth!
B006RUJST6|2.0|i thought this would be the intelligent young adult book i've been looking for (unsuccessfully), because of the rave reviews. but it isnt. i found it very superficial and shallow. the writer didnt dig deep at all, kinda smudged everything over. the characters are very flat and the storyline very expected. had she taken the time and givven it some depth i would have enjoyed it much more. it feels like a missed opertunity to take young adut litrature to the next level.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love this app on my kindle! i had tons of problems with the pinterest website on my kindle but this solved all of the issues....now i am addicted to pinterest!
B007MDB71O|5.0|I have read all the Cronicles or Mars and this movie is how I imagined it to be and more.  It flopped at the theaters but I believe it will gain a cult status.  I hope more will follow.  Outstanding job bringing this book to life!!!!!!!!!!  For all the Edgar Rice Burroughs fans out there you will not be disappointed.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|Even though Andy will surely be missed for the roler he played in Spartacus, Liam fills the gap as best as he could.  The actors did great, love the show, but only one more season remains.  I will be watching these over and over again.
B001NTZV4W|4.0|This album is quite interesting. Similar to his JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EATTH album Rick is the master of the keyboards.  Masterful at his craft and dramatic in his interpretations of musical styles of what it was like centuries ago. I still prefer the JOURNEY album but still like listening to this as well.
B007RXRSEY|5.0|I do not consider myself a Slash fan, but I do like some of his older music from Guns n Roses, Velvet Revolver, and now his own album with Myles Kennedy.  Great album, great songs, great music, enough said.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This is the most helpful book I have read. I recommend it for all couples, men and women. I'm surprised this book wasn't written earlier in time, the logic and format in which it's written makes it a good reference.
B008BIZ06M|5.0|I own a few different Offspring albums, and love them all. The CD starts strong and finishes strong.  This is a very solid album and they still got skills to make the hits.
B000FC1MM8|4.0|This was a suspenseful book and very good reading. Kept my interest until the end. Harry gets into many  scrapes but comes out smelling like a rose, He also attracts women although he seems to not be the settling down kind. THis is a fun series.
B0064Y5U24|4.0|I think I liked Dark Horse better, but this one is not too bad.  Some of the songs take a little while getting used to but it definately sounds like Nickelback.  If you are a Nickeback fan pick it up.
B00913DPW2|5.0|I loved going thru The Haunt on my Kindle Fire but I have upgraded to the Kindle Fire HD and can't get this game yet on it.  I am so looking forward to being able to get it again and going back thru it again but getting all of the way to the end.
B004CAWKXE|4.0|Welcome to the black parade was a better overall album, but this one is not bad.  They are a good band I am looking forward to their next album.  Takes a little while getting used to their lighter style, but it flows.  Picked this album up for a $5 special since I liked their previous albums.
B0087HT36U|1.0|A fun and entertaining app with many levels of play. You may have to buy super bombs to clear a few levels
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is a physical work-out, as my muscles tense when I make the guy jump! Fun and addictive!! I really like it, so far!
B000SGSU58|4.0|From the first page we fear for Harry's future. So many possibilities and so few options. Harry is at his best in deciphering this complex tale with a full historical connection and a new woman in his life. A good read to be sure!
B00846REIS|2.0|I read 50 shades before reading this book and i felt that his was 50 shades on speed.  The book moved too fast.  I did not enjoy this at all.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|This is my second time at reading this book.  It is just as good this time, maybe more.  Most readers know you can' t read the first chapter and decide if you like it.  This book you really need to read a few chapters.
0307352145|4.0|I feel like I've been on a crusade for years to educate people about introverts (otherwise known as \\"my people!\\").  As Susan Cain points out in her excellent book, Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking, it's an extrovert's world out there in America--even though introverts make up 33-50 % of it (depending on which study you follow).  Cain writes, \\"We live with a value system that I call the Extrovert Ideal--the omnipresent belief that the ideal self is gregarious, alpha and comfortable in the spotlight.\\"  Speaking from experience, I can say that it's tough to be an introvert in the loud, boisterous world of the United States and I constantly have to explain to people what the word really means.    A lot of people still believe that introverts are \\"people haters.\\"  Nothing could be further from the truth!  Cain writes, \\"Probably the most common--and damaging--misunderstanding about personality type is that introverts are antisocial and extroverts are pro-social.  But...neither formulation is correct; introverts and extroverts are differently social.\\"  With their capacity to bring focus and depth to relationships, introverts make great friends.  They might be slow to warm up at first, but once they commit, they commit!  At work, they might not have the loudest voice, but they are usually the most prepared people in the room and have carefully thought out their ideas from multiple angles.  But it's easy to dismiss introverts, because they are quiet and slow to draw attention to themselves.  There are times when loud and gregarious is what is needed in a situation.  But we already know that.  Extroverts are already revered in our culture.  It's high time to recognize there is also a time for \\"quiet strength\\" (also the title of a biography about Rosa Parks).  And that's just what Susan Cain's book does.    Cain traces the origins of the Extrovert Ideal in America and fascinatingly contrasts it with Asian countries and cultures which have moreof an Introvert Ideal.  It's fascinating to think about how cultural standards figure in such matters as politics, particularly as we look ahead to our Presidential election in November.  From observation, it seems to me that both President Obama and Governor Romney exhibit some pretty classic introvert traits.  Is this a weakness?  Or could it, in certain ways, be a strength?  Cain makes the observation that \\"people followed Moses because his words were thoughtful, not because he spoke them well.\\"    Cain wisely writes, \\"Bill Gates is never going to be Bill Clinton, no matter how he polishes his social skills, and Bill Clinton can never be Bill Gates, no matter how much time he spends alone with a computer.  We might call this the 'rubber band theory' of personality.  We are like rubber bands at rest.  We are elastic and can stretch ourselves, but only so much.\\"  If I interview for a ministry position again, I think it would behoove me to explain my personality type and the \\"rubber band theory\\" to a call committee.  Cain writes that we can stretch ourselves far outside our comfort zone in a job successfully if we are doing it for deeply help values or goals.  However, if we do that much stretching, we must build in regular \\"restorative niches\\" so that we don't burn out.  These niches are quiet time apart from the demands of job and the stretching of our personalities.  These times must be guarded and protected.    The light bulb moment for me in reading Susan Cain's book is that introversion is not just where we get our energy (from lots of interaction with people or from time alone), but why we get our energy that way.  Extroverts have a high need for lots of stimulation.  They like being in noisier, busier environments.  They are the life of the party and need to be where the party is happening.  They like risks, too.  Having too little stimulation will de-energize them.  Introverts, on the other hand, need far less stimulation.  Not no stimulation; just less.  This means that introverts do indeed get lonely.  They need friends and socializing too.  They enjoy people.  They just need less of this stimulation than extroverts do.  And keep in mind, the stimulation is not only about people.  Busy, loud environments are great to extroverts.  Introverts quickly begin to feel overwhelmed in such places.  That's why open office plans can be so de-energizing for introverts, while extroverts might thrive on them.    Overall, I found this book immensely helpful and informative in understanding my personality better and in being better able to explain it to others.  I found insights for how to use my personality in relationship with my extroverted family members and friends and to better understand where they are coming from.  There were insights for the workplace, for church, for marriage, for parenting, and for friendships.  Both extroverts and introverts would benefit from this book.    I have two areas of critique.  The first is that for those who interpret the Bible literally (as I do), the references to evolution in the development of the different personality types might be a bit annoying.  My advice: just ignore that part and take from the book what you can.  The second critique is that at times the book becomes bogged down in detailed and sometimes confusing research.  Don't give up on it, though.  There is a lot of good information here even in the midst of all the data.    4 stars out of 5.  Recommended.

B0028MBKVG|5.0|I wear the Vibram Five Finger \\"shoes\\" nearly everywhere.  People approach me and ask me about them all the time.  A few of the people that approach me mentioned this book and all spoke emphatically about it.  So, I downloaded it and I too am incredibly enthusiastic about how good it is.  It was nothing like I expected a non fiction book to be.  The \\"characters\\" in the book are all amazing and the book has caused me to do much more research into these people.<br /><br />If you enjoy jogging, running or just walking, this book will motivate you to keep at and maybe push a bit harder, and keep you entertained.<br /><br />Buy it NOW!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Provocative story with very sensual language that feeds the readers imagination.  The plot of the story has many twists and keeps the readers attention.  Sensual yet romantic.  Good transition from book to book.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is a book I couldn't put down.  Tell's it like it is and what a dribute to our Seals.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Great movie, great story, great message. My three year old son loves it. He first saw it in the theater, and then I found it for a great price on Amazon. Didn't hesitate to buy it. Typically don't let my kid watch too much TV, but I have no problem letting him watch this movie.

B004W2UBYW|3.0|I flew through  beginning of the book, but sputtered in the end. The author kept repeating the same theme over and over. Plus, it got tiring reading about how abusive Jobs was.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|never thought I would have spent so much time dropping coins but this game is surprisingly fun. fun fun fun
B007KOYEOC|5.0|I would recommend the trilogy of Fifty shades. My favourite was the second and third but all are brilliant. Wish there were more to read couldn't put them down.
B004CFBMRY|5.0|Wow, what a book!  A fast-paced and well-written story that combines a feeling of reading fiction with an accurate account of a true-life story.  I was absolutely blown away and couldn't put it down, to the extent that I read it while running on the treadmill!  It gives a fascinating account of the Tarahumara people and the world of extreme endurance running.  If you don't go out and start running after reading this...nothing will get you off your sofa!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I put off reading this book for a while because I thought the subject matter was a bit strange. While on vacation someone had the book and convinced me to read it.  I did and really enjoyed it.  I immediately recommended it to my husband who also enjoyed it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have been reading more in the last month or so, stumbling upon books that are recommended after finishing each book...I read a review and took the dive into Wool.  I found it a bit like...huh? in the very beginning, I don't normally read sci fi...anyway, once past the first book, could not put it down and blew right through the rest...read them! you will love it!  Captivating, you really, really want to know what's coming next!
B007M6OIF8|5.0|Loved Walking Dead season 2 put more shows like this  I like watching new content like this and more free shows for praim members.
1400052181|5.0|I was very pleased with my purchase. The book was described accurately and I have no complaints. Would definitely purchase from this buyer again.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game is fun &amp; addictive!  If you like hidden object games you'll really like this one! I played on my kindle fire &amp; had no problems @ all!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Eye opening. If you had any doubt about what sacrifices our service men make day to day, read this book. If you want to know the truth about what happened on the mission that killed Osama bin laden from a first hand perspective, and not from politicians or news reporters, read this book. It was really a good read. I could not put it down.
0385344333|3.0|CAUTION: MILD SPOILER FOLLOWS<br /><br />One of the qualities of Lee Child's writing in the Reacher novels has traditionally been his conspicuous commitment to the reader (intentional use of the past tense here).<br />Even though you could always detect a recurring inventory of familiar and idiosyncratic constants in Reacher stories, Child managed to reduce them to background noise and to fashion a well paced and fluid plot around them, populated by characters of real literary interest because of their relationships with (and often against) the title character.  This book was the first in the series for which, to me, that background noise was intrusive and distracting. In the past I found Reacher's unique moral code, his personal detachment, his casual brutality, and his Univac mental processes to be simply the canvas on which Child painted an entertaining and engaging story with just enough twists and jolts to hold my avid interest. In \\"Wanted Man\\" those same character traits very nearly become a shroud, or at least a scrim, that covers the painting.  In part that's the result Child's unspectacular artistic rendering on this particular canvas, but it's also a case of too many applications of a good thing and in toxic doses.<br />In past outings Reacher's size, strength, and deadly dexterity have played almost as sources of embarrassment to him.  They occur casually, naturally in the narrative, and we all (Reacher included) accept them as the unamplified context of the story. In the past the same could be said for his unusual mental gifts. But in this book, Reacher stands posing and preening like a bodybuilder in the glow of his arcane wealth of information, spouting not just muzzle velocities and anatomical trivia but enough obscure agricultural, geological, and hydrological detail to bore an Iowa farmer.  Would anyone, whether he's a walking precision timepiece or not, actually be able to spout off the rankings of states by population? By gross domestic product?<br />In other books Reacher has suffered field casualties among his friends with contained, stoic fury.  Not so here, but why vault so egregiously over the top? Would anyone, grizzled, veteran warrior or not, crawl away from the newly massacred corpse of a female colleague and tell another distressed, female colleague, \\"Shit happens. Get over it\\"?<br />My first inkling of concern over Lee Child's commitment to his loyal readership came with the announcement that Jack Reacher would be portrayed on the big screen by Tom Cruise.  Don't get me wrong; I greatly admire the action role accomplishments of this versatile actor. But Reacher, he AIN'T.  And then I read of the other character-killing liberties Child has allowed Tinseltown to impose upon the story they'll bring to movie houses... Reacher isn't even a road-roaming vagabond; he's a COP, for God's sake. Now how is THAT going to play if this book (Wanted Man) goes Hollywood? Or any of several others in which Reacher's hobo status is pivotal to the tale (Nothing to Lose, for instance).<br />I not only enjoy but actually demand authors who write for their readers.  I'll give Child and Reacher an opportunity to recover that status, but I'm alert to the possibility that this franchise has run its course. I'm fortunate to have found another compelling line of diversion in Craig Johnson's series featuring Walt Longmire.  If you give it a try, I suggest you start at the beginning with \\"Cold Dish.\\" It sets a deft and beautiful tone for all that follows.r />In other books Reacher has suffered field casualties among his friends with contained, stoic fury.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|The entire series... AMAZING!!! A breath of fresh air, a different intense love story. Definitely a page turner I cannot wait for the movies.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is pure trash.  I can't believe it is so popular.  It is the worst book I have read in ten years.  I wish I had not purchased it
B00881VLCE|3.0|I spent hours downloading and. paying for new puzzles yet they never showed up on my device. I really wanted to like this but there is no way to see what you have downloaded or already paid for when you get a new puzzle.
B005IGZUTC|1.0|After reading I heart New York, I thought this book would be just as good.  It is not and I still haven't finished it.  Slow going because it just does not pull the reader into the story. A bit too silly for me.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I chose this rating because this book was the best book in the hole entire world besides the Hunger Games
B008K3HRF0|5.0|My 2 year old and 4 year old love this movie, mostly because of the music!  Such great songs, cute characters, not scary, great theme!  We love it.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book blew me away. The writing is descriptive and brings the excitement (terror) and immediacy of the action to you. I would say that this is reminiscent of a medieval Dune, rather than being like LoTR or the Belgariad. I definitely recommend this book to any lover of political drama or fantasy.
B003V1WTMM|4.0|I have yet to finish this novel but have been spellbound from the first page.  Once again Kate Morton takes us from present day back in history to present the entire picture.  Great read so far!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The story jumps around so much that it throws you off. It seems to me that this is caused by the editing process, as it is so jerky and disjointed.
B0058YPL66|3.0|I admit to being hooked on this show, but mostly for the concept.  There is something second rate about the characterizations and the scripts and so on that is somewhat offputting: the really intriguing parts of the show are the twists on the original versions, but much of the working out of them is less inspired: the shock value -- which the writers do a lot of -- wears off after a couple of minutes, and one is back into conspiracies and such.  It is interesting that fairy tales are so deeply archetypal, and so trying to \\"ordinari-ize\\" them ought not to work, but the barrenness of contemporary life makes for a nice foil against the faery world.  I just wish it was a little wilder. (Though now that Season 2 is underway, it is in fact getting a bit wilder -- anything Jane Espensen is involved with is always intriguing).<br /><br />The weirdest thing about the show is the obsession with nuns.  What is that about? (The last virgins on earth, perhaps?)
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|I purchased this book on my first day of a 3 day beach get away. Finished it before I left the beach. Another one I could not put down.
B0083EW97W|5.0|i got this album because i love john mayer's voice and this album is pure relaxing john mayer. Shadow days and love is a verb were the more pop-ish songs on the album.  the rest sounded like he was trying to go old western? \\"whisky whiskey whiskey\\" i dont even know what that songs about? all i heard was \\"whiskey.... country..... whiskey\\" but i liked this album . i will totally put it on when i need to calm down and relax :)
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is the neatest app ever created! I really enjoy the food section there is a lot of easy and delicious recipes for all ages!
B0090P98Z4|4.0|Not to bad of a game. pretty good hack n slash action rpg. A lot of levels to play through. Only rated it 4 stars because there is barely no story line.
B005Y841QC|4.0|I started watching Supernatural, Season 1 on Netflix.  I got hooked and watched Seasons 2 - 6 on Netflix and HuluPlus.  For Season 7 I had to use Amazon.  The show is great with lots of action, plot twists, and let's not forget, blood splashes.  Amazon's ability to smoothly stream this show or others however, is sadly lacking with multiple stops for buffering.  It's not my system because I don't experience those issues with Netflix or Hulu.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|...not the furry kind but the Sea, Air, And Land young men who are the best of the best...or do we? I admit that even after watching many documentaries on the History Channel and/or movies, I thought I knew what a SEAL was. But after reading this book, I got a deeper insight into the dedication, special abilities and day-to-day life of a SEAL. Actually, the media that came the closest to showing the true SEAL was the TV show, The UNIT. This author did an exceptional job of keeping my interest even without the requisite page-after-page of bullets flying. If he ever decides to write another book, I will gladly get in line to get a copy.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Was very good from start to finish. Would recommend to anyone. Very interesting to know what's next. And how the movie would play out..
B005TM0I8I|5.0|The songs sound better than ever, especially compared to my 1980s-era Louder than Bombs CD. Over at the AV Club, there is a superb May 2012 interview with Johnny Marr. He explains how and why he put the time into Complete. (Search \\"Johnny Marr has no negative thoughts about The Smiths, seriously.\\") The Amazon sales process was very smooth. The songs easily downloaded into my iTunes. Amazon then let me download the album onto my Android phone.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is an excellent, well written first hand account of the raid on Bin Laden.<br />I hope the author does not get punished for \\"revealing secrets\\".  I am an ex-navy<br />man (retired submariner) and as far as I could tell he did make any statements<br />that would endanger his counterparts or reveal any operating methods the SEALS<br />utilize.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I find i must skip over the autopsy parts. Otherwise excellent as usual and look forward to more from this prolific authoress.
006097625X|5.0|I bought this book because I wanted to know more about the art of comics. I was amazed at all the things I learned, starting with a definition of comics, a brief history of comics (they are really old!), and proceeding to the vocabulary necessary to understand and discuss comics, from time frames to gutters, to type faces, and so on. Reading this book has made me think differently about comics: I now appreciate them in a much deeper way.
B0087HT36U|4.0|This game offers many scenarios that range from the relatively simple to the astounding. Although a drawback is the inclusion of purchasing weapons, it does motivate the player to spend more time working out a solution. Even though it is like Angry Birds in some ways you don't have to deal with trajectories.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this calculator app is exactly what I was looking for,  a basic calculator that had big numbers. I use it all the time on my kindle fire!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Finished reading this book in two days!  It would have been one if I had the time to complete it in one sitting.  This event will be one of history's most memorable moments and to be able to read a first hand account without government spin, PR or other typical biases was awesome!  While the story was told from a Seal's POV, hence it had that bravado tone, the story seemed honest and intense!  Thank you to all of those folks who made (and make) personal sacrifices to fight American's enemies.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I'm very picky when it comes to the books I read.  I did not want this story to end.  The plot of the story was great from beginning to end.  The story it self was not to long or to short which is very important when reading.  It was a very easy read and flowed well.
B0088WFZQG|3.0|Disappointed in story line, on a 10 rating, I would rate it at 6.5.<br /><br />Film quality is quite good. Very believable, but I still wasn't that impressed.
B001FA0NZ6|5.0|I love makeup and learning how to achieve different looks.  This app explains a great many of the the attributes associated with various products.
B00932A2MC|1.0|From the opening to the climax, this dog has so many \\"issues\\" that it detracts from the outstanding effects.  Since when did the navy start issuing commissions to recently released convicts and how did he make it to Lt in such a short time? And the retired battleship just happened to have a full load of hot ordnance onboard? Gimme a break.  The truly sterling stars of the show were the double amputee army vet and the former crewmen who work the ship on display.  I wouldn't pay more than $2 to watch the dvd and only then on a cold winter night when I was bored and wanted some comedy.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|Hard to believe to see this professor in the trailer in such a good state of mind after so many shock treatments. He must be a real genius to survive all those treatments.<br />As far as I know, schizophrenia is not curable. A very good movie about this American genius!
B008D28HYS|5.0|This is my \\"go to\\" app, esp when I have time to kill. Coming from the black and white version, the color adds a new twist on strategy, and the resulting pictures look nice! Also the program is stable after updates.
B000W061HE|5.0|I was a fan of Whitesnake many years ago. I did not have any of their music and when I saw this album for sale on Amazon I purchased it. I am really glad I made this purchase. I listen to it when doing intense work outs and it really helps me with my work outs.
B002IE2JF0|5.0|This movie was really well done. It surprised me how much I enjoyed it.  I highly recommend this movie.  I rented it but now think I will buy it!!
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|This show is so funny.  My husband and I decided to watch it again before season 2 begins and are now realizing that we laughed so hard the first time around that we actually missed things.  Great entertainment.
B0090EIILU|1.0|I cannot understand why this actor receives any accolades at all.  I understand outrageous disguised as art.  But when art pantomimes stupidity, it's time to pull the plug on the so-called actors ambitions.
B005X47SQM|1.0|I ordered episode 7 and they gave me episode 6.  I do not believer there was an episode 7. The reason, when they reran last seasons Sons, they did not show an episode 7.  While I paid anyway, I do not think I should have been charged.  Warning, do not order episode 7. Unless you want to watch episode 6 again.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Prometheus - it is a true story of discovery. Prometheus is not only entertaining but thought-provoking.<br />Prometheus is a great science fiction movie.  Prometheus is definitely a prequel to Alien.  Prometheus answers many of the questions people asked themselves about the alien movie. I was amazed at the fantastic<br />special effects of the film. Prometheus is a real edge of your seat movie. I will see Prometheus over and over!!It is a movie that transcends our vision of who we are and our place in the universe.  I will definitely go see the sequel when it comes out in late 2014 or early 2015.  It is a truly spectacular movie event.  Noomi rapace (Dr. Elizabeth Shaw) is a great actress!! And cute too!!
0143038419|4.0|I read this book after having enjoyed the film. I am surprised that so many reviewers regard it as egotistical and self-indulgent because, if anything, it is the reverse.  The purpose of the spiritual life is to lose oneself, which I assume to mean to submit one's societally constructed ego to a higher power and/or to the purifying process of stillness, meditation and contemplation: in so doing, we find our `real' selves.<br /><br />This book is more likely to be read by women than men and, since I am male, I may have a different slant in my perception of it.<br /><br />The author's spiritual journey reminds me of the Buddha in his search for enlightenment. He tried self-indulgence, then extreme asceticism and, finally, a middle path between the two extremes.  So the author enjoy food , drink and luxury, then turns to a variety of religious and spiritual practices and then settles down, partly, to a `normal' life. It is possible to find wholeness through normality: a loving relationship requires several small submissions to the ego.<br /><br />Her descriptions of the difficulty of getting into meditation ring true: the boredom and frustration, a few minutes seeming like several hours, the chattering mind which refuses to be silenced.<br /><br />Like many, she had to leave home in order to return and see it again as if for the very first time. We wonder if the end will, be that she lives `happily ever after' but will have to read the sequel to find out.
B007SSEU9O|5.0|A must see. Great performance by all. It should me a lot about British politics. Merle streep was magnificent. Great drama was never bored.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game gets me through some boring times. I used to play this on the computer when i was a child in school. I guess I'm just a child at heart. lol
B006AN78XS|5.0|I can only say that this film brings all the elements of great art together into a perfect gem!  Beauty, truth and the direct humor and pathos of life!  I bought it to view over and over.  Woody Allen has created a masterpiece.
B0065CCM76|5.0|Bob Seger is one of the best rock and roll classics artist and the download and purchase was very easy.
B0091XRL86|3.0|Enjoy Aardman videos, but this one was only so-so. Lacked the satire and humor of Chicken Run, which could be enjoyed by both adults and children.  Pirates seemed to lack the multi-generational enjoyment, but still could be perhaps enjoyed by the younger crowd.
034580404X|4.0|Romantic love story.  Wish something like that would happen to me!  Can't wait for the movie to come out, but who will be Christian???
B007J4T2G8|5.0|As I write this, I have not finished the book but am more than halfway through it. I think it is well written, and I love the story line. At this point, I just hope it ends well.<br /><br />This book is not for those who object to sex and four letter words.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Book was very thought provoking in the sense that most of us do not realize what some of the people in our society are capable of.  It was a very moving book in that it made me shudder at the terrible things that she had to suffer, but at the same time showed me that all of us have a will to surive.
B007SSEBCU|5.0|This film has a beautiful sort of pace and rhythm that matches the fantastic acting of all concerned to create a pure gem.  As with any great piece of art it is an honest slice of life, time, emotion, thought.  Very well done!
B008XG1X18|5.0|How do you not like pintrest. Simple to use and there are always great ideas. Some simole and so extreme so much fun going on there and seeing what new things people are coming up with and what kind of ideas I can use in an everyday places. Great fun.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It is the BEST for organizing everything visually. Once you start, it's addictive looking for everything you can imagine and pinning it, like arts & crafts, decorating ideas, recipes, books, gifts, holiday ideas, etc.. love it!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|A good look into the personality of a Navy Seal.  While the author may have violated his sworn agreement with the Navy by not having this reviewed prior to publishing, there are no secrets revealed in the pages. In fact there are less secrets revealed in these pages than have been revealed from the podium at the White House Press room.
B008JAGZDE|3.0|This installment of the American Pie series falls short of the mark set by the original three films. It has the usual hijinxs that we've come to expect from the characters, but it falls short on substance and meaning.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|A true delight to read.. Very much enjoy a book with hard lust, however, there was just a tad bit of too much sex.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I'm not a gamer, so I don't have expert comments.  I do enjoy this game.  It is easy to learn and fun.
B004SIMNF0|4.0|I loved using the spider throughout europe.....  It saved my back.  It takes a little while to get used to it and after a full day my hip was sore, but still very worth the investment.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|\\"No Easy Day\\" offers an insider's view of what it takes to become a Navy SEAL and to prepare for and carry out various missions.  The story of the raid on bin Laden's complex in Abbottabad is fascinating and inspiring.  It's good to know we have people like these guys to protect us!
B004QSQML8|4.0|The Blu-ray version of \\"Legend\\" exceeds all other previous DVD's. The Blu-ray color image just explodes off your High-Def screen, and the shadow and hi-lites way surpass all other DVD versions. The audio also sounds much cleaner and defined. I can say this because I've compared my (Legend Ultimate Edition DVD) version side by side and what I noticed first is how much more detail is in the darker scenes. Nice deep blacks enhanced next to color that just explodes. Knuckle Bone Meg is now a brilliant evil green that she has never been before. So if you like this movie as much as I have, and you like color that Pops, this is it.<br /><br />For those of you who seem to dislike this movie for what ever reason, listen up, IT'S A FANTASY MOVIE, not \\"Gone With The Wind\\".
B004FRX0MY|3.0|I was hoping that I could use this to stream directly from my cloud account instead of having to pull the music into my phone first. Even within good wireless range the app just chokes.
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|I wanted to see this movie but after doing so I asked myself why ? I found it boring. To me it just didnt live up to the hype. Glad I watched it on demand and didnt pay full ticket price at movies would have wanted a refund.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|easy to use... love it!! My daughter downloaded it thinking it was a game and we just fell in love with the way it it lets us see the battery power.
B0044R3X72|4.0|In a way, the movie is kind of cheesy, but in a way it is also really good.  I always enjoy watching it!  IMO, you can't go wrong, really.  See it, if you haven't.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|As usual the movie couldn't capture the feeling that the book created.  The movie was still pretty good and she is a good actress, but I was disappointed in the movie version of the arena.  The book made it a very scary place to be, while the movie made it look more like a disney ride.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed this novel very much.  The twists and turns were imaginative.  I thought the use of first person narrative for each character added to the suspense.  I would recommend this book to my friends.
B002BWP49C|5.0|when I put my order in everything went smoothly, It took almost no time at all! When my purchase was sent to me got here a day before it was due to arrive! Amazon has proven to be a very efficient source for me. The movie i ordered had no scratches or problems to it i was able to enjoy the movie with no problems at all.
0345803507|4.0|This one was better than the first two. I'm glad this is the last one so I can stop reading them. I can't seem to help myself. I skipped thru most of the sex scenes because they are repetitive, and I got bored. The rest of the book was good. I like the journey although it is far fetched with Hyde, but this book is entertainment and it did do that.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Ill let you know more. But so far so good. Asst. was a little confusing. But it seems fun so far
B001G7HKZ4|5.0|I can't for the life of me figure out why I dragged my feet seeing this film. Possibly because so many well-intentioned romantic comedies turn into dismal, badly written mush.<br /><br />My mistake, because \\"Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day\\" turned out to be crisp and charming. Set in London on the Eve of WWII, it resembles a \\"gold-digging\\" depression-era comedy with Amy Adams cast as the sparkling starlet who can't decide between the man with money, the man who can promote her career, and the handsome pianist (Lee Pace) who loves her.<br /><br />Into this madcap life slips Miss Pettigrew (Frances McDormand) - a Vicar's daughter/governess who's literally starving on the streets because she believes children ought to behave. The two women strike up a friendship that -- through the course of fun (if predictable) twists and turns -- transforms each of them for the better.<br /><br />If there's a fault with \\"Miss Pettigrew,\\" it's the romantic subplot. The vastly talented Lee Pace is given little to work with and so the chemistry between him and Amy Adams feels forced.<br /><br />But romantic comedies are a dime a dozen, while movies with strong friendships between interesting women are rare as diamonds. This one's a gem.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Love these books...interesting way of learning of 1700 Scottland with a sexy love story. I cant wait to start the next installment in the Outlander series.
B00932A2MC|3.0|The holes in the plot were big enough that you could drive a battleship through them (where was the continuity editor?), but all in all was a fun action sci-fi yarn.  Enjoy - but rent, don't buy.
B007JOM0GC|5.0|First, this is the only album of hers I like the other was nice and all but not quite my thing for music though it was well done.  This one, blows you away. She's not some crappy song writer, she reminds me of the old Singer/storytellers of the 70's(come on you know you've heard or remember \\"Little boy blue and the man in the moon\\") these are just story songs of her...and of all of us.<br />I will admit though I liked the California Gurls edition that had legal action taken against it, personally that version was the best, course maybe its cause I heard it 3 times driving from Milwaukee to Wausau on various radio stations, but I just think that was the best, Snoop Lion (Dogg at the time) does a good interlude but...its just not quite as good.<br />its a fun album. even the last additions are still fun its like okay you had this awesome party and fun for the album and suddenly you have to wake up to reality and bam there it is, you're \\"wide awake\\" the phone's annoying you and you \\"just want to throw my phone away\\" and dang going back to bed and back to the fun dreams would be SOOO much better.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A great read-has lots of twists and turns and leaves you in shock at the end.  It may start slowly but keep going 'cause the author was brilliant in her storyline.  Should make for a fab movie.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|Love the book. I hope there will be more books with John Corey. The action never slowed down.More John Corey Please!!!!!!!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|What a show!!!!! On the edge of the seat for the whole season.  WOW.  Love the twists and turns, and the writing is fantastic.
B005K01VZS|4.0|I've enjoyed every book I've read by this author and this one is no exception. It was a good read.
B00846REIS|5.0|Enjoyed this book much more than the first book in the \\"other\\" series.  Hoping that the next book which I have pre-order will continue to be just as good.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was sucked in right away with this book. I must have changed who i was rooting for 5 times throughout. Great format for a Great story!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I just loved this book!! As soon as I finished reading it I started it again.. I just couldn't get enough of it.. I wish I didn't have to  wait until April for the next book!! :-(
B002UM5BXW|4.0|Opening and operating a restaurant is not as easy as people seem to think it is. You better know how to work with many different types of people. After reading this book, Ill remember not to order fish on Monday.  This was a really good read.
B008TRUDAS|3.0|I liked the book, did not love it.  A little too predictable.  Also I am in my late 40's and it is more of a college age level book.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|I had been waiting for this movies since I read the trilogy several months ago. I found it very entertaining and very true to the book (as much as a movie of this length would allow). My husband watched with me  (he didn't read the books) and enjoyed it also. We're both looking forward to the rest of the series!
B008QTV3X0|5.0|If you want a break from the \\" I know what's going happen \\" everyday dramas. Then this is the drama for you. Emmy worthy performances all around. Watch it now! You won't be disappointed.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|What would a tablet be if you did not have adobe reader, this is an absolute must have if you need to see any documents that can only be read by adobe.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A quick read and definetly a story that needed to be told.  It was straight-forward and to the point without gushing or anything by the author.  Makes you even more proud of what they did for America and gives you their point of view.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this game. Except for a slow loading screen and minor malfunctions, overall the game is totally worth it. I sit and stare at my phone for 2 minutes as it loads the game but the second its on it's literally a joyride! Very addictive too...
034580404X|2.0|Personally, I have to say I don't know what the hype about this book is. It is a trilogy and you should read all three of them, but the review will be taken on all three of the books. The first book...well if you are into sado-maso you might get a kick out but that is about it. Storyline for me was flat and the author spiced it up with kinky sex and we all know sex is an awesome seller. The second book, not much difference there a break up, a make-up session and a still superior guy that thinks he can control a life... Wonderful as if the guys in real life need to hear that, at the end we throw a twist with another evil guy.... Why is it that women are always looked at the weaker sex? And Mr. Grey is willing to learn how beautiful..... and the last book was just boring... Oh, he finally comes to the light and realizes that his sex life was wrong and sick...you really think that happens? Not.... So, all in all a waste of my money...a hype that is so not worth it and three books with kinky sex written in detail with a more then flat storyline...not worth the money or my time
B0064T6LV8|4.0|Great fun to play and past the time. The grand kids love to play it on my kindle fire. Also challenging.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|this was a wonderful game with lots of twists and turns.  Won't let you down on the story line.<br />not to hard that you get lost, but not to easy either. The perfect mix of fun and suspence to keep you playing. When you download the full game it's worth the money!!!!
B005D9MUWY|1.0|Funny that this app is sold in the Kindle store, as it cannot be installed in the Kindle Fire.  This is, by the way, a major flaw of Kindle Fire for non-English users, as the keyboard cannot be customized.  Writing Spanish characters such as accented vowels or ñs is a bit of a pain in the neck.  I have spent considerable time looking for a way around this and have found none.  When it comes to Kindle, Amazon does not cater to Spanish language users.
B009329Y30|5.0|I have always been a fan of Nicholas Sparks' books. His books set a foundation for wonderful movies with real life situations and a ton of heart. The Lucky One was a great read with good flow and the movie did not disappointed. GREAT movie with good chemistry. Wonderful story of tradgedy bringing people together so that they can fall in love. I have been telling everyone I know to watch it. You will not regret it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love the layout of the app! pinterest is my favorite site! keep up the good work. catergories are much easier to find.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|The 5th book in the series continues with the stories of many of the favorite characters and it also introduces a few new ones.  It is a good read, however I find that the story lines are beginning to ramble and I keep expecting them to intersect for at least some of the main characters, but they don't.  If there is only one book left in the series, when is this going to occur?
B00846REIS|5.0|I enjoyed this book and I am in waiting for the next one!My neighbor told me about it and I read it on my Kindel and my daughter read it and said it was anouther additing book!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I have read alot books and thought that it was good book  But reading The art of racing in the rain , it is so heartfelt that I actualy cried!  I love this book and would recommend for any one to read...
B0090P98Z4|4.0|D&amp;D hack and slash!<br />easy way to kill time and and some zombies etc. try it you'll like it. or your money-back.its free
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this game. its fun and it has tons of replay value. different jetpacks and different gadgets to help you get further and further!
B003L7DK74|5.0|I had to introduce my new boyfriend to this show just so that if he didn't like it I would know I had to break up with him. Thankfully it is impossible not to find Flight of the Conchords hilarious, so he loved it and we got married. Also in his wedding vows he vowed to dress up like either Brett or Jemaine every night, with a picture of their faces on a paper bag I can stick over his head. Every couple has their quirks! So to say the least-- I highly recommend this show.
B0091REZMW|3.0|the game takes a long time to level up your character without outright buying dimonds all the time but other than that fun rooms
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Very easy to read romance!  would recommend to anyone that loves to read but doesn't have a lot of time.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Suzanne Collins is a fantastic author , her books are quite rivoting and very well written.<br />I will be looking for more of her books to read in the future as I found all of the Hunger Games<br />books hard to put down.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Good game for killing time while waiting at offices while keeping your brain sharp. I recommend this wonderful timeless classic.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I used to have this on my ipod touch but now I have it for my kindle and its the greatest way to burn some toke on the train... awesome game
0374532281|5.0|This book is so wonderful I absolutely understand why it is being made into a movie. You just love the main character so much and it actually hurts you when he is sad. I loved every minute I spent reading this funny and quirky novel and I recommend it to everybody, especially you. That's right, you reading this review right now. Go read the book.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I simply could not wait to finish this book.  While it was interesting in the beginning, it began to drag on and on and on....Of course I should not have been surprised by the twisted ending since the entire plot was a bit twisted but I was hoping for something better.  I did find the foul language annoying and distracting and after reading an excerpt of Sharp Objects decided I would not be reading that one either.
B000E5N62U|5.0|I thought I knew what I was getting into, you know, it's Fagen, it's gonna be great. When the first song started, that bass hits and you just think, \\"Oh, s***...I need to sit down for this,\\" and the experience is more than just great, it's legendary. This album makes me jealous as a musician and grateful that I got my hands on it in this lifetime.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Wonderful.  Loved that the author and other agents noted that for sure obama would take credit for the operation.  They also noted that obama had previously taken credit for their efforts - though he was not there for either operation and would not have the balls to be there.
B00005N6KG|5.0|SO I JUST RECEIVED THESE AND HOLY CHRIST THESE ARE THE BEST HEADPHONES I HAVE EVER GOTTEN IN MY LIFE!!!! THEY ARE LITERALLY FEATHERWEIGHT AND SO GD SNUG ITS UNFREAKINGBELIEVABLE LIKE COME ON IM LIKE TOOOOO IMPRESSED....SOUND QUALITY...ITS SONY NUFF SAID AND I BOUGHT THESE FOR RUNNING AND THEY STAY IN PLACE AND CAN'T BE BEAT!!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|We had chosen this book for our book club and I thought it was terrific. The story is sad and the reality is sadder but well written. There were times however in the book that were not completely accurate regarding the oxygen. My mom is currently on Oxygen so maybe I was silently monitoring that in the story because I feel when I am with her we are contantly monitoring the level in the tank. I think this would be a good high school read.
B007KZY1YY|1.0|Before I bought the fifty shades trilogy I was in two minds about reading it as I had hear/read mixed reviews about it. I decided to open my purse and give it a go, after all I am a mum and was keen to discover what the fuss was about. The first book started off well. The courtship, the intimates scenes, the falling in love and even managed to have a few laughs about the kinky scenes with my girlfriends. Unfortunately, it all went down hill from there. I struggled to finish the second book and had to force myself to open the third. By these stage, I had lost complete interest in the characters. Both christian and ana are very boring and lonely creatures.  they will have very little to no interaction with any one else and found myself getting excited when other characters were introduced but much to my disappointment, they would interact very little and disappear all too quickly. I though the characters never developed as individuals or as a couple. And really, I don't care how young or full of energy you are/have..there are others things you can do to keep the spark alive.  The only good thing about this trilogy is that it confirms my theory that some people are just destined to get rich no matter what they do or produce. So to all the hard working mums out there..my advice, your pennies will be better spent at the massage parlour. I can guarantee you it will be more pleasurable than Christian grey.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved the way the story ended..I would love to continue reading how Christian was thinkin the same way we got Anna's side ..I am officially anxious to get the fourth book.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Frankly, I was disappointed.  I expected to read a kind of expose of the treatment of Washington to the Navy Seals.  I expected to read all the \\"secrets\\" revealed that would compromise the elite Seals.<br /><br />Instead, everything in the book seemed to be what the public already knew immediately after the mission when Obama lauded (emphasizing himself) during his announcement of the killing of Bin Laden.<br /><br />It was fast reading and the information seemed accurate. Some of the personal asides from the author were amusing.<br /><br />I am still trying to see what all the concern was before the publication of this book.<br /><br />After reading NO EASY DAY, I came away with being proud of the Seals and the spectacular job they--and NOT Obama--did.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The Book Mockingjay was wonderful. I read all 3 of the Hunger Games books and I loved them. It was very easy reading, I would recommend this book and all the Hunger Games books to everyone.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Gillian Flynn's characters are amazing - complicated people that you can kind of like and understand. But they also have aspects that you don't like, and judge as wrong. Either way, you are prompted to think about them, wonder about them, and you feel like you've met someone real.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Seals train to excel where ours can not. They do jobs without any praise, this time media and govnmt decided to give them some but to their taste. As usual the people who put their lives on the line get burned. I see nothing that Matt wrote would endanger any of his brothers. What happen here was he pissed out the wrong people by telling the truth.
B0087HT36U|4.0|yeah it is an ab ripoff but still a fun game.  it is fun to throw rocks and knock stuff over.  not a puzzle game or require too much thought.
0345803485|5.0|From the beginning I was in love with book could not out the book down..but even though I was not in the story I felt like I was watching it happen rite before my eyes..lol whenever Ana blushed I did too. Lol thank u E.L James
B005MMJ84K|4.0|This book was so good! It has kid of a weir distribution at the beginning, but once you understand, it will become one of your favorite books! Only a WARNING: the end will let you breathless, no able for sensible hearts!!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I liked the book very much, it is a book full of action and excitement. And I reccomend anyone who enjoys a good book by the fire with a nice cup of tea, to buckle up and start on this exciting adventure of Katniss Everdeen.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|Great storyline, incredible animation, light-hearted and funny. Wall-E is a great movie for a family movie night. Get the popcorn ready!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I usually hesitate to read stories set too far in the future, but this series was not so much about that as it was the same basic human traits that exist in this century with our current events & cultures.  Well written and kept my attention from the first page of book one all the way to the last page of book three.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Once I started the book I couldn't put it down . As a former US ARMY RANGER I know what a sniper can do on a battle field and how their presence is a GOD send for us Grunts on the ground . Chris Kyle should be what all Snipers aspire to become , not only a great shot but a serviceman who never let the rivilary between services interfer with his goal of making sure that any soldier he watched over he made every effort to make sure they made it home . Chris Kyle you can watch my 6 24/7 ... 365 .
B000QUI9MA|5.0|This was a great episode with the late John Ritter in it such a good memory and an always adorable Kristy McNichol.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|This book paints a bleak but exciting picture of the future and what the Internet may become. It also contains a great narrative that kept me wanting more and more even at the end.
B007SPN5MA|5.0|How many times can you play \\"Maybe Not Tonight\\" over and over in your car? I'm on about 6! That song is so touching and beautiful it'll make you cry. I have to make myself listen to the rest of the album and it's all terrific. Love this man.
B0090EIILU|3.0|standard SBC fare: well done and no unexpected twists. a funny movie. i guess i need to add more words...
0525953728|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was easy to understand and the author describes everything really well so you can picture it in your mind.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I was an active US ARMY RANGER for over 20 years and I found this book to detail the Special Operations community to be spot on . Once I started the book I couldn't put it down until I had finished it . I have since read it at least 10 times , it's a fantastic book .
B005IQZB14|3.0|Thin storyline. The author spent way too much time relating about her mother. A good accounting of the nuances of long distance hiking.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|I must be almost the last person on the planet to read Fifty Shades of Grey. EL James has become the latest big-selling author to be maligned by readers and authors alike, as much for her writing style as for the content, so I thought I'd take a look. Well, okay, my wife got hold of a copy and I started to sneak off with it into dark corners. Here's what I found (warning - contains mild spoilers, double entendres and spanking of writers, readers and most everyone).<br /><br />The most immediately noticeable thing about Fifty Shades is the first person, present tense narration. This was originally written as Twilight fan fiction, a series that uses the same intimate and claustrophobic narrative style. I'm no stranger to first person (my own first two indie novels use that style) and well aware of its limitations. A lot of readers immediately walk away from first person and those who don't like the style but persevere in hopes of BDSM mommy porn are already hard to please.<br /><br />With first person narrative the reader is obliged to stay within the narrator's mind and only gets their take on things. Timelines tend to be linear, every day accounted for with a strong sense of chronology that risks becoming mundane. The first person narrator will observe, think and talk in a consistent style with a vocabulary that might feel repetitive to the reader. Think about it; we tend to use the same spoken words and thoughts on a day to day basis. Anastasia is a young thing, innocent, educated, intelligent, low in self-esteem but not isolated from the modern world. Her account of events is going to be from her perspective: naive, humorous, inquisitive, infatuated, insecure, unrequited, confused and, at times, clich&eacute;d. Despite her strong education and literary interests, she isn't going to have the life knowledge and hindsight that will enable her to eloquently describe her observations, experiences, physical feelings and emotions. Having accepted that, the FSOG story can be examined further.<br /><br />The paperback copy that came into my hands was well-fingered. It had sweated in the hands of numerous ladies as they took lengthy baths to ensure a private reading away from interfering hubbies. When I had the chance to claim it for my own it was already past its prime, all floppy and wrinkled. The first few pages slipped from the spine onto the floor with a sigh. I held the remainder and tried to picture all those readers. Would the book be an anti-climax? Or had they all reached the self-gratification they had been searching for? (Compare the FSOG mommy porn content with my poor efforts and you'll see it ain't easy to avoid slipping into slapstick innuendo and double entendre!)<br /><br />It was hard going. (Okay, I'll stop with that now.) The first fifty or so pages were all chick lit romance and I thought I'd made a mistake in trying FSOG. Then I remembered the first words from my wife as she had reached the first raunchy bits - \\"She has no gag reflex!\\" What could she possibly mean? I persevered. Things started to get weird. Non-disclosure agreements and contracts. Vanilla sex occurred, with a cherry on top. Things were looking bad for Anastasia in her innocence. I couldn't imagine all the previous readers of this copy (probably the entire female population of holy Catholic Ireland) had read a novel containing stuff normally only found in the red light district and live sex shows of Amsterdam.<br /><br />Well, it didn't go there. It went somewhere else, far more disturbing.<br /><br />Most of us are not natural leaders. We spend a lot of our work and personal lives looking for people to tell us what to do. In the majority, I think we're submissive by nature. The minority are dominant. When someone in authority directs us we, in the majority, tend to comply. That's how society works.<br /><br />Take the concept into a personal relationship. If that dominant person is physically attractive, and there's an irresistible chemistry, itcan lead to a relationship that appears unfair from the outside but satisfies the couple's private needs. That's what happens in FSOG. Anastasia is surprised by her own participation but justifies it with the rationale that she's really trying to convert Christian to normality. That's one hook to keep the reader going - the hope that Mr Gorgeous Perv will convert to a romantic. The other hook is a promise of hard core misbehaviour, as specified in the dreaded BDSM contract.<br /><br />I did enjoy the touches of wry humour and the use of Anastasia's foxy inner goddess and insecure subconscious to explain her thought processes. Unrequited love and lust has always been a favourite topic for me. Anastasia wants Christian Control Freak to behave in a more predictable fashion and there's some irony in that. She's willing to endure physical and emotional debasement in an attempt to bring his behaviour and moods into a spectrum she can cope with. At the end of the day the subtle flaws in her character outweigh his overt perversity, as she is ultimately bent on relationship self-destruction and predictably sabotages the stairway to romance heaven every time it presents itself.<br /><br />The ending leaves a void as Anastasia pricks her own balloon. Annoying, yes. A set up for the next book in the series, yes. EL James maintains the titillation and keeps her readers on the cusp of release. Yes.ead to a relationship that appears unfair from the outside but satisfies the couple's private needs. That's what happens in FSOG.

B007L3BMGA|5.0|Very very well written story. Characters are described detailed it is a joy reading the book. You nearly can't get enough of this book. If you once start reading it is not possible to stop at a certain line because you want to know how the story continues. Take your time to read and enjoy it.
B003THHIEM|5.0|This is a fun series, good chemistry between the actors.  I really am enjoying this series and will probably purchase the other series from Amazon as well.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I have to say I wasn't too sure of it at certain points but then I told the adult in me to shut up and let the kid in me to go wild with imagining this wonderful, crazy world that is created. It was a great read and I would recommend it to anyone wanting something different to read. The pictures were great and gave life to the characters, the pictures were one of the best things about the book-all 'real' antique photos. Makes me want to see what other crazy photos are out there!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I pre-ordered this book and received it on September 4th , I've read it 5 times since . I found no secret information of the mission or their training . You can find as much secret intel in the movie Navy Seals . Mr.Owen kept his word and didn't release intel from the operation or revel names of operators . I think Mark Owen should be very proud of his service to our country and we as a country should never stop thanking him and all the servicemen and women how have and are still putting their lives i danger for us . I want Mark to know that my son has always wanted to be a US NAVY SEAL , I had him read your book and said \\" If you want to be a SEAL this is the caliber to shoot for , The only easy day was yesterday . I was a US ARMY RANGER for over 20 years but if my son wants to be a SEAL and can become one anywhere as great as you were I would be a pround papa . Thanks to you and your team and may God bless you all .
0525953728|5.0|This book is said to have been written by a member (with the help of a co-author)of the team that killed bin Laden. That incident is part of a longer story describing the protagonist's time as a member of what is popularly known as Seal Team Six. In the story, he presents himself as a somewhat obsessive compulsive individual driven by a fear of failure.<br /><br />The book is exceptionally - and for me, surprisingly - well-written in a conversational style that includes flashbacks and digressions that do not take away from the flow of the story. In fact, the actual mental process of reading this book is as enjoyable as it can be.<br /><br />There's been a lot of talk about the book and its author. It's been said he violated the code of honor and may have put our intelligence process at risk. Interestingly, no one has stated he isn't who he says he is and didn't do what he says he did.<br /><br />The climax/finale of the story is a description of the attack and the killing of bin Laden. The author says that team was able to penetrate the complex and reach bin Laden's quarters. Once there, one of the team shot him in the head. While down but in his death throes, author Owen claim he and another shot him in the chest until all movement stopped. Then they documented the body with photos and DNA; put it in a body bag and dragged it downstairs. After loading it on a helicopter, someone sat on the body because the craft was crowded.<br /><br />I hope every word is true.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game. I'm addicted to this game. but most of I can't get enough of this game. it's the best game I have on my kindle fire. it also works great on my kindle fire too.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I really enjoyed this series...the second better than the first, but not as good as the third. The second book filled in details that were missing in the first book which enhanced many of the characters.
B0091WRCOA|5.0|This move is one of my grandchildren's favorites.  Even my sixteen year old enjoyed this movie and that says a lot for a movie that doesn't have sex and cursing.

B008602KQI|4.0|I thought the movie does a good job with the book. but reading the book first is extremely helpful. It is a little jumpy at first as far as cinematography.
B008B3H4VQ|4.0|seems to be more like some of their old stuff and not too much like a thousand suns. love it.
B007VDPMYI|5.0|George may have been a perfectionist which caused him I am sure great pain sin the studio. Perfection is hard to grasp when doing demos. I am certain he kept thing is prospective . You really have to apprciate the recordings. They are not finishe as you have know them but stripped down the offer a unique glimps into the originaloffering. The embellishments of the final product retain the same framework as these demo's. These are real treasures to my collection and anyone who has a love for Gearges music. I am awaiting the volume 2 and 3 and 4 ...
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book for a great price. The third and final chapter in the Hunger Games trilogy ends brilliantly. Like the other two books in the set, it's a very fast read. It's nearly impossible to put it down!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love the app. A couple times it's been slow to open. I haven't had any other issues. Would recommend. it to friends.
B0043WDK2G|5.0|Life got in the way and I had to catch up on Castle via Amazon. I love the series and the stars. I enjoyed season 3 and am now watching Season 4 so I will be caught up to watch Season 5 starting soon.<br /><br />If you haven't watched Castle, I encourage you to watch. It is a crime story with humor and good character development. Very light hearted.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this is an awesome app! I use it every day! the radar is great to have on hand! love it!
0385344333|1.0|Others have summarized the plot--what little there is of it--well.  The Reacher novels are in a downward spiral, going in circles at dropping in value.  This has far less action--and far more repetition and boredom--than his other books. He seems to be just cranking them out for the money. Maybe that also explains why the author is ok with his 6 foor 5 inch giant character being portrayed on screen by Tom Cruise.
B0058O84G0|5.0|An excellent read, could not put it down. I look forward to the next book by Ken Follett. I can recommed this to anyone.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I love this game. I play it every day!!! It is better than regular solitaire. This is a must have.
030758836X|4.0|As for the good:  Gone Girl is the true definition of a page turner.  Before I read the book I tried not to read too many reviews so as to not spoil my own reading.  While I knew there were some twists and turns, I had no idea around which corner they were hiding.  The characters are quite well developed and engaging.  While I always kept an eye out for a blindside, I truly was surprised several times.  Just when I thought I had a solid opinion, I received just enough information to spin things around and cause me to have to reevaluate.  There was constant movement in the story and really kept me guessing.<br /><br />As for the not so good:  I won't comment on specifics about the ending but I believe I would have preferred something a bit more tidy.  I felt like the first part of the book was a legitimate thriller and maybe even somewhat a study into the sensational relationship between violent crime and the media.  But then it took yet another turn, ending in a cartoonish/Twilight Zone/M Knight Shyamalan way - almost a caricature of itself.  In my opinion, a huge let down.<br /><br />Having said that, I rate this a solid four stars because it was generally that good.  But I must subtract one star for the ending.  I will definitely recommend this book to my friends.
0765356147|5.0|It is hard to find a writer who has a well-developed milieu, interesting storyline(s) AND sophisticated writing style.  Branderson does.  Yes, I did wonder how many times the \\"flat stare\\" appeared in the text, but the other primary criticism (occasional summaries of plot or character you needed to have absorbed from books 1&2) is unwarranted.  These are in fact 3 separate volumes so why shouldn't they stand on their own?  In any event, these are at most minor inconveniences.  The final criticism, that (at least one element of) the ending is predictable, really does not bear out.  If you are savvy enough to correctly pick up on one or two elements, you will do well.  But you will not really understand \\"whodunnit.\\"
B009329ZF2|3.0|I wanted to check out this movie specifically because it was about a battleship.  I frankly didn't have particularly high hopes for it but I was ultimately very entertained.  The opening left me very un-invested in the main character (in fact I rather despised him) but before he could be chaptered out of the Navy the aliens show up.  I was pleasantly surprised by the thought that went into the strategic limitations and implications of an interstellar invasion.  the aliens clearly followed rules of engagement and had specific objectives like taking out command and control nodes and destroying supply routes, as well as setting up reliable communications with their home planet.  The earthlings had to attempt to counter those missions with limited military resources available locally, ultimately leaving them only one option, un-mothball the USS Missouri to defeat the final alien combatants.<br /><br />the resuscitation of the Missouri happens in less than a day, which would be impossible, but they actually used docents from the museum, ie actual sailors who had served on Mighty Mo and you could just see the glee in their faces as they brought the old battle wagon back to life.  the film did a good job of showcasing the actual operation of a ship of that size and age and watching her unleash broadsides on the enemy was a lot of fun.<br /><br />All in all within the parameters of alien invasion opposed by WWII battleship this was well thought out with a much plausibility as possible (at least in most cases) and if you like alien movies or just battleships, you should check this out.
B002U3CCKQ|3.0|This book follows the journey of discovery a girl takes to find out - for financial reasons - why her family was murdered.The main character, Libby, is unlikeable and therefore it can be difficult to be comfortable with the book and sympathise. One finds oneself disliking her and therefore not really caring about what happened.
B0048IMZMG|5.0|I love Taylor Swift songs and this cd was missing in my collection. The cd was amazing. I love listening to her music when I am in a great mood .. Thansk
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great read! Well written,very interesting insight to the day of the assaination of Osama. I would highly recomennd this to anyone who has read the news accounts of how BHO  took care of Osama Bin Laden.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|No Easy Day is a very well written book by a highly experienced SEAL.  His story leading up to the killing of UBL is very informative.  A little different that the main stream media told.  Good book.  Good to hear the story from the inside.
B0058YPL66|5.0|ABC really has landed a hit with Once Upon A Time.<br />The show is amazing with the depth of every character and of course being unique helps too.<br />I've never seen a show quite like this and it's nice that it is something entirely different from every other show in TV.<br />The actors are great and chosen well for their characters.<br />I especially like Lana Parrilla in her role as the Evil Queen/Regina Mills.<br /><br />A DVD box I can recommend to everyone that has room for some phantasy and imagination in their mind!<br /><br />Really looking forward to Season 2 !
B002QAY31Y|5.0|Even though this series came out quite a few years ago it has not lost any of it's punch.The newsreels are great,it flows very well and the narration by Laurence Olivier is top notch.<br />I would highly recommend this set to any one interested in seeing what WW11 was all about.Any serious history buff should have this set in his collection.
B004RZGUBM|5.0|This is a great classic...must read! I read alot of Dickens when i was in school and I enjoy reading these classics again now!
B0026P3G12|4.0|Love it, but songs are pretty much too slow.  Understand she has put more life in  her songs now. Will buy more.
B0018Q4DTY|5.0|I owned this CD when it first came out.  It's still just as good as it was back then.  All the songs on this album are great.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|Shoddy world building is running wild.  I'll give Scalzi the benefit of the doubt and assume he is being self-deprecating and intentionally ironic when he uses the ultimate shoddy world building to wrap up his satire of the shoddiest of all world building. The codas are a nice save and get my overall review back to 4 stars.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read all year.  I would recommend this book to anybody.  Mitch Albom's books<br />are excellent.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use this app throughout the day to remind me of things I have to do or places I have to be. When I'm away, I no longer rely on hotel clocks (often set by some jokester to go off at 3AM). This is a very productive app for my Kindle Fire.
B006HTUZ1C|4.0|A new take on tetris. Really makes you think quickly. Recommend for people looking for a challenge.  Help your kids learn to add.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|that is it. it works! connect to home pc from android phone.  I need to try it on a tablet for the bigger screen
B005K0HDGE|2.0|Mr. King has taken a great story idea worthy of about 400 pages of his best effort and given us about a thousand pages of mediocrity.  It's as if a mathematician who needs to string out pi to a dozen places in order to get a nice precise area of a circle becomes obsessed with stringing it out to a thousand places and makes you count it out with him.  There are several glaring anachronisms (blue lights on cop cars in the 50's;  a character uttering the phrase, \\"You rock...\\") in the same time frame are the two worst.  This work shows a lazy attitude to back checking, rewriting, and most of all editing.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|I ususally enjoy the Temperance Brennan books, but this one had way too much detail about the geology, gold mining and other trivia to constitute a much of a mystery.  In fact it wasn't realistic how Brennan even got to participate in the events of the book.  Who would pay her salary to trek all over Canada?
B008602KQI|5.0|The movie is definitely not an exact replication of the book, but I really enjoyed it. If you are a stickler for the book, you may not enjoy the movie as they do change some things. But with an open mind to the movie as a separate entity it was really good. Loved the characters and settings. Definitely recommend!
B006LSZECO|5.0|A fantastic journey.  After reading this book, you will (at least for a while) wonder about transparency and motivation of your spouses' actions..  The book is very well written - taking you along for a ride with multiple surprising twists and turns.  The characters are well developed and tell their stories in a captivating manner.  A great read.
B0015DROBO|4.0|When approaching a work (and I could start every literary review with this sentence) it is critical to understand what one expects from the text: are you giving yourself to it or requiring a specific style and approach. Ever since my Aesthetics class in college it has been my position to allow myself to become part of the work as opposed to expecting a standard which I would satisfy my definition of \\"art\\".<br /><br />That being said, it is fair to assess TGWTDT as plodding, tedious and/or poorly written. Much like many others, I found the granular expose of the Vanger clan to be much like reading Numbers from the Old Testament. At one point I actually inquired to a friend who had read the series and seen all the movies (domestic and foreign) as to whether it was critical to plot disclosure that I recall the multitude of people being presented to me. Cheating? Somewhat. They assured me that while it might help get a better feel for the culture it was not a requirement.<br /><br />There-in resides my enjoyment of the text. So to not rehash the plot, and to keep this as brief as possible, I do find everyone's reference to \\"translated novel\\" as being integral when approaching any of Larsson's books. The simple cliche's did not distract from my enjoyment as there is not a requirement for original sayings. I expect people to talk as the characters are represented.<br /><br />I cannot speak to what the culture of Sweeden is like. Knowing Larsson's past I have to conclude that it is possible that the books are more a retelling of his experiences as opposed to inventing a fully original storyline. Yes there are moments when the characters seem a bit 1 or 2 dimensional but I'm not clear that there is a requirement to fully investigate all facets of their lives. Stieg, IMHO, does a fine job of allowing us to understand why the characters are who they are, why they interpret things as they do and why their actions necessarily follow from those definitions.<br /><br />Personally, while being arduous at times, I enjoyed the investigative feel of the book. It helped set the mood of the author and how he felt the story should be told. If you appreciate the need to set the landscape of the Vanger you can see how the abuse plot line can not only be complicated but handed down through generations. It is not enough to say person X was abused and therefore abused, rather Larsson details how a close family can convey a world view or attitude such that it can be divided and somewhat poisoned.<br /><br />Furthering this idea we can see how Mikael utilizes a similiar process through his means of investigating via photographs and other documents. Everything is narrative through a family, town or business relationship.<br /><br />My review is obviously not a critical literary analysis and many may disagree with my approach. My 4 stars directly reflects the slow, but necessary, descriptions Stieg uses. It also reflects what I consider I somewhat Disney ending that while satisfying is almost too easy and successful.<br /><br />In closing I must address the graphic nature of the certain incidents. It seems flawed to fault the book for not devling into Mikael and Lisbeth enough yet being offended or put off by the graphic imagery. Here is where I think you'll find the details which not only help define the protagonists but also the very human condition of the all the characters. There is a prevalent moral thread that has to be considered. \\"What decision should I make?\\" hits us through the idea of uncovering truth and then presenting it. If there is any advice to give it would be to look at every page within that moral framing.<br /><br />If you can make it to \\"Merge\\" with even 25% interest you will be justly rewarded for the remainder of the text., while being arduous at times, I enjoyed the investigative feel of the book.

B007B6VOG0|4.0|I am in my 50's and  no longer keep up with current music, but my daughter had Some Nights, the single, on her iPhone.  We listened to it in the car, and I enjoyed it. I also saw the Carry On video from link on twitter.  It was also quite good. When I saw the album on Amazon for only $5, I decided to give it a try. The whole album is good, and I will happily play the whole thing straight through. There aren't enough albums like that these days.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Ill start off saying i read all 3 books in four days...and out of the three this was my favorite..i was so into the star crossed lover story line..couldnt stop reading
B008D28HYS|4.0|i'm glad i found this pic cross game. very entertaining and a great challenge i just wish there was an \\"x\\" button instead of having to double tap the square other then that it has been more then worth my time to keep playing this game.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|While on vacation I really enjoyed reading the 4th installment of this series on my kindle.  Looking forward to book 5.
B0073XV2W2|3.0|An interesting exploration on how robotics and computing technologies converge, and the possible negative impact on society.  While the concept is thought provoking, the plot and characters were a bit like a B rated movie - trying to make up with action what they lack in complexity.  The book is an entertaining read.
B00846REIS|5.0|Great follow up to 50 shades!! Enjoyed reading , bought it on amazon for my kindle so I was able to start reading at once. Love that
B006TF6WAM|3.0|I enjoyed this book which put a different spin to the 'on the road' genre and told a sweet story of an elderly man who leaves suddenly on an unplanned pilgrimage across 500 miles to visit an old friend dying of cancer.  Along the way, he confronts his past and finds the parts of himself that have been overwritten by the miseries of his loveless marriage and flawed filial relationships.<br /><br />This is a story of transformation and self discovery that has general appeal.<br /><br />However, despite ffairly solid - if unremarkable - writing, I must admit I found the characters quite unbelievable and too much 'author intrusion' meant parts of the tale seemed contrived and moralistic if not a little irritating.<br /><br />Nonetheless it was an engaging and quite entertaining read that was worth the effort.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Absolutely love this book couldn't put it down at all I can't wait for the second book to release great read
1936608898|4.0|I had learned to live without sugar and this book helped shape my understanding of other items in the Standard American Diet (SAD) that are often harmful rather than helpful.  This also builds upon material I have collected from Dr. Joel Fuhrman about seeing food as medicine and how much of our common food is toxic.
B007FH9GA6|4.0|I would have given it a better rating if the movie had put more emphasis on the plot, finding out what happened to the missing/murdered girl.  Way too much time spent on the violent parts.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Fantastic! Very well written account of his experience as a Seal and sole survivor on a mission that went wrong. A must read!
B0058YPGSY|1.0|Arrived very quickly...but the 2nd dvd was unwatchable  ..upon inspection it was very scratched and I could not watch the middle of season4.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Very cool character, reminds me of Jason Bourne always getting into some kind of trouble, but always finding a way out. Can't wait to read the rest of the Reacher novels.
B00932A2MC|4.0|Fun to watch over a bowl of popcorn! We would recommend for a Saturday evening viewing on the big screen.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I began this series with some trepidation as this would not be my normal reading genre.  Not 50 pages into book 1 however, I was hooked.  Mr. Martin has written a masterpiece which I feel will be known as comparable to classics as those written by JR Tolkien, and others of his prowess.  Chilvary (or lack there of), war, conspiracy, and magic abound.
B001E8WNNO|5.0|One of the best Car/Horror movies out there...i have watched this movie so many times... Still just as good as the first... Little harsh language for young kids.. but great movie
B004J4WKTW|4.0|A very different interesting book.  You have to stay focused to keep track of all the characters and at what timeline they are currently in.  Kept my interest for sure!
B006LSZECO|3.0|Slow beginning, very entertaining, creative and captivating body, and disappointing ending to this novel.  I am not certain that I read a sequel if it were available.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was a good continuation of this series. The location and the history of the location were very intriguing. All in all a very good read.
B005LQ6UE8|3.0|The beginning of this book could very well be truthful, but as I read further, there was a sense that this was written as a third-person narrative. I have heard others mention that the entire book might not be the truth about a extremely difficult, if not impossible, journey across the Gobi desert and the Himalayas.
B008YRVW0I|3.0|I love this game, but the \\"free\\" levels are over too soon and it costs to get additional levels. Still considering buying the game because it's one I love to play on my PC.
B005EGXTHG|4.0|I must say that I found the second of these books confronting and challenging. This book was not as good as the first but in scheme of the 3 novels it really is like a binder in that it draws the other 2 together.<br /><br />The first time I read it I probably did not enjoy it as much as the second time after I had read the third book because there are so many layers to this novel that you don't get on the first reading. As with all of these novels for the girl who does not like futuristic books this was a surprising winner.
B0090EIC3Y|2.0|Ever since Borat came out, the quality of Sacha Baron Cohen's movies has gone straight down. I do not recommend this movie.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I got this app to try it.....and I love doing puzzels...this app is awesome and is even easy for younger kids to use
B008Z9YLV2|1.0|Pointless cinema. Storyline was kind of original but that only due to the books. Some stories just aren't meant for the big screen.
B00395ZYVS|4.0|I found this story very touching, the descriptions of India were very real. I couldn't put it down as every page was so unexpected. It made me appreciate and cherish my 2 daughters even more.
B005KH928E|4.0|Just listening to the track right now and I have to say I can only agree with another writer here: They ARE having a blast of a time! However why is EC part of this? Because of his great voice? To a degree and I think it is most underrated with EC. He is much remembered for his guitar play. If you ask me I think he is a better singer. Yes, he has set a new trend back then with the electric blues in UK/Europe. However he has never really evolved or grown further. Compare with Sting, he is an artist with wide spread roots because he never stood still. But back to this album or rather this track (I have not heard the album yet and possibly will put on my \\"bucket list\\") - needless to say how great W Marsalis is - I always prefer him to Brandford - I guess pure taste. Great to know there has been album with those 2 great artists. And further great to hear that EC can sit back and leave the stage to greater musicians. And I dont mean the ones who play faster and more scales and have greater knowledge. No, someone who has a wider knowledge and bigger scope of music sense.
B008XG1X18|5.0|best brainstorm tool ever. I can keep track of all my fab articles from random websites all in one place.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|its a great game and lots of fun. graphics are great and it doesn't lag. but more areas and challenges would be nice. and I get connection errors sometimes but that might be my network .. when does n. 4 come?  O.O<br /><br />Dave<br />kindle fire
B003SHDP4K|1.0|I wouldn't call this a novel but a poorly written high-school project. The plot is predictable and based on very basic recipes for suspense. It made for entertaining Holiday reading but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who enjoys good detective novels or thrillers. I am in no way going to see the film after this...
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I love this note pad.  It is clear, and so easy.  It has just the right amount of everything. Can go back and edit or ad easily.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its fun as long as you can beat the games there's over 100 games so if you don't like one play the other
B003KRJNBW|5.0|Excellent movie, I only buy movies DVDs only if I consider them to be these type of movies. There's is violence but for an adult the concept and the surprise ending make it a worthwhile purchase.[[ASIN:B002ZG997M The Book of Eli [Blu-ray]]]
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Riveting and disturbingly realistic for those of us that have raised children and have gone through the teenage years with them.<br />Mr. Landay puts a definite O'Henry unexpected twist on the ending that made me say \\"WHAT THE----???\\"
B0097EWK3A|5.0|loved the game cant wait until the conclusion comes out.  when is the second due to come out.  please I hope soon.
B004ZNANZA|3.0|What happened to Comfortably Numb  - song number six on Disk Two? Sounds great until it gets pretty much truncated (volume goes very quickly to zero), what a shame! Everything else is perfect!
B0076NKNLA|5.0|What a wonderful movie!  It was like stepping into a world with  Marilyn and get to know her and the struggles she had.  The story of course is bittersweet....
B002361MLA|5.0|Enjoyable and relevant to modern times.  I am applying Eckhart Tolle's book and life is brighter and fun. Highly recommend this book!
B000FC1MM8|5.0|Interesting and complex characters.  A really good read. Bosch portrays all the ups and downs of being in law enforcement in todays society.
B008Z9YLV2|1.0|The acting was stiff and forced, so was the entire choreography and graphics of the nature and Panem, as well as the depiction of the Capitol people.  The fight scenes were blurry as was the point of view that made me dizzy just watching.  With the computerized world we live in, I felt like I was watching a movie filmed 10 (or more) years ago. Just watch Avatar, and you'll know how badly Hunger Games did on the graphics part and flow of the movie.  I have never been this disappointed in a movie adaptation before.  It felt like it was low budget.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|Great game... there should be more in this genre for the Kindle Fire.  More games that implement the whole wargame boardgame feel; the only other good one I know of is Populus Romanus
B00632HWOG|5.0|I like this system of email i use it every day. It is easy to use haz every thing you need to keep you files  lose at hand.i would recomend this email application to my friends.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I liked the book very much. Read it in two days and couldn't put it down until I finished. Liked the statement by the author that his only regret about the mission that it would probably get Obama reelected but he did it anyway as it was his job.
B003LL3LHO|4.0|for a book based off a game it wasn't bad. Usually i avoid books, movies, or games that spin off. They are usually rushed and are there just to pick up on the hype the original product generated.<br /><br />This felt better. While not a super novel that will compete with books like some big name series i could drop here. If your bored and waiting for your favorite author to release his next masterpiece. You should at least try the sample.
B003L77G06|5.0|This show is hilarious and so much fun to watch with friends and family. The actors are amazing (every single one of them) and they all work so well together on screen. I can not think of an episode that I didn't love, my friends and I quote and quote this show like nobody's business and this is the type of show that you can watch over and over again.
B001XUPF2O|5.0|Best Batman ever! Bale is phenomenal only complaint is that i liked katie holmes better as rachel! But harvey dent and the joker were the best. 5 stars!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Loved this book. I am not normally a fan of crime/suspense novels, but Flynn's book had me reading until all hours of the morning.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I am not a avid reader and I could not put the book down.  I have read all three books and felt like I wanted more.  I purchased all from Amazon.com and downloaded them in less than 5min.  Thank you so much.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|I recently went on a 10 day road trip with my in-laws. We hit places like Cleveland, Canton, Harrisburg, Gettysburg, Albany, Montplier, Bar Harbor, Salem, etc... I had downloaded this app before the trip and by the second day, when we were pulling into each destination they would all turn to me and say: \\"Okay, 'Trip Advisor' where do we go eat?\\" It lets you search via GPS locator so you can find a certain type of restaurant near you. Or, if you want to plan ahead, you can search via city! One night we changed plans and had to find a cheap hotel and Trip Advisor helped with that too! The customer reviews are invaluable. You can also search local movie theaters, events, etc. It's worth it!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I had just got through reading American Sniper by Chris Kyle when I ordered this book. In reading American Sniper I knew that Navy Seals do there job and keep quiet about it. They do not care for glory but just love their Country and sacrifice family and health to do so. I had wondered why would a former Seal want to do a \\"Tell All\\" book. While some may disagree with this and many former Seals have said so, I agree that the true story needed to be told by someone other than Obama and his merry band of idiots. If the present administration would have kept their mouths shut about this mission, then I would have strongly disagreed with this book being written. Until you can get the goons in the Whitehouse to shut their mouth about sensitive operations and missions, then we need more books like No Easy Day to tell the real truth. Great book from start to finish!
B001NKI60W|5.0|I've enjoyed ABBA since they were a band in the 70's and it's great seeing the songs put to a movie. I don't think they could have picked better people to play in the movie they're wonderful.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this app is so much fun and it is easy too I love it so much it could be harder
B009329ZF2|3.0|It's a perfect popcorn movie. You don't need to think much about the story line and just enjoy a lot of CG and explosions.<br />Main character, Taylor Kisch is a very good looking guy and actually really funny. He can be a next Channing Tatum.<br />Aliens look like those Halo soldiers.  My 15 year old son really enjoyed it.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I've been glued to this game for over a week. The concept is excellent and the game is extremely well done. Tons of puzzles to play and lots of challenge.
B000UZNSWM|5.0|A very good history which also explains how and why we got entangled in Vietnam.  Shows the arrogance and stupidity of certain officers and politicians.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|It's more than an account of the mission to kill Bin Laden, but also an autobiography of a Seals career. Very interesting and hard to put down.
B00992CF6W|4.0|love the game but needs all items, bigger maps, and the ability to change creative mode to survival mode. Lastly the app i worth the money and i ppay this app every day !
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I really like this book it is about time we were told the truth about how things went down. I hate being lied to and codled because our gvernment thinks we can't handle the trugh. Hurray for the Navy Seals.........
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved it!! fabulous book - never expected it to be such a fantastic book - could not wait for next book!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|My appreciation for the freedoms I enjoy is magnified by the knowledge of the sacrifices that our Seals endure daily!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I can't wait for the next one to come out!  This one was great!  It had great graphics and a fantastic story line!
B0067EKY7M|3.0|But then again, it's not too shabby.  \\"Local Hero\\" (1983) is the movie \\"Salmon Fishing...\\" seems to be patterned after.  Both movies are set in Scotland, and feature protagonists with emotional handicaps that are swept into a wild, mystical and technological quests, complete with stunning visuals of indigenous scenery.  And lots of quirky characters to boot.<br /><br />If you are a fan of slightly daft movies that hold to the proposition that great ideas can span the divides of cultures and that inspired lunacy can triumph over class distinctions and corporate stodginess, then this movie might be the one for you.<br /><br />But, whereas I would give \\"Local Hero\\" ( a movie that, if you are unaware of, you by all means should seek out) five big stars, I would give \\"Salmon Fishing in the Yemen\\" only about 3 and 1/2.  This movie is more heavyhanded than \\"Local Hero\\".  The Scottish flavour is ladled on a bit too heavily with heavy brogues (Ewan McGregor's accent seems to verge on parody, as if he was parroting Dudley Moore), tam o' shanters, and kilts.<br /><br />The eccentric Yemeni sheik seems to have been cast with an eye to \\"getting someone who looks a bit like Antonio Banderas\\".  And the greatest sin, \\"Salmon Fishing\\" is missing a brilliant, crazy good, beautiful musical score like the one Mark Knopfler supplied for \\"Local Hero\\".<br /><br />Worth watching, I'd say, but please be aware that there is better stuff like this out there.
B00881VLCE|4.0|The bigger the device the smaller the pieces are. Works great on 10&quot; tablet but 7&quot; is way too easy.
B007PS0DTI|1.0|Hold your nose when you watch this one PU No return of main Caricature at least have a replacement nope. ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I heard about this book from a 14-year-old girl. I was a buit sceptic what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised.<br />The story was involving, original and the psychology behind it was hair-raising to think about. How strong survival instincts can be.
B000QCS8TW|3.0|I was disappointed that it is not historically accurate and I am still trying to figure out what planet these characters are on. It isn't earth.
B00003CXI1|5.0|It's a very rare person who hasn't watched a Harry Potter movie or read one of the books (admittedly I know a few of the poor souls who haven't).  And for good reason, the books especially are excellent, and the movies not bad adaptations at all.  Of course I always recommend reading something before watching it, but if the very least you're going to do is watch it, then at least that's something.<br /><br />Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone is the first movie in a series of eight.  Obviously you want to watch them in order.  This particular one follows the first book through its entirety.  So you watch as Harry becomes a wizard and joins Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry.  But there is a terrible foe out there, one who tried to kill him as a baby.  Voldemort, this evil wizard, may be back again, and there's something very powerful that he's after.<br /><br />Characters:<br />Daniel Radcliffe- Harry Potter<br />Rupert Grint- Ron Weasley<br />Emma Watson - Hermione Granger<br />Robbie Coltrane - Hagrid<br />Richard Harris - Albus Dumbledore<br />Alan Rickman - Severus Snape<br />Maggie Smith - Minerva McGonagall<br /><br />I really don't think the movie could have been cast any better.  Everyone was exactly how I would have envisioned them, or at least close enough that they are what I picture now when I read the books.  Daniel Radcliffe as Harry does an excellent job.  He has the right amount of surprise at magic and an innocence that goes along with not knowing how important he really is.  Ruper Grint as Ron Weasley is funny, and I like how they have a ready quip for him at all times.  Emma Watson, what can I say, she's Hermione through and through and has that right touch of haughtiness.  Of course all the others are excellent, although sometimes I can't quite figure out if Dumbledore acts as he should.  And Professor Quirrell was kind of a surprise as well too.<br /><br />The movie follows the book reasonably well.  It's understood that you're going to be disappointed by some things when you watch, that's just the nature of trying to squeeze the detail of a book into the movies.  But they did ok and I was happy enough with the efforts, although there were some scenes I would have liked to see included (like the dragon scene expanded as it is in the book).  Since this movie is for kids the violence is toned down a little bit.  But there is some there and I could see some elements that may be frightening for younger children.<br /><br />The special effects were brilliant.  They really brought the world to life the best they could with the technology and the care taken is shown.  Even the Chocolate Frogs were amusing and I especially like how they pulled off the wizard pictures.  It made it almost as if you were reading it and picturing all these things in your head.  I would have liked to see more magic done, but I guess they had to put plot in in addition to all the shiny special effects.  Music, what can I say.  I read somewhere once that they get goose bumps when they hear the opening music to Harry Potter.  And I quite agree.  When you hear that music there's just a moment of anticipation, like you know something wonderful is about to happen.  And the rest of the score is just as good and just as magical as you would hope it to be.  And it does help that it is instrumental without the singing to distract you during the movie.<br /><br />A great show and one that I don't mind watching over and over.  Although invariably it always results in a several day long Harry Potter movie marathon.  But we all have our vices.<br /><br />Review by M.

B002MQYOFW|3.0|Call me old fashioned but I find it disturbing that this book has gained so much popularity with young children, ages 10-13. That's all I could think about while reading it. Children taken away from their homes to participate in a \\"game\\" where they kill each other? Seriously, No wonder our world is becoming what it is. I had no interest in book 2 or 3.
B003AKLFAG|4.0|I had heard so many great things about this film before I saw it so I kind of had high expectations.  While I enjoyed the film very much I don't think it lived up to the lofty expectations bestowed upon it.  The acting and directing are top notch and you do feel for the films main protagonist but the ending reveal fell a little short for me.  That being said Oldboy takes you on a an interesting and mysterious journey.  The film is really original and left me guessing until the end.  Some great shots and some of the fighting scenes were just brilliant.  I heard Spike Lee is doing an American remake and I will be interested in seeing that knowing that it probably will not live up to the original.  Really good film that will probably be a cult classic if it isn't already.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|its great best sleep app I have found and with the mixing ability I can change what I hear. so if your looking for a free sleep app this is the one trust me. I love it so much that I will be buying the paid app as soon as my broke self gets some extra change
0385344333|4.0|I always enjoy the Reacher books because one never knows what kind of mischief he will wander into.  \\"Wanted Man\\" was full of twists and turns, and directions I never would have predicted.  Lee Child is a master at character development, and is never in a hurry to tell the story.  I thoroughly enjoyed this, the most recent Reacher novel, and can't wait to see what is next.
B00005JL0I|5.0|I like the movie.  It sort of makes you wonder is this where James Bond series came from![[ASIN:B0055OG2BC Casino Royale (1967) [Blu-ray]]]
B00395ZYVS|5.0|It was a fascinating look into the Indian culture.  The story held my interest from the first page. I enjoyed the peek into two very different family situations.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Loved the book, Mitch Albom does it again, like all of his books are thought provoking and everyone would be able to relate to his books!
B009329Y30|5.0|i really enjoyed this movie it was good and the story ended the way the book did .... i would recommended to everyone that has read the book
B005IQZB14|5.0|As someone who loves a challenge and the outdoors, I was excited to read Cheryl's account of her trip and life that lead to her decision to hike the Pacific Coast Trail.  I found her personal story intertwined with her travel experiences on the trail made for a very enjoyable and satisfying read.  I would recommend this book highly! I might even read again in a year or two.
0425263908|1.0|After reading 50 Shades of Grey, was not impressed by this book.  Seemed as though the author also read 50 Shades and then hurried up and wrote a condensed version of the story and only changed the names and settings slightly.  Was not impressed at all with the \\"copy cat \\" version.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I have read every book that Kathy Reichs has written and I couldn't put this one down.  It grabs you on the first page! Dr. Brennan is such a likeable character and this book sure doesn't disappoint for suspense.  I highly recommend Kathy Reichs!
159413586X|4.0|I love this serious but I wish that I would have received the original cover to the book like it shows in the picture. I know its the same book but was hoping that I would get all of the same types of covers not the movie edition cover.
B005FISBTO|2.0|Seriously, DO NOT BUY THESE DVDs. It's been said many times before, but download the files or watch them online. I love Dexter and I tried to buy it honestly, only to have the ENTIRE SEASON RUINED by the COMPULSORY 2 MINUTE ADS CONTAINING SPOLIERS on EVERY SINGLE DVD in the set. Thanks, Paramount and Showtime. I'll be sure to never touch another disk. If your mission was to lose customers you've succeeded.
B006LSZECO|5.0|enjoyed this book from cover to cover,difficult to put it down. so many twists and turns ,i was constantly<br /><br />on the edge of my seat.
B005O242D0|1.0|[[ASIN:B004LDLI0S Mein Kampf (The Ford Translation)]]If this had been a paper book, it would have been slammed against a wall over and over again.  I would have preferred never to have read this piece of garbage, however the main reason I chose to read it was to KNOW what I thought was true WAS true.<br /><br />Being a Jew and having had 47 of my relatives enslaved and murdered, I've no love of the Nazis.  But being a critical thinker, how could I intelligently discuss something I'd never read?  I am not unhappy that I read it; doing so proved what I thought about the book and its miserable author.  It is proof positive that Hitler was exactly what I'd thought about him.<br /><br />In short, it is disgusting but necessary reading because without knowing what happened in the past will only lead to a repeat of the disasters in the future and NOT so distant future.<br /><br />Today, the Arab world is attempting to use Hitler's use of the BIG LIE to discredit the only Jewish state on the planet. The world is swallowing those BIG LIES and are turning against that tiny nation. The biggest lie, perhaps, is that Israel is an apartheid state, which it most definitely is not.  But as Hitler utilized the BIG LIE propaganda ploy over and over again, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, a personal friend of Hitler's, learned the technique from the Nazi leader himself.  That is how Hitler is still having a negative impact on the Arab world.<br /><br />Do I recommend this book to just anyone?  Hell no!  The only people who should read this screed are students of history, particularly the history of propaganda.
B004UIOUHC|5.0|easy to use, quick a must for any tablet sets up easy for pages with preview Best browser I have found so far
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I was actually pretty suprised at the bad writing the author has.  It's a pretty dumb story and wouldn't recommend it for the more intelligent readers.
1609611543|4.0|I recommend this book for anyone that is experiencing digestive and/or health problems. It gives insight into health issues that may be related to their diet.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is my new favorite game. You can play in different ways, going after missions, coins, or for distance. You can spend the coins on useful gadgets or fun accessories. There's no need to spend money to get more coins, though you could if you wanted. It's very re-playable as once you complete all the missions, you can start over again (and in doing so you will get some that are different from the first time around). I love it, this is the most fun and addicting game since Fruit Ninja! Another great job, Halfbrick.
B007HGPBRC|5.0|enjoyed this book very much.it gave a good look into the man his personal feelings and the reasons he felt as he did.<br /><br />his wife did avery good job of finishing the book.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I have become addicted to this game. I like it a lot! I want to get all levels completed with fewest moves and it makes you think.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Loved this book, probably because it was so different from anything else I've ever read! Quite dark and twisty, but I was never able to figure out what was coming next, which is so much fun. A wonderful, intriguing read.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this book series.  I couldn't wait to download the second and third books.  It keeps you interested and wanting to read more.  I only wish there was a fourth book.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Nice little App for the kids!  This product was fun, and entertaining!  Easy to download and fun to have on your Kindle.
B001LM1456|4.0|An awesome thrill ride with just a touch of well placed humor. If you are a fan of the Marvel genre, this one is a must have!
B008FQ1O1K|5.0|Being a devoted fan of Mitch Albom's inspirational books yet another meaningful and compelling book that I devoured in 24 hours. If only we had more Mitch Albom's in the world sharing wisdom and insights about what is truly matters most in life - the world would be a better place. Hope the next book won't be too long!!
B006HTUZ1C|4.0|Well done game, educational, and I look forward to letting my daughters play it. Kinda fun for us grown ups too.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The first half of the book is absolutely riveting. The second half left me completely mystified. It was very well written, if you like psychological thrillers you will enjoy this book. If you like psychology in general, you will like this book, it gives you the chance to kind of \\"study\\" a few very strange characters. Overall it was a great read even though I thought the ending was just too bizarre.
B008LY9AWG|4.0|As always , a very interesting read, my only issue was I was dissapointed when it was over. He is a great writer of detective mysteries.<br /><br />Richard Gormley
B000FC146C|5.0|The Thorn Birds is one of my favorite books. It captures your heart and makes you feel as if you were part of this family.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|I've seen Bourdain's show a few times. Now that I read this book, I'm going to start watching more. You really get to know what he's like, and what his personality is all about. And, I actually LEARNED quite a bit too.
B001EC2J20|5.0|This is an excellent movie.  I recommend that you watch all 3 of the movies and do them in order<br />The Matrix (1999)<br />The Matrix Reloaded (2003)<br />The Matrix Revolutions (2003)
B0042UEU8M|5.0|Great show , didn't have any slow spots when streaming too, I would give this show 4stars and the plot was exciting as well as the actors
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game really has no point but it is really fun. you should definately get this game even though it looks really retarded!!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A very good read. It was not self angrandising and had a truthful tone. After all the political leaks about this action iy was an exciting experience to hear the truth. In thia day and age, with the shark feeding frenzy of the media, we have to look for the truth in other places. I am glad I bought the book.
B008XG1X18|5.0|What a fun way to get holiday and craft ideas from some very talented people!!! Great App for those of us that love to do crafts
B000I186FW|5.0|A great mix of a love story and policial drama.  this movie keeps you on the edge of your seat all though the film.  It is a wonderful Friday night movie.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|WELL WRITTEN FILLED WITH LITTLE KNOWN INTERESTING FACTS. A FAST MOVING AND UNUSUAL PLOT THAT KEPT ME READING LATE INTO THEN NIGHT.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app has helped me stay organized and take notes in school I would recommend it to any and all. Skitch is also a very helpful app to go along with this one.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This book was not as good as its' reviews. The story could have been told in 3 chapters, too much repetition, and I hated the ending!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I orignally listened to \\"A Discovery of Witches\\" during my drives to work and back and on long drives out of town.  I am a fan of the modern takes on witches, vampires, werewovles, and others not of the straight human race, books. I was hooked right from the begining of this trilogy. The story is not slow or predictable at all.  I found myself sitting in my car and waiting until the chapter ended before getting out.  The side stories are fantastic and blend well with the main characters.  The ending of this book left me hungry for the second work. I have downloaded the first and second books to my Kindle Fire, and am 'reading' the first book before starting the second novel. If you are a fan of this genre, Deborh Harkness is an author you will remember forever!  The third novel, I am sure, will be nothing short of AWESOME!
B004XDYJRU|3.0|it was a good app but missing alot of the stations i wanted worth the buck thought plus it did move you to a alike station.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|As a big fan of military channel TV, nothing in this book really surprised me. I didn't feel any secrets were revealed that I didn't already know about military capability. It gave me great pleasure to read about putting together dream teams of the biggest, baddest, smartest, soldiers, that have the very best equipment to do their jobs. I can imagine OBL thought processes as the teams knocked down the doors and he knew they were coming. I bet he was thinking he would be sent to trial in the US where he would throw a wrench into the system every way he could. He got his due reward, and it couldn't happen to a more deserving person. (other than maybe KSM). I'm not military, but in my dreams I wish I could have been on that raid. Reading the book is as close as I'll ever come to getting OBL. I thought it quite satisfying.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I like the kindle version better than the PC version; it seems to load quicker and it's easier to move around different boards. If you haven't tried Pinterest; this app is a good introduction.
B006LSZECO|4.0|What a great page turner.  You have to keep reading, never wanting to put the book down. Always wanting to see what happens next.  Then in the end you can't believe what is happening.
0385344333|4.0|This novel is a sequel to [[ASIN:0345541596 61 Hours: A Jack Reacher Novel]]  Not everyone will like this novel, but that is true of many novels in the Jack Reacher series.  You have to be willing to accept that not everyone will act rationally with intelligence, and accept evil plots and evil people.  Everyone in this novel is not who they seem to be (use care in reading reviews because some people babble and write spoiler reviews giving away major plot points).  Jack Reacher (who is a somewhat make-my-day Clint Eastwood type character) is traveling across country as usual, using one of his favorite travel means, i.e., hitchhiking, and stumbles into a major criminal activity (typical for Reacher novels).  He is traveling east, hoping to meet up with a woman in Virginia, when he accepts a ride in the wrong car, and gets involving in a case of carjacking/kidnapping/murder.  As usual, Reacher is willing to bend the law a bit to get things resolved (that sometimes caused him trouble back when he was in the Military Police).<br /><br />In this case, Reacher finds himself in the middle of county authorites, state police, FBI agents, the State Department, the CIA, and Homeland Security.  There is an involved undercover operation, and people don't want to give him the details.  There is a major cover-up, and people in authority consider Reacher to be someone in the way.  Events lead to a usual climax of storming an enemy operation, blazing guns, bad guys getting killed, etc.  Some characters are sacrificed along the way.  In the end, as always, Reacher heads out of town, somewhat like one of the Clint Eastwood characters riding into the sunset in one of his westerns.  The total action takes place over a few days.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great continuation of the first book. I didn't want to put the book down. I loved the whole story line.
B0027MJU00|3.0|I read all three of Gillian Flynn's books within a week. Although I enjoyed Dark Places, it was my least favorite. It's difficult to write about characters with very few redeeming qualities and keep people interested, but Flynn has a remarkable knack for drawing you into the stories of people you would attempt to avoid in real life.
B005FRF6PC|4.0|I was a big fan before reading the book and I'm a bigger fan now.  Rafa is not your typical professional athlete who thinks he deserves everything delivered to him in a silver platter.  He's a great example of how an athlete should act in and out of court.  Thank you for being such a good human being.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|Guys, I thought it was an amazing book.<br />I personally loved suspense and this book proved to me that suspense was real.<br /><br />I will agree on you,  I hated to writing style. After I read the first book,  I was ready to dive into the second. It took me half an hour to figure out that it was back and forth narriation. I'm not used to that so it took a while to catch on. But sometimes I just begged to move on to Cassia's part because it made  me want to read more.<br /><br />  Other than the writing style, Ky's narration and Cassia's story were completly different.  Which one did  l love more? In the beginning, I loved Cassia's part. Then, once Ky got a move onto the canyon with Eli and Vick, Istarted to get into that. Once Cassia finally found  Ky, I became addicted.<br /><br />  So I really did love this book and series. All the supense,the whole adventure got me totally hooked. I gave it 4 stars because I've seen better books, but this was close to its five stars.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|As much as I loved the first and second book,this book was too much in detail. I still loved reading the book, it is just that it went on and on with the same thing. In the end it was great reading. I am mad that the MOVIE is so off of what happened in the book!
B006LSZECO|4.0|My mind was effectively blown at the 51% mark of the ebook. The tense, confident voices of each character kept me intensely interested in each leg of this twisted journey.
B004UID2LC|4.0|I first got this app on my kindle fire, and loved it so much that I got it on my phone too. And for a while, all was well. But now, I am having problems downloading the songs. It works sometimes, but not often. Thankfully I had already gotten most of the songs I wanted. If they fix the glitch, I will gladly give this app 5 stars.
B006O7XOOW|5.0|I used this product while babysitting.  They babies were entertained and thrilled Blythe colors, movement and the fact they could reach up and grab it.  Gave me time to recover while they played.  Certainly worth it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is a good book. Have not finished it yet but love the writing style. Can't wait to see how it ends!
B005USZYDU|5.0|Grisham rules. All kids and kids at heart will love this book. A little heavy on legal descriptions, but for kids, very informative, and probably necessary.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I hate reading but all 3 of these books were amazing! Very easy to stay attached to the book. I never wanted to but it down because I just wanted to know what was next. Also it's not as bad as people say!
B006ZZANG0|1.0|Defective product. First shipment. CD 0ne would not play but the @nd CD of the set played. I returned it and asked for a replacement. The second shipment also had the same problem and I tried to play on three different players. I returned it for a refund. Necer again.
B0094KF4WG|3.0|Started reading this book and couldn't stop. Finished it in three days. Once you start reading it, it is difficult to keep it down
B000FC0OOU|2.0|It took me far too long to struggle my way through this novel. Hemingway's attempts to capture the flavor of Spanish syntax make the narrative sound artificial and, at times, ludicrous. Furthermore he often had characters engage in lengthy exchanges which would resolve into nothing, leaving the reader to wonder what profound point he missed. When, in fact, there really was no point at all.<br /><br />Overly long and arduous. Something to be foisted upon unhappy high-schoolers. Hemingway's just not the sort whose style appeals to.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Book 2, Fifty Shades Darker, is better than book 1, but that isnt saying much.  I really dont know why these books are so talked about.  Its repetetive beyond boredom.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book, as I have told many of my friends, is just like other SEAL books I have read in the past. It is mostly an autobiography about \\"Mark Owen\\", with the last few chapters dedicated to the Bin Laden mission.<br /><br />To those that are all up in arms about the Bin Laden thing and mission secrets. There are no secrets disclosed, and if you followed the media from the announcement you will know what I am saying.<br /><br />For the reviewers that stated Mark Owen is obviously not a writer and it was poorly written, well, of course he is not a writer, he was a Navy SEAL for the past 15 or 14 years. He didn't quite have the time to study about writing. He tells stories (real life) about previous missions in a fashion that one would tell while sitting around and BS'ing with some friends. Give the guy a break, he's a hero and he's dedicating most of the proceeds to charities that support families of fallen SEALS and SPECWAR fighters.<br /><br />I loved the book and think that anyone into the SEAL or SPECWAR books should buy this and read it immediately.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I like that the author began to delve deeper into the real story in this book. Book one was good, but it was nice to start to get some insight into the why of it all.
B003K16P3M|5.0|If you're looking for a fearless heroine - who needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle - Graceling is the book for you.  All the seven deadly sins are here in triplicate, and often in the form of \\"graces.\\"  Read it!
0553801473|4.0|I love these books!  Book 5 was a significant improvement over Book 4 - Feast of Crows - and picks up the story where Book 3 left off.
B004EPZ0H0|5.0|This is a really interesting book very well written and a great insight to the life of Henrietta lacks what a great lady thank you so much
1451627297|5.0|I read \\"11/22/63\\" by Stephen King, and have to say that it was a phenomenal read.  Jake Epping is an English teacher who is introduced to a time traveling \\"rabbit hole\\" in the back of one of his favorite burger joints run by dying Al Templeton.  Figuring out that he was able to go back in time and actually prevent events from occurring, Al became obsessed with the idea of preventing the JFK assassination, which he believed would also prevent a string of events from occurring (such as the MLK assassination).  Since Al was dying of cancer, and Jake was a younger, divorced with no children, unattached teacher, Jake was the perfect person to step in and prevent this tragedy from occurring.<br /><br />Jake goes back to 1958, and begins to change history, all the time worried about the butterfly effect (like the Ashton Kutcher movie, where changing one teensy thing can cause insurmountable changes and catastrophes).<br /><br />During his time in the past, he teaches English, makes friends, finds the love of his life, all while stalking Lee Harvey Oswald and his family.<br /><br />Will Jake be able to prevent the Kennedy assassination?<br /><br />I enjoyed this book for MANY reasons!  Jake is a quick thinker and very likable.  There's a little \\"Back to the Future\\" Biff theme, with Jake being able to earn some money by making sports bets based on outcomes he already knows, although Jake gets himself into some very hot water with those bets!<br /><br />I think one of the most thrilling parts of this story was the fact that in our world, JFK actually WAS assassinated.  So how could this book possibly end differently?  King kept me hooked until the end based on that question.<br /><br />For those of you who stay away from King because you \\"don't read horror or even watch it on TV,\\" yeah, yeah, I've heard it before.  If you know me, I can't stand horror (gory) movies, but I love psychological thrillers.  And if you say that, you're totally missing out.  Yes, King does \\"horror\\" but much of the horror is psychological, which to me is scarier than any alien or monster or vampire (although I did enjoy \\"Salem's Lot\\").<br /><br />\\"11/22/63″ would be a great introduction to King if you're not a horror fan.  It's not a scary novel, just very suspenseful.  As a warning, it's a long book, but well worth it!  I'm not the biggest history buff, but there was enough background so that I didn't get lost with the history aspect.<br /><br />You would enjoy this book if you like reading suspenseful novels and/or if you enjoy history.<br /><br />If you could go back in time to prevent an event from occurring, what event would you stop?<br /><br />Thanks for reading,<br /><br />Rebecca @ Love at First Bookbut much of the horror is psychological, which to me is scarier than any alien or monster or vampire (although I did enjoy \\"Salem's Lot\\").<br /><br />\\"11/22/63″ would be a great introduction to King if you're not a horror fan.
