B0045IPOPE|3.0|The movie was good but it was incredibly long and I started loosing my interest in it about half way through.
B00AKL1XPU|2.0|I love this game. Its very fun but it was very hard to down load on my kindle fire. I finally did and had a nice group of animals in my zoo when all of a sudden it deleted everything I did..wow it felt like someone let the air out of my balloon, so to speak..You all need to not get so into the game and just be prepared for it to happen to you...
B00425S1H8|3.0|Could not install the drivers on the supplied CD onto my Windows Vista laptop. Manufacturer's web site was awful and no help whatsoever. Finally decided to let Windows auto detect and search for the drivers itself and that worked like a charm. Score one for MS getting it right. USB serial connector works great. Plug gable Technologies, revamp your support site!
B004EPYZSK|5.0|Aliens attack and our heros fight them off with six shooters...it's got andventure, drama, gun battles and hunky guys saving the day.  So what if it's silly...it's a good break from life.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Although Travis seems to have anger problems, and Abby seems to have commitment issues they seem perfect for one another. I may have to re-read I loved the story it seemed real.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Loved it!  Will watch again and again. Great action, great characters, great story and great quality.  Couldn't put down.  Watched in just a couple of days.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|Cloud Atlas - Kindle Version for iPhone was an enjoyable read.  This  tale  of past, present and future  good and evil, love and loss recycling itself over thousands of years intrigued me.  You are transported back and forth between a post-apocalyptic Hawaii, a slave ship , 70's journalism, London and a horrifying future where the monopoly of a fast food giant, Papa Song, is revealed.  In each of these worlds created by the author  David Mitchell ghosts of the past emerge whispering a herald that is demanding to be heard. .
B00ADYYY50|2.0|I love the first album.  This album is a horrible one.  I don't know what he was thinking on this one.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Beautiful movie..very well written, the scenes were wonderful...I wish the score was more memorable. Tommy Lee Jones was the best ever!! Daniel Day Lewis was awesome.
B007HACDLK|3.0|Love Vince Flynn books. This one did not seem to measure up to some his earlier books. Won't stop reading his books, this one just did not hit a home run for me.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Awesome!! Really what can I say about this movie. I don't have to say anything other than this movie is awesome...
B005H9B44A|5.0|This was the best of all the avenger movies. Better then ironman and captain america...... Thor had a better story line that takes u to another place while watching. If you like space and scifi or feel like you need to be on another planet with a different race of humans, this movie will amaze u
B003IWRE3I|4.0|I really enjoyed the film, but it was not a feel good flick. The Road avoided all of the usual Hollywood urges to end on a high note.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Nice and easy to figure out how to play with the help button. Got it for my mom and she loves it.
B0060MYK7G|5.0|Don't have HBO but do now have both years of the Borgias.  Hope there will be many more.  Its like a train wreck...but you just can't take your eyes off it.  Great photography, story line and acting.  HBO has done it again.
1400069289|5.0|This book had been on my wish list for a while. I write about \\"smart habits for rich living\\" on my blog, and have been studying habits for a long time. And this book is exceptional in what it offers, compared to all that I've read and learned so far about habits. I happen to love Duhigg's writing voice and style: funny, engaging, and clear, with a little bit of \\"freakonomics\\" or \\"hidden side of everything\\" attached to his case studies, but not too much that it turns it into a Malcolm Gladwell kinda book and while I love Gladwell, I didn't want too many case studies. This book has the right balance and they are all fascinating stories that break down Duhigg's concept of the habit loop.<br /><br />I am sure it is still work - YES work - to break bad habits and build good ones. It's not a walk in the park, and we are humans so even the habit loop can fail us on some days but the approach to habits is smart. It is not this forced disciplined style that I've used all my life, which has not worked all that well. It is not a manipulation of the brain or anything like that. It is an understanding into our own psyche and then using that information in a logical way, even if it does not seem intuitive at all.<br /><br />The habit loop is at the center of this book, as you may know: The cues that lead us to the routines that get us to the reward. Identifying those cues correctly is the first step of the process and the examples here help me understand how to apply the habit loop not just to my own life, but to that of my wonderful husband and who knows, maybe even to a few of my willing clients.<br /><br />Build smart habits, break old habits that no longer serve you and use the habit loop that Duhigg teaches here. It works!
B00992CF6W|4.0|I really enjoy this app but it should have a few more things. I know it can't be exactly like the pc or Xbox version because why buy it then. But it would be really nice if you could add the stuff that follows: More animals please! Also to be able to tame them and breed, boats! I really really want boats lol, skins! I don't like the guy look.. caves! I really want caves and mine carts/rails, Redstone! I found it while mining but I couldnt keep it. Pressure plates! Hehe. Bigger lands! Being able to place water! Also its really really hard to find red mushrooms. Lol this is a long review.. but overall I really really like the game(:
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|this book unfolds and captures not just your heart but had me looking at past areas of my life where I had made mistakes by not stepping forward into life and to noticing now where I might be holding back from life.
B002KGEORM|5.0|The first season is still my favorite, but the second is equally riveting. In the first season, time was spent establishing the characters and their history and back stories. Now we move forward against a new rival -- and sometimes, it is hard to keep watching some of the violence. But superb plotlines and better-than-ever acting from Katey Segal keep you captivated.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|I chose this rating 'cause Firefly rocks! I used to HAVE to watch Star Trek for Science homework every Friday night when I was in 8th grade (1967-68). Now we really have tablets, cell phones, etc. I have no desire to be a Companion, but it is interesting to see how Joss (does his first name mean \\"luck\\" or \\"fate\\" in Chinese?) Whedon has thrown the Chinese language, some costumes and decor into the mix -- almost as if he knew 10 yrs ago what will happen to our economy unless we wake up. Notice how all the characters speak Chinese as their second language regardless of their first? The Chinese laugh at our purchase-based economy NOW. Please don't give them enough to laugh about ten more years from now, otherwise we'll ALL be demanding to be taken out to the black and they can burn the land and boil the sea. Like my celtic forbears, they can't take the sky from me. I can never even read the lyrics for the ballad of Serenity w/o tears. My dad was the Senior Test Project Engineer in charge of Post-Recovery Operations for the Apollo Project, courtesy of North American Aviation, who also brought you the Mitchell B-52!
B002WSASIC|5.0|American History X is powerful, gritty, graphic and absolutely belivable! It's message hasn't lost its impact 15 years later. Believe me, I saw it in 1998 and rented it recently. Both Edward Norton and Edward Furlong are amazing! If you haven't seen this, you must. If you have... It's one of those movies that's got to be seen again!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app. it is awesome it is awesome when you are on the go.  So if you need to know when you want to go.  Accuweather is there
B00AKGG5VC|5.0|MFSL's Original Master Recording series LP always sounds great. This album is my 3rd MFSL O.M.R. series LP, and sounds good, looks good. Also shipping and delivery is really fast and in good condition.<br />I want to strongly recomend this item to anyone who wants to listen old analogue musics not for collection but for listening.
B0012GMZ5E|5.0|I am a big fan of Johnny Winter.  I love the selections and hope to enjoy them many years to come.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|the book is ALWAYS better, but this was entertaining enough on its own. I suggest reading books before watching them made into movies ALWAYS :)
B0089LOKHG|4.0|I really liked Requiem.  Though I wish there was another book so I knew what happens to the group with their new beginning with freedom.
B009Y6V7XK|5.0|As a fan of the older Cradle of Filth releases, I enjoy seeing them go back to their older style.  But this time around, it seems smarter and more mature than earlier releases while keeping the attitude.<br /><br />The more recent releases before this one were still good, but they seemed to be straying too far from their core sound and attitude.  Overall, I really enjoyed this one!
B009HV2JT8|5.0|My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  It was well acted, had an interesting story and the special effects were wonderful.  I'm an avid admirer of the great president from a historical perspective, but I just put all that aside and accepted it for what it was
B0063IH60K|5.0|Wonderful game to pass the time when you are waiting for someone or waiting for an appointment. Great graphics for background and decks.
B008OOYALE|5.0|great fun...design your own dragon world...wait for baby dragons and interact with other dragon lover's from all over the world:)
B000NMY7CM|5.0|If you have had dealings with someone addicted to drugs you understand what Sandra portrays in this movie. Nothing matters to the addict but her on satisfaction. Only when she realizes her own dependence can she overcome the problem.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved reading this.  This novel offered an insightful peek into the experiences of people and families dealing with mental illness.  The story line was well developed and engaging - I couldn't put it down!  Really, a terrific read.
B003Y74KCK|5.0|i love it because i can lay this on my dash board in my car and it does not move around.  easy to handle!
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I really enjoyed this novel- it was an insightful read!  The characters are incredibly well-developed and the author did a wonderful job of engaging the reader in the character's emotions and experiences.  Well written!
B00A80SHFM|4.0|Once you hear even one of these songs you cannot get it out of your mind! I am somewhat biased by the Broadway presentations & the many talented singers over the years.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It was a very interesting story, but I hated the ending.  The story was good, but the ending ruined it for me.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Another wonderful CD by Josh Groban. I have all of his other CD's & am always pleasantly surprised by his song writing as well as his singing talents.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|I have seen three versions on stage. I never thought that a film could capture the essense of this classic  tale inspired about the Hunnchback of Notre Dame. This video gives more dimension to this love story. The beauty of the Paris Opera, behind the scenes, as beautiful as I have ever seen it. The story on this video is more profound and has more dimension than the stage version. A must for every home library<br />Tony Clark<br />Chevalier dans l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.
067144901X|5.0|The animal sounds story is good to keep kids interested. My young son loves to flip the thick pages himself. A very good book for toddlers!
B003QSJVV2|5.0|One of my all time favorites and I would highly recomend it to anyone who loves cars and action. Great Flick
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Lots of fun to play. If you have played other games where caring for a pet,then you will enjoy this game. Various challenges keep you on your toes.
B00BP3DPJY|5.0|great somg writing and great execution. can listen to each track back to back whether you're on a road trip or sitting around drinking beer. plus if your lady friend has good taste in music, chances are she'll love this album too!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's like temple run but better not as complicated good for kids I would pay two pound for it atleast
B00AO7HN8Q|2.0|If you plan to listen to these Vinyl Pic Discs, do not bother buying them. If you want them to hang on your wall, then by all means, they look cool. I found out the hard way, bought Beast and this, blew 70 bucks.. Picture discs are just unlistenable. Oh well, I have cool wall decorations though, framing them up.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|Would like it better if Kindle HD took pics of other things.Who wants to take pics of themselves all the time? Don't answer lol.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|The acting is solid. Only the time-travel plot is sloppy. Considering that the movie was made more for fun than thought, that's okay.
B007N8RULO|4.0|too many ads in the way,if you don't watch out you'll click on them, and of course unlike the game they'll open right away!.
B005H8DEMG|5.0|Shakespeare was a strong proponent of the polytheist world view, a believer in the serious magic of it. This is his crowning statement. Also, well acted, beautifully set, strong special effects.
B004VMUS9G|1.0|Turned up every volume control on the Kindle Fire and can barely hear the alarm. Maybe it only works on cell phones.
B0098VXMNE|4.0|Not as strong as the first season, but still worth watching. How many of us still, all considered, are slaves?
B006G2NVCA|3.0|'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo' by David Fincher is a fantastic movie and a major part of that movie is the amazing soundtrack that comes along with the visuals.  The key word here is 'WITH'.  I have rarely listened to a soundtrack that is so necessary in the context of the movie.<br /><br />Is this soundtrack bad?  Certainly not but it is like listening to constant background music.  In the right atmosphere (eg. WITH the film) it is perfect.  Without, it is very hard to enjoy.  Scores that have some kind of a \\"theme\\" are much easier to listen to independently and without the existence of tracks that sit on an island by themselves it is a droning listen at times.<br /><br />I loved the score for 'The Social Network' and wanted to love this score on its own merits but it is very hard to do.  I like it but I would rarely find myself listening to this.<br /><br />Caveat emptor.<br /><br />***
B009XPGJYY|5.0|Great writing this season! Unexpected twists and turns. Some sad moments too. The season finale got us to purchase season five.
B00772M1F6|5.0|There is so much brilliance in this album. JD finally takes art back to music, standing out in a world full of musicians plugging notes into computers and generic formulas. This album sounds like it came straight out of the 50's or 60's but has some modern quirks that make it truly special. If you're into rockabilly, country, or even motown, then I definitely recommend!
B00BGIBVP8|4.0|The other reviews for this movie did not give enough credit for how funny it was. It made me laugh my butt off! There are so many funny truths to life in this movie.
B003Y8YXFS|1.0|This remix was very disappointing for me. Maybe i got a bad cd copy because the music quality wasn't up the industry standards. I can't imagine any professional putting this mix out for sale. This song Imagine is a John Lennon standard which this cd should reflect. I was very disappointed and returned this to Amazon. Oh Well
B001BKVWYG|4.0|Sixto Rodriguez has some very strong lyrics, but they are original and real. We are happy we purchased this CD.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I love these Rick Riordan books. I've always been interested in Greek Mythology and these books make the gods and goddesses seem more human which is very entertaining.
B004XGN8W4|1.0|This is the WORST $250 I have ever spent. I wish I would have bought the vanguard instead. I'm stuck with this TINY 15.5 inch screen. I honestly hate it.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|I really loved this book, it was beautifully written and it is one of those books you hate coming to the final page, you dont want it to end!  you are with Harold every step of the way and really connect with the main characters, if you havent already read it you are in for a treat!
B009EEFTMC|3.0|I love the the bright colors which is probably attracted me to it.  Have not tried all the different play modes yet
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Yeah, I know it's just another zombie show but the character development is awesome. Good bad guys, bad good guys....you have to watch to understand.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I liked the pace of the book.  Obviously to make sense you need to read the first one.<br />  Great book!
B0002BO0AS|5.0|I Could Listen To 'Endless' 10 To 20 Times :) One Hell Of An Epic Metal Song! I Haven't Got A Chance To Hear All The Songs From The Album, But What I Heard Was Pretty Sweet :)
B009UX2YAC|1.0|This game sucks balls it lags so much.my sister said it does not respond the game is a waste of energy and time don't get this game
B00BFHZOCG|5.0|You can never go wrong with Anthrax but when they decide to do covers it is a welcome bonus. They probably have the strongest catalogue of cover songs of any metal band in history. Add to that this awesome EP with some songs that you wouldn't expect, but<br />they are versions that give it the full Anthrax treatment. These songs are the same great rockers, but basically turbocharged so they sound current and vital and kick-ass. Awesome collection. One nit-picky comment I have though is I would have LOVED to have heard more obscure gems from Lizzy and AC/DC instead of the songs EVERYONE seems to cover. Maybe &#34;Emerald&#34; and &#34;Down-Payment Blues&#34;, respectively?  Looking forward to Anthems II featuring &#34;Borrowed Time&#34; by Styx &#34;Dirty White Boy&#34; by Foreigner...A guy can dream right?
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Loved the game, kept me occupied for quite a while enjoying the fast pace of trying to beat the clock.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Its a great game. I love it, and its a great time passer. It is addictive, and you should get it and enjoy it yourself.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I this movie.  That is all I have to say.  A very good movie. Six more words, and I am done.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|I was very hesitant when ordering this item, however when I received it all doubts were washed away. It works perfect on my 5th and 6th generations ipods. No problems whatsoever. Highly Recommended!
B000FA675C|5.0|Download worked great and i am very happy with this product. i will purchase again in the future. Thank you
B002VHI8HC|4.0|Darkly dreaming Dexter has a jaunty,humorous tone despite its dark subject matter. Somehow the writer manages to sound both jaded and poetic.  I love the alliteration almost as much as the main character,who is the most interesting anti hero ive come across in years. Strongly recommended.
B004HW7JI8|3.0|two of the discs didnt play good at my dvd and ruined the pleasure of a nice dvd, so a bit dissapointibg
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|i love this game it gives me something to do and not get board that easly. many others think its not so fun but it actually is,  i realy love it, with all the neat looking dragons to boot:).
B00ARI9CDQ|4.0|I like this app because it makes it easier to view the news I like to read about. It doesn't take near as long for it to download and I have the option of clicking on the photos instead of them taking forever to download when on their website.
072325804X|5.0|What a gorgeous book!  My teenager said when her little sister is finished with it, she would like to keep it.  The only bad thing about it is that it is such a large book my five old may have a little difficulty handling it.  I know that it is most likely used by parents as a lap book to read aloud, which I will do as well, but my daughter loves reading the stories herself too!  We'll see...it's going to be an Easter present.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|Any time I would try & open the camcorder once in the app it always caused the camera app to stop.
B000002TLX|5.0|I never knew of the writer singer until I was watching a movie and his songs were in the soundtrack. I then did some research and found that most of the popular hits were either written or song by him.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I luv this cant stop playin this game cue its so awesome but still it's not better than the other games sometimes other games having problems but still this game is like the top 100000000.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I've read this book so many times, I've actually lost count. Definitely my favorite series! Orson Scott Card is a genius!!
B005C8ENI0|4.0|I would have been upset if I had paid full theater price to see this, but with Prime it was OK. Nothing special or memorable, but enjoyable way to spend an evening.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Has a few glitches, but over all  it works  and is quite fun. I liked that there are things you can do by achieving a specific level, but the variety of things  could have a wider range of activities. Perhaps some of the accessories for the horse could be less expensive, seeing as how the expensiveness of the items let me down  (I would have to play too much to get rhe amount of money, and it is not too interesting to play this game due to the fact that to earn money /health /happiness for one's horse obe has to wait). Apart from this, I think its a good free app.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Mesmerizing. The joy is we can go onto the next episode when we can't stand the suspense. And we view this as a family, together, when everyone is free.
B008476HBM|3.0|Story about people in England and the way they class people and how they look at people who have money and power.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I really like Feedly as a replacement for Reader.  It is easy to sort through all my craft blogs and orgsnize then.  I like the thumbnail style main page also.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Book started out kinda slow, but built up with the trial and tribulations of running away from a husband who was mentally ill and had a surprise ending!
B000FC10MU|4.0|Deep thoughts presented in an easy to enjoy story, with a hero that you want to meet. The old gods are far more romantic than the new.
B00BEZTMWW|1.0|Took over a week to get here. What's the use of preordering??!! I think I'm going to go to best buy next time?!
1439152802|5.0|This was exactly what I wanted from the book when I picked it up--a fabulous read.  My favorite Kate Morton.
B001UGB1X8|3.0|It was a fair Tommy Lee Jones vehicle, but it could have had a much better plot line.<br />But if you like South Louisiana and New Orleans, you'll enjoy this.
B0037NVM1I|4.0|There is added footage in the director's cut that explains some of the scenes better than the original release. There is some humor too, loved the scene where the T1 is learning to smile. Just goes to show that adding just a little more content adds more depth to a movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Ok, of all games that tried to copy templerun, this one is the BEST. It is so much fun, how they update the. cites from time to time. Really fun game.
B0096HIEE2|5.0|Channing of course is marvellous...cannot figure out how he even does a lot of that.  MacConnouhey (sp) is good too but he plays such a slimy character, I couldn't entirely buy him.  Also the woman lead is excellent.
B004SH40BQ|3.0|I keep coming back to this item, because when it works it is awesome.  Maybe the 3rd time will be the charm...I've had two in under a year, because they are incredibly fragile and seem to last no more than a few months (at most) before they stop syncing properly.  The warranty is only 90 days, although I will say customer service has been excellent when I have had problems during the warranty period.<br /><br />When it works, it has a great range, stays synced in environments that other transmitters cannot cope with, is easy to use and transmits a good quality sound from my iPod 5th gen.<br /><br />I keep shopping for a transmitter that works well, has good range, and lasts more than a few months.  I want this to be the one, in spite of the problems I've had, because when it works it is better than the the others I've tried by a long shot.
B009Z8FUB2|5.0|When you get it, you will not know how you lived without it.  It is that good.  And it makes the film better to be able to play this music while you are loading the dishwasher or changing the sheets.
B004XNGKBS|5.0|Nice app...super fun to play with but....I regret paying almost 4 dollars for it.....I wish there were a free version
B002CNK1MK|5.0|This is another case where I rented it first then bought it.  It never fails to make me cry.  And Cruise is at his best.  Very young and beautiful and without the anger he shows in his more recent films.  I hear they are making a sequel but I've got this one which I play to my heart's content.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I love this demo...the only thing is it limits u to how many thing s you can do.....you can't still sleep or build certain things
1907360468|4.0|Shakespeare tells us all we need to know about how to construct a drama.  How to introduce conflict...how to resolve issues.<br />Well, you know.  Shakespeare cannot be outdone.
B00846WWVM|5.0|Nice app but after a while u get sick of it......kinda stupid made for younger ages deconstructing pay for it
B003SHUMRI|5.0|At least that's my take on it.  Full of great dancing and his sexy expressions.  Just cannot get enough.  Buy it.  It is very reasonably priced with a story line almost as good as Magic Mike.  Sexiest Man Alive
B003FNWR6Y|5.0|I bought this for my best friends 21st, as she is a huge monoply fan and loves nintendo!<br />And she loves it! A great version of monoply.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Definitely grab the HD version.  It's well worth it.  There are incredible scenes that need to be seen that way.  I hadn't read the book, so the end was a surprise.  Good movie.
0374214913|1.0|I love to read, and was excited about this book because of its themes of books and puzzles.  The first few chapters were promising, but I was really put off once the Google girl appeared.  The entire book fawns over Google and the might of Googlers in a way that is clearly not satire; I got the sense that the author drank the Google koolaid.  I know what Google is like, and this book does not reflect that.  After the first few chapters with excessive Google fawning, I had to skim very quickly through any passages including any Google characters.  (Also, is Clay's reaction to the Google girl really what guys are like when they fall in love with a girl?  I found that part of the book to be 110% unconvincing.)  I would have preferred that the author had made up a company instead of using a real one - I think he would not have run into the same problems of how people relate to Google.  Or perhaps that was the point?  Either way, I felt that it detracted from the book.<br /><br />My other overall criticism is that the book seems more like a sketch or a spec script than it does a real novel - it lacks any true substance.  Clay's friends are described briefly, but don't really figure into the story - even when they're integral to the plot.  I was hoping for more depth to the world imagined in these bookstores and the Festina Lente Company - more puzzle, and less twee, self-satisfied description.  I hate to say it, but I would not read another book by this author after this novel failed so deeply to deliver on its promise.
B004EPYZZ8|4.0|It is a nice movie to watch, I especially liked the beach views, the photography is really good.  The story is inspiring, but I'm not sure about the actors' performance.  The Christian background and approach seemed superficial.  But good movie overall, I would recommend it.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|I would recommend this book to everyone I know. I know this book will be one of my &#34;must reads&#34; a few times a year.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I read this book every year at Christmas time. Very well written and easy to read. Great reading for adults and youngsters.
B008M7JODC|5.0|This is one of the best TV series I've ever watched. If you're a sci-fi nerd/geek & enjoy shows like Battlestar Galactica & The Walking Dead then check this out. Walter rules!
B0083Z614S|4.0|Read this book when I was younger, maybe twelve. Just read it again as an adult in my thirties. Good read but I enjoyed it more as a kid.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Poor streaming quality. Fight scenes blurry. Other than that it was nice. Please fix the quality I like to see what I am watching a bit better.
B002RI9ZUE|5.0|Sylvia Plath has a new fan in me. It's so beautifully written and relatable. It's too bad this was her one and only novel.
B000QJM8Z0|5.0|This book is simply funny. A good &#34;beach read&#34; I think- quick, silly, and totally girly. I think every woman can relate to some part of Bridget's life. This is a book that I could read over and over again.
B0041OT9W6|5.0|This book has touched me deeply. At the beginning, I didn't enjoy the read much. I felt like I was reading any 13 year old's diary. But the more I read and the older she got, I really started to admire her. She has incredible insight for a 14-15 year old. And, her optimism and faith in humanity when experiencing the worst of it is inspiring to say the least.<br /><br />The passages about her dreams for the future absolutely broke my heart as we know this story doesn't end happily.<br /><br />The diary ends abruptly as they are captured by the SS. The last entries bring tears to my eyes as she excitedly writes about her return to school and with the wish to someday show the world her true self.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I truly love Colleen Hoover's writing. She knows how to draw you in. You feel as if you truly know the characters. I loved the story- different and totally unexpected.
B00BESJYAY|4.0|Great surf footage. Good story with message of setting goals and a plan for success  Good acting. We highly recommend it.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|I loved loved loved this series and was very excited for the final conclusion of the trilogy. However I was really disappointed. I found the pacing hurried and I felt as though Oliver  had to finish up the end in a hurry because the last few chapters I found lazing and lacking. I would have loved for her to dive more into the intricacies of the characters as it was nearing the end and given us a more thoughtful conclusion. But it was still entertaining and a really good story.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|This product works and looks like its description. What more could I want...Fairly priced, YES it was  worth every penny. I recommend it (owner of three fires)
B00000FCBC|5.0|METALLICA AT THERE RAWEST! I COULD HAVE DONE WITHOUT THE FIRST DISC THOUGH, ITS PRETTY MUCH GARBAGE, (NO PUN INTENDED). DISC 2 ON THE OTHER HAND IS THE REASON METALLICA IS MY FAVORITE HEAVY METAL BAND OF ALL TIME.... NUFF SAID!!!
B007712XAU|5.0|wonderful show, as alway from the BBC.  Great acting.  wonderful characterization and brilliant writing.<br /><br />It is fantastic to own it and be able to view wnenever I want!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I thought this book was very good and entertaining!! I know some people thought it was to over the top love story and sets bad examples but i thought it was worth the read.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like it but u cant see objects to well. u need to change objects when u have to search same rooms over and over.
B0012HQKZE|4.0|Had seen it years ago.  After viewing again, still think it is a good movie.<br />***Wish you would not set an amount of words used for the public reviews.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|I want to use on my Kindle fire to download emails that have PDF files.  I downloaded the reader and I still can't download any PDF files.  I may be doing something wrong but the instructions certainly don't tell me how to use it on the Kindle Fire
B0095P29EG|5.0|I love the whole series especially the Iron Man movies.  This is part of the saga.  must see before the Avengers.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|The movie arrived promptly and was securely shipped. There were no surprises or glitches whatsoever during the course of the movie. My son thoroughly wnjoyed the movie, and we appreciate you. I advise anyone to shop with you. Thanks!
B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|Sometimes prequels dont work well but this one does.  It gives more info to the ring saga.  WATCH THE NORMAL LORD OF THE RINGS SERIES FIRST.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|this game is a great game I love it so much! but there is one big problem. gems. It took all spring break to save up my gems in hopes to win a pony in a game. then I don't get a pony,  just stupid statues.  so I delete my game to start over. and guess what?,  It would'nt install again. It only said &quot;open&#733; I clicked on it. nothing happened. I would reccomend this for everybody! but,  be prepared! ( kids that don't know better that would spend 100$ on princess celestial should play this game with their pearents)
B00AMBH70S|5.0|I love this type of movie.  lots of action.  In particular I like plausibly realistic action (not that it would or could happen but at not something super human).
B0058VW36U|5.0|my little brony brothers and mua ( I'm a pegasister) love the omnom. they call him omen though. Fun for all! play as a family! ponies forever!
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|I normally love kid movies but this one really had limited appeal for me. The concept was good but for me did not quite make it.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is definitely one of the best games I have ever played.  It is challenging without being too difficult. I have thoroughly enjoyed it and highly recommend it!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Great read, that was action packed. I used this book for tutoring a student who does not like reading and she was ready for the next one when we finished. It's no Potter but I think it appeals to an older crowd anyhow.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|As I have found with each season and each episode, this show is limitless in its imaginative creation.  While I have a bias opinion of science fiction I feel I would love the inventive nature of this show as well as the rich character development even without that predetermined love of the genre.  I am sad to think it will someday end but such is the way of the world.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for the next scene. Great game!!!!<br />Go ahead and pay for full version instead of starting with the free version saves you time!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|i love this game it becomes more challenging as u go but that is what makes this game so fun
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is not only relaxing and entertaining, but also stimulating brain training.  Levels become progressively more challenging so there is not risk of soon becoming bored with it.  I would recommend it for all ages. Graphics are brilliantly colored and large enough to be easily manipulated, and simple enough so as not to be overwhelming with detail. I wish I had had it for my mother who had dementia.  I believe she would not only have enjoyed it for entertainment, but for its brain-stimulating benefits.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i have a horse of my own this game is really close to a real horse. i hope you enjoy!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Saw an article on Slate talking about this book and decided to pick it up. It did not disappoint. By the second half of the book I had a hard time putting it down.
B005HSL626|4.0|it is OK but some times this game does get really boring some times but it is some times better then cutting up real fruit
B0096BIENY|5.0|I have all of IL Divo DVD's and CD's.  They are simply the best. The blending of their voices and the selections are second to none.Will have have the pleasure of seeing them in person in May at the Fantasy Springs Casino in Indio, CA. They have been #1 on my bucket list for years. Even though some of the selections are on other discs, it is good to have them all together.  Highly recommend!
B0034DGPEU|3.0|A good read although predictable at times.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes historical novels of the south.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The twists and turns of this book will keep you on the edge of your chair.  It would make a great movie to help expose the problem of human trafficing that takes place around the world.  To think that something like this could happen in America is really disturbing.  One has to wonder what really happened to the young woman that disappeared from Aruba several years ago as well as the pictures of children routinely displayed on milk cartons and in pictures of missing children displayed in many places.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|An interesting read, but not the page-turner that &#34;Lone Survivor&#34; and &#34;No Easy Day&#34; were.  Those books told a story about a single event seasoned with tales of BUD/S and other training.  Kyle's book was a bunch of brief accounts like &#34;one day we were stationed above a river and this happened&#34; or &#34;one time I was assigned to protect some Marines and...&#34;.  Not saying it was bad, it just didn't read like a regular novel and pull me into the plot.  One aspect similar books are lacking is the periodic input from Kyle's wife as a constant reminder of how hard the lifestyle of a special forces operator can be on relationships.  Kyle estimates something like 95% of marriages to SEALs end in divorce, a perspective you won't see in other texts.  It's not all guts and glory and I appreciated that being included in the book.  If there was a continuous plot in the book it was about his relationship with his wife and family and how they struggled to stay together.  A decent read, just not quite as good as &#34;Lone Survivor&#34; and &#34;No Easy Day&#34; IMHO.
B00AYXNKIC|5.0|I like the graphics on this awesome game.  I rate it better than minecraft!<br />It is better than the first game.
B00BEZTMWW|2.0|The blu-ray was great but could not use the ultra violet copy as I was in the wrong region which should not be happening if you are selling worldwide
1476729719|5.0|Who hasn't been bullied at school? My heart broke in different ways for each of the characters as they tried to make sense of what had happened. That is one of the things I love about this author's writing: her characters are so real.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This game is cool and scary you can adjust the fog and lighting and slendermans script works well. Totally worth the dollar. Can't wait until chapter 2
B000QRIGLC|5.0|True American Heroes!!  Great read! Hard to put down, The choice they made due to the s***ty rules that only our forces abide by!  I have nothing but respect for these men & their family's!
B000VDDWE2|5.0|This movie never gets old. I saw this in theaters when I was 14. I loved it then and i love it now. Excellent if you like disaster movies. Even if you don't and you just wanna watch something when your bored, this is a great flick either way. Great actors, wonderful special effects scenery. simply put, A+ hands down and two thumbs way up. A true work of art from a skilled genius. Roland Emmerich really outdid himself on this one.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|Lincoln is a slow and dry retelling of a part of history that had the possibility of being so much more. Don't waste the money to buy or rent it.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|This is a great digital rendition of this book, I have always enjoyed reading it and having it on my phone now is even better.
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|Has some decent twists and turns. You might find you are watching your kids more closely and paying attention to bumps in the night too.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|This is a great digital rendition of this book, I have always enjoyed reading it and having it on my phone now is even better.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I love walking dead it's me and wife's favorite show. We just started watching it and we have watch from the beginning to now in just month.
B002RKS81O|5.0|This is a great digital rendition of this book, I have always enjoyed reading it and having it on my phone now is even better.
B008N2Z1L0|5.0|I bought this for my wife as she is a big fan of this band. I have to rely on her feelings for this CD. She loves it, it was in her CD player for several days after she got it.
B002RKSZKI|5.0|This is a great digital rendition of this book, I have always enjoyed reading it and having it on my phone now is even better.
B00000G6TL|5.0|Having grown up listening to the Purple, I wanted this mainly to have these songs on one CD.  They are not the same without Ritchie's guitar these days.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I find this product to be very useful when I am searching for information on the internet. It is great!
B00846REIS|4.0|This book has the passion and possession that any 50 shades fan would want. It has just the right twists that creates its own story, different from 50 shades. I finished the 2 books in 3 days. I can't wait for the next one in June!
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is a fast moving game there is a lot of obicol in it. so you shoud really getit
B000IZ21BS|5.0|l really enjoyed this movie.  It was action packed, thrilling edge of your seat and left me wanting to rent the others and looking forward to seeing the very newest one out this fall of 2013.
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|It was really fun to watch the scenes that were put back in the movie.  I would have left them in the movie to begin with.  I mean what is a few minutes added to the film.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I Loved it. It wad amazing. Could not put it down. Loved that there was a sequel. I want another one.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|This sound track from the recent film is just beautiful. It contains all the highlights and is a haunting reverie of the story. We were surprised at the price (lower than expected) and rapid delivery (came from Argentina, of all places) of the product.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This was a great book and easy to follow. It kept my attention. I I am already recommending it to friends.
B00BI745AA|5.0|I didn't know they still made movies like this.  Excellent performances by a strong cast. We knew Jackman could sing. But, the others can as well.
B000B8IA2G|5.0|atlantis took us into another univers and showed us the ancient's battle excitng as it as and their downfall. loved every minute of it
B000GCFG7E|4.0|Very enjoyable - I am a big fan of Lee Child and his Jack Reacher series - this did not disappoint
B004JMZPJG|5.0|It fits my Nikon 5100 perfectly. Good quality with reasonable price.  Recommend for day trip only. I'd prefer to use Logic backpack for long term travel, so I can bring more lens with me.
B007FIY3VW|1.0|I rated it 1 star because that is as low as Amazon's review site would let me go! I just purchased this app a few minutes ago for my new Samsung Galaxy Note phone.  I have attempted to edit a Word docx document created via Word 2007.  It kept crashing my phone's keyboard. I[[ASIN:B007FIY3VW Olive Office Premium]] finally attempted to just make a document in the app and it crashed my phone completely 2 times.  Wish I had not spent even the small purchase price for it because it was TOTALLY  NOT WORTH EVEN THAT!!!
B00BEZTMQ8|3.0|Normally when I see that an digital copy is included with a DVD or a Blu-Ray, I'm happy to spend the money to purchase it.  I normally redeem the code through iTunes and go on my merry way with my disc and digital copies.  However, The Hobbit does not include an iTunes download.  If the code is redeemed, you are forced to get an UltraViolet account to access the movie via streaming, and you have the option to download an app from Flixster in order to watch it offline.  Is it too much to ask that I be able to purchase a DVD or DVD and Blu-Ray and an iTunes download when a digital copy is included?  I shouldn't have to set up extra accounts or download more apps onto my already crowded hard drive.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|this is a book you cant put down broke reading records. Very well written and good detailed. cant wait if for number 3
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Very good book! I recommend this book to people who like magic and adventure. There are many cool characters in this book
B007J4T2G8|5.0|dont have words to described havent read something so intence and so well told. hoping for a forth one to come out
B0054JZC6E|4.0|so much fun! i love playing these mini games!! too bad it takes so long to unlock them all. other than that I love it!
B00BOL126U|4.0|If you are looking for a documentary of life among the Norsemen during the Viking Age, this series is not for you.<br />History Channel's \\"Vikings\\" is a mixture of history, myth, and saga stirred together into a concoction meant to feed modern sensibilities.<br />Don't get me wrong it's not a bad series for what it is. It is very entertaining stuff.<br />But \\"Vikings\\" is more of a reflection of the culture that produced the series than a fair representation of the culture it seeks to depict.<br />Watchable and enjoyable, \\"Vikings\\" will appeal to all except those whom demand 100% fidelity to what can be proven historically and archeologically.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I can wait till the next book. There was a thrill around each turn I loved the story zoo much.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|I am enjoying this game. It is not the most thrilling, or the most meditative, but I enjoy it. I don't seem to be able to visually manipulate the symbols as well as some other games.
1451620829|5.0|This book is a great read. Whether you  like KISS or not, this book shows the highs and lows of being a musician. Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I am on my second time through. It is great! I really like the difficulty levels, the variety of configurations, the types of illustrations used and even the music. It is great!
B009CF3MEK|4.0|The story moves slowly but becomes ever more riveting as it progresses. Initially, distinct qualities of the characters seem to be lacking but they emerge with clarity and surprises at the end. The end result is that the movie evoked significant conversation between my spouse and me after viewing and also resulted in individual reflection for several days.<br /><br />Yes, the film could have been shorter.  Yes, the story could move faster, much faster. But, it stimulates thought not only during the viewing but for days afterward. Well worth viewing but don't expect pure entertainment and escapism.  This is a thinking person's film.
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|I enjoyed this game, despite the obnoxious, nerve grinding sound effects. Then I ran out of time in less than an hour. This could be a marvelous escape, hypnotic and engrossing, but not worth having to pay every few hours.
B00BQPEIT2|1.0|Why isn't it available for kindle fire? It says that it is not compatible. Why not? Im afraid that it may never work. I was so excited!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I need easier access to instructions because I can't remember how to jump or skip. Also, I am not much into enjoying being chased by monsters.
B0068THAGY|3.0|It was okay.  I expected more.  The story dragged and took a while to develop. I liked the movie making within the movie.  AJ Michalka was very convincing.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|One book I just couldn't read fast enough. Great twists and great characters.  I would recommend to anyone who enjoy a young romance with dark past.
B0071FBARY|3.0|Album cover suggests a faster pace.  Not much variety from song to song.  Isaac Slade doesn't show the expected range in his voice/singing.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This show is by far the best show I have seen in years!<br />I love the style, intrigue and beauty.
B000066C6F|5.0|It is one of the worst movies ever made and it is all the better for it.  Jann Wenner's cameo must be seen to be believed.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|No issues so far, easy to handle and perfect for gaming!<br />The reason its cheap comes from the fact that its wired but the speed is unprecedented! I'm a wireless type of gamer but this definitely changed that. Gold USB tip for less noise is a good addition but never really had a reason to have it nor does it make much of a difference.
0393327655|5.0|If we value the marketplace of ideas, this is a book that should not be ignored - although I would ignore the 1 star reviews here because they all misconstrue, misrepresent or complete misunderstand the arguments Mr. Harris is making. That is not to say all his arguments are sound. I personally do not find his arguments regarding abortion very convincing. His likening early term abortion to scratching one's nose in terms of moral equivalency is a dubious analogy; one which he can only clumsily link by way of modern genetic technology.<br /><br />But all in all I find Mr. Harris to be a deep and nuanced thinker, despite the fact that he sometimes displays a tendency to over-simplify and make sweeping generalizations. He's actually better in debate formats where he is forced to unpack his more provocative statements and can clarify the subtleties of his arguments.<br /><br />And he might be unique among atheist intellectuals in his understanding and appreciation of religious experience; at least those of the more universal variety often classed under the heading of \\"mystical.\\" He takes these experiences seriously and engages with them fully. Of course being a scientist, his primary conclusion is that these experiences don't mean what people (who have them) usually think they mean - they do not confirm any doctrine, dogma or metaphysics. They are purely subjective and can say nothing about objective reality.<br /><br />If you think 9/11 was a \\"crossing the Rubicon\\" moment for global society in terms of our tolerance for, and ability to survive, dangerous religious beliefs masquerading as certainty, this is an excellent place to start to understand what might be the most important global conversation for decades to come.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|It's a good mouse, the only complaint is that the mouse is somewhat hard to hang on to.  Your hand tends to slip off some.
B005IQ39AY|3.0|The instructions leave a little bit to be desired.  When you fail a level, you can't restart a new game without exiting the program and starting all over.  It's just an okay game.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love all the critters and the different things you can build.  It is all time consuming and so much fun!
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Movie was really good and relatively clean minus some creepy looking creatures. The movie went by quickly despite it being an almost 3 hour movie.
B000ID1J5E|5.0|This movie needs to be seen first for the story and suspense and then a second time just for the marvelous scenery!
B007FSF1FE|5.0|Sounds new and fresh and funky.<br />Good production by Dan Auerbach.<br />Recommended to fans of Dr.John and Black Keys.<br />Brilliant :-)
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|What a delightful movie.  I rolled my eyes when it was suggested but once into it laughed and cried and went out to buy it!
B002BI6SMI|3.0|I need to ask for a refund soon. I'd recommend this movie. #2 was entertaining. Enjoy and eat fruit instead of popcorn. Haha
B0020PJJHS|3.0|It was Ok.  Plot was not all that great and the editing I thought was uneven.  Action scenes were predictable and definitely not Pierce Brosnan's best.  Still, the music is so James Bond and great.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think that this game is enjoying to play. Its preety easy if could understand why I think so.I recommend. this game to all ages.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|After watching the original I borrowed a friend's non blu-ray copy.  Huge difference.  Get the blu-ray and settle in for some wonderful oldies.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|very brititsh and great - can hardly wait for the next season - it is fast going and keeps one wondering what t
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I tend to enjoy Disney/Pixar films, and although this wasn't a collaboration of the two it doesn't really , it's still funny and lovable. Video gamers will enjoy all the tiny references to the more popular titles, and it's a blast to watch out for them (some surprise ones here and there). Story wise I liked it, it was very unique. 5 stars for me!
B007VUA7VO|3.0|OK, I have this app installed on my Kindle Fire and I've not had any problems at all. I haven't found any overheating at all. Battery life seems decent, though honestly I installed the app shortly after getting the Kindle, so I don't have much to compare too. I have left it idle for over 24 hours, and have come back to 95% charge left.<br />I'm just thinking out loud here when I say,\\"What's the advantage in having this app?\\" I  can do pretty much all I want to do with stock software on my Kindle,why do I need more programs taking up space? Well, it does look cool, and it has talking alarms. Again,cool.
B0074VA2T2|2.0|I saw this app and got it without hesitating. We read this book all the time with our kids and I thought it might be a fun game for them.<br /><br />here is my pro's and Con's list<br />Pro:<br />- Its based on the Hungry Caterpillar, and features art from the book!<br /><br />Con:<br />- The Caterpillar doesn't do ANYTHING!!! He doesn't eat, he doesn't grow and you can forget about him turning into a butterfly!<br />- Very repetitive.<br />- No animation<br />- no positive feedback, you kid can't win at this and you can't either. there is no feedback or reward for correctly answering the questions.<br />- your kid needs to hit done to &#34;eat&#34; the food, but there is no instructions for this, so they just tap all the food and when you hit done for them you hear &#34;try again&#34; and get to repeat this all over again.<br /><br />Summary:<br />This app is poorly designed and doesn't really know what demographic it is made for. It is either too tough for little kids or to lame for older kids. It need more feedback and animations. Really seems a shame to let such a cute IP wallow in app mediocrity.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I enjoy looking at others ideas. :)<br />This is a nice site for ideas for just about anything..... birthday, gift making, organizational skills, decorating.... and the list goes on.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|It's fun. I wanted quite a bit of time on it. Now ten more words to write to finish this review
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was amazing. I loved it. This is Jeff Kinney's greatest book of the series. It was just absolutely awesome.
B008XX6J4C|3.0|Cleaver and inventive.  Entertaining too.<br /><br />So why did I give it a 3 of 5 stars?  If I wanted a MP3 recording, I would have bought a MP3 not a CD.  The audio quality is muffled and dull for a CD.  No sparkle to the sound.  If this recording is ever re-released in real CD quality, I might (but not for sure) buy the CD again.
B000F6IOC0|5.0|This movie was awesome! Kate Beckinsale was a great choice for Selene. The whole series is good! I can't wait till they make a new one because they keep getting better and better.
B00AFEY354|5.0|The movie had the same feel as the book.  It felt more powerful in the theater, but what movie doesn't?  Love it.  The disc itself was flawless as was the packaging.  Shipped pretty quickly.
B00BGICGJ8|5.0|My two daughters and I saw this movie in the theatre.  It was so very true to real life and that is probably what made it so funny!  A &#34;must see&#34; movie!!!<br /><br />Those much younger (maybe in 20's?) probably wouldn't think it as funny, but still good comedy.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I'm still absolutely addicted to this series!<br />From the characters to the settings, you can't help but be addicted to the Abbey!<br />I couldn't stop watching!  Can't wait for Season 3!
B009MO5960|4.0|This movie was as expected. The whole series has been interesting to say the least. Still like the original much more than any since. Worth watching only if you truly like Resident Evil series. Otherwise forget it!
B00006RAKP|5.0|Love this set.  Going to see Elton John in concert in couple of weeks and could only find a few of my EJ CD's and none of the really great ones.  Ordered this to refresh my memory of how much I love his music and it didn't disappoint at all.  Brought back great memories and I'm still amazed at how many awesome songs he has.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Its an alarm clock, what more is there to say.  It has minimal rings to choose from but they all work just fine.  Make sure your device is charged and this will work
B000001DQI|5.0|This has to be one of the best CD's ever.  Going to see him in concert in a few weeks and Amazone delivered this set at a great price and very quick delivery.  Couldn't be happier to have this one to listen to prior to seeing him in concert for the 8th time.  Owned this set before but couldn't locate so I knew Amazone would get one to me quickly and in perfect condition.
B00514HDNW|4.0|I really did enjoy this read.  It is a page turner with shades of horror and mystery.  I loved it.
B00BHU9DUK|4.0|A very good movie that our society should learn from.  Keira Knightley was stunning as Anna. Well done!  My one complaint is the stage rather than real settings.  I see the artistry behind it.  However, I would have preferred a more realistic interpretation.  In summary, I am glad I saw the movie.  It beautifully showed how an affair can ruin a person's soul.  Demons took over poor Anna.  I wish she would have chosen Alexander when he gave her a second chance.
B000002JSJ|5.0|This was the last Led Zeppelin CD that my good friend lacked in his collection. He just happened to mention it in a conversation when we were comparing concerts we had loved throughout the years. I was ordering another CD for myself, and happened to remember this title, and ordered it for him. It arrived very quickly and I was able to give it to him today. I talked to him tonight, and he said he was loving listening to his two new CD's that completed his set. He said he was enjoying them both; I have no personal knowledge of either, but my friend is very happy to have them!
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|Having been a diehard fan for 42 years, I was overjoyed that a new single came out in January. Initially, it sounded like the new album would be a \\"4 Quartets\\" kind of affair, but to everyone's surprise, the man has still not \\"rocked\\" his roll.  You will find traces of all his 50 years of his music in this distinctive set of songs (and startling cover) which notably lacks any cover songs.  Even more interesting are how many of these reviewers love him for so many different albums, what they compare this one to, and how many different songs are the best on this album.  He always promised he would never be boring and this is anything but.<br /><br />Those rockers who have not kept up with this most fascinating artist will not be ready for the gruesome content of most of the songs, but he has always been \\"disturbing\\", \\"hysterical\\" and \\"elliptical\\".  Take your pick, it's all Bowie. Big airplay should follow \\"Set the world on Fire\\" and \\"The Stars\\" and \\"The Next Day\\", while late dj Alison Steele would pick up on melancholy \\"Where are we now\\" and the very catchy \\"Valentine's Day\\".  The highlights for me are the two closers: \\"Feel so Lonely\\" sounds like it was written for \\"Son of Sam\\" or Lennon's murderer Chapman, with its tremendous though dying for it to be even longer finale, and the astonishing \\"Heat\\" which encapsulates an Eno-like landscape to intense lyrics about a child abusing parent and is probably the most haunting tune on the album.<br /><br />The bonus tracks are okay, but taking lyrics from Stephen Sondheim's West Side Story (\\"Hold my hand and I'll take you there\\") doesn't quite speak of originality.<br /><br />My only real comment, despite its length, is that I'd love most of the songs to be just a little longer.  I can't wait for the extended versions to start populating the atmosphere and depleting my bank account.  Remember, it's art, it's music, but it's still business.  So cry about a $147 cover art tee shirt, but if you don't want it, don't buy it, or make your own.  I held back when the ($800, now $3000) Sukita book was floating around, but Bowie Style and Moonage Daydream were about my limit.  And no, I won't be buying the Japanese cd for one bonus track, that will probably come out on a b-side somewhere.  Of course, if there is a tour, ...........................
B000002JSP|5.0|One of my best friends and I were comparing concerts that we had attended in our lifetimes. He had told me that seeing Led Zeppelin in '69 was the best he had ever seen (before my time), So I had found him a book that he was really happy with for Christmas. After going through it, I had remembered the 2 CD's he said that he lacked to complete his collection of CD's. I happened to remember both, and ordered them for him. They got here very quickly, and I was able to give them to him today. He said he was thrilled, and I talked to him later, and he said he was really enjoying listening to them. I went ahead and gave this a 5, but I don't have any personal knowledge of how this sounds. I just know it made my friend very happy!
0307352145|5.0|So far so good! Haven't finished yet but very interesting. Having watched the TED video I was worried it wasn't going to offer anything new, but it certainly does!
0783225903|1.0|I love science fiction but this one is just a pinball machine of random, incoherent nonsense.  It has created some kind of goofy lockstep among reviewers who seem to flock together at times to declare something as hip or cool when there is no discernable story, no interesting characters, and not a single believable scene.  Some people thought it was funny but I see nothing funny about two people pulling on a singe desk through a wall, or a spiderman like plumber who swings around the city on ropes.  It seems like a junior high level cartoon to me.  Kind of like Donkey Kong meets Peter Parker.  It seems to me that even if one is satirizing a dystopian world that there must be some rational sense of how we got from here to there.  In my view 12 monkeys gets that last part right, but Brazil failed miserably. The only plus I can see is that if you are a film maker, you might be able to draw from some of the imagery to create a compelling landscape that actually conveys real human feelings and emotions.  Sort of like Gilliam did when he appropriated Lebbeus Wood's illustration.  Merely an idea for a set or mood that really has some rational context.  Although not a great movie overall, &#34;Joe vs. the Volcano&#34; has chilling scenes of Joe's bleak life that are obviously derivative of &#34;Brazil&#34; but actually try to do so while telling a story.
B000SEGQNS|5.0|Great for newbies in web development. Lots of tips and little gems about how to make sure the way you develop a website doesn't make users think more than they are willing to
B007B6VOG0|5.0|This is just a fun album to listen to, no pun intended.  There is a good mix of upbeat songs and slow songs.

B003JTHXOK|4.0|A bit predictable at first, and maybe a little trite  but it did improve.. and overall I did like the book and the ending... especially..
B0030U1TW0|3.0|I used to listed to this album a lot &#34;back in the day&#34; and I still love it.  For the most part, the digital version from AutoRIP were fine, but a couple songs had pops and skips almost like they were recorded from vinyl.  I will wait and see if the CD has the same artifacts.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|A great story, with amazing depth, and so beautifully written I was sorry that the book ended, I was enjoying the read so much!
B0030U1U6A|5.0|I have loved Gentle Giant for many years but its been a long time since I have heard them since my entire collection was on dusty vinyl that I haven't played in decades.  This is one of their best and the sound quality of the digital download was superb.  Now that I am reviving my old favorites in digital form, this one will take a prominent place in my digital collection.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|It doesn't work well on the Kindle - it won't let me draw in response to a round. I have to play it on my i-phone.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love this app and its free. The animals are so adorable!!! You also get to take care of your animals by feeding them, cleaning them, and playing bouncy ball with them. You can also buy fun houses for your pets to play in. Also, you can choose your location for where you want your pets to live. I definitely recommend this for kids 13 and younger.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Absolutely a great read!  The scary truth in the book had me laughing and crying--and I was sad when it ended.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to see what life was like...
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Very interesting I have not read many of his books but will read more. This was very intriguing a must read

1401900526|5.0|I love the beauty and encouraging statements in these cards. They were shipped to me SO quickly, still in the plastic wrapping. I got 2 great deals: Amazing words of encouragement and love; and Without any hassels, delays, damage, or issues!! I recommed these cards to everyone - whether you believe you are struggling or not; having some source of encouragement, love, satisfaction, and gratitude can truly change anyone's life - and always for the better!
B0075MFS9Y|4.0|Comparing to that this one is selling like hell, I thought it be more priginal and the power of rock would be pounding out of the disc<br />I have to listen  more, to see if I can dig it more
B006LSZECO|1.0|The first half was depressing, and the second half was totally ridiculous. The only redeeming thing about this book is that it really makes you appreciate a good story.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My granddaughters love this and play it on my Kindle a lot.  It's great fun for anyone who likes video games.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I picked up this series on the Kindle App because they were on sale for $5.00. (I know right??  Crazy cheap!). I had seen the movie, and was really curious about how the rest of the story went, so I bit.<br />Without giving up much in the way of spoilers, I must say that the first movie followed the first book rather closely.  Sure, there were some changes, but for the most part, it was pretty true to the book.  That being said... if they pull off the second movie as well, it's going to be a huge hit.  The second book, to me, had a whole lot going for it (even more so than the first!), and the way it ended.. you just immediately open up book 3.<br />Book 3 was LONG.  Way long.  Some parts are tedious, and are dealing with everyone's emotional state.  Sometimes, it gets downright boring (think the way some Stephen King books kinda drag on).  But, by the end, you're just left in a state of &#34;Holy Crap!&#34;. I sort of wonder if they can even make the third one into a movie that's true to the book, because there is some disturbing stuff during the War.  They may have to tiptoe around a lot of it, like they have had to do with the Walking Dead conversion to tv (believe me, the graphic novel is much more graphic).  It'll still be great, but not the full immersion into &#34;Did they really just do that?&#34; that the book gives you.<br />Anyway, I highly recommend this book series if you can scoop them up like I did.  I actually read these on my cell phone, and shared with my husband's smart phone so he could read them too at the same time.  I love how the Kindle app can be used in multiple ways and on multiple devices. But that's not the point.  The point is... you may not be the only one reading this series.  it's that awesome.  I kind of wish it just kept going, but it had to end, and the ending was good enough.  I wish I could say more, but I don't want to spoil the fun.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Great!  Wow!  Love it!  The best musical ever! And the price was fantastic! I would recommend it to everyone who loves musicals!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Hooked and enjoying each episode as it comes out.  Read for a great season finale this weekend.  Video on demand works a lot better in the states than overseas.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|really love it this game is  very challanging as you get higher up in levels it adds more colors and does not allow you to cross over
B00BPLDCVM|5.0|My brother has been telling me for a few years to watch this.  While in Afghanistan, had a chance to watch the first two seasons and part of the third.  Totally hooked, started buying each episode right after aired in the US.  Now I'm back in the states, ready to watch the season finale this weekend!
B0012GTZC0|5.0|And Follett's female characters are always strong women. I can't wait to read Winter of the World having also finished Fall of Giants.
B00AHTYI5M|3.0|People have raved about this movie but to me it just wasn't my thing. I'll probably watch it again to see if I like it more but I doubt it.
B0078ZTWP4|4.0|just got it in.  bright enough to be very useful which I expected at 300lm.  love how small it is and seems to be very well built.  Price is great.  I will get another one.
B00AAQHP66|5.0|This movie was a total surprise to me. I was figuring a bunch of beach boys fooling around at the beach. The movie was based on a factual person and it was great. I loved Gerard Butler and the kid was phenomenal. Great movie. Highly recommended.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is an Awesome movie, I think this should be shown at every church and communities, It is so touching and makes you think how society is. God gives us choices and these men made the right one. I more then just Love it!!!!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I loved the stage show. This movie version is very good. Russell Crowe, as usual, is outstanding. I enjoyed the movie almost as much as the stage version. Well worth seeing. The music is wonderful.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|This is a great show. Love the characters, sets,costuming, and acting ,also! So much can be said about it! Enjoyable!
B00947N6D8|4.0|At first I was skeptical but then, as I got into the story line, I really enjoyed the movie. The animation was good and it ended well. I like movies that have a good ending.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Great movie. Clint Eastwood could not have been any better. Story was great and even Justin did a great job acting ! Loved it!
B007REV4T8|4.0|Daniel Craig does it again. He is a fascinating James Bond because he is so masculine in the role. He runs, jumps and fights his way through every James Bond movie. Love him, loved the movie. Very upset about Judi Dench. Can't imagine a James Bond movie without her.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I love these earphones. They fit nicely and I have never liked the ear buds for my active life. Wear these to hear my praise music when I clean our barn.
B001BANK32|4.0|I recently visited estes park and the Stanley hotel that inspired Stephen king to write this book.  I had seen the movie, but was told the book was better.  It was.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|i loved this book and was disappointed when it was over. then i found the four books that explain why it all happened. im in heaven again. i just started 1st shift.
0765316994|4.0|This is a good 3.5 star book for me, but I'm going to round up to off-set some of the scathing reviews that almost -- almost! -- put me off what turned out to be a really enjoyable sci-fi romp for this Trek fan.<br /><br />If you're looking for the next heavy, serious, hard science fiction work, this isn't it. But if you can step outside that corner of the genre for a day or two and not take things quite so seriously, you'll probably find yourself enjoying &#34;Redshirts&#34; a great deal.<br /><br />&#34;Redshirts&#34; (yes, the title does indeed refer to those unfortunate ensigns-in-red who invariably met with untimely demises on nearly every Star Trek away mission) raised enough interesting metaphysical questions to make me say, &#34;Hmm...&#34; while keeping a very fast and fun pace. Think &#34;Galaxy Quest,&#34; with a little more philosophy; the laughs are there, but some serious thought went into making this plot work. And make no mistake, it does work!<br /><br />The characters were engaging, the dialogue was witty, and like any good (or bad) sci-fi show, there was lots of action. The ending was wholly and surprisingly satisfying, as well as unexpected. In all, it was a very enjoyable read, perfect for light weekend or summer reading for those of us who prefer sci-fi over chick lit.
B004AQR24W|3.0|This is not a great movie, but it is entertaining. I would rent it on a rainy day, but not a Friday night movie.
B0023S50DO|4.0|This is not a breaking technical or acting barriers... It's entertainment for those who like to watch end-of-the- world destruction movies. And yes, it's one of my watch every couple of years movies!
B00574PQDU|5.0|This movie was awesome. We saw this movie at the show and when it came out we rented it again.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is fun and easy to use. I find it pretty easy to navigate using it. I love pinteresting on my Kindle!
B008133MDK|5.0|Mar. 29 2013<br /><br />This is one of the most intelligently written TV drama series that I've had the pleasure to have viewed.  Every element of every episode was well acted and well paced. The character development was extraordinary.<br /><br />After watching Season 2 I downloaded the original works and have begun reading them. Perhaps that is the greatest compliment I can bestow on this production.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I have seen Seasons 1 and 2 of Downton Abbey.  So looking forward to watching Season 3.  This is an incredible series.
B000I9YWZ2|5.0|i would buy this again and again.<br />i miss these music actors and the quality..<br />a must buy!! even if full price. :)
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|it works perfectly on kindle fire no bugs and loads at a good pace as well.<br /><br />tip: don't spend your gems on 30second things in the tutorial - the gems are hard to get.
B002JVWR4U|5.0|love this show, sucks that they cancelled it..<br />anything more for joss whedon<br />Maybe there might be another tv show he will make soon..
B00992CF6W|1.0|I love how th chicken taste so good and the porchops. Trees are nice to stare at while killing animals
B003E8P9G0|4.0|i liked it becase it has advecher and mystery, and it's by the same author who wrote percy jackson and the olmpans
B006LSZECO|5.0|I have never written a review for a book, but felt compelled to do so after reading this one.  Wow...what a great book.<br /><br />Update...discovered that's have actually once before submitted a review, but I had forgotten since it was a terrible book and a bad review :).  I am an avid reader, so I guess I am only speaking up when I am amazingly impressed (no pun to amazing Amy) or thoroughly disappointed.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|this book is a fun filled book. it's the run off story of precy jackson and the oylmpans IT WAS AWESOME!!!
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Great quality bought it for a bbt fan i thought i liked this sseason a lot comes with 4 discs for time consuming watching and got me off my ass to do science

B009FZHYKU|5.0|Addicted... non stop twist and turns.. and zombies attacks. The acting is great, special effects are amazing, it's a thrilling ride.
B0067TQQI8|4.0|One of the problems I had was that when I was going to be traveling I always tried to keep my phone plugged in until the last possible moment.  That meant sometimes i missed calls and messages since i wasn't  were my phone was. And even doing this, i'd still end up getting somewhere and having a dead battery.  And there's nothing worse than trying to call someone with a dead phone.<br /><br />With this battery pack, the problem is solved.  I don't have to leave my phone charging and when I get where I am going its ready to go.  One charge gives me multiple charges on my phone and a single fulll charge on my tablet.<br /><br />It's a bit bigger than I expected but it still fits easily in my accessories bag.  It doesn't power/charge the device while its charging but that's never been a problem really.  It comes with some charging cables and although it provides various tips (not lightning) . I find it easier to just use the ones I have.<br /><br />I am happy so far.
B00BESCJII|1.0|What a complete waste of time and money. Even my teenagers hated this one. I would rather pay $30 to be locked in a bathroom with someone projectile vomiting!!! There should be a minus star catagory for movies this awful.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I loved the book! So sexy and so passionate yet kinky. It's a wonderful book! I'm very intrigued by the ending and can't wait to read the second book!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I enjoyed this very much. Fun with just enough sci-fi. Fun for anyone who needs something light to watch. Try it and see.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I love this game. My 11-year old daughter makes fun of me for playing  it. It beats using real coins.
B009S6ZKSO|5.0|My wife Loves this....great Bday present for her, having the DVD video's to go along with is pretty cool and I know she enjoys that.
B000Y7U98W|4.0|Great story with a well done storyline.  It kept me glued the entire time.  Danny Boyle films are pretty much always great though.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book was recommended to me by someone who always recommends good books and this was one I loved.<br />It is a difficult subject but a story so beautifully told with wonderful characters that it is worthwhile reading.
B004TBWFAO|5.0|I have read a number of Virginia Woolf's books (many years ago), but never read To the Lighthouse.  One of the members of my book group suggested that we read it, and most of us were delighted that she did.  This is not a book for everyone, but it is beautiful, poetic, and insightful of the mindset and mores of the Victorian Age.  It is a slow-moving reverie, certainly not a galloping along story with a compelling  plot, but it drew me in and kept me engaged with the characterization.  So from my point of view it is a gem.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I discovered this series 2 years after its premature end.  I've rewatched the series at least once every 1-2 years since.  I love the rich universe Joss Whedon's created with Firefly.
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|I wasn't able to down load it on my cell phone. I need to up date my amazon apps. But the reviews were not very good so I 'm consider if I want to do it.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|It said it would be here on a Friday and it got here a day early! I only had to wait two days for it to arrive instead of three (and thats with standard shipping!) The cardboard slip cover wasnt bent or anything which was a plesant surprise. I cant wait to watch my movie! Good job, Amazon!

0783225547|5.0|I teach high school science and show this to my kids each semester. They love it even though it is several years old.  It also uses accurate geologic vocabulary!
B005IQZB14|5.0|I know a lot of people are thinking I'm not reading an Oprah book...well I was one of those.  After month of a cousin telling me to read the book I finally did, and let me tell you I am so happy I did.  Cheryl's story is inspiring, emotional, and in the end uplifting.  The was Cheryl writes is amazing its as if you are experiencing everything she experienced during this hard time in her life.  READ THIS BOOK!!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|One of Nicholas Sparks best books. 100 times better than the movie!  Great plot! I never would have cast those actors as the characters! All women will love this! And its not a sad sappy romance!
B002ZBZFNY|2.0|Was not pleased with the poor story, seemed only to be a platform for some sex shots, the sci-fi just didn't carry the story enough to maintain interest.
B000FC1JCQ|5.0|I have been reading this book for a few weeks, it is a lengthy one.  I have enjoyed the story, the twists and turns, the characters.  I have wanted to read it for years.  It is enjoyable.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|awesome fun game interesting and keeps me entertained if you like horses you will love this game and I have had no problems with it
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|I was advised to watch the movie first.  As usual I am glad I read the book first.  Very entertaining and imaginative but frequently departs from the book.  It was a good read but not a great read.
B00AJLHUWQ|5.0|I've been following this group from Poland for a few years now. Long gone are the days of hell metal or whatever that genre is. Really, how many songs can you sing pretending you are the devil? So anyway, these guys keep getting better. Now that Steven Wilson has moved into the stratosphere, Riverside provides that much needed hard edge with a class that Porcupine Tree used to provide. Not that they sound alike, no; Riverside is it's own. What a record! Best album of the year so far !!!
B004P4O87I|4.0|My son loves it. He wanted Comander Cody and this was the only kid with him in it. I just wish Lego would stop the the decline in value: higher prices but less legos all the time...
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|This is a beautiful, sometimes funny, story about life, and overcoming difficult (impossible) circumstances. The cinematography is wonderful. It is also a story about the power of faith, or more accurately faiths (hindu, catholic, muslim), and how this man survived because of it. Several times in Pi's life he was dealt a loosing hand, yet he was able to survive and thrive.<br /><br />This is a very good, feel-good movie.
B000HL0EEE|5.0|Like all of the Star trek genre, this Enterprise series really hits on social issues of today.  Watching all four seasons gives a great perspective along these lines of thought.  Series 1 sets the stage for series 2, 3, and 4.
B009UAO1ZG|4.0|As my one history professor said, \\"there's nothing new under the sun.\\"  In Lynne Olson's excellent book one can see the same thing today, two groups in vituperative disagreement over an issue and demonizing each other.  The best and the worst of American society are detailed in this account of the long battle between isolationists and interventionists prior to the Second World War.  On one side was Charles Lindbergh, man who should have stuck to aviation because he was clueless about anything else and on the other side FDR, who having won a third term, and with the people beginning to gravitate his way, seemed to go into a funk and withdraw from making the commitment to England that people finally seemed to agree was justified. As you read this narrative you can see the ancestors of today's rightists and leftists battling each other in noble and ignoble ways.  But, as Olson points out, this was democracy in action and the prolonged debate in the end got the US to where it had to be.  An interesting book.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|It has great character development and the acting is superb. It has a perfect balance of humor and drama. I find it very family friendly.
B001MTENOC|5.0|Nice, comforting book on what happens beyond this rhelm of life.  It gave me peace of mind and took away some of the fear of what happens when we die.  I can't wait to read his next book.
B00908DDZM|5.0|Loved it, great artist, would recommend this to anyone that enjoys music. Is not just all foul language, good buy
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best series I have ever seen!  Every episode we, at the end, stare at each other with our mouth open. Can't wait till next season!
B00AF6MF9I|2.0|I was  looking for a game where I could pass some time with some fun combat.  Unfortunately you can't advance anywhere without spending money.
B008LFY6NI|5.0|very fun game!!! anyone could play it kids, adults, or even teenagers!!! There are different shapes u can pick from so u don'e have to always have to have a circle!!!!:):):):):P:P:P:P:0:0:0:0:0
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|I've always liked Sy-Fi.<br />Most of the episodes are interesting and filled with action. I watched all of the episodes right up to the very end. Including Atlantis. I think you really have to have a GREAT IMAGINATION to right for theses kinds of programs. And the script writers did a wonderful job. At some point, there WILL BE A REVIVAL. Just like there was with Star Trek.
0316019984|5.0|Nicely made book. The pop outs are intricate and impressive. It's sure to be a hit with any kid into superheroes!!!
B00BSBT8M6|2.0|bad video quality on streaming. acting was good, but some part of the movie scene looks fake. like the music.
B0050R0XEG|5.0|This was a gift for my boyfriend. He loves legos and is saving for a VW Van. Now that it's built he uses it for inspiration to get through the work day, knowing that he will have a life-size one soon!!
B004132I20|5.0|This movie is enjoyed by all the adults in our family. One of our sons introduced it to us, now everyone wants to see it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome! I recommand it to audults terns kids and babies!!!! I love this game and you will too!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Awesome keyboard... and it's the best Arabic keyboard I've ever tried..<br />It gives you multiple typing options..<br />Used it on Samsung Nexus S and LG Nexus 4.
030758836X|4.0|Wow. I mean, WOW! What a book! A person must be truly brilliant to come up with a plot like this. It's that great, it really is. It grabs you right from the start with catchy opening sentences and keeps going this way to the very end. Contrary to some opinions I encountered that the book had a pretty slow-paced first half (to be made up for by the roller coaster of a second half), I personally found this book to be thoroughly compelling throughout. And it reads like it was written to be filmed, I can easily see this book turned into a very successful movie.<br /><br />I'm not going to give any detail about the plot itself, because everything is so interconnected that there's no way I can reveal a little without revealing too much and totally ruining this book for other readers. So I'm only going to say that, come to think about it, it's quite sick in the message that it conveys. It represents such a twisted and unhealthy vision of marriage that, in a normal world, it would totally extricate the desire for commitment from people. But we don't live in a normal world, and I know there are a lot of crappy marriages out there... So we get to have this story, and it's so well written that you actually stop minding all the despicable things it talks about. The things spouses (in this book, Amy and Nick) would do to each other, the amount of information they'd withhold from each other, the ends a person is willing to go to out of unhappiness...<br /><br />About the characters. At first I found both Amy and Nick to be pretty cool. Fun, interesting, sweet. I liked them both, in a different way--in the beginning. But then there's this thing: you don't get the whole picture in the beginning. The author is feeding us one little bite of information at a time, and somewhere along the book I already was pretty much hating both with the same energy that I loved them in the beginning. The first part of the book took its time to introduce and somewhat develop the characters, and perhaps for that reason some readers found those first chapters to be rather slow. I personally found them quite entertaining, I was constantly wondering and replaying possible scenarios in my mind. But by the middle of the book, once the readers are already served the full pile of nastiness, you no longer wonder: you know. The outcome was still anything but clear, and it remained this way until the very last page, but you no longer get to like the characters, they have grown that unpleasant. By that time, however, the action is moving on so quickly, that one would hardly focus on the characters; it took some will power for me not to skim through pages just so I could reach the end and finally figure out what would happen. Flynn really does know how to keep her audience intrigued.<br /><br />What disappointed me in this book was the ending. I was going to rate it 5 stars, I really was. But the ending the author chose came so unexpected, it went against all my personal ideas justice in fiction :)I was left wondering if the author perhaps had several different versions of that ending and only chose this one spontaneously at the end. I don't know. But I did feel Gillian Flynn kept her \\"finale\\" options open. Throughout the narrative, she left little venues here and there, little stories she spent suspiciously good amount of time on, so I was kind of expecting them to turn up towards the end to assist the novel's \\"grand finale\\". They didn't, and I felt a little cheated by my expectations. I was, really was, hoping for some sort of a happy ending, if such was even possible with such a plot. So, my personal craving for justice wasn't satisfied. Or maybe--just maybe--there might be a sequel? It certainly leaves you wondering.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is one of my top five I knew it was just like temple run but the creater add something different and it is good
B00628RVV0|5.0|This movie about two children can teach us a bit about the basic nature of humans when they are faced with the simplest of problems. These boys found a way to avoid the ugliness of their surroundings by just being kids. We can use the lessons in this movie for other problems in our lives. The world we create for our children will determine how they learn and grow.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I had never read this classic novel before and love it. After seeing the musical years ago and now the recent movie I had to read the book. I was not disappointed. Will definitely read again.

B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This was a very great movie to watch for the entire family. We all wattched it and loved the relationship with Pi and the tiger.
B000I174QO|5.0|See it, every time I try to explain this to someone I've ended up just having to show them. True with a lot of kusturicas films
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This app is really fun! However,  it feels a lot like temple run. whether that's a ggopd thing or a bad thing is up to.interpertation. Also,  there aren't a lot of likeable characters in my opinion. Some are weird,  some are over priced,  and some are both!  Also,  I feel like the daily challenges are repetitive and lack challenge. You have to find the letters that spell a certain word, and I find that very easy. And I find myself finding the same words. Other than that,  this game is really fun and I highly recommend it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is a perfect game for people who love to build.(me) I am very surprised I like this game because I don't like minecraft a lot. but this is a perfect game.
B00280LYIC|5.0|The best book I have ever read. The first time through, I was shocked . Each time it just gets better . The more you read it, the better it is.

B005S9EK5Y|4.0|I think the product is great.  The production was well done and deserving of any awards it got.  I was never in love with the story itself.  It is dark, desperate and sad.  The actress that sings &#34;I Dream the Dream&#34; did an amazing performance.  That was the best part!

B008RV5K5E|5.0|Follows the book beautifully.  Would highly recommend it to anyone that likes the Batman.  It will make one want to see the second one as well.
B002ZG981E|5.0|I wonder why I have to buy this movie?  Reason?  I need to watch it twice to link up all the things together.  Finally understand the movie.  Go get it, Chris Nolan movies are great!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book so many twists and turns you are never really sure what comes next.  Can't wait to start the next book.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|This book is very interesting. It's very different than anything else I've ever read. It's well written and hard to put down. It can be a little hard to follow in the beginning. The concept is a little far fetched, but it's still a very good story.
1476735115|5.0|A futuristic novel that is great and deals with things being hidden to keep people in line. I think that this may be a problem that we have but most people don't know about it<br />Wool Omnibus creates an absorbing dystopian world of oppression and treachery. The inhabitants of this world live underground in a silo, the outside world above ground is hostile and toxic, a world they can only see on video screens. The political climate is almost as poisonous as that outside. Those who voice their unhappiness are sent to cleaning, a death sentence where offenders are sent outside in airtight suits with a limited oxygen supply to clean the sensors which project a view of the outside world onto the video screens on the upper levels. No one sent to clean has ever failed to do so, though no one knows why since nothing is forcing them to, and no one sent to cleaning has ever survived. The population is segregated by occupation, each living on their own levels of the silo. Life inside the silo is governed by a rigid pact which seems to apply to everyone but I.T. I.T. runs by its own rules, allocating supplies, and pulling all the strings behind the scenes.<br /><br />An intrepid few try to unravel the fabric of secrets and lies before they too are put to cleaning, to find out if there is an inhabitable world beyond the hole they are trapped in.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|I loved the setting and Tommy Lee Jones is always great no matter what he plays. I couldn't figure out who did it and i love that about any movie
030726999X|5.0|It seems like a particularly cruel joke that Steig Larsson died shortly after getting a deal to publish his Millennium Trilogy. Would he have continued on with these tales of Salander and journalist Mikeal Blomkvist if he would have lived? Unless the rumors are true about Larsson’s long-time girlfriend having a laptop with a fourth book saved on it stuck in a safety deposit box somewhere as she fights with his family over the cash cow this series has become, we gotta assume that this is the last we’ll see of Larsson’s dynamic duo. And it is a crying shame because Salander has quickly become one of my all-time favorite characters.<br /><br />This one picks up almost immediately after the events of The Girl Who Played With Fire, and I can’t say much about the plot without spoiling that one. (Anyone interested in this series should read them in order if at all possible.) As the title indicates, Salander started an almighty s*** storm in the last book. The anti-social, brilliant, violent, revenge-driven hacker has managed to kick off a constitutional crisis that shocks the Swedish government to the very highest levels and threatens numerous deserving douche bags with exposure of past crimes. Atta girl, Lisbeth!<br /><br />Meanwhile, Blomkvist recruits a number of unlikely allies as he tries to save Lisbeth by publishing her true story as he plays a variety of dangerous cat-and-mouse games with the people trying to shut her up for good. Of course, his biggest headache will be convincing the pain-in-the-ass Salander to cooperate in trying to save herself.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I could barely sit while watching the movie even though I knew how it ended, I was terrified throughout.  The tension was palpable, the acting superb.
B00BIPCXJM|4.0|i didnt know anything about this show but decided to give it a try and it was great. need to finish watching the other episodes.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|Enjoy the plot twists. Darker version of Batman/ Robin Hood. Enjoy seeing different actors and actresses for a change. It's a also a nice change of pace from all the Crime Scene/ police TV shows out there.
B00BT0ZDF2|5.0|I went to see this movie in theaters solely because it was directed by the Wachowskis. I love the Matrix, and trusted them to have made a fun action movie. I left the theater still almost in tears knowing I had just seen one of the most profound and brilliant movies to have been made in the last decade.<br /><br />Critics say that it's confusing. This is true for about the first 40 minutes. The stories aren't told sequentially in chunks, but are spliced into each others. That plus the fact that several of the actors play multiple parts--is a perfect recipe for confusion. However, if you've been trying to pay attention and have any amount of reasonable intelligence, the characters and separate story lines soon become clear and distinct. And in a way, they all end up being the same.<br /><br />This is the brilliance of Cloud Atlas. These stories are radically different--different times, planets, people, plots, and yet they tell the same story. I know the writer's original intention was basically a \\"we are all connected, and our actions affect others,\\" but this wasn't what I really felt. I saw all of the stories as moments of redemption.<br /><br />***Spoiler*** I normally can't stand movies that kill off main characters or have generally depressing endings, and yet this movie needed the moments of sadness to help further the story. And I actually didn't leave sad. If the movie had focused solely on say the couple where one of them commits suicide, I would have felt gypped and would not be raving about this movie at all. And yet, each story while interesting, emotional and sometimes hilarious--is just a part of the whole story. And the whole story taken together just hits you in the gut. It made me laugh, made me cry and made me think.<br /><br />I dislike both Halle Berry and Tom Hanks as actors, and it didn't matter in the slightest. They played their parts to perfection (especially Hanks). The settings and costumes from each time period are also on point. And I was right in that the Wachowskis also delivered a cinematically stunning movie as well. However, unlike the Matrix--where you can get caught up in the action just because it looks so cool, the action and general stylism used here is not just here for the sake of being cool. The stories wouldn't have worked if you were constantly being drawn out of them or distracted. Here, the stylism actually propels the story. It's necessary to keep the stories just slightly outside of the realm of reality. In becoming fantastical looking, the viewer can then simply focus on the story which in turn actually makes the stories more real.<br /><br />There is not a doubt in my mind that all three directors are simply genius. I think it's ridiculous that this movie got such bad press, honestly--I can't help but think that those who didn't enjoy it simply weren't smart enough or more likely didn't bother to engage themselves with the material. This isn't Transformers or even James Bond. Thinking is required to enjoy. But instead of this being tedious, this movie can affect a person in a way that a movie like Red Dawn (just a recent example) never can. This movie deserved the Best Picture Oscar for 2013. It is more than the sum of its parts.right in that the Wachowskis also delivered a cinematically stunning movie as well.

B000GCFG7E|5.0|Jack is up against many difficult problems with very little to go on except his uncanny, almost, 6th sense for deduction.  It was great fun to watch him unravel the different personalitys as he works his way toward a solution.  &#34;The Hard Way.&#34;  Child's genius is in letting the reader look, with him, into Reachers mind and how he draws upon his years as A Military Policeman as well as obvious God given talent for this kind of work.  Not much violence until the end but then It's showtime!  I was in NYC a few years back and stood in &#34;Strawberry Fields&#34;, in Central Park, right across from the &#34;Dakotta.&#34;  It's great to follow Reacher as walks in some of the same places I had been in my two weeks visit to that exciting place.

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Bought the trilogy box set a couple weeks ago when it was on sale, and just finished the series. Overall, a good read, enjoyable even to cynical old men like me. The story is very tight and compelling in the first book, and the broader themes Collins starts exploring in the second continue to drive things along satisfactorily. But the third, Mockingjay...well, unlike most of its critics, I loved the ending. It's the \\"getting there\\" that had some story/flow problems, in my opinion. Part of this was surely by design, as it was depicting the senselessness of war and violence. Still, it seems there should be better ways to show that than the rambling nature of the book's second half. Overall, a good two weeks spent reading, even if I'm a little let down by the third installment.

B00BETX5PS|5.0|but I must say this is not bad at all.<br />Daniel Craig is good even if a very short guy (difficult to give him the 'presence' Connery had). Javier Bardem is a good actor I love him but this shade of blond they gave to his hair 'killed' the poor guy's look.<br />I consider it a good action movie and try to forget it is a 007.

1615470158|5.0|First let me say that I read several technical books a month, and have reviewed them for Manning Publications on several occasions. So I have some pretty high standards that must be met before I give a book five stars.<br />I am teaching myself PowerPivot for work, and have [[ASIN:0735640580 Microsoft® PowerPivot for Excel® 2010: Give Your Data Meaning]] which is very thorough, but this book is more helpful. It focuses most on what I know least about--Data Analysis eXpressions, or DAX. It begins with the assumption that the reader is an Excel power user, or \\"Excel Pro\\" as the author calls us. It therefore gets right into the material related to PowerPivot, without wasting time or space on things everyone who uses Excel professionally already knows.<br />The author's writing style is entertaining, turning what could be a very dry topic into something you want to celebrate along with the writer. I love his side remarks, such as:  \\"You will not see me create another implicit measure in this book. They are dead to me.\\"<br />My only complaint is a formatting one. Much of the text is in a green font that shows as a much lighter gray on the regular Kindle, making it hard to read. Even on the Fire I would have preferred a choice with more contrast.<br />Despite that little annoyance, the book is a fast, enjoyable read with the information presented effectively and in an order that makes perfect sense to an Excel Pro. I am tempted to go ahead and buy a print copy just to have as a reference for my team, it is that good.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|If you like science fiction; something different with some personality to it, then this might be for you.  Every episode is different but there are just enough &#34;strands&#34; connecting the main underlying big picture story to keep it cohesive.  But again, each episode is mostly about a different situation so it's not like, &#34;oh my Lord, I cant WAIT to see the next episode! Whats going to happen next!?&#34;  If you want that kind of science fiction, where you are soooo deeply hooked and you just cant get enough, then watch battle star galactica, the new ones from 2004 and on. (also on amazon prime)  or try Downton Abbey.  Thats a Helluva show.  Anyway, Fringe is interesting enough and entertaining enough to keep you coming back.. This show sort of reminds me of x-files, not the same, but it has many similarities.  It's a good show.  I'm in the middle of season 2 now and I plan on watching all the way through all seasons.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|Word goes around that Depeche Mode have made a great record again. Is it true ??? Answer: YES !!! Delta Machine is perhaps the best album they made in the more than thirty years they have been around.<br /><br />Obviously a lot of electronics on this record, but also bluesy guitars, beautiful vocals by Gahan & Gore, smart lyrics etc.<br /><br />A WARNING: give this record time to sink in. The first time i listened, i was not convinced. You see, it is quite different and more experimental than on earlier albums. But around the fourth time I listened, goose bumps started to appear when i realized this is absolutely brilliant stuff. A real grower.<br /><br />Buy this with confidence and enjoy it like i do. When was the last time you couldn`t stop listening to a really good album ?

1400067820|5.0|Every once in a while a book comes-a-long that provides a new way to see the world as it truly is. Nassim Taleb's \\"Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder\\" is one of these. Taleb highlights how the rationalists have dominated modernity with the fragilizing of the economy, our health, political life, education, and almost everything else...by suppressing randomness, volatility, and stressors. Those trying to suppress these in an attempt to help, end up hurting us the most. (The Soviet-Harvard delusion)<br /><br />Seeking or being `comfortable' is what fragilizes...it distracts and  eliminates the motivation to change and/or to find the root cause of symptoms, which can be the tip of an iceberg. Size and power are means commonly used to create zones of comfort.<br /><br />The consolidation of global financial institutions in the 1990s and early 2000s serves as a good example. As institutions became larger, extending their reach and influence (power), they became more fragile and too big to (let) fail. Financial executives were blind to warning signs and early symptoms that something was awry...until it was too late. Fat, dumb and happy was the rule of the day.<br /><br />Antifragility, on the other hand, \\"determines the boundary between what is living and organic, say the human body, and what is inert, say, a physical object, like the stapler on your desk.\\" Antifragile is about people and organizations not being too big or too powerful to avoid the stressors and shocks that come with natural life. Antifragile systems (and people) deal with vicissitudes of life and don't just survive shocks, they prosper from them. Stressors, randomness, and volatility actually serve an evolutionary purpose by strengthening, instilling resilience, and forcing adaptation to a changing world. \\"What does not kill me makes me stronger.\\"<br /><br />Who is fragile? A man who works in a large company for thirty years or a 30 year veteran taxi driver? Compare these two scenarios - 1)an industry shock strikes, and a large company must respond with workforce reductions; 2) taxi ridership dries, and taxi drivers must find a new source of riders. The taxi driver who has coped with shifting patterns year after year adjusts and moves with ease to another part of the city. The long term employee who loses his job (and with it, his prestige, benefits, and network) is in shock and must learn how to adapt or wither. He has not had the stressors which stimulate evolution, adaptation, and improvement and learns how fragile he was and is. (I see this frequently in the transition ministry I help facilitate. We serve C-level executives, managers, and professionals.)<br /><br />Taleb, a former derivatives trader, is a distinguished professor of risk engineering at New York University's Polytechnic Institute. He is also the author of runaway best seller, \\"The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable\\" and considers \\"Antifragile\\" to be his central work.<br /><br />\\"Antifragile\\" consists of \\"seven books.\\"  Each book deals with the application of a central idea, going either into deeper or into a different territory: evolution, politics, business innovation, scientific discovery, economics, ethics, epistemology, and general philosophy. Each book is a reading experience.<br /><br />* Book 1: The Antifragile - an Introduction (Overcompensation and overeaction)<br />* Book 2: Modernity and the Denial of Antifragility (Tell them I love randomness)<br />* Book 3: Optionality, Technology, and the Intelligence of AntiFragility -A Nonpredictive View of the World (Fragilistas and the harm they do)<br />* Book 4: The Nonlinear and the Nonlinear (Do you think you really know where you are going?)<br />* Book 5: Via Negative (The difference of a large stone and a thousand pebbles<br />* Book 6: The Ethics of Fragility (Subtractive knowledge)<br />* Book 7: Books and a rules section (Skin in the game and the talker's free option)<br /><br />Taleb writes about \\"probability withhis entire soul and his career experience in the risk-taking business.\\" And he writes about his scars (his personal stressors), hence his thought is inseparable from the topic and who he is.<br /><br />This is an outstanding book, one that readers will refer to time and time again. I would give this a six star review if I could as it is the best book I have read in a year. My copy has more notes and highlights than the last ten books combined - which is indicative of the many insights Taleb provides - 7 books worth!<br /><br />Organisms and organic things benefit from shocks; they thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, randomness, disorder, and stressors and love adventure, risk, and uncertainty.his entire soul and his career experience in the risk-taking business.\\" And he writes about his scars (his personal stressors), hence his thought is inseparable from the topic and who he is.<br /><br />This is an outstanding book, one that readers will refer to time and time again.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is completely worthy of the hype! It was amazing and Colleen Hoover has a new major fangirl on her hands (don't worry I won't turn too stalkerish). This is my favorite new adult book of the year and if you haven't checked it out yet, you must read it!<br /><br />When I first started reading it, I couldn't tell where the book was going. It seemed like sort of a cute romance between a sheltered homeschooled girl named Sky and bad boy Holder. There were hints that something more was going on, but I was blindsided over how much heartbreak and healing would take place within the pages.<br /><br />Sky was a likable narrator. Even though she's new to high school, she quickly sees through the BS. She's treated crappy because of an unfounded rep of being skanky, but she doesn't let it get her down. Sky is brave, which is a great trait to have since she'll need this bravery later on when things happen to her that threaten to tear her world apart.<br /><br />Holder is INCREDIBLE. Thank goodness he's a fictional character because my husband would be in trouble otherwise. Sky nails it when she says the one word that she would use to describe Holder is passionate. He's intense, but in a good way since early on it's easy to see how much he cares for Sky.<br /><br />I loved the author's writing style. She took the time to allow the reader to feel Sky's emotions and her conflicting feelings over the way she felt about the people in her life. It felt very true to life. The way we feel about people isn't always black and white and there's still room for love in the midst of hate.<br /><br />The book was far from predictable and there were some twists I didn't see coming. At one point, I was like can things possibly get any worse? And then they did. But all though there's plenty of heartbreak, there's a lot of hope too.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone, but plan to have a few hours free and a box of tissues. The Kindle version is a steal and the book has something crazy like four thousand five star reviews.<br /><br />Rating: 5/5 Stars<br /><br />Thanks to the publisher for a copy of this book for review!hing crazy like four thousand five star reviews.<br /><br />Rating: 5/5 Stars<br /><br />Thanks to the publisher for a copy of this book for review!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Required reading if you read the first two.  Well written and still able to surprise the reader after the first two books.
B003THHIEM|5.0|Not everyone likes Buddy Shows (where a man and a woman are partners, usually with one of them normal and one unusual). But these shows are overall pretty popular, and have been since TV was invented (Adam 12 anyone?). Recently shows like Psych, Bones, Mentalist, Life and Castle have been popular. And this one is the best of the new bunch in my opinion. First, Stana Katic is stunning as Kate Beckett, which helps a lot. And Nathan Fillian is pretty charming in any role. Their sexual tension works, and the writers have done well to milk it without letting it develop - it works for them. Both contribute to the crime solving, they come to trust each other, the rest of the team is useful, and the dialog is crisp. If Buddy Shows is a genre you enjoy, you should love Castle.
B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|We loved this movie. The Acting was superb and the bonus features at the end were a lot of fun.
B00B69UQEO|1.0|Having anxiously awaited Delta Machine, I couldn't be more disappointed having listened to it several times now.<br /><br />Whereas bands like Duran Duran, a-ha and Erasure have had similarly long careers, at least they have remained strong in the quality of music they've continued to make over the years.  Can't say the same for Depeche Mode.<br /><br />This album should have never been released...it doesn't showcase any of the quality of writing or production that they've had in the past.  While there are a few bright spots on the CD, they are very few and far between.  I can't imagine this one will end up in my regular rotation of listening.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This story takes my breath away. I can hardly wait to start the next book. The characters are rich, the descriptions are just enough. I love a story where I feel invested in the lives of the people.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great game!  It's so much fun!  I can play for hours and I'm not a a child.  There are ads but you can skip and get back to your game, which is fine and not so annoying and after the first couple games the ads stop.  Well worth the play.  One of my favorite games to play.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|Kids were inspired to get this after the recent Oz movie. The graphics are pretty cool and it is fun.
B009ZQC7MY|2.0|Season one was good,season two was ok....season three was very tedious<br />Should have stopped at season one<br />Would not recommend to any guy
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season was aewsome. Michonne is my favorite. She is so hard core and actually the smartest in the buck. I just want to know the story behind the pet zomies.
B00A757EFW|4.0|We enjoyed the sample version of pac-man lite, it was really fun! There wasn't a problem navigating the game with the joy stick.overall a fun retro experience!
B002GHHHL0|3.0|I first saw this movie when I was on vacation at the beach and at the time I left the movie hating it but over time I have learned to really like this movie I mean its pretty bad acting and really bad CGI but still something about it I like and about twice a year I go back to it and watch it because it's just alot of fun but I will say this,  if this movie was done right and by that I mean director , actors and budget this movie could have been awesome not Jaws awesome but close. It is surely worth a watch if you've never seen it before.
B00BNWWVFG|4.0|Viewers of this film will either like it or not like it depending mainly on how they relate to Rooney Mara's interpretation and depiction of her character Emily Taylor, a woman who struggles with depression and anxiety after the release of her husband from prison.  I personally found Mara very seductive and sympathetic in her role, and that's why I found this film so compelling to watch even as the plot twists into the absurd.<br /><br />For those who are slightly turned off by Rooney Mara (probably a lot of women) then this is a film that's hard to cling onto.  Channing Tatum is a non-entity in the film, and Jude Law has lost much of his easy looks and charisma.  And if viewers don't like Rooney Mara then they certainly won't like Catherine Zeta-Jones at all.<br /><br />Some viewers may be annoyed by how the film is a superficial ultra-Hollywood film masquerading as a thought piece.  The plot leaves much to be desired, but I personally came away from the film thinking that Rooney Mara will one day become as dominant an actress as Natalie Portman is today.
B005HEPN06|5.0|I miss the good ol' days when you could watch something you were interested in with your kids in the same room.  Good quality picture and no commercials only improve this series since the 80's.
B00B23O96A|1.0|I put this in an empty shopping cart outside a grocery store after one listening. I included the packaging. When someone finds it, I imagine they'll be very excited. Until they listen to it. Mr. Clapton, I don't imagine that you have time to read reviews on Amazon, but if you find this one, may I have a few moments of your time.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|This game is great, there is a Multiplayer mode online, where you fight enemies for artifacts, which give you boosts and things like that. Also, there is a Daily Challenge, which, obviously, changes every day. There is exactly 50 levels, which after you beat every one of them you can go back and fight whichever one you choose. I can't wait to see what glu comes up with next. I'm hoping it will be Samurai vs. Zombies Defense 3!
B00190OHD6|5.0|Wonderful movie! Inspiring ~ thought provoking ~ loving ~ funny ~ caring ~ touching ~ and more! A must see !
B004YXE438|5.0|I love jigsaw puzzles, but Spectrum has taken it to a new level. Fantastic! My hope is that the Spectrum puzzles do not end anytime soon.
B0063IH60K|4.0|The game is great but before each game annoying ads pop up.  I'm not interested in the ads at all!
B00BSW6F26|1.0|My fingers are sore from tapping every inch of my Kindle screen but getting nowhere. Obviously not bright enough (me and the game) for this supposedly short game.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Latest update out there is new version 1.1.5 as of this morning, but here at Amazon we are still on version 1.1.3.  What's the deal.  It has stopped snowing, but I cannot get the new buildings, new clothing, new anything without the most recent updates. enjoy the game, but why do we have to wait so long?<br /><br />Just finished the update 4/12/2013 and now I can't play it at all.  I'm on level 111 and because I want to keep playing, I will have to uninstall and re-install at the very beginning.  This sucks.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The game is fun a great to play when you're bored or when you're waiting for someone or something. All around great game
0345803507|5.0|I bought this for my wife who has read all the Fifty Shades book and she loved it, just as she did the others so needless to say, we are definitely satisfied that this book lived up to the rest of them!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I have always enjoyed Mahjong and this is an enjoyable version to play with many levels. It is even nicer because I didn't have to pay for it
B000000H3W|4.0|Heavy tunes here. I thought the music was the best part. Vocals are just ok IMO. This is the only album I own from them.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I love the retro gameplay and clever design. For this as the free app of the day but easily worth the regular price.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|The book is narrated in the voice of an emotionally troubled teenager.  In many spots, this was reminiscent of &#34;Cather in the Rye&#34;--and I'm guessing this was precisely what the author was aiming for.<br /><br />How much you enjoy this may be dependent on just how tolerant you are of weepy teenage boys.  I'm not terribly interested in teen angst (I'm a couple decades older than the target demo), but I found enough of this book compelling enough to recommend it.  It's not Salinger, but it's worth a read.
B00BI5IXL4|3.0|I think the vocal performances in this movie are its weak link. The scenery is good, the acting is okay, some of the singing is good, but most of it is more what I would call adequate. I think the best performances of the music from Les Miz was the tenth anniversary concert and I tend to judge every other rendition off of that. This comes up far short of that level of performance. I'll watch it again and it's a good movie, but it falls short of what it could have been with better vocal performances.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|It's easy to see why Tom Brokaw dubbed the WWII veterans part of the greatest generation. I enjoy reading what about this time in history that my parents endured. This book was a little heavy on the aircraft explanations for me, but it was still a great read.
B000FA675C|3.0|It makes a nice read and I got it for a good price. I've read this book before and while it's not a bad book, it never really sang to me. Some people love it, some people hate it, to me it's an okay book to pick up and read, but it never really grabbed me the way it does some people.
B00BF124PC|5.0|This movie does an excellent job developing the characters and building to the crescendo while keeping you engrossed and on the edge of your seat.  Very well done. Impressive directing.....surprise ending to the movie though.... some guy named Bin Laden dies in the end. Shocking.  :-)
B004AO4FJ4|5.0|I grew up watching Dr Who on PBS starting with the Tom Baker years. Due to school/work/life I'm only getting around to watching this now. The rebooted series so far has been excellent although I was somewhat sad that we only got one series with this iteration of the Doctor. I would not hesitate to recommend this to jsut about anyone, including people who are not familiar with the older Dr Who. It's a great entry/reentry point.
B008Y1YFNU|5.0|This is Papa Roach's best album since Infest and Lovehatetragedy. I have been a fan since I first saw P-Roach on MTV as a teenager. Infest bred an \\"in your face\\" Papa Roach adolescence, that even they could never reclaim. Lovehatetragedy was a step up into corporate territory. After LHT I lost interest in Papa Roach. Every now and then I would hear a single I would purchase, but I felt P-Roach got drown out in the evolving world of hard rock. The Connection is a come back album for Jacoby and the rest of the band. It brings back the bands roots, and made me realize what I enjoyed from P-Roach in the beginning. If you are a P-Roach fan you will not be disappointed with this album. Its one album that is worth your money! Go see them live. They will not disappoint you!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Finally the truth is told by someone who was there. I downloaded the kindle version and ten purchased the book for my son. I served for 20 years in security forces my son served in the reserve. We know BS when we hear it. THIS IS NO BS! Thank you for your service and bravery.
B004GCPJDQ|5.0|Same money not having to replace batteries every couple of weeks. It charges fast and easy to use. The charging pads are small and convenient.
B007REV4YI|5.0|colmo mis expectativas, complete la coleccion de bond 50 con el ultimo film. Es una gran produccion en sus 50 años...
B007QDNKQA|5.0|Great movie with a very viable conspiracy theory behind our Government.  It's one that remains applicable today, just change the names of the countries.<br /><br />Decent amount of action,  Good plot.
B0041KBWM0|4.0|The story line starts out a little boring and it almost makes you want to stop watching. After a few more episodes, it starts to become a little more interesting. In the end you want to know is this really it?
B008Y6TD5A|5.0|I'm a big Russell Crowe fan and this movie doesnt let you down.  It's like beautiful mind meets the TV series prison break.  A movie with a lot of internal struggle for the lead actor and they couldnt have picked a better actor to play that roll IMO.  The biggest upset in the movie is when Russel Crowe uses a tennis ball to open a car door.  Major fail on that, but the rest of the movie is entertaining and a worthy watch.
B0096HL33G|1.0|I love romantic love stories but this story was terrible in the end she's left so unhappy yet happy. Not one of my favorites by far.
B0070Y46UY|2.0|Sorry but reading the book was like watching paint dry or grass growing. Very repetitive day after day experiences. Just not my type of reading.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|I bought this case based on it's features, and the fact that I liked the one I had bought for my older kindle.  This unit was for my new 8.9 Kindle Fire, and I was hoping the quality would be as good as the previous one.  It actually was better, and more sophisticated than the smaller case!  This is a quality product that allows both horizontal and vertical viewing while securing the case in that position.  The Kindle turns off and on when the case is closed or opened (as advertised).  The stretch strap works well to secure the Kindle in the closed position.  I can't imagine a better case, and therefore gave it five stars!
B00BHMETKC|1.0|This is not a film about Iran or the 1970s or US foreign policy or history. It is a film about Hollywood and like all self-adulation it is nauseating to watch. Every character in the film is a cheap stereotype issuing unbelievably bad lines in a plot that is totally predictable. Ben Affleck can't act and to his credit, in this film, doesn't bother to try. Other actors deliver 'cute' one-liners with all the timing of a T.V. sitcom. The end of the film is a series of \\"cliffhangers\\" of monumental artlessness. The mean airport guards scrutinize passports while the heroes sweat. The mean guards call the heroes into rooms to interrogate them while the plane is on \\"final boarding\\". The mean guards chase the plane down the runway... you get the picture. And in the end, everyone gets away, cries and embraces while the music rises. This is deeply despicable trash. Do NOT see it!
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Great animation of the ponies, and the background story gives a nice framework for why you need to build things in-game.  The money collection routines get a bit tedious as the game progresses, but it's not out of bounds for this sort of game.
B001ANSSDC|1.0|I don't know how this has remained a best seller it is not that well written very expected and boring
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Makes me feel like I actually own a horse the fact that it's free makes it all even better it's a wonderful app every one should download it!
B00439KW2U|5.0|despite what others say, this is my favorite Back to the Future.  Great ending to an awesome series.  Seriously, awesome.
B007N85POS|5.0|I enjoy this game play it every. Day hope can play more of it all the time even when I'm off work
B0091REZMW|3.0|I find this game boring to play alone,  and difficult to add friends. The play self limits quickly. Leveling up is slow.
B0010HOZS0|3.0|The story has a long history and has seen many versions through out the years.  It's not as scary as the 1970's version and lacks the classic b-movie vibe of the original, but what this does have to offer is a fine performance from Nicole Kidman.  She really carries the weight of this movie as she is on screen almost 100% of the film.  Even if the same is true of the first two versions, her star power draws your attention in a way that those other two don't.  The picture on the Blu-ray is pretty stunning with excellent clarity.  You can see dust particles on desk tops and individual strands of hair.  Fine detail and texture on clothing, but a few instances of aliasing and a handful of soft shots.  The sepcial features aren't much to speak of, but one featurette on meaning behind the allegory is pretty interesting.  I might even recommend it as an alternative or companion to watching The Host in theatres.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|I enjoyed the fast shipping and the way the batteries worked like they were suppose to. I was really skeptical after reading some of the previous reviews but I had to find out for myself. I am happy with my curiosity.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love this app. It works so well on my kindle fire. So many fun things to do with it.
B004US4K2C|2.0|To bulky and the app runs slow on my phone and tablet. I switched to GO Launcher HD and it runs better than EX but I only put HD on my Tablet.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this game its probably the best game for the kindle fire. I wonder if they will make a sequel
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|I watched this movie with little memory of this time in history.  Boy was it good.  The blu-ray had additional video of the events as they were presented on tv at the time of the crisis and I was flooded with memory of the events and I enjoyed the commentary provided.  great stuff!
B003405MF6|1.0|the music on this album was so-so. The Dvd of Jeff's performance at Eric Clapton's 2007<br />Crossroads fest will not play on any Dvd player that I have tried to play it in. I have tried at least 20 DVD players.
B00B69UQJY|4.0|First a bit of a background. I started listening to DM in the 90s, so the pre-Violator era isn't as dear to me as it is to some DM fans. I enjoyed all of their 90s records, even though they were all very different. And Delta Machine feels to me like the record that should have followed Ultra instead of Exciter (which was hanging from a rope of mediocrity). I did enjoy a couple of the cuts from Playing the Angel and Sounds of the Universe, but I haven't enjoyed an entire record from Depeche Mode since Ultra. Delta Machine definitely changes that, and I'm surprised to say there really isn't a song I dislike . They are all great tunes, dark but also strangely accessible.<br /><br />Things you need to know about Delta Machine:<br /><br />1) It's varied. Lots of different sounds from blues, through classic DM synthpop, to dustep (yes, really)<br />2) No more pain... I honestly was getting sick of the \\"pain\\" songs. Don't get me wrong there is plenty of angst and dysfunction here. But this really isn't another \\"pain\\" record. If there is any recurring theme it is sexual and spiritual at the same time.<br />3) All of Dave's writing contributions to Delta Machine are wonderful unlike with the previous records where he participated with some not so good songs.<br />4) The blues isn't really as predominant as ads will make you believe. Delta Machine isn't any bluesier than Ultra was for example.<br />5) Don't buy the delux unless you want to listen to some wanky stuff. The added songs are really just messing around with synths, except for the Heaven b-sde which is good.<br /><br />Song by song review:<br /><br />1) Welcome to My World: A brilliant album opener that is what I would call an evolving track (sound and feel changes quite a bit as the song progresses from a minimalistic brooding start to a pulsating electronic anthem). Currently the song I keep replaying the most.<br /><br />2) Angel: A bit bluesier and somehow feels like the most SoFaD-like cut on the record. You could easily play it right along \\"I Feel You\\" and it will seem to flow well.<br /><br />3) Heaven: I will unfortunately have to be one of the minority here that doesn't find Heaven all that exciting. It's a nice song, but that's like saying \\"oh he's a nice guy.\\" It seems a bit uneventful to me. Still enjoy it as an album track but not wow-ed by it or anything.<br /><br />4) Secret to the End: One of Dave's. Secret to the End is definitely a violent song that keeps hammering you until it's done (but in a good way).<br /><br />5) My Little Universe: This is a complete surprise. And sort of dubsteppy. Sounds like something Thom Yorke would write, definitely an unusual sound for the Depeche Mode. But I like it, it's refreshing to see the boys play around with different styles. Overall a very calm song, and somewhat of a pallet cleanser after Secret to the End.<br /><br />6) Slow: Probably the bluesiest cut of the record (and faintly reminiscent of a Viagra commercial...) Definitely a slower and sleazier tune.<br /><br />7) Broken: This is the classic-DM-fans-shut-up-already song. If you don't like Broken, you have never liked classic Depeche Mode. Another one of Dave's. A very strong piece. This one sounds like it could've been on anything released 86-89. So I guess you'd call that a time piece. Love it.<br /><br />8) The Child Inside: Token Martin on the vocals ballad. It's good, it's enjoyable, but it's not one of Martin's best. Come to think of it, he really hasn't done a standout piece since Ultra's Home, Bottom Line, and Surrender (he sang it live instead of Dave, it was amazing). If you liked Damaged People (I did but again not wow-ed), you probably will enjoy this one too, although it's a bit more sparse.<br /><br />9) Soft Touch/Raw Nerve: Strangely enough this is where the \\"A side\\" of the album would begin if it had one. Lyrically this is Never Let Me Down Again 2013. Sound-wise, it's upbeat and poppy... as in Cherry Lips by Garbage pop. Accessible, probably thepoppiest song they've done in a very long time. Bound to be a single. Judging on the stuff they've played live so far, very likely to be the case.<br /><br />10)Should Be Higher- Again, Dave delivers an incredible song. Reading the comments on YouTube this seems to be everyone's favorite from the record. I can see why. It's classic DM sound but also updated. Dave hits some unusually high notes here (and does so well I have to add). A very strong tune, again I'd expect this to be a single.<br /><br />11) Alone- This actually sounds like the 2nd half of Ultra with its layered structure and occasional outburst. Could stick between Freestate and Insight and it will fit right in.<br /><br />12) Soothe My Soul- 2nd single to me is a hit. I personally think this is a great choice (better than Heaven) to represent the record. It's a sexy, upbeat, and very direct tune.<br /><br />13) Goodbye - Another bluesy piece. Again, these aren't as predominant as all the adds would make you think. To me this is the weakest piece on the record.
B00A0MJA1I|4.0|Though my least favorite of all Disney Classics, this is still worth watching and owning. So do yourself a favor and get this - kids will especially enjoy watching of course with you.  Have a good time!
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Mark Wahlberg can be really funny, not just your average action hero. The animation is great. A lot's of bad dirty language, not recommended for kids but, a lots of fun for adults!
B00004Z4WR|4.0|Some car action and actor Nicholas Cage make for a good old-fashioned drama. Though I liked it, I still enjoy the Fast & Furious series more. But then this started it all so I feel you should get this as part of your collection. So enjoy watching!
B002QNTNL6|3.0|It was a good family movie.  One you can safely watch with anyone.  I watched it with my husband and we both enjoyed watching it.
0307595579|5.0|Great Great Books! Need to purchase these to read as you will never come across again these unique thrillers. Please, however, give these a chance as they take a little while to get into. But then you will be hooked and it will be well worth the journey. Please do yourself a huge favor and buy, buy, buy.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I love Jane Austen and I like.the long version as well as this version. This version puts the passion with the book.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This game almost hypnotizes me. I concentrate so hard on getting the items in a row, I sometimes don't see when I've cleared a path!!!  Then, it all disappears, and I've won a new brick!!!  Then, I FEEL the excitemen,  and try for another!!  I think you will like this game...You get to work in the &#34;field&#34; and you get to be the &#34;boss&#34; when the little people build the buildings.  See? Something for everyone!!!!
B007JMW46U|3.0|I haven't read the book yet. But I plan to read it inthe near future..  Looking forward to reading it.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|yeah your game is fun but when I saw the screenshots THEY HAVE SO MUCH MORE THAN THE DEMO I HOPE THAT THEY MAKE IT FAIR Because who's going to buy it if they don't know that this has more stuff
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Cubistry is a challenging mind game. It required the mind to be quick to find the matching squares. It's really good.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|this is really one of my favorite Disney movies, because the characters are so funny and the horse especially!  Also love the frying pan parts, totally hilarious!  This is a must see.  The only thing I didn't like about the movie were some of the singing parts, they got kind of annoying, but overall I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone!!
B0091VOCAS|5.0|This is one of my fav love stories. It tells us how true love should be. We committe our lives to that special person and hang on no matter what.
B0049J2BSM|4.0|I haven't seen this movie in years, but it is one of my favorites, just an all around good family movie!! :)
B00957T6X6|5.0|These books are great.  I am still reading just the first book but I have to really struggle to put my book down.  Can't wait to finish reading the books and watch the series.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Read for my book club.  Very suspenseful.  Like watching a Dateline where they make it seem one way then change your perspective.
B004FQX5CK|5.0|2nd best SF film ever, right after 2001. Rutger Hauer improvised the line about 'tears in rain' near the end of the movie.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|This book seems more like filler.  It is an interesting look at some side characters ( who may become more important) but you consume these books to get the big picture and I kept waiting for the main stuff to happen.  Can't wait  to read number 5.
B0000524CY|5.0|Great movie. This version includes the 'crabwalk' scene which, while brief, adds something to the experience. Don't ever watch movies on your phone - you don't get anything but convenience.
0307346617|2.0|Had to put it down. Disappointing. Unreadable. Every character the same - obnoxious juvenile crass and rude. Except a few who were completely depressing and hopeless. Much scifi is ruined by the misanthropic tendencies of the author.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|The actors in this series are superb!  In particular Brendan Coyle (now Downton Abbey's Mr. Bates) as Mr. Timmins and Olivia Hallinan who portrays his daughter Laura Timmins.  Mark Heap as Thomas Brown is a delight, as is John Dagleish as Alfe Aliss,<br />also Postmistress Dorcas Lane ( Julia Sawalha) and the outstanding  portrayal of Emma Timmins by Claudie Blakely.  Watch out particularly for Linda Bassett & Karl Johnson as 'Queenie' & 'Twister' Turrill.. This is British drama at its best - a series  about two adjacent places,  the hamlet of Lark Rise and nearby town of Candleford.  I love it, watches all four seasons, hated to see it end.<br />It is heartwarming, inspiring filled with strong morals and faith, and difficult decisions.  Watch it = you will love i also :)
B00AK0X5VQ|1.0|Enjoyed the game.  Soon tired of it not opening on my Tablet after one touch.  Had to try three to four times before it would open.  I would touch the screen and it would start to open and get only so far in the process before shutting down leaving me to try again three or four times.  Not worth the effort.
B0053F042G|2.0|THI MOVIE SEEMS LIKE AN INTERESTING SCI FI ACTION THRILLER ITS NOT IT WAS A RELLY BAD STUPID MOVIE DONT WASTE YOUR TIME
B0074VA2T2|4.0|Great game for my young grandchildren to play on grandma's Tablet.  A fun way to learn counting, listening and reading skills.
B004SNC5QM|5.0|I had been interested in getting some Merrell shoes for some time and so far I am pretty impressed by these shoes. The shape is certainly based on the natural form of the foot, which makes it look just slightly awkward (a bit like clown shoes) but that's mostly because I've been used to wearing shoes that are much wider at the arch and heel. The design elements of the shoe definitely make up for it, as this particular color scheme is really striking. It's a very interesting blue color that shifts in tone around the shoe. The fit is definitely different, and it really encourages you to run on the balls of your feet rather than taking all of the impact on your heel. I am looking forward to breaking these in even more and having them form to my feet.
B005C8ENI0|4.0|Enjoyed watching this &#34;free&#34; movie through my Prime subscription.  Had a good story line and kept my attention throughout the movie.  May watch this one again and would recommend to friends for viewing.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I have read many of John Green's books and this one might be my favorite. What a wonderful person Augustus was!!!! Great book!
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|Accidently down loaded this.  Have no opinion since I did not actually play the game. Have no interest in acquiring the game.
0765356139|3.0|Elend: There is an army outside Luthadel. It happens to be led by my father. I'm king now, maybe I should do something about this.<br /><br />Dockson: Indeed- wait, what? We made you king? Aren't you, like, 15 years old?<br /><br />Elend: Ah, shucks, that isn't very nice. I'm 21.<br /><br />Dockson: Well, you are a good guy so I'll let it pass. This will be mentioned repeatedly throughout the book. Honestly, you are so good.<br /><br />Vin: (Glances around the room, making sure everything is safe) Hey guys.<br /><br />Elend: Holy crap you are so paranoid! I love you though. I worship the ground you walk on. Let's make a bunch of mist babies. Have I mentioned how adorably paranoid you are?<br /><br />Readers: Actually, considering her upbringing and the fact that you are now king, she doesn't seem paranoid. She is just being smart.<br /><br />Elend: No, no, trust me guys. She is soooo paranoid.<br /><br />Readers: But, don't you mention how assassins try to kill you every month? And that she is essentially the only one protecting you?<br /><br />Elend: Guys, seriously. She is paranoid.<br /><br />Readers: Sigh, Ok...<br /><br />Vin: You know how I seemed conflicted about my role and who I was in the last book? Well, that was unresolved and we are now going to drag it out for 400 pages.<br /><br />Zane: Hey, what's up? I'm another Mistborn and I'm the bad boy. I wear all black. By the way, Elend wears all white. There is no symbolism in that AT ALL.<br /><br />Vin: Woah, who are you?<br /><br />Zane: Oh, I work for Elend's dad...you know, the one who is currently commanding an army that is besieging the city?<br /><br />Vin: Considering my predilection for not trusting anybody, it would be consistent with my character to treat you as a hostile enemy. But, I'm just so intrigued! Another Mistborn!<br /><br />Zane: Elend is using you Vin. You are nothing but a tool to him.<br /><br />Vin: If that were true, wouldn't Elend just command me to go slaughter his father's armyby myself? I mean, I'm so powerful now all I have to do is blink and people's heads explode.<br /><br />Zane: Nope, he is using you.<br /><br />Vin: Actually, I'm the one who insists on being his personal body guard and roaming the mists at night. He never once asks me to do that and in fact hints that he would prefer I stay safe inside the castle.<br /><br />Zane: Read my lips. TOOL.<br /><br />Vin: You have convinced me! It's not like you have an ulterior motive for causing me to doubt Elend.<br /><br />Zane: Not at all. While I'm here, I could easily kill all the team members with a single coin while they slept. In fact I could kill your entire army very easily simply by being quiet and not continually letting you know I'm here. But I won't.<br /><br />Vin: Because you are honorable?<br /><br />Zane: Um, no. Just because.<br /><br />Sazed: Hey guys I'm back! Guess what? The mists are eating people now. We should maybe do something about that.<br /><br />(The characters proceed to pretty much ignore him).<br /><br />Vin: Crap, it looks like someone has killed one of the team members and replaced him with a Kandra! You know, like Renoux in the last book.<br /><br />Elend: Wow, this is serious. BUT Kandra can't use Allomancy. Seeing as how the entire group can use Allomancy except for Dockson, and Vin can pierce copperclouds, you should go and test them right away. Like now.<br /><br />Vin: Eh, how about I wait for 200 pages and you continue to tell them all your secret plans?<br /><br />Elend: Sounds good!<br /><br />Vin: Ugh, I'm so conflicted! I wish I could be the girl Elend deserves, wearing pretty dresses and being supportive all the time. This line of thought is not supported by anything Elend does and actually conflicts with the whole \\"You are a tool to him\\" theory, but oh well. I love the mists! But I'm so angsty about my relationship with Elend! Ah, the mists! But angst! Hmmm, mist, angst, mist, angst, mist.....mangst?<br /><br />Readers: This is incredibly boring.<br /><br />Elend: Alrighty, I'm going to meet my father. Alone.<br /><br />Breeze: That is the stupidest thing I have ever heard.<br /><br />Elend: Hey, don't be a meanie! You see, that is the point! He will think me stupid for meeting him without protection!<br /><br />Breeze:...That's because it is stupid Elend. At least take Vin. Oh, and while you are there, you could take the Kandra working for you. That way, you could kill your dad and replace him with your Kandra, therefore effectively being in control of his army. He could just order the enemy army to attack the second army now at your gates. Problem solved.<br /><br />Elend: Um, no.<br /><br />Breeze: Ok, why not?<br /><br />Elend: Cuz I'm a good guy?<br /><br />Breeze: No, you are confusing \\"good\\" with \\"insanely inept at being a king\\". God I wish Kelsier was here.<br /><br />Cett: So I'm in charge of the other army. Mind if I cause the government to depose Elend and then set me up as king?<br /><br />Readers: Wait, how did you get in the city?<br /><br />Elend: We don't ask those kinds of questions.<br /><br />Readers: But he is a cripple! He can't walk! If he was able to get into the city, then why didn't he just send a couple of his troops in each night and hide out until the entire army is in the city, thereby taking everybody by surprise??<br /><br />Sanderson: (covering ears) La la la la la, I can't hear you! Stop asking questions, the characters don't ask these questions!<br /><br />Readers: Ugh, who cares anyways, I'm just glad Elend is no longer allowed to act like an idiot while in power.<br /><br />Elend: But wait! I'm a good, honorable guy!<br /><br />Readers: So we have heard.<br /><br />Cett: How about while you guys are deciding, I bring my troops in here? That ok?<br /><br />Elend: Ya, sure, what could possibly go wrong?<br /><br />Readers: (Loud groaning) So, it's now been 400 pages, nothing has happened and we have yet to even address the title of this book.<br /><br />Vin: Wellallow me to up the drama! I think.....THE MIST IS ACTUALLY THE DEEPNESS.<br /><br />Readers: We already figured that.<br /><br />Vin: Oh ya, well what about.....I THINK I AM THE NEW HERO OF LEGENDS.<br /><br />Readers: That was clear from Book 1.<br /><br />Vin: Fine! Then I think I need to.....GO TO THE WELL OF ASCENSION.<br /><br />Readers: Thank the Lord baby Jesus, finally!<br /><br />And the book proceeds as it should from there. The ending (and the really cool and developed magic system) is the only reason this book gets 3 stars.
B004UNX1LS|3.0|Love finding older songs but feel it is missing something.Can't find all I want of some singer's and to much of others.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This game if fun and challenging.  It is much harder than a previous version that I have and I like the challenge.
B004L07KWQ|2.0|Wish we could choose colors more. And stay with the color we could choose. To random and no different paint brush sizes.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This series was the best I have ever read. I have read the whole series twice and now nothing else compares.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved this book so much I read it twice! Nicholas Sparks kept me hooked from the beginning all the way to the intriguing ending. Highly recommend it!!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This series was the best I have ever read. I have read the whole series twice and now nothing else compares.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Life of Pi has risen to the top of my favorite movie list - it is astounding, eye opening, touching and really makes you think about life and what is important.  Watch it with your family, your friends or just yourself.  You will never forget it, but will probably want to watch again.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This series was the best I have ever read. I have read the whole series twice and now nothing else compares.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|A frank portrayal of a famous person who happened to be a christian and his search to become closer to God while living in the material world.  He wasn't perfect but his quest to be close to God makes this a great documentary.
B00AK0X5VQ|1.0|I guess if you enjoy mind altering drugs this might be appealing to you. Otherwise, don't waste your time on it!
B0071BGOJC|4.0|If you like Follett's other novels this does not disappoint in an way - far from. If you like reading about history, politics and everyday life before and during WWII? Then you get a full setup in this novel. I was greatly entertained.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|The game is well developed. And it's challenging. But not so much that you get stuck in 20 minutes. For sure a 5 star App.
B00BGIBVRG|3.0|It was decent. No where near as funny as knocked up but it had its moments. Glad disnt go to this in the theater but definitely worth a rental
B00846WWVM|1.0|The game is well done. But it's well done for kids 12 and under. Not a lot of fun or challenge.
B009B53LA6|5.0|I've always loved No Doubt and I've been very excited about this album!  I like the fact that they sort of went back to their punk/ska roots instead of pushing forward into the Pop world.  Great album!  I can listen to it on repeat over and over!
B00AK0X5VQ|1.0|looked like fun but no fun at all and hard to understand what to do with the game you should delete it and get something else
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|oh, such good looking young men!  even the villians are fascintating and smart.  great plots and always a twist at the end.  and---such good looking men to look at.
B00846F1YW|1.0|This is crap!! I played the game and it is a waste of time! All you do is play really hard timed and search and find games! CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Nice game, easy to use.<br />Very easy game to use.  Love to watch the cards dance around when I win a game. I would definitively recommend this app.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is amazing! The graphics are great, the campaign is excellent, and it even has an online multiplayer! This game is a must play on kindle fire hd. If I had to say anything negative, it would be that it is sort of hard to aim but with aim assist on, it's easier.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Without a doubt, this series will go down in history as one of the best ever. I became an immediate addict!
B009K0OL06|5.0|well done trash show with intriguing twists and turns in a world just close enough to one I live in
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Best match three in a long time....would like a little more time on some levels, but maybe that's because I've been playing a bit too late....
B008YP272M|5.0|I just LOVE Christopher Hitchens, and soooo wish that he was still around to amuse and educate us.Read this small book where he tells of his cancer diagnosis and treatment. GOSH - I wish he was a survivor - but I am soooo glad he left us this little gem of a book. Thanks. Melody Haskins
B00AREIAI8|4.0|it's a really fun game, great for any and all horse lovers! Server gets a bit bogged down sometimes though
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|I watch this through Amazon Instant Video and the quality is excellent. My one complaint not with Dr. Who but with the streaming service—Amazon Instant Video is not enabled for iPad's Airplay,
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is a good game to play I love it very much like a good  game  mom DAD Bryce and I love minecraft so much I love it but I what a lever<br />But I didn't have it
B009AMANH4|5.0|Superb acting and a compelling story combined in an excellent film. Today's Rebublicans would do well to watch this film and then watch it again. In fact, all of us should. It shows what can be done to improve our country when principle is placed before personal glory and compromise can be achieved. And yes, some backroom dealing is also needed if we are to move ahead.
B006LSZECO|2.0|The two characters had no redeeming qualities and deserved each other. Not worth the time investment.  However, it is clever in the way it is written and presented.
B00BI5IXL4|4.0|I completely enjoyed this filmed version of one of the greatest musicals of all time. The actors generally performed well and truly surprised me with their vocal skills. Many have panned the extensive use of close-ups. I found that it drew me deeper into the story and the emotions portrayed. To me it proved that you should not just depend on the critics, but judge for yourself since their's is only one person's opinion, just as this is mine.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|The depth that the author takes is amazing.  He has thought about almost every angle. If you are a sci-fi, zombie, or post-apocalypse fan then you need to read this book.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|This Dr. Who took awhile to grow on me, but this season does not disappoint. And the Dr also has a real budget finally. Great storytelling!
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|Liked how the story continued you guessing what was going to happen to the main character.  A good human story
B008BM9L72|5.0|What a great sexy set of books!  I had no idea what they were about, just that everyone was raving about them. Add me to the group!
B000A1INBC|5.0|Comes even more alive on vinyl.  Translucent Blue Vinyl, that is!  Very cool looking and vinyl is always sonically better sounding.  Set the needle, sit in your listening chair, let Morello's guitar envelop you and Cornell's voice wash over you.  This band was too short-lived, but they made three perfect albums.  Don't debate it, just buy it.
0425252868|5.0|A fascinating and truly incredible story and it's all true!  One of those almost unbelievable accounts from wartime annals that reflects even in the most terrible of times that good will triumph in the end no matter where it originates.  If you think that history is boring read this book.  Your spirits will be uplifted when you finally finish it.
B003WJ81MA|1.0|I saw this film way back in the 80s and had a vague memory of this movie so decided to watch it again with my kids. Ugh. This movie is campy and merely a vehicle for Tom Cruise's idolatry. The plot is dumb, the acting dumber. Actually go watch Dumb and Dumber it's a better use of your time. The script is laughable, the creatures and effects are so amateurish looking for nowadays kids that they are bored to tears, literally. Leave this movie back in the 80s where it belongs.
B008K9SG9K|4.0|Some of the songs are really great but the music tends to change from song to song in the sense that there is no pattern as to which genre they are sticking to.<br /><br />Pros: some of the songs are great in their own standing and it shows since they reached the top hits.<br />Cons: genre is somewhat not similar from song to song.
B0053TMP24|5.0|It was a wonderful book very interesting very on going easy to get in to cant wait for the other book to come out.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|this game is a  awesome game because I have the game you no why you fly with flinly and watch out  for stuff:() :)
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This was a easy book to get in to very interesting very good story line loved to read it .
B006AZZPCM|5.0|The tudemate is the thing that help me out. I can download youtube video and know they are safe and what them when ever i want. It is awesome to me.
B00A757EFW|1.0|I could not control it on my phone.  I thought it would be better to operate it.  looking for better version.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Great game, I can't put it down. Multiple levels of puzzles with increasing challenge/ difficulty. I really enjoy this game.
B00123LIPK|5.0|Madonna is timeless. It's nice to listen to music from my youth that my 15  year old daughter can enjoy as well.  Enjoying my purchase!
0143145088|2.0|The PDF loads but I cannot get the audio files to load.  Works fine on my MAC but I need it on my phone.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I am so addicted to this game. you must have patience, a lot of negative comments ive seen is just cause they didn't give it enough time
B00BNNJHXO|5.0|Soilwork is not capable of making a bad album. They take on a lot of different styles, and they rock every single one of them. This is a very good double album, everything is put together well. Speed is one of the best metal vocalists out there. Get this album. Do it.
B0088W4YTK|4.0|Nice stories, great characters...a fun romp.  Can be corny sometimes but overall great science fiction.  This season has some great twists.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks hits on another winner. This book is easy reading and hard to put down. I enjoy all his books, but this one is my favorite so far.
B000HWZ4A2|5.0|Despite the fact that this story departs from the book, it still works and inspires me.  It is interesting to see the culture in these old movies to get a feel for life back in the mid 1900's.  Ayn Rand had a unique perspective about life.
B00BESM14U|5.0|I initially only watched it because of Emma Watson (I'm a huge harry potter fan) but the movie is amazing!! great characters and great story. Highly recommended!!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|One of the best shows I've ever seen! Good character development, Very good acting. Zombies are awesome and the suspense is great!
B00005N6KG|3.0|I bought these headphones to replace the now discontinued Sony MDR-A35 collapsible headphones that I've had for years.  I was quite disappointed with the new pair.  The sound is ok but they really are of low quality.  They're very flimsy and feel like cheap headphones that you get on an airplane.  I tried using them when I run but I found them to be uncomfortable; they didn't stay on and I was constantly trying to adjust them to make them stay put.  Considering the price, I suppose I am not surprised that they feel so cheap.  However, I believe that they are overcharging if the retail price is $10.
B0088W7VNG|5.0|It is best to watch the seasons in order, but this was great. I will admit I was looking for the relationships to pan out or to solidify and that did not really happen as I expected, so, in a way, it was not predictable.
1926778537|5.0|I am fascinated and a believer of the for horseman and this book provides excellent artwork and alternate ways of viewing it. The book came up for preorder and I had to have it, so I preordered the book months in advance and they never forgot me and I recieved it for the holidays.
B009IJJ712|5.0|Was hesitant at first. Did not see how Watson could work as a female, but this show is great. Hope season two lives up to expectations of intelligent characters and great plots set by season one. Our whole family loves it..
071198042X|5.0|My father is a huge Queen and Freddie Mercury fan and this made a wonderful gift and missing Piece in his enormous collection.
B000001FT2|5.0|I had this cassette in the late 80's.It was different back then & ahead of the times today.The cd came quick,mint condition & sounds great.Its a gift to hear this late 80's music on a modern day cd player !!!! Very soulful. 1 song sounds regaee.It has alot of  good beats, Grace sings by her own drum beat.This is a good cd that I kept in my funk/Soul collection.She was & still sounds very futuristic,like the next wave,even though its 30 years old.
B005HSL626|3.0|it awsome atbfirst but then i glkinda gets boring i mean tye blade are cool and if anybody knows why they choose fruit please coment back bye:)
1416549447|5.0|This is a good book. I bought it for my husband. It is a good reference book for people that are older and dont want to get hurt.
B0086221SS|4.0|The characters were so believable and the acting was excellent. It was an enjoyable movie alternative to the typical tv drama.
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|I'd give the movie 4/5 stars.  It's a wonderful adventure with amazing special effects and a grand scale.  It's a little goofier than the Lord of the Rings series, but the book kind of read that way also.  If you loved the LotR movies, books and everything else, you'll definitely want to see this.<br /><br />The star off is for the digital version that comes with the disc.  It's a low quality (non HD, not even DVD quality) copy that plays in Flixter's own player.  I get better picture quality on Netflix non HD streaming shows and movies.  You have to use their player, their service and it's presented in a letterbox format with no options for widescreen.  So if you already have a widescreen (who doesn't?) then it displays at about half size because you still have gigantic black bars on top and bottom.  It's just not even worth watching.
B00A757EFW|1.0|I always did well on the original pac man. This version is horrible!  Very very hard to control and just very frustrating.  Don't bother. Bad bad bad
B009KEN87O|5.0|This game hits the bulls-eye on retro. I got this game for free and even though it was free, it would be worth the (weird) price of $2.56.<br />I also made this because I will be the 600th reviewer!
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Being a new runner of less than a year, a friend suggested I read this book. What an awe-inspiring story. A must read for any runner!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I don't think there is anything new I can say about Adele.  She has a true voice that doesn't need any kind of mechanical manipulation to sound good.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|Nothing really special with this Angry Birds.  It's a good game and great for spare time but I wouldn't delve into it like other games.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Enjoyed the movie. Not perfectly true to the story, but suspenseful and good character development.  A gripping story definitely worth watching.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Love this game.  I love being able to constantly earn more and more and this game never gets boring.  I've played it a ton and got a few others addicted to it as well.
B00ABO609A|1.0|We were only able to watch the first 10 minutes of the movie -- absolutely disgusting.  We turned it off, and searched for something less offesive to watch.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Really enjoying season 1 and so glad I didn't watch when on network tv because now I can enjoy at my own pace.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|When the movie came out I loved it because I knew the story.  Had I not read it I would not have caught a lot of things in the movie.  Parts of the book are just so long and drawn out - I really don't need to know about the sewers of Paris!  Would love to be in a discussion group about &#34;the law&#34; versus love, mercy and grace.  There are a lot of religious themes throughout this story.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Well put together, Awesome story line and special effects. Makes you look at life a bit differently but in a good way.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I'm honestly sad that there isn't another one but happy that she isn't dragging it out. Amazing books that suck you in from the beginning.
B00A757EFW|3.0|Kind of hard to control the pack-man. If it was easier to control it would have been great to have.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Easy to play and its just like taking care of a horse. Great for existing it time and just having fun.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This one is so much fun and such a challenge at times.  Great for adults and older kids that can do problem solving.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This is a great app! It gives you alerts when you get close to the end of a auction, and when your out bid. I have used this app for my last two purchases and have had no problems! If you mess with Ebay download this app!
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|This movie was so cute... really makes you want to believe again and appreciate the tradition of fairytale's and holiday characters. Kiddos will love it to, but this movie was entertaining for adults.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This Game is Amazing it is like Call Of Duty Black Ops 1and2 so Get this game now it is not a waste of money so Get this game now there is Camping and Multiplayer get it now!!!!!!!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its a fun game to play when you are bored and is good pastime. it is a little expensive tho<br />.
B005T87QCI|5.0|This Game is Amazing, Awesome, And Cool. Get this game it is not a waste of money so Get this game now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|I just started playing these kind of games, and I can say this is by far the best. Intriguing puzzles and graphics are awesome. I couldn't put this game down. If you only get one of the G5 games I recommend buying this one. It is well worth the money, and you won't be disappointed.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Get this game now this is the best game ever it is not a waste of money so Get this game now!!!!!!!!
B002EMESSM|4.0|It was exiting to see the crew return to the Enterprise, but not sure what it was, it was not like seeing them in the original series episodes. It was a good movie though and glad they made it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|It seemed so believable. The characters did a great job. Love it that it is in the real castle. Can't wait for next season.
B0059R5Q08|3.0|There are many scenes that have been cut from the book that should have been in the movie. This is the second time that i have watched it and other than Michael Fassbender there is nothing that i can say positive about this.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I absolutely loved it... inspirational and I feel like I was part of the journey through the whole thing! All the best ways to capture a reader in all 3  novels!
0670026638|5.0|I was first introduced to Ozeki's writing as an undergrad and was immediately captivated by her novel, My Year Of Meats.  When the opportunity arose to review A Tale For The Time Being, I knew I wouldn't be disappointed.  Ozeki has an incredible gift for weaving together fact with fiction so well that often it becomes difficult to distinguish one from the other which results in a very enlightening and meaningful reading experience.  I often found myself surfing the internet to learn more (much like the character Ruth in the novel as she tries to decipher Nao's diary).  I was unaware of the intensity of \\"bullying\\" among Japanese students and the high rate of suicide among teens as well as middle-aged Japanese business men.  Ozeki brings to light the environmental aftermath that will continue to develop following the recent Tsunami that devastated portions of Japan.  She reminds us that we are not a singular entity divided by national boundaries but rather a truly global community.  I found myself quickly immersed in this novel and yet I felt the need to pace myself; slow down, take my time, and make this last as long as possible.  Ozeki's approach to the concept of the passing of time itself throughout the novel is certainly worth contemplation and one that left me more aware of my own time.  Each character is brought to life with their own unique and endearing qualities that will capture your attention and tug at your heart!  Ozeki is the embodiment of literary brilliance and this book is destined to become a contemporary classic.  I would highly recommend this as a \\"must read\\" for any reading group....the discussions would be endless!  FIVE stars.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|best game ever. extremely addictive. buy this game and you will love it. the android app is amazingly awesome. buy buy buy
B00BQPEIT2|3.0|I am hooked on this game! I am having a problem with it updating my missions....iI know I have completed a goal but it says I haven't.  This has happened more than once.  Overall, though, this game is fun and not too involved!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is just absolutely wonderful. One of the best games I have ever played. It is a game that keeps you playing until you beat your high score 5stars.
B0016492BW|5.0|I was a teenager when this movie came out and it has been one of my favorites ever since. Being able to watch it in high definition on a big screen at home is sweet.<br /><br />The quality of the blu-ray picture is outstanding. The hilarious silliness of the movie has stood the test of time. It's a classic.<br /><br />Buy this movie. Show it to your kids and grandkids. Keep the cult of Monty Python alive.
B007HU4FJ8|5.0|Great movie and a great story, with different dialects being spoken throughout the movie. The whole movie was great although the ending could have used some more work.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I purchased the 50th anniversary box set of Bond movies from Amazon on Black Friday last year and pre-ordered this as soon as it went on sale.<br /><br />Seeing a Bond movie in a theater is still amazing, but it's very cool that we can now watch them in high def with surround sound in our own homes.<br /><br />The movie is a worthy addition to the franchise and longtime fans will enjoy many of the nods to history in this film. Recommended for all Bond fans and fans of action films.
B00A0R0CG0|5.0|If you loved the first Ice age movie then you'll most likely love this one too. Not much can be said other than you won't know what kind of experience this movie will give until you watch it for yourself.
B005COO1X6|5.0|I don't give everything by Stephen King five stars, although he is the most consistently entertaining author alive today, IMHO. Here are some of the reasons that I gave this novella the gold prize: It reminded me of his best and funnest works in his old anthologies. It has all the elements of great everyday characters, everyday objects and situations that are turned on their head and gruesome horror. Is it brilliant? No, probably not, but it was pure and delicious entertainment. Many of the characters are children, and as in most of his work (here his connection to Bradbury and other essentially Romantic American writers are shown), it is the child's innocence and imagination that allows them to navigate situations that would otherwise send one to gaga land. Here is the crux of the theme: In a world where bad stuff falls into our laps, and we could die from being a samaritan, we must see the world through a child's eyes. If you can't do that, don't bother with this little horror gem. It is fun, twisted and light, but not I'd say for the jaded and cynical.
B00B23O96A|5.0|Easter is here and giving us time to relax at home and listening to some good music<br />after Steppenwolf, Jefferson Airplane, Grateful Dead it became the final time<br />to put Eric's Old Sock on the turntable, the vinyl record just arrived from the<br />USA and as usual what sort of music is Eric bringing this time. I have seen Eric<br />from his days with Cream and Delaney and Bonnie and numerous concerts as just Eric<br />Clapton so I had great hopes of his new record. The record was put on the AA stereo<br />system and what a nice and warm sound came out of the JBL speakers, we almost had<br />Eric in our lounge and my wife and me smiled softly and smoke another cigarette<br />what a wonderful record but being in the sixties the both of us we might just be<br />a couple of old socks.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This is only the second book of Kate Morton's I've read, but I plan to read more.  At first, I found her signature jumping about in time a touch off putting, but I eventually realized how much this increased the tension and kept it alive until the end.  I am honestly in awe of her ability and skill in crafting her tales to hold the reader's interest until the final page.
B001NHNG64|4.0|It did not hold my interest as well as Reacher #1.  Good info about the about U.S. separatists.  Too much detail about guns and amo.
078322947X|4.0|Although it did poorly in theatrical release, I still remember seeing this film at the theater and I thought it was great. I had been looking for a copy for years and was pleased to get it through Amazon.
B00B9LNLTQ|5.0|I've listened to this 4 or 5 times through now, and it gets better with each listen.  I didn't think Angles was a bad album at all, but I did think it had weak spots.  This album seems to be more cohesive and every song is a standout.  I hate the digipak packaging, as I always do, but companies want to do everything on the cheap, especially with fewer people buying actual discs.  If you're on the fence, definitely pick this one up.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love ths just like everyone else who has read this series! Great story line and I can't wait for the movie! Laters baby!
1451695195|5.0|After loosing my Father I felt completely empty.  My family has been struggling with loosing this person special to all of us.  I heard about this book written by a neurosurgeon which is rare someone in the medical field even talks about such things.  The book is very well written - you feel that you're taking the journey along with the writer.<br />I found comfort in this book and I highly suggest it to anyone dealing with grief and loss.  It has helped my family tremendously.
B00899DR40|5.0|But this collection is great!!!! I am so happy the my niece decided to download this. My favorite song is Catching Feelins! This cd has made me a fan!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|The daughter of a friend showed me this app.  It's perfect for my 4 year old niece.  She loves to play beauty salon in real life, so this was a nice distraction when it's not possible to play with someone's hair.  I even find myself playing with it.  I really like all the features of curling, cutting, shaving, but also adding accessories and taking a picture of your creation.  Very cool!  Love it!
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|Great special effects. A disappointment in that it didn't reach a conclusion - this is Part One, which I didn't know when I viewed it in the theatre. Left me expecting more, felt a bit ripped off. Some think this is no comparison to LOTR, and they are correct. The grandeur and depth of LOTR isn't here. But then again, the book was written as a light hearted tail and that's what this film reflects. View it for the fun of it, and for some insight regarding the finding of the One Ring and you won't be disappointed. After all, I did rent it after viewing it in the theatre, didn't I?
B004FN1T3A|5.0|Read it three times. Just past my due date yesterday, and looking forward to my upcoming birthing experience and practicing what I've learnt!
B004LWZW7O|4.0|I am so sorry to say I never received this item..and its not the sellers fault. It arrived at our local post office, and they state it was delivered however, we live in a rural area, with a cluster of boxes at the base of our highway road during the Holidays, and we feel it was stolen from the mailbox.  We had seen this movie, loved it, and decided to purchase it...the seller obviously did mail it quickly and we would purchase from them again.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|I found myself swept up in the character of Harold Fry, in his inner and outer journey through the English country-side, towns, and lives of individuals that intersected his life. Joyce is a wonderful wordsmith taking the reader on a remarkable journey. Highly recommended!
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Bought this CD at the same time that I picked up Maroon 5 Overexposed as well as Fun and Lumineers.  Would have to say that Mumford and Sons had the edge in overall quality of CD produced.  A well done to this group.
B00AH8FTT2|1.0|I bought this book for my husband who enjoyed the first two of the Clifton Chronicles but he said that he could have made a better ending for this book..He says it wasn't worth reading the first two books to end up with such a pathetic ending.
B0075MFS9Y|4.0|The Lumineers are a very interesting group and their recent hit Ho Hey caught my attention.  Very glad to report that the entire music selection on this CD is quality stuff and should be on everyone's list.  First heard them on Sirius XM, glad I did.
075669812X|5.0|Very happy with product & shipping speed.I would recommend this product to friend. Great price too! My son is enjoying it very much.
B008LC8TJI|4.0|I buy a wide range of music and wanted s strong selection from Maroon 5.  This met that requirement.  While not an ardent fan, more into Train, the Maroon 5 Overexposed made a favorable impression.
B000OJFV4C|3.0|I don't love this series, but it is interesting enough.  Because it is a cable series, there is a lot of sex.  Costumes are beautiful.
B00BMVTS1S|3.0|but waaaay too long and dragged out. i did notice that the landscape seemed less 'magical' and i was more aware of actors at times as opposed to their characters, and then i read about the new tech they were using and i hope they don't do it again.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|Well okay, the book is pretty similar to the Studio Ghibli version (the movie being based off the book in the first place), but yet they are so different in character personalities and events... I love the movie more because I saw that before reading this book. But as a separate book, it captured my interest and I enjoyed reading this:)
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I was curious about the book series after watching the movie.  The packaging of the books into a single, well priced product was a great way to read the entire series in a few readings.  The overall story flowed smoothly with very dull moments.  I can say I enjoyed it, and at 66 I do not fall into the demographics for which it is targeted.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This game is fun, entertaining, addicting, etc. But it's not like this game is useful in any way. It's still fun though. And addicting. The first time my friend showed me this game, it looked so useless, but for some reason I actually did enjoy this game. Go figure:P
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best show ever & I am so glad I can still watch it even without cable! Not having to wait for Netflix to get the season....Priceless:)
B003IY48PS|4.0|One of my favorite movies of all time, but some things are better left untouched, there is a scene that the car goes on the bridge and the sound guy appears...THEY COVERED THE GUY WITH SOME HORRIBLE TREE!!! Just a fan thing...
B005NPCUC8|5.0|Dark Side of the Moon is one of the best albums ever made. It sounds as good as it did back in the seventies. It has been remastered so the sound quality is freekin' great.
B005UDD1R6|2.0|Got this to hopefully play videos my installed player wouldn't play.  No such luck.  Can't seem to find anything about this product to recommend it except it is free.  If you don't have a player, it is better than nothing.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|Anyone who hasn't seen the original Upstairs Downstairs series needs to do so ASAP!!  One of the longest-running series in Brit history, and one of the most highly acclaimed, it is also the first series that examied the effects of World War 1 on the people who actually were in the trenches.  It was produced for 7 years, and I've seen the whole series several times!! Wonderful work!!<br />Kathy
B0067RQYNW|4.0|I do not use the program very much but when I need to it works well.  Gave it 4 stars only because I don't &#34;Love It&#34;, I only use it occasionally.  But,if only rating it on value, it is easily 5 star or better!
B004P8JPS6|5.0|I love Jack Reacher! this particular read was as always fasted passed, edge of your seat, and flipping pages like mad...good. I think this is one of my favorites by Lee Child.
B0087EVHTE|5.0|I upgraded all of my components from a much slower system, so it's difficult to ascertain how much of my speed gains are from the processor, but there's no doubt this is a fast processor. Some anecdotal observations from playing a couple 2-3 year old games on my new system but before I upgraded my Nvidia 8800GT video card indicated that the games ran much faster for what it's worth. Since I'm not overclocking, I went with the stock heat sink and fan.  I'd heard the fan can be quite loud, but I don't feel that it's very noticeable at all except when first booting up the computer.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|This movie was made for a child of the 90s. There are lots of references hidden throughout the movie that young and old would enjoy.
B003E6LC6I|5.0|Season 2 was great.  With each season of the series it just seems to get better and better.  So sorry it ended.
B00BBQXUYK|5.0|I do not frequently enjoy movies and had not heard of Rise of the Guardians. We rented it to watch as a family. It was surprisingly good, not completely predictable, and visually one of my favorite movies. The story involves a selfish child who figures out his purpose in life. The story rated 4/5 stars (not quite 5). I added one, because it was really enjoyable to watch.
B00A0A6F7C|5.0|I have watched this lady blossom from the days of American Idol and give so many pleasure...I believe it taught so many that you can't rate a person by how they look.  God blesses us with talents and Susan is now sharing that with the world..
B00AGKH7K0|5.0|Bought this album at the urging of a friend and it is great! Eric's mature voice and sensitive lyrics continue to enertain.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|Awesome CD! great songs that make me feel at ease and gives me more to listen to than the same songs they play on the radio.
B0034DGPEU|1.0|The only reason I finished this book was to be able to fully rant at my next book club meeting about how ridiculous and awful The Kitchen House is.  I am stunned something this bad could be published.  The constant drama on every page was irritating, the plot predictable and most of the characters irksome. Don't waste your time or money with this one.  It does not deserve any stars at all but I had to give it one so I could post this.
B000FC2PKG|4.0|I enjoyed the book but I would have liked to have a more developed DD Warren in this one.  It was a little slow.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I was expecting &#34;The Notebook&#34; quality since it's by the same author and I didn't find this to be quite up to par with the other book, however, it was still a good read.  Some parts were a bit predictable.  Other parts, less so.  Other reviewers called this &#34;good escapism&#34; and I would certainly agree with that.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|When I listened to Where Are We Now the first time I was apprehensive that the entire album was going to be some experiment in art pop. While it was a decent song that grows on you, a whole album would have me running. Luckily, Bowie turned it around with so many great faster, harder beats. It is rock and roll in all its glory. Unlike those who say the music is not \\"pop-friendly\\", I disagree.  The music is extremely enjoyable even for these older ears. Many of the songs will grow on you and you will find yourself singing along. I recommended Valentine's Day, Dancing Out In Space, and (You Will) Set the World on Fire for sing along tunes.<br /><br />Don't be put off by some of the lower ratings who are either trying to rain on the parade or are tone-deaf. This is a year for good music with Bowie leading the way. It should receive some award this year- Brit or Grammy and I can see the nominations pouring in. I am hoping Bowie has more in store for us and that he doesn't wait another 10 years (some of us might not last that long)
B004X4R49Y|5.0|Colin Firth is always a delight to watch and it was fun to, for once, to see H.B. Carter do an understated role.  This is an interesting piece of history that we were not taught in school,.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|This is not a terrible movie, but it is also not very good. Typical Spielberg fare, unimaginative writing, predictable narrative techniques, self satisfied in its manner of presentation. It is somewhat interesting as an illustration of what Hollywood thinks ought to be a good film. It says more about the movie industry than it does about antebellum America. Also, the blizzard of over used faces distracts from its meager substance. Skip this one and spend a few hours reading about the civil war.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love this book its just amazingly well put together and the thrill the drama the intensity of the plot as it thickens. MAGNIFICENT I JUST LOVE IT!
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Good fast paced read. I couldn't put the book down at times, I had to know what happened next.<br />If you like a good mystery take time to read this one.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Great movie, the last 35 minutes are spectacular!  Absolutely loved it from beginning to end, if you are a Batman fan then you'll enjoy this movie as well.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Amazing this book is great I read the whole series is a great book series for kids I love Jeff does with the book
6305807086|5.0|I received this dvd promptly and it was like new. I watched it with my horror club and we enjoyed it immensely. We are planning a charity Halloween event based on parts of it. John Malkovich and John Cusak are amazing, although I did not recognize Cameron Diaz. The story line is unusual and is quite bizarre, who would think of entering the mind of John Malkovich and seeing what he sees? There are several plot twists as well...
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|The Tender Steak house. This book was really good. It gave good details. It was better than the movie. I <3 it
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I read this in 5 hours on a train ride up the east coast and was disappointed when it was finished!
B0044DEAUA|4.0|works well but is hard to hear somtimes with outside noise for the money it works well and concedering the cost of a ticket you can't beat it.I would recomend this product to others.
B009UWYFFK|5.0|This movie Zings! I love all the characters but especially Adam Sandler if perfect as Dracula. I love all the pet names he as for his daughter Mavey Wavey (Mavis) voiced by Selena Gomez. I love when she does the Pouty Bat Face! Andy Sambger as Jonathan \\"Johny Stein\\" is hilarous! Kevin James and Fran Dreshcer as the Frankenseins are funny as all get out! Steve Buscemi and Molly Shannon as the Werewolves are too cute and the kids especially the littest werewolf in the family is so adorable. And rounding out the cast is David Spade as the Invisible Man who is perfectly voiced but the suprise stand out is Ceelo Green as Mummy! The movie on a whole and the crazy quips had me dying laughing! This is a definite keeper, you won't be disappointed.
B00992CF6W|5.0|No words to explain it just simply amazing b e s t g a m e e v e r
B000H5U832|1.0|This movie stops/pauses several times through out the movie.<br />Very frustrating, I will not buy used videos from this site again.
B000RL4GS4|5.0|Not sure why I am creating a review for a CD that I purchased like 5 years ago, oh wait.... Because it rocks out and I am still listening to it pretty regularly.<br /><br />I felt I should stop by here and put in a quick 5 star review.  I like 70's - 80's AC/DC with their simple and butt kicking formula of putting together tunes that grab you and take you for a rifftacular rock 'n' roller coaster ride.  Airbourne pulls off every song here perfectly.  You pop these songs into your car stereo as you are crusin' down the interstate and you will be shaking your head, singing along, and ruling the road.  It is fantastic.  This is a must have for any fan of AC/DC and rock'n'roll boogie.  These melodies and riff fests will be burned into your mind for a while.  Rock On Airbourne, well done !!!!!
B002XWXPC8|5.0|One of the all-time great comedy's about baseball, it is a quickly paced absurd story about the Cleveland Indians making a run at the title with a team of misfits and cast offs. It's a shame that there is so much swearing in the movie, otherwise it would be a fun family film.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I've only started Series 1 but find myself looking for time to watch the next episode!  Look forward to it.
B005LAII12|5.0|What a crack up! If you don't like this movie, go back to the convent and say a million Hail Marys!
B0090XPGVG|5.0|I love seeing all the special features finally!  The processes behind creating movies like this is amazing, from special effects to story concepts!
B000R7HY0K|5.0|I saw the end half on cable and had to get it to see the whole movie. It is great. Action packed with gore, violence, humour., and some sexy gals ;-)
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Awesome show, consistently solid performances, good directing and engaging scripts. How many other shows can boast the same? I was not aware of the graphic novels but am a big fan of the show. I watch it with my 9 year old son every Monday, it's zombie bonding time.
1606995359|5.0|Carl Barks best. I really love Tralla la and other tales. A comic book master piece and a excellent edition.
B004Q7CIFI|4.0|This book was recommended to me by two people who know I don't enjoy real scarry stories and this one is different, coming from Stephen King.<br /><br />It has kept my interest, especially since I lived through this period and lived in Dallas for quite a long time.(Too long, actually.)<br />I am amazed that King could keep up with moving back and forth between eras with such efficient continuity.  His writing ability must have certainly been challenged. He did a great job of taking the reader with him through the hallways of time past.<br /><br />Nancy Cathey
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I enjoyed the game.  It had a good story and plenty of hidden objects and puzzles.  The objects were not always obvious which made it more challenging than some of the games.  Big Fish usually has good choices.
B000IZ7YK6|5.0|I absolutely loved the time period of this movie, the water war for Los Angeles, the actors --- everything!  Well acted and filmed.  The plot had good mystery that keeps you wondering what will happen next and how it will all turn out. Being a film noir movie, you know someone is going to die in the end, but this keeps you guessing until the last minute.  Also loved the music. Can't wait to watch it again.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game is very addictive.  My wife sits there pushing the gems for hours and hours and hours and hours.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|I played this while I was at a friend's house recuperating from surgery, and I absolutely love it. The screen graphics are awesome,<br /><br />The only complaint is that when I reach over to turn off the monitor, my body keeps brushing the power/eject button, when then causes the the game to shut off. Perhaps in their next make of the product, GAEMES could include a slab of plastic to add some cover for accidental button brushing.<br /><br />It would also be cool if there were a stand that could slide out from behind the monitor to raise the eye level from hunched over to straight back.<br /><br />Also, it would be nice if there was more room for wires, even at the sacrifice of less weight and less bulky.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|It never down loaded to my Kindle, so it's a bit difficult to rate. Why do you put a word count on a product that wasn't received?
B000W7JWUA|5.0|It is fun, addicting, and never grows old. Plus, the game can expand to make it more interesting to play or to include more players. Granted, one has to pay for those, but for the simple game that usually last around 45 minutes to 1.5 hours, I love it.
B007BVOF8E|5.0|I don't suppose it would be possible for a film with the cast list of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy to be all bad, but this film more than meets expectations.  John le Carre's (also excellent!) spy novel is something like 400 pages long, and it was adapted into a well-known 6-8 hour miniseries in the eighties.  It's not often that a two hour adaptation of something like that works -- but this does.<br /><br />The creators of the film chose to focus on one important theme of the book which they put into the mouth of Riki Tarr -- &#34;Everything you think is gold is s***&#34;.  In order to do this, a lot of the charm of the book is lost -- For example, I couldn't imagine Guillam in the film doing a bad Paul Robeson imitation to test out speakers and then Smiley giving him a hard time about it -- which could potentially be disappointing.  I didn't mind at all, because it made the film more focused.<br /><br />And despite the depressing atmosphere, and the depressing theme, there was a satisfying and much less cynical conclusion than one might expect.  There might be gold after all.<br /><br />(Ridiculous Aside:  I love period drama, and when I watch 60s period drama, I am very jealous of the costumes.  When I watch this 70s drama, I am devoutly thankful that I don't live in the 70s.)
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I love Bruno-- and I especially love the Lazy Song which is on this CD.  This has a lot of great songs on it-- it was not very expensive and I get to add it to the Amazon Cloud Player.  So this was a great find. If you like Bruno Mars- this is a must CD.
B008G8SFGO|4.0|The old stuff is better but still good new stuff too! This was husband's stocking stuffer for Christmas. He really liked it.
B009AMANH4|5.0|Hands down awesome movie w/ a doubt the best movie of the year Daniel Day-Lewis and Tommy Lee Jones were outstanding!
B006UG90RM|4.0|Although older music more to our taste we both enjoyed the new tunes on road trips. I use online downloads but my husband is old school CD user.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This book was a very, VERY good book.  But with one flaw.  Katniss wasn't good!  When most people invision Katniss they think of a heroic woman who chooses the right nomater WHAT!!!!!!!!!!! :-(  I think Collins went WAY over the edge with the killing Snow and continuing the Hunger Games.  The sad parts like Prim dying and the other counless deaths might have contributed to the overall story.  I might not be exact on this but it doesn't tell the reader who Katniss chose at the beginning of the story.  Peeta or Gale.<br />P.S Peeta should wear a mask in the next movie.:P
B008PE9GSA|4.0|We are 40 year fans of ZZTOP. I bought this for my husband's stocking for Christmas and he likes it, although the old stuff is still better.
B0029SCFE0|1.0|Total waste of money. One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Last time I follow the advice of professional reviewers.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|This show had me hooked when I saw a rerun on tv. I went onto Netflix and caught up on all previous 7 seasons in only a couple weeks and then got caught up on this 8th season on Amazon! Love love love this show!
B0013K1ALE|5.0|This is a &#34;cleaned up and expanded&#34; version of the 1976 release.  The sound, arrangement, and bonus material are fantastic.  I have fond memories associated with the original version and this new version only adds to those wonderful memories.  Some fans and critics have stated that these concert clips do not represent Zep at their best.  But, for me, I think they still stand head and shoulders above anyone else --- both in terms of musicianship and entertainment.  Unfortunately, I never had the chance to see the band live, but through this DVD set, at least I can imagine.
0439813786|5.0|The drawings in this book are intricate. It's a long book, but it held the interest of the 10-year-old boy I gave it to. He's an avid reader and liked this book very much.
B000VWYNNW|5.0|This is a &#34;cleaned up and expanded&#34; version of the 1976 release.  The sound, arrangement, and bonus material are fantastic.

B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Very funny movie but really raunchy too.  If that turns you off, don't watch this movie.  Watching a teddy bear having sex is very disturbing.
B00632HWOG|4.0|This app is good, I can check my mail while out & about on my iPhone, but I could do that without the app as well, the app just ads another icon on my home screen. I could take it or leave it, but if your email on your phone isn't Yahoo, then I'd say you'd use it more than I do
B001QJOZP0|5.0|The story starts with John Wayne, {Ethan Edwards} as he arrives at his brother's ranch.  The love of his life, is Martha {his brother's wife]He[John Wayne} has only been home  one night, when he is recruited to join the Texas rangers in pursuit of a Comanche raiding party.  While he is following a false trail the Indians attack his brothers ranch ,killing his brother,Nathan, Martha,and his nephew..  They kidnap the two nieces, and the rest of the movie chronicles the search for survivors.  John Ford directs.  the movie is dark, at times witty,and the Monument Valley of Utah provides a spectacular vista of .beautiful scenery..  This is one movie you must watch.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book, I loved every second of it. Now I have to see the movie! I can not wait though!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|incredibly easy to start reading and hard to put down - found I was deciding to finish more of the book vs watching movies or playing games.
B0037KMHRY|5.0|For those that enjoy electronic as well as symphonic music, the \\"Tron Legacy\\" Soundtrack is for you. Daft Punk incorporates their electronic sound with deft interweaving through the orchestral sounds. It creates a sense of forboding, adventurous excitement, drama, and satisfying victory as the music progresses through the different tracks, the background of the movie. I found myself bobbing my head to the pounding beats of the electronic sound, my emotions engaged with the panoramic sound of the orchestra.
B005HEFB6M|4.0|This was an excellent entry in the Star Trek franchise.  I don't know why so many people were so harsh about it.  The whole Xindi season may have been a bit of a mistake, but it was worth trying.
B003CN4R74|5.0|Evanescence knows how to blend the different levels of sound into an engaging whole. Lead vocals are sharp and clear with harmony that enhances the melody. Bass support adds a primitive heartbeat that pounds into a person. Drums and other instruments contribute an other-worldly quality to each song, including delicate strains of piano. The total creates an emotional experience that is worth many times listening.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series is PBS at its best.  Season two is just as good as the original season.  Looking forward to season 3.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|I really enjoy all of Lee Child's books, I have been reading them all in order, the last one I read was 61 hours, very good, I read it in 2 days! Now back to Bad Luck & Trouble, it was very exciting, the characters are always so realistic, and so menacing. A great read as are all of them, I am on the last book, Worth Dying for, and it is just as good as all the others, am looking forward to August for the next Jack Reacher novel. Glad he will continue, does make me wonder; will Jack ever settle down with one woman?
B003TJ4YUQ|5.0|Beautiful music and the people making it make this a movie to watch any time one is blue. The movie also has a great cause.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Sometimes you gotta get real cold on em, in order to put yo self on.  Man this CD really has some real smooth tracks on it.  He really came strong with it. He got somethin for everyone.  If you wanna feel, man he turned the soul up on ya.  If you wanna listen he got down on his lyrics, so you can understand.  When I listen to this CD I think about her.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a very strange read that kept me engrossed. I can see why it has been on the best seller lists for so long.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Not a disappointment. Continued fun in the world of bloody survival and struggle. We all agree that Daryl and Michone definately Rule!
B00125WAXC|5.0|In addition to addressing human violence and ignorance during the years before integration and the civil rights movement,this movie shows the dedication and passion for learning in a small Texas college. It is a true story about debaters facing fierce competition despite the social handicap of their race. Today's students should take note.
B004DZXC30|5.0|Loved it , action packed  exactly what I was looking for great actors and good plot, would recommend this movie
B003O86FMW|5.0|I didn't think I would enjoy this series but I had to read them all.  This second book in the Panem triolgy does a great job to cointinue the story.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Wanted to catch up on the series, really liked it , am glad I did it I am now following the series
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I love the HBO series.  I usually read books before I watch a movie or series.  I was unaware of George R.R. Martin's books until the series.  I'm reading this book now and I have to say I enjoy both the book and the series.  Win, win!
B003HARV4S|1.0|Language: English (Dolby Digital 5.1), French (Dolby Surround), Spanish (Dolby Surround)<br /><br />Dubbed: French, Spanish<br /><br />IS NOT IN SPNISH LANGUAGE ONLY SUBTITLE
B008DKBPTO|5.0|My daughter ordered this for her Kindle Paperwhite. It is attractive, protects her Kindle, and seems well built. My other daughter ordered one too.
B0001I561E|5.0|Awesome movie!  Even though a few changes were made, it was a great movie and I just had to have it in my Disney Collection!
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|Set up was easy--just plugged it into my Surface Pro, and it works. I haven't formally tested the speed, but it seems fast enough. Can't ask for more than that at the price.
B00BHU2A7I|3.0|Some serious make-up issues detracted from the movie att the beginnig. I'd say this was a soft soap of Hitchcock. Would not recommend to friends but would not discourage either. Definitely would not buy and would wait for Netflix or RedBox.
B00BHU9BV6|4.0|Very creative interpretation of the book. It would have been very hard to follow if you didn't already know the plot line though.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is totally five stars! This is the 4th best book I've ever read except for the hunger games series.<br />This book is about an11 year old boy named August Pullman. He was born with a facial deformation, has had 27 surgeries, an  is about  to face a big challenge. August will be attending Beecher Prep school next season. He faces many<br />Challenges, but it turns out ok. I hope there will be a second book of this!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|There is nothing not to like. Castle has murder and mayhem with dignity and humor. The interaction within the  entire cast and their personal lives in the series is great to watch.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I felt this book was entertaining and a quick read. Loved the romantic story line as well as the life choices that the characters had to make.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It's a great app for Bible study and keeping multiple versions of the Bible handy. I find that I study better and more thoroughly when I use it. PLUS it's always with me on my mobile devices and stays synced on all of them.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I wasn't sure how I felt about  this show when I first started watching it. I found that I didn't like a lot of the characters at first, I found them snobbish or cold and calculating. Even though I didn't like some of the characters, there were some stories within the show that just kept me coming back. I'm glad I did, because I can't think of any character I dislike anymore. I enjoy seeing how things may have been back in the early 1900's, the interaction of the different classes, the drama, the love stories..<br /><br />I am sad that I got through Season 2 only to find that Season 3 is not free on Amazon prime. I guess I will have to go check Netflix..
B000MRAAJM|5.0|They sent it as described and it got here on time. Doesn't come with the extra documentaries but knew it wouldn't and didn't care.
B0012CH350|5.0|At first I was sent an 18 1/2 inch cover but my kettle requires the one that is 22 1/2 inches.  It was replaced with the new one and looks so nice and not some black garbage bag look that I have sported before.
B008D36INE|2.0|This was an empty story of selfishness.  No redeeming meaning to story.  No reaspn for caring about these characters.  No good feeling about spending the time watching it.
0307591549|4.0|I've read this book twice, highlighted the heck out of it, purchased it for my clients, and recommended to a number of others--including my wife who teaches elementary age children (where (education) it is directly applicable).  If you've watched the TED video, this book provides the substance and details behind his video. The quality of his writing is excellent and the research and stories the author describes supports his thesis and experience. This is a quality read -- I'd highly recommend.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I loved the show when it first aired on television.  I missed a lot of the episodes, so it is great to be able to see them all at my leisure.
B009HV2JT8|2.0|I read the book, I was disappointed in both. I am from a Southern state, and I didn't care for the stereotypical portrayal of completely evil southerners, being vampires, drinking the blood of the innocent.<br />I comprehend the definition of fiction, but it still bothered me.<br />The special effects however, were terrific.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My 6 year old loves everything horses.  She got a child friendly tablet for Christmas and asked if I would put some apps on it for her.  I found this one and she is hooked.  She wakes up in the morning and wants to check on her horse before she goes to school.  I think as an adult you might lose interest quickly in the game but for kids it is perfect.  They earn money and gems or taking care of their horse, their stall and competing in jumps.  They then buy cool things for their horses with what they earn.  There is also a button to take pictures of your horse while it is playing.  My daughter must have 1,000 pictures of her horse :)
B009SJ3GUK|1.0|This is a horrible show. I was actually interested because I watched the first season in the haunted house. This one reminded me of &#34;SAW&#34; or &#34;TEXAS Chainsaw massacre&#34;...In this case, I am just not gonna watch medical torture. Yuk
B00BUL171O|1.0|Idk what Wayne was thinking putting out a record this bad. I can't believe I actually bought this hot pile of crap. Whatever happened to the dude that made classics?
B005MSD6QU|4.0|I enjoyed it-I will probably purchase another episode soon. Nice to have for when I miss something  I really like.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app so much I am all ready level 41 and I started on March 29 and it is March 31!PS Duck Dynasty Rocks!!!!
B00BSBY38A|5.0|I loved it, so did my kids {13 &19}.<br />We kept watching it over and over again and again.<br /><br />Bonnie
B004X75RCW|3.0|It's not my kind of movie.  It was funny and my wife loved it (she even cried a little).  Great date night movie.
B00BHU261S|5.0|Loved it but I love anything that has to do with Alfred Hitchcock.  I love all his movies, and it was nice to see into his life.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|if is very very very very very very very very very very very very  awesome. it is so cool.it is so so fun.
B004SUWR2C|4.0|Love this game Play it all the time.  My kids even play it when they get on my kendel.<br /><br />Bonnie
0765325950|4.0|The cover looks to be in line with the rest of the covers as far as artistic taste.  I personally would like a little variation there, but that's no biggie.  Book is heavy.  But that's to be expected.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love it am so hooked on it can't go a day without getting on it.<br />Hubby hates it.<br />Bonnie
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Like usual, Sparks' book kept my attention and I wanted to read it straight through. I always feel good after reading his books. No surprises, but good.
B0096HIEE2|5.0|We realy loved this movie, watch it all the time.  He can realy move. Matt needs to quit he looks too old school like he is from the 70's.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Cannot get much better than George R.R. Martin.  So detailed and unbelievably addictive.  A must read for anyone who hasn't watched the show yet.
B005NFVZTM|5.0|If you love X-Men you really have to see this. I was completely surprised by it because I was actually set to not like it, but it won me over. And a famous actor gives a stellar performance!
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I was playing this game while waiting for my husband to finish PT.  The time just flew.  I love playing--it's addictive!
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|Very interesting and entertaining.  You definitely need to pay attention in order to follow the movie.  Great acting by Daniel Day Lewis as Lincoln.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in a portrayal of politics during the Civil War and the abolishment of slavery.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This was a great movie!! I loved it! It was hilarious and had good music! I would watch it over and over. Perfect for girls night!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Typical Nicholas Sparks book - Makes you feel good-easy relaxing read- no need to stay up half the night because you have to see what happens. Really neat ending!!
B00B7G3Y4U|2.0|I've watched the previous 3 paranormal activity movies and this was by far the worse. There were a few moments when I jumped by overall it wasn't scary at all. The ending was horrible. Very disappointing!
B009G41CG2|4.0|One of the things I would change on this game is to have more options such as hints and reshuffle the tiles.  It's not an easy game therefore, it is challenging at times.
B006G3D0SO|5.0|Well it may be a bit scary for the really young...but 5 and up I think would love it! I saw this movie when I was a kid and it became one of those movies to transcend age...still love it today. If you haven't taken the time to see this movie...do...especially if you have kids. Watch the original again...then pop in this one...
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The attention to detail - the fashions - the settings - the storyline itself, the 2 &#34; families&#34;, as we come to know them. Outstanding!
B00BETX5PS|4.0|I have been a Bond fan since I was very young...loved all the gadgets and villains. I know the new Bonds have drifted away from the gadgets and iconic villains to a more gritty/darker story line...which isn't a bad thing. I was happy to see they reintroduced Q and Money Penny...and hope in the next installment reinstates some of the awesome gadgets once again.<br />I thought Skyfall filled in a lot of back story to who Bond is and where he came from. Overall I was entertained and pleased with the end result.
B004UID2LC|4.0|Program works great but the process to Search and Download are not obvious and easy to get to.  Recommend for an average user.
B00BHMF578|4.0|I wouldn't say that I was blown away with this movie...I don't know if it lives up to all the buzz!
B0054XOMX4|5.0|This is.  Great bey it can stand against strong attacks... this is a must buy bey! So get this bey!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My wife have really enjoyed the Downton Abbey series...well produced, great characters, and interesting story line. All the buzz is noteworthy...any hesitation should be dismissed...give it a go.
B004NOH9LC|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie! It was fun and I love all the actors and actresses!<br />I would watch it again!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|My wife have really enjoyed the Downton Abbey series...well produced, great characters, and interesting story line. All the buzz is noteworthy...any hesitation should be dismissed...give it a go.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent book, great portrayal of characters, would recommend  Book to those of appropriate ages. Can't wait for second book in the series!
B00AA7O6QC|2.0|Well the movie in general sucked...but found it fairly comical at times. The fact they wrangled up all the iconic action stars was impressive...what wasn't impressive was their acting and the story line. The over the top kill count was actually funny...I lost all interest in the movie...but decide to start counting how many people got killed about 1/4 the way through. I lost count at one point but I was at around 200...but doing a little bit of research...approximately 489 people end up in body bags. So if you are bored...you could turn this into a interesting drinking game. Hopefully this is the last we will see of the Expendables!
B00008PX8P|5.0|I loved this DVD, it had some of the most legendary performances from one of the most legendary artist in rock & roll history
1933952806|5.0|I'm surprised I didn't write this review sooner, but this is simply the best user's manual replacement I've ever read.  Darrell knows his Nikons and really knows the D7000.  Now, I'm waiting for him to write one for the D7100.  I'll still keep this book, as much of it is relevant to my new camera.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|this game is great fun. can't put it down. have already completed village once. playing a second time and still thoroughly enjoying it.
B008Q0D9DG|5.0|All-around great. Charlie Sheen is fabulous, Tom Berenger is just right in his catcher's gear, Bob Uecker delivers classic announcements, and the Allstate guy/Pedro Cerrano is hilarious along with Jobu. I've seen it at least 20 times and I'll see it another 20+.
B003TTMFCK|5.0|I love this show! Yang is my favorite of everyone, I think - her character is so dynamic, and it has been interesting to see the progression.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|This is easy to use, large enough to see. Have told friends about it, and many have gotten it and like it.
B004E2XAFW|5.0|That audio track, coupled with the Isle of Mann TT Motorcycle footage makes for compelling and rocking music. Ck them both out.
B006FTCH2E|5.0|I often thought if I could go back and change one thing what direction my life would take.  What would that Cindy look like?  Would I like her?  What would I say to her?  Some might think it was slow and boring but I can't wait to watch it again.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone willing to give it a chance.
B00BI745AA|5.0|Kindle did you proud on this one.  Color, sound, acting and music made this an exceptional view.  wish I could have streamed it onto my TV.
B005UKJX4E|5.0|I wrote a longer review on another site but I begged three people to watch this movie and they were not disappointed.  It makes for good discussion afterward.  Please watch this movie if you like to think.
B0034G4OUO|4.0|well this movie is pretty awesome. Glad to see that the rock is getting better and better in his films.
B004XVN1T4|5.0|Loved loved loved it I am going to be reading alot more Ken Follett books excellent story teller and writer in my opinion
B0091W7K6K|5.0|Great movie could probably watch it everyday and not get tired of it.the mustang , the charger 1960's San Francisco very nostalgic.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a cool app that makes navigating the Bible easy.  Much easier than getting from location to location in m Kindle.
B0000TG9E2|5.0|Wonderful story to see over and over I was very glad to upgrade my VHS collection with this timeless tale.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This was truly a great read even if virtually impossible. My only criticism would be the way the wife handled the whole problem of her husband just walking away across England to deliver his message in person.
B001JRB16U|5.0|Wonderful story to see over and over I was very glad to upgrade my VHS collection with this timeless tale.
B00AN0KBJC|2.0|I mistakedly orderd the non HD version of Game of Thrones. the Quality is very poor, so I ordered the HD version I do not need both versions,<br />can I get my money back for the non HD version as I have the HD version now?
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This book was okay. I have read much better books by Grisham. It was not really suspenseful. It took awhile for me to understand the plot. I gave it a chance though and when I was reading towards the end  around 70 percent finished, is when the book became interesting.
0061733199|5.0|I bought this book for my husband who is as serious about prepping as I am about my food storage efforts. He loves this book! He has gained so much useful information that he did not know from reading this guide and we highly recommend it for anyone trying like we are to cover all bases for emergency survival and prepping. This book is full of valuable tips and information.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|😭😭😭👍😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭ITS SO SAD OMG I LITTERATLY CRIED OMG RIDELY COME BACK TO THE DARK SIDE AH AH AHHH AH RIDELYYYYY
B0079J27SS|4.0|I'm not what you would call a Klemperer enthusiast, although I've several recordings of his Beethoven(the EMI Missa Solemnis, symphonies 3 (stereo version) and 9, and Brahms (symphonies 1, 4, the German Requium), but I confess I'd pigeon-holed him and his style with EMI in his later years as monumental in the best cases or simply \\"ponderous\\" in others(e.g. the Mendelssohn Symphony #3).  For some reason I'd never heard these recordings of the last Mozart symphonies, but having now done so I admit freely that they are now among my favorites.  There is no ponderous posturing here, rather an alertness to structure but with often fleet tempi which allow the performances to breath while as true allegros.<br /><br />I agree with many of the other reviewers that EMI's DSD SACD remasterings have helped give both more spaciousness and truer instrumental timbres..especially in the higher registers,  where it is now a pleasure to discern individual combinations of flutes and oboes, trumpets and violins...especially at mezzo forte and quieter sound levels. That said, it seems that Walter Legge and his engineers prefered an upper balcony perspective rather than say one from the orchestral seats, with the result that much in the lower registers (=cellos, double basses, bassoons,  low level percussion) is lost or simply hinted at in a way that loses much of the \\"guts\\" of the Philharmonica...a wonderful ensemble, even at forte or louder sound levels. The only way these sounds might be heard would be through more radical re-equalizations (e.g.  a la Pristine) but at the possible cost of compromising the producer's original vision.<br /><br />Still,everything considered, especially at the very low prices this and other EMI SACD sets are being marketed, one should be thankful and hopeful of additional SACD releases from the EMI vaults in athe future.
B0095MVOMC|5.0|I had Hidden Letters and enjoyed it so much I got the Hidden Numbers too.  I enjoy them emensly as does my 5 year old grandson.  I would get more if they were available.
0525953728|5.0|I thought this book was a great read and gives one more appreciation for our soldiers. I couldn't put it down.
B008476HBM|5.0|I love Pride and Prejudice, have already read it several times in my life, and am happy to have permanent access to it on my Kindle!
B005D9MUWY|4.0|I wish that there was a 4.5 star review. This keyboard is great but not perfect. It will get the correct word 95% of the time but I still occasionally have to fix the words. That said, it's much better than the stock keyboard and I recommend it.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|It's a great game for kids and adults. I enjoy playing it with my kids. We enjoy it very well.
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|My daughter watches this DVD over and over again! :) Keeps her entertained! If she is happy, I'm happy. :)
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love the challengers set up in the different series as you progress to higher level games in each set. I was over 60 yrs. old when I first learned to play this game. I'm now over 70 yrs. old & still getting a big kick when I play these games. I am always trying to promote other seniors to start trying to play the games in this series. Some are intwerested, some not! I'm hooked! Thanks
B006O6F932|5.0|My daughter loves this toy! :) It is a great addition to her Monster High Dolls that she has. :)
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I enjoy the variety of challengers offered in the variuos levels.<br />The different attack modes for the Bird varieties.<br />Would recommend this to all age groups,especially seniors who enjoy a sporting game challenge.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book really amazed me. I had heard the movie was good and decided to read the book. I was hooked from the beginning. I couldn't believe how much I connected to Pat, his innocence initially mixed with his sudden mood was so well written I thought for sure the author was describing me. By the end I was in tears. I trust me this 6'1\\" 300 pound man has never done that while reading a book. During certain time it really brought back the same feeling I had when I read The Perks of Being a Wallflower when I was 14.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I may always choose the winning deal selection ( not always) but I can still get defeated with this selection. I use the undo arrow frequently to try to make a better choice on cards to play but that dosent always work out! No negative comments I love this game too!
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Entertaining little game. :)  I really like the sound effects and graphics.  My daughter likes how the dinosaurs react when you touch them
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love the size ...that it fills up my kindle screen...&amp; being able to have it with me always...useful &amp; practical!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I give Doctor Who a 5 star rating because who don't like Doctor Who it's one of the best series from BBC. Although I admit it gets better in later seasons. Anyone who is a fan must watch the first season after all it's free if you have Amazon Prime!
B00280LYIC|4.0|At first I thought Percy Jackson was over rated but trust me he's not. And I'm excited for the sea of monsters.
B005KELQEU|2.0|Wanted protection for my Kindle while at the beach, do not want to remove the cover I already have.  Sleeve will not fully zip.
B0097HSS4M|1.0|It's hard to review something you did not get.  It does not show up in my Kindle List of applications.  It shows up in my cloud acct that it was purchased.  I even tried to DOWNLOAD IT AGAIN AND IT SAID I HAD ALREADY PURCHASED ON THE 27th.
B0058O84G0|3.0|The first part of the book was great but did not realize when I bought it that it was a war story.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Great game. It has a crazy mix of classic games that are mixed together in creative ways. The tetris style stuff is tough.
B004YXE438|5.0|My first spectrum puzzle, and I love it.  The puzzles and all of the different available levels of difficulty are fantastic.  I haven't even counted the number of puzzles, let alone how many variations.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This was only fun to watch.  Great acting.  Interesting plot lines with historical context.  Can't wait to see the next season.
B005LAIIGC|3.0|I love this movie, so when I bought it it definitely wasn't for the eggs. However, I was disappointed when I found it delivered to me and the eggs were not jumping like they were suppose to, the kiddo I nanny for was very disappointed.
1442362901|5.0|I really enjoyed The Presidents Club, it had a lot of information I did not know previously. It's well written and I would recommend it to anyone who likes to read about presidential history.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I was aware of &#34;Falling Skies&#34; when it debuted, but for some reason never watched it, until I saw it on Amazon.<br />It is an outstanding series.  I am almost through season 1.<br /><br />It has been renewed for a 3rd season, starting June 9th.  (TNT put out a teaser for this, but since I haven't seen season 2 yet, I am avoiding that trailer, to avoid spoilers).  I do plan to be get caught up on Amazon Prime, before season 3 starts.<br /><br />If you have watched the reboot &#34;V&#34; and felt that it was just a little shallow, and characters were too stereotypical...then &#34;Falling Skies&#34; is the show that you have been waiting.<br /><br />In a lot of ways, I find &#34;Falling Skies&#34; to be more similar to &#34;The Walking Dead&#34;, than it is to &#34;V&#34;.  For example, while the premise is about a massive collapse of society due to aliens or zombies, respectively...aliens and zombies are the focus of the show.  Both of these shows focus on the survivors, how they band together, tear each other apart, and human desire to survive in the face of obstacles.<br /><br />Spoiler alert:<br />The character of Pope is just so brilliantly written and acted.  He is the archetype of someone you don't want to like, but is just so well acted that you do have to like him.
B009AMANBA|2.0|Well he is not the Lincoln that I had visioned in my mind. BUT to me Sally Field stole the show and should have gotten the Oscar.  She was great and moving as Ms. Lincoln. The movie moves a bit too slow for me, maybe I am spoiled by the high action and thrillers you see so often now but I thought it a bit boring.  It all seemed a bit fabricated and sometimes over done to make a point. The more I think about it the less I like it. I wish I had rented it instead of buying it.  Oh well.................. Don't you make the same mistake.
B0036S4C6G|4.0|Lots of good real life experiences to relate to, especially in terms of aging!!  Each chapter is a story in itself but they're all interwoven.  Kind of difficult to read on Kindle because I wanted to keep checking back and that's not easy.
1609613937|5.0|Great book.  Makes a lot of sense.  Tried it and felt great, but also felt my body needed animal protein.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|After so many people raved about the series we had to try it.  We're already on Season 3 which I also got on Amazon.  The quality of the DVD is excellent and the scenery beautiful.  Don't miss it!!
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  It is one book in a trilogy.  The character was very resourceful.  the book was well written and was definitely a page turner.
B000FCKIFU|5.0|From the 1st page, it is a riveting story. I could almost see the prior and places the characters were in. I love the action scenes and the back stories. Kept my heart pounding for the last few chapters!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Ya know,  this game is very fun and I love it butttt one thing,  I GOT TO OVER 2MILLION POINTS ALL BY MY SELF THEN THE GAME JUST DELETED ALL MY PROGRESS!!!!!!! I was so mad! and still am because I cant get that high again!!! I have been trying FOREVER so I got mad and threw my kindel across the room and started throwing a tantrum... (and I'm 13)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway suffers is a amazing game but you can get addicted to it after a while. So have fun and always win.And tune in for the mystery box
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Great purchase.  Great series!  I'm not sure what the difference is that sets this set apart as &#34;original UK version&#34;, but we have really enjoyed this series.  Will be looking for season 3 soon.
B000QQH4YS|5.0|PART MAN<br />PART MACHINE<br />ALL COP.<br />Robocop is an intense, exciting flick that is bada** at every turn. Murphy is a good cop cleaning up the mean streets of Detroit. Unfortunately, the first day he is teamed up with a new female cop, Murphy is brutally murdered by some punk thugs after a high speed chase. With the magic of science and medicine, he is resurrected and still a cop - a Robotic cop created by an organization called OCP. Robocop becomes the new unstoppable crimefighter in town, but is constantly haunted with shallow memories of his past life and before his death. Robocop set out on a big mission to find the bad guys that killed him. I am personally not a huge sci-fi fan, but really like action movies with Sci-fi thrown in like \\"Predator\\", so if you're an action or sci-fi fan pick this up.<br />Some general info about the packaging:<br /> -comes in a steelbook  case<br /> -has the original and extended versions each on 1 disc (the extended just contains secondsworth of violence that had to be cut from the R-rated version such as the Ed-209 overkill among minor others).
B00BI5IXL4|4.0|Les Miserables is one of the best movie musicals i have seen in years. I highly say buy it and enjoy.
B000VYNYN0|5.0|Hi i'm reviewing Evil Dead streamed from Amazon Instant video, not the blu ray or dvd because Amazon always mixes the reviews of similar but different items together. This is my first review on here, so I will make my point. Evil Dead is a scary and shocking movie about a group of college students vacationing in a cabin in the woods, who stumble upon an old book called \\"The Book of the Dead\\" and accidentally summon demons. All HELL breaks loose -literally, from there as Ash (the main protaganist played by an early Bruce Campbell) tries to save his girlfriend and buddies from the evil powers lurking in the woods! This movie has lots of good gore effects and really creeped me out. There is no comedy thrown in here like what the sequels Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness had. You should start here if you have never seen the series before, Plus a remake is coming into theaters soon, produced by the original director and main actor. Check it out!
B0058ZPNOK|5.0|Such a great movie that takes a metalhead squatter and throws him into a broken family and through his shoot now and shoot again latter attitude teaches this family how to be a family again and live for what you have not what you had. Just phenomenal movie that makes you laugh, cry, and cringe.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Loved it! I was very emotionally connected with the narrator. I felt all of his emotions and this book was perfectly written.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|The Tudors Seasons are Great to watch. We like it. The Tudors Seasons are Great to watch. We like it.

B003M6EAXM|5.0|What a good show, we'd seen the original when it aired, but missed this season, we extremely happy to see it on Amazon!
B002ZG976U|5.0|I really enjoy this film.  I like all of the performers and their performances, the musical numbers and oh that Christina...fantastic!
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|This by far is Justin's best cd.  He is expanding his style...he sounds so much better as he has grown up.  I couldn't be any happier with this CD...all the songs on it are GREAT!  I have played it over and over again since purchasing it.  It is wonderful.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|The plot is a surprise. The photograph is amazing. Good acting and well told story.<br />To conquer ones fears, to face the challenges, to be victorious!
B003M6OW4Y|4.0|It's TV that doesn't go where you expect and it gets there with a great story and characters that really develop over the course of 2 short seasons.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I wasn't too kind in my review of season 1! Simply put...I didn't get it! My husband insisted on continuing to watch the series an I am forever grateful as I am now hooked. I love it, so much so that I have every intention of rewatching the first season and I am sure my opinion will be much different the second time around?<br /><br />I don't feel as if the writers are just going for the shock factor in this season, although it is certainly there!  Character development is also very strong in this season and the plot constantly leaves you wanting more! Rick and the rest of his gang are certainly intriguing, but so are the undead.  We are hooked and as season three is currently on air and drawing to a close I will by buying that one too and eagerly waiting for season four.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I missed the final episode of Downton Abbey, and was so happy that I could watch the one episode that I missed here.  I am a recent convert and I had purchased the first two seasons earlier.  Now I'm all caught up.
B002UWH8P6|5.0|After a few slow episodes, SGU really picked up and delivers surprises with great story telling. Too bad it got canceled so early in its blooming style. I guess a casualty to anything that requires a little thinking.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I have never enjoyed a television series more than this one.  I wish there were a dozen more seasons to watch.
B000OZ0NXA|2.0|I was was led to believe the Child books, and this first one in particular, were quite good. Not so much. At the end of the day it's poorly researched and sort of corney.  I'd say maybe a C- , not impressed.
6305428522|5.0|The clever and talented Robert Redford directed this engrossing snapshot of the decay of American moral standards with television quiz shows as the vehicle. Set in the McCarthy era and into the sixties the central character Charles Van Doren (excellently played by Ralph Fiennes) - a privileged, WASP university professor, applies to be a contestant on &#34;21&#34; and on discovering the show is rigged, makes the decision to play on for fame and fortune, agreeing to be supplied the questions and then just the answers. A disgruntled ex-champ, hilariously played by John Turturro, exposes the con when he is forced off the show to make room for Van Doren and then is dumped and ignored, having squandered his corrupt winnings on a poor investmnet. The decline and exposure of Van Doren begins. The brilliant Paul Scofield plays Van Doren's distinguished and unimpeachably honest and dignified, rich and famous poet father (a similar character to Sir Thomas More in &#34;A Man For All Seaons&#34;  for which Scofield won an Oscar as Best Actor in 1966)
B008GOG98Y|1.0|We are not a family that chooses to subject ourselves to &#34;entertainment&#34; that uses language that we deem inappropriate.  The characters in this movie used the Lord's name in vain multiple times in the first 5 minutes.  We turned it off.
B007L96SI6|5.0|She has an amazing voice  She has a great career a head of her.  Strong and powerful voice. Looking forward to a follow up CD.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I could not put this book down, and I certainly hope that Mr. Howey plans for more stories of Silo 18 and the world around it. Other reviewers talk about the tedious reading of the traveling up and down the main stairway, but I think it gives the reader a much greater sense of the enormity of the silos and the different levels. I really enjoyed this series! I want to read more! Such a nicely done book!
B000FA5SMK|5.0|Very good intro book, Mr Corey never waynes in his humor. More of a man's book, point of vew. Great read!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I really love the hobbit, I have read the book many times as has all who start enjoying this series.  Can't wait for the next two movies.  Would love to see the Belgariad on film.  Oh I shiver to think of it.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|Half comedy and half drama but blended well. I don't think this one is for the 20-something crowd. Good movie.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|Nothing brings me back to game other than boredom for some other reason. It's free so not a bad deal...
B005GIS1WA|5.0|Got this for my wife who is an animation fan and she loved it. Six more words required for this.
B001UGB1X8|5.0|I love this movie. Tommy Lee Jones and John Goodman were outstanding!  Awesome! You have to watch it, it will have you drawn in within the first few minutes!
B00003CWOL|4.0|If you like action and violence, this is your movie. It is an older film and this was a re-viewing for me. Lots of action and violence throughout with a less than satisfying ending and reason for the movie. But Selma Hayek is always worth a watch.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I barly got this game today and I love it.i've only been playing this game for a little while and I'm hooked<br />with s.vs.z.d. buy this app!
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|It's understandable that this story was split into two movies. And, &#34;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey&#34; is definitely worth viewing on its own. But, if I had it to do over again, I'd wait until I could have both &#34;Unexpected Journey&#34; and &#34;Desolation of Smaug&#34; in hand before watching them; so I could watch them together.<br /><br />After watching &#34;Unexpected Journey&#34;, waiting to watch &#34;Desolation of Smaug&#34; is excrucio..., er, excruciating!
B008YKGQR4|5.0|This is a good app and I use it often, It is nice to be able to communicate with others
B00BUI6D2A|1.0|This could possibly be the worst thing I've ever heard, so bad I think Lil' Wayne needs a thorough psychological examination. He definitely is not a human being, he's a retarded alien sent from the planet douchebag to kill what's left of rap. Every song is nothing but a cluster of curse words and derogatory statements over a beat. This CD is beyond stupid.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|This is a good app and helps you find anything you are looking for and that's all I have to say
B00BSBY38A|4.0|It was an interesting movie....I was expecting it to be a boring one but it wasn't...watch it and you will see
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love this game I have it on my computer,  and on my kindle fire and on my cell phone
B00BESLT6G|4.0|It wasn't what i expected it to be...it wasn't scary at all..part one is still better....but its a good movie
B001N3GUIE|5.0|either you are a fan of this genre<br />or<br />you're not<br /><br />i've seen this movie a hundred times if once since i was a kid!!!
0345803493|4.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2WOWI0Y89V7Z2]]One Minute Review
B00846REIS|5.0|GREAT book!! I never wanted to put it down.. I haven't found a book that kept my interest like, Bared to You!!
B00ARAN9JW|3.0|I've loved these movies to this point, but I had to say that this one should really be the last. Milla is still awesome, but the story line is just getting plain silly. Worth a watch for fans who want to see what happens after the cliffhanger ending of the last movie, but let's, uh, let it go, folks...
B00B2V66VS|3.0|it was awesome but then the tutorial came on and I have to go through the whole tutorial every time I play. also when I crash it freezes up and I cant get back to the home page.  PLEASE FIX!!!!!!
B007HC3LHS|5.0|A harrowing account of domestic and psychological abuse of an intelligent and educated  woman, who after what seemed like many months, to plan an elaborate escape from her lover, a sadistic sociopath.  And, he was indeed, a monster.  One can only imagine the hell that caused her to finally run, despite her many obstacles.  She was  OCD,  which probably attributed to the state of numbness that enveloped her,  and he was a cop.  A very corrupt one who had many friends and allies in powerful positions.  So she did, with the help of very few friends,  and a push and a shove from an acquaintance, after her numbness  deteriorated to the point that she realized that if she wanted to stay alive,  she had but only one choice, or possibly die, or at the very least sustain  catastrophic physical and emotional trauma.  This is both deeply disturbing and riveting,  (not for the faint of heart).  Once you start reading,  it grabs you and never lets up.  Elizabeth Naughton takes you on this extraordinary literary journey with Catherine Baily.  You will be afraid for her,  you will cry for her, you will admire her extraordinary bravery,  and she will inspire you. This gripping and incredibly written book will undoubtedly stick in your mind for a very long time.  It was well written and edited.  Sleeping With the Enemy and Safe Haven pails in comparison.
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|I marvel at the creativity and collaboration of these three extremely talented songwriters!  Have always had Kenny Loggins in my music collection.  Glad to add Georgia Middleman and Gary Burr.
B0025UHKNS|3.0|I've owned a garmin 410 for several years now and all ive had to do is replace the wristband which was fairly easy to do. The reset button is starting to go, now I have to press it harder for it to reset my runs which is unfortunate. I bought my sister one of these because she is an up and coming that im proud of. Upon arrival the watch worked great! After several runs the reset button on the side refused to come back out which was such a shame because it worked so well. I must say I am very pleased with Amazons prompt return service. They immediately sent me another watch and payed the return shipping for the malfunctioning one. Excellent customer service, if Amazon keeps it up they will be my main source for shopping! Thanks Amazon!!
B00ANVX6DY|5.0|Our daughters are 3 & 6 and they both LOVE this show. We record the series on cable and watch them together as a family. It is a very good show. Sofia the First: Once Upon a Princess is the 1 hour movie that set the series up and now there is a 1/2 hr series on the Disney Channel. We would recommended to any family with children of any age.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I absolutely love Dragon story I highly recommend it my advise is to get it strait away its very addictive like bakery story and pet shop story awesome fantastic fascinating brilliant
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Great story. One that makes you think about your own family and history. It makes you wonder how far you would go to protect your kids ( or other people's )
B00AGKHFCA|2.0|I own many of his CDs plus a couple of his DVDs.  The song selections on this CD do not do justice to his voice. I love his earlier CDs as well as his opera arias but this one is a disappointment. Sorry.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game is awesome and addicting!<br /><br />I find myself playing this alot.  It's great while watching TV or waiting somewhere.  I also take the bus to work so it keeps me occupied
B0061QD82E|5.0|New, still in plastic, and with reward code.  Very satisfied with my purchase.  And at a better price than walmart.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I was sad when the Percy Jackson books ended.  I absolutely LOVED them.  I totally love that this series is a continuation of the Percy Jackson books at a different camp with new characters.<br /><br />Such a great idea plus I am learning a bit about Roman and Greek History  (I have actually got a few jeapordy questions right from these books)<br /><br />Terrible cliff hanger at the end (I dont' want to ruin the ending for anyone so I won't mention what happened).  I read it on my Kindle and thought I had alot more to read and then I realized the book just ended and now I have to wait almost a year for the next book.
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|I found the first season to be outstanding, Other then them killing off my favor character and actor { Sean Bean }. I only watch the first 2 films of the second season so far. I find it to be just as outstanding as the first.
B000GCFY0I|4.0|At first I was turned off by the title because it sounded lame but after reading the sample I was hooked, now I can't wait for book two to see what happens.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|My sister and I knocked the whole season in a couple of days! I love SUPERNATURAL, I have watched every season so far and will continue to as long as they keep making them!
B0009MWEN0|5.0|love it ! got what i paid for now i can take this movie anywere i want,  love it yeah boy !
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This is a fun game it has super cute pets and it's fun to see the pets brothers and sisters.The mini games &quot;level&quot; the pets up.<br />1 through 5 I would rate this game a 77
B004RGHWIQ|4.0|Perhaps a little overrated, Coraline provides the viewer with great video in 3D, and a rather typical story of being careful what you ask for, you may get it!  Definitely enjoyable but not enough potential in the story for a repeat viewing. Recommended.
B005O64VH8|5.0|I am very fond of the duo Secret Garden, and all their CD's, including this one, have been great!  I hope they will come out with another soon.
B00B1E6FF8|4.0|Which surprised me. I thought this film would have a lot of replay potential, however, once is enough.  It leads off with a disturbing audio-only recount of 9-11, more disturbing in some ways than the actual horrific video. The balance of the flick moves at a rather rapid pace, quickly arriving at Osama's home.  Very little detail about Seal Team 6, the prep that went into the mission and the patriotism and heroism of those involved.  In fact, I found myself testing for 'fact' based on the 60-minutes interview with an actual team member.  In short, a good film, direct and to the point, perhaps a little light on the historical background.
B00B69UQEO|3.0|Just received the deluxe edition from Amazon, and it included two bonus discs and no album!  Did this happen to anyone else?  I would love to actually review the album, but I'll have to listen to it first.
B005DOKL3E|5.0|I just love this case it is AWSOME it is perfect and it is just big enough to hold my headphones also without scratching my screen
B00BR476TG|5.0|As soon as I saw this amazing short preview, I wanted to  see the entire The Life of Pi movie!
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|although these types of movies arent really up my alley, this did capture my attention although i did want to read the book first
B000SLP4SE|4.0|Couldn't resist the pun. It was suspenseful and I enjoyed the explosions. The story line was plausible and I like Marky Mark.
B0018OIK0E|4.0|more on the humorous side, it had a little bit of every thing in it, great for all types of people
B0054SMID0|4.0|Story was good, twists in the plot were good. Didn't see the mother coming... and Matthew McConaghey was a good actor, not just eye candy.
B00448SE4S|5.0|this movie was great weather you a chic or a dude. it had action romance and a good message behind it
B004T2QZL8|4.0|This game is very entertaining and fun!! Although I did have some problems with the game stopping every time I started up, but it's fine now, highly recommend for people who like puzzles!!
B004GBIE3Y|4.0|the more i watch movies with zach in them the more i like him, this movie has a little bit of everything in it for everyone
B006YTTVHO|3.0|The book has nothing new under the sun. What I like it the most was its direct language and its number of pages (short). The book is a good refreshment of some social interaction strategies.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Couldn't put It down so I recommend reading it when you have nothing else to do for a few days.
B005T87QCI|5.0|I like how you can create your own character.  AND I HAVE TO BE ABLE TO GET THE BEST GAME OF 2013.  MINE CRAFT IS 1st. Try making something like that.
B008YCMM2A|4.0|This CD is important in that it reveals the further transformation of Miles to the electronic and rock era. For me though, being an old fogey I guess, I still prefer the music displayed in the Europe 1967 tour, where I think, in particular, Hancock was playing at his finest. In comparison, the electric piano just doesn't and never did move me.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|My boyfriend and I loved Seasons 1 and 2 of Downton Abbey.  The characters are wonderful and there is just enough history to make it interesting, with a few overly dramatic turns of events within the characters lives.  Bravo!
B005HEPS6A|5.0|I have been a Star Trek fan for a long time and I still  find this series to be interesting and very relaxing.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Enjoyed the book from being to last.  Creative, strong and just wanted to keep reading.  Looking forward to 7, 8 and 9.
B00AE2IJIE|3.0|I did not see this in the theater when it appeared and thought I would give it a go when it appeared on Amazon Prime.  This film is too scary for a lot of little ones and seems pointless to us big ones.  I understand why they nominated it for an Oscar in animation and I also understand why it lost to Brave.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Sister Act used to be my favorite move.  Pitch Perfect is absolutely the best movie. Great sound, Great singing!! The bonus disk is excellent.  Overall, a very fun movie experience, gotta have it.
B005ES0ZDU|5.0|I have been wearing Crocs for years and these are the most comfortable pair yet. Very well cushioned, yet provides good support. The outer sole provides far better traction than the average Crocs sole does. Fit seems a little narrow that some other styles.
B0085OELXK|5.0|...better than the book, which I just re-read. Damon's performance as Tom Ripley is wonderfully sinister. The film also portrays the homoeroticism of the story with intelligence and clarity. The other performances, especially those of Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow, are spot-on.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote has so many options in creating to-do lists, even with check off markers, categories, and the ability to add photos! It syncs with all your android apps, so you can access your notes on your Kindle as well as your phone! Works flawlessly on both my Kindle Fire HD and my HTC Evo 4G! This is my most accessed app and would recommend to everyone!  (Note: this is the first review I've ever written and the first I've felt the need to share my opinion. That says a lot about how much I love this app!)
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|are u tired of no more fun games?do u wish they would invent super fun games?and finally.do u wish fun games did not cost money?if u answered yes to any of these questions u may want to think about getting this app.the main reason I got this app is because I was tired of my old apps.I recomed this app to everyone who answered yes to my questions.this app has so many levels.listen to me.this app is one of my favorite apps.get this app.NOW NOW NOW. *
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|If you saw the movie it's time to read the book.....this book brings you on a way different feel than Judy garland in wizard of oz.  If u  didn't see the movie...read this than see the movie, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, then see the movie, Oz.  Enjoy :)
0547884591|2.0|Clearly a sales pitch to sell his products...seemingly good advice but things are not explained well. Lots of sound bites and lots of boasting from him...look what I did, I'll give you a hint of how I did it but I'm not really going to tell you.<br /><br />For instance he tells you how to memorize long lists briefly. He doesn't clearly explain the principles enough for you to put them into practice. I read Darren Brown's book Tricks of the Mind and could use the technique within hours.<br /><br />Another example, he tells you that you can loose weight by eating 30 grams of protein within 30 minutes of waking up. He never explains why and so when I did research it clearly wasn't relevant to my case.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|you need to get this game if you don't have it.it will be like you own your vary own horse.
B0072NWJRK|5.0|I enjoyed this book and read it over two days even though I was reading another book at the time...a page turner. Well crafted story of an English girls disappearance and murder in Peking. As good as any fictional detective story that I have read recently.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Beautiful story, lovely easy read with a great storyline! Great characters that you get to know and love! I enjoyed every page!
B0063GORYU|4.0|Easy to  play. Great time filler. You are able to make it more challenging by changing the settings. Can't put it down sometimes.
B004WGIXX4|4.0|Im giving this movie 4 stars because it was good. At some point went a lil boring but I liked that the &#34;friends with benefits idea&#34; came from the girl not from the guy.<br />It was funny, the levels of sexuality were under control (meaning they didnt abuse on the scenes) and its kind of a &#34;current stream&#34; in our society.<br />I liked it very much and will recommend it.
B0001HAHXW|5.0|I read other reviews and then took a pinch of salt, bought this album then proceeded to love it so much I will probably wear it out! If you truly love the blues, Robert Johnson and Eric Clapton, you will love this recording! 5 stars to be sure!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|The reviews were all over the place on this film.  That can be a good thing sometimes.  I usually find when a movie is so hyped up that I get my expectations dashed when I finally see the movie.  I constantly find myself wondering what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />In this case, my expectations were not high.  I went into it with an open mind.  I am so glad I did.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this movie more than I can say.  I thought the casting was good with only minor issues.  I did not quite feel the tension between Javert and Valjean as I would have pictured it after a lifetime of cat and mouse.<br /><br />I am happy to see Helena Bonham Carter in anything.  She was made for the movie role.<br /><br />When you have people in these rolls who can really sing well, it makes those who cannot stand in deep contrast.  While Mr. Crowe's acting is not in question, his singing ability is sub par to say the least.<br /><br />Eponine, Marius, Cosette, Enjolras, Gavroche...all were spectacular.  Even Fantine was believable.<br /><br />I am certain I will watch this movie any times over.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My son loves this game, different from regular Angry Birds., more challenging. He is a big Star Wars fan to begin with so this game is great.
B001RHPJBU|4.0|If you are a fan of PC and 80's music you should definitely but this.<br /><br />I can't remember skipping any tracks. The album is on constant rotation.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|I hadn't heard good things about this movie but decided to watch anyway since the filming was at Maverick's. The story was put together well and moved quickly along. The filming was spectacular giving a sense of you are there. Definitely a film I could watch again.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I really like these search and hidden puzzle adventure games.this one has a nice mystic setting and good graphics.great story.
B00BF11STU|3.0|Maybe because I was watching at home with distractions. I found the torture scenes very tough to watch (no comment on the rightness or wrongness of this style of interrogation, tough to watch in a movie).  Couldn't follow how the information was put together as the years passed. The movie didn't flow well for me.  The ending at the safe house seemed way over extended. My understanding of the true events is that everything there happened very quickly. Not the best presentation of this subject matter.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Fantastic book with great mystery and suspense....Would recommend it to any one who loves murder mysteries with historical facts and emotion skillfully combined.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game very addictive.so glad its free. ive tried buying coins and all 3 attempts we not successful.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Loved this book two of the continuing story of the hardships that people went through during WWII.  Had a few too many war strategies and facts for me, would have liked it more if that had been held to a better limit.  Did learn however, more facts about the war, not just the families that were suffering through the tragedy.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I bought this for my father. He loves science fiction and fantasy movies so I thought he would like this one and he did.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|A Jodi Picoult page turner.  I have read many of her books, but this one was the best she has written in my opinion.  So into the characters and story that I couldn't stop thinking about them for several days.  It had an impact on me and what teens of today and their families face.  I would recommend this book to anyone that has a teenage daughter or son that think they are in love.
B00BYOEMTQ|4.0|It's a pity that this didn't come before the Trilogy.  As in the books, this is about the adventure, not the characters, so there is not a lot of depth (which is a pity, considering the quality of the actors). Unfortunately, the funding for this film probably only came after the success of the first three,  I will say that it's worth seeing for the New Zealand landscapes.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|this app is pretty amazing for being free! it works great to camouflage noises allowing the user to rest peacefully.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Awesome show - awesome DVD!  Great characters and writing is superb!  This show will go down in history as one of the best!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This game is great it is new to kindle and i love it. If your looking for fun and challang this is the game for you.
B005PK56TA|5.0|I LOVE AHS!!!! My friends convinced me to watch season one of AHS and I didn't think that it would be good and I was right..... It was AMAZING!
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|Im sorry but I just didn't see what all the commotion of this film was all about. It had great special effects, but was kind of slow for my tastes. Just wasn't as good as I expected.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show. It's great.  Lot's of spins, plus you do not need to love Zombies, but you walk away a zombie lover!
0316010669|4.0|Summary from my full length review - Giving us convincing arguments and examples to think differently and to focus on developing expertise as oppose to keep gathering more information. Good read overall. If you find yourself distracted into looking for the next holy grail easily, you need to read this book.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Unlike the honorable Mr.<br />Trump I first read the book.(Team of Rivals,by Doris Kearns Goodwin)I believe this was the best picture this year.It reveals that politics in any century makes strange bedfellows. Masterful performances by Tommy Lee Jones,Sally Fields,and David Strathairn. It is a story of how great men from intensely diverse backgrounds and beliefs came together for one common cause, to put an end to the scourge that was slavery. Should be part of every school systems American history program.
1400067936|3.0|Summary from my full length review - A strongly opinionated book that introduces the world to the importance of understanding randomness and how randomness is playing a role that is far greater than most people are willing to accept. It is one of the most important book of its time showing us how people under estimated risk and and over estimated their ability to handle future uncertainties. A thought provoking book for all traders, especially those who have not ingrained tight risk control in their mindsets yet.
B00650SSDU|4.0|It was a really good romantic movie, Mila was hot as usual and Justin was likable despite his boyband history.
B004XVMCPI|5.0|If you ever wanted to see what Soccer should be like then watch this movie. It is just great fun.
B005HV6Y84|4.0|We have all of the &#34;Twilight&#34; CDs, movies, and musical scores.  I am still most partial to the first CD for the music for &#34;Twilight&#34;--the first movie CD, but my daughter plays all of them on her Ipod.
B000I5X82E|5.0|Perfect music for how I was feeling at the time.  Good album if you want some loud meaningful music!  Get it.
1885167776|5.0|This book has literally changed my entire way of thinking!! It's amazing how just going one or two steps deeper into what you think might be your ONE thing will actually make the true ONE thing become so clear!<br /><br />It's almost too simple to be this life changing but it's pretty darn amazing!<br /><br />Love it!!! Easy Read!!!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|great game, a little nerve wracking though. lol i play while taking the train to work.  it makes time fly
B00BWGL6BS|5.0|Tracks 3/4/5/10 are the best!! I love how this album reminds me of her first one...I have all of her albums, and I love Dido forever. :)
B0018PH3L0|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  This is  a classic and will be a treasure in our collection. Love it!
B0038NN3B4|5.0|Well wrote and easy to understand. Yes I would  say that Dr. Atkins was way a head of most diets. It works and the book tells you why..
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Crazy Brits are addicting. Great show, great cast.  It took a few minutes to get my balance but after the first episode I was hooked.
B00571F26Y|4.0|Well wrote and easy to understand. Yes I would recommend. There will be lots more to come out about our food supply.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I liked the characters and the story.  Read this before you see the film. The plot is stronger and makes more sense. Touching! I enjoyed both the novel and the film.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|Ahh I can't believe it just ended!!! I was reading it on my Kindle and had no idea I was on the last few pages. Off to download book 2!!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Works well! Really addictive game and  great way to pass the time while you wait for whatever you are waiting for! Enjoy !
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I honestly did not think I would become hooked to this show.  I watched the first episode of season 1 and, maybe I didn't pay close enough attention, cause I wasn't impressed.  A few weeks after, I decided to watch the second episode and was hooked!  The acting is great.  The story-line intriguing.  And interesting to watch the way society was during this era in history, where the car and telephone were introduced into society, and WWI was happening, etc.  Can't wait to get my hands on Season 3 and then 4.
B00AP5Z2F8|5.0|I found this book to be an excellent guide for the beginner.  For more advanced users it may not be what you are looking for.  It helped me learn how to properly use my GoPro.  Do not let the &#34;Surf Edition&#34; part of the title put you off, the lessons can be applied to any GoPro use.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|This book kept me interested and is definitely insightful to what those dealing with mental illness go through. There were so many layers to the characters as you read you keep learning more.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|I was not to sure about buying this at first, but it has worked out very will.  Especially for lining up shots properly with the horizon or other reference points.  I just wish there was a way to shut it off after lining up the shot to save on battery power.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|this book kept my rapt attention all the way. I found it both deep and exciting.it was an adventure with strong god overtones
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Storyline is interesting and graphics are great.I recommend it for all ages. I look forward to the next Enigmatis. Big Fish games are 5 star.
B006TVQU6C|4.0|I bought this case as part of my first custom build.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Its cheap.<br />Mostly good construction.(see cons)<br />Side panel vent compatible with a 120 mm fan for increased air flow.<br />Enough hardware to mount and secure a full ATX board.<br />Front panel USB 3.0 ports and audio ports.<br />The case has some good basic cable management.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The left side panel appears to have been damaged or perhaps has a manufacturing defect because it is extremely difficult to remove. I had a very hard time removing it with one hand. I had to use two hands just to pull it forward and then had to physically pry it away from the case just to gain access in order to install my motherboard. The only obvious damage I was able to find is a gouge just below the bottom thumb screw hole. To re-install the panel is also rather difficult. The top slides in rather smoothly but the bottom has to be forced in before pushing it back into place and even then it doesn't fit perfectly flush. But, the right side panel comes off very easily and goes back on just as easy.<br /><br />One of the front panel 5.25 bay covers don't sit flush with the rest of the case. this isn't a big deal at all but just more of a picky observation.<br /><br />The rear PCI expansion slots,with the exception of the first one, aren't reusable. Once they're removed they cant be replaced. This is only a real problem if you accidentally remove the wrong one or if you change GPU's from a a two slot down to a single slot.<br /><br />They don't give you any extra standoffs, motherboard screws, or thumb screws. Which was a problem for me simply because I accidentally dropped a thumb screw and it rolled under the fridge, which was my own fault. But so long as you don't drop or strip any you'll be fine.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />All in all this is a really good budget case. I considered returning it due to the panel issue but i decided it wasn't worth waiting for a replacement since the restof case was pretty solid and I found that a pair needle nose pliers and a piece of tape to avoid scratching the finish can easily get the panel off. The only real con is the panel, but the rest of the cons I listed are only minor little things that aren't really a huge deal when dealing with a budget case. I just wanted to mentioned them so there aren't any surprises for any future buyers.<br /><br />I would defiantly recommend this case for those doing a budget build.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|We loved this movie since the first time we watched it, and my husband has watched it a few times since haha we love it and would definitely recommend it!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Could have provided more pictures that have been released in the media. Nothing like the movie either, way more in-depth.
B00BUL171O|1.0|I haven't actually listened to album yet, this is not a review of the album, just of this specific product / download. Why even sell a version that doesn't have the digital booklet download? its the same damn price and just makes me feel screwed for not seeing that there is a version with a booklet until after buying this.<br /><br />If you are going to buy this album then buy this for the same price and enjoy your pdf that comes with it.  http://www.amazon.com/Explicit-Deluxe-Version-digital-booklet/dp/B00BUL0IHI/ref=pd_cp_dmusic_0
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Season 10 storylines are better than ever pulling at my heart strings. As for buying and streaming it online, it is very convenient. I can access it from any computer, even my phone.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I have played this game through getting every star and had to delete and download again to replay. It's an awesome game. I want more levels.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Much more specific and far easier to read than the installed battery monitor. I like that it opens automatically when I'm charging my kindle. Plus, it's free.
B003VDY7XE|5.0|I am a bit SyFy fan and have enjoyed Haven season 1. I bought it to have something to watch while flying to Europe and got hooked. I will purchase further seasons for my next trip this summer(or probably sooner). The picture quality on my Kindle HD is excellent. It's not \\"horror\\" or \\"blood and guts gore\\", just enjoyable since fiction.
B009AMANBA|3.0|I had a tough time watching this great film because dvd stuck.  Label explains that this my happen, and it did.<br />With some adjustments with my remote, I was able to see all of it on my machine, which is an older model.  I will try it again on another player and hope for a better viewing.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|nice game for pass the time and the road and whith the others,shere and play it is ok and free
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|At first I thought it would just be a British soap opera but was extremely pleased to discover its superb writing & acting. A must-see for all.
B009ME47H2|4.0|It is very easy to use!  I like that I am able to record students reading stories and go back to hear it.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|The charge case is a great way to charge up the Voyager.  What a better way to keep it protected and charging at the same time.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|You hot homicidal blonde. The entire SOA series is good. Katey Sagal is amazing, far beyond Peg Bundy. Bikers have compassion and an endless supply of bullets...
B0081336FO|5.0|I have been a Holmes fan for years and the modern spin on this series makes it all new again.  Great watch!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|For all people who like my little pony friendship is magic you will all love this game . Especially for you bronies out there ! In this game you rebuild ponyville however you like , collect ponies ,and even play fun mini games ! I totally recommend this app to everyone who loves ponies ! ;)
B0057LUI0O|5.0|Great for the whole family. We couldn't find it in any store. I'm glad that we have it now for her on her Kindle.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I found the e-book version of the oxford dictionary quite useful<br />Though i wish it could skip to the letter you need
B001NA6096|1.0|No plot. Boring to watch. Too much just day to day conversation. I do not recommend this movie to anyone.
B00594XOZU|5.0|This app is really wonderful! Kik first searches your contacts for other kiksters and you can talk to them instantly. You can find other people by searching for their username and add more people to your conversation or be added yourself. Plus each message you send takes no time to be received by the other because you can see the message be &quot;sent, delivered, and then read.&quot; Another plus is that there are little emoticons you can send. Everybody should get kik because it is also very fast!
B000I9YXHY|5.0|Outstanding musical numbers and dance numbers. Very entertaining and well done. A must-see for any musical lover. Barbra Streisand is a very believable Dolly Levy.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I find this game very delightful once I figured out how to use the entrance directions, which were vague to me! I'm speaking about the levels etc.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Works just like Google should.  It is great having it on my Kindle Fire HD.  Use it all the time.
B00683JK9K|5.0|It's very entertaianing and the music is relaxing!  I like that you can increase the skill level.  It will be great for a plne trip.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I have never read The Hobbit books but have enjoyed the LOR movies and now the Hobbit. Regarding my opinion on the 3D DISC'S, Yes there is 2 disc's for the 3D's. The 2D is only one disc. The 3D had some crossover and blurring. However, there are some very clear 3D images and some rather poor. I think it's worth the extra mere $11.00 to pick up the 3D combo pack. I just purchased the \\"Prometheus\\" movie in 3D which was tremendously superior to Hobbit 3D. I have many 3D movies, some awesome, some awful. THEN THERE'S THE DARK SUNGLASSES!! I have shutter glasses with a 55\\" LED LCD Samsung 8000 model. I saw this movie in the theater providing passive glasses and there was noticeably less crossover. However my shudder glasses gave more depth at my home. In my opinion I find most theaters are considerably dimmer in contrast and brightness then a good quality LCD LED TV. Incredibly
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I am reading for the first time it is not just magazines. I love the style of Twain's writing, looking for Huck Finn next.
B009KEN87O|3.0|You know the drill, send them packing with blasts from your ship. Not groundbreaking in any way, but it's simple fun. Good way to kill some time.
0385537816|5.0|Tudo Perfeito, os livros chegaram em muito menos tempo do que eu achei que fosse levar para chegar. . .
B00BSBY38A|5.0|This is an amazing novel and the movie of it is a &#34;must see&#34; for everyone who has ever wondered if there really is a God.
B009FBX5M0|2.0|I am sorry to report that I found this score completely forgettable. It's all action cues and symphonic crescendos and thumping percussion. Sure, those are necessary to a soundtrack to accompany the film's action. But there is really no melodic theme you can grab onto, as on the classic Bond scores. I don't mean to be a purist -- I love not only the John Barry scores, but also the Bacharach and Conti, etc. They all have the required ups and owns, the character themes you can follow, and even the action pieces manage to refer to specific action. Thomas Newman knows how to compose music, of course, but here all I hear are action and menace, but no real subtlety. This music could have been used in almost any thriller -- there is no real Bond feel. The familiar theme is used once, maybe twice (it's so forgettable that I've forgotten), as a throwaway. There's just no soul to these compositions. I hate to write negative reviews, but I am so disappointed that I feel I need to say it. My God, there's more soul in Jerry Goldsmith's Flint music! And that was for spoofs! The inclusion of Adele's title song might have elevated the proceedings, but really I doubt it. This score might work for me as \\"writing music,\\" but it won't get that many pleasure listens. I guarantee that I still listen to many of the other scores for pleasure. I just don't get that feeling here. The last piece just peters out. There is no conclusion! There's very little connective tissue between the tracks. I sincerely wish I'd liked this a lot better.<br /><br />-W.D. Gagliani, author of Savage Nights
B00C1BUYX4|2.0|after i paid for hd i was told it's not compatible for streaming movies on a computer, so i had to watch the standard version (with horrible quality) without being refunded for my hd version payment.<br />the movie itself is good.
B007R108WA|4.0|We found this movie to be rather strange but very enjoyable and interesting.<br />Dustin Hoffman was amazing as usual, making his character extremely memorable.  Worth watching for sure!
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|i dont see this as a five star its cute and good story line and lot of action  with wreck it ralph as the hero  and the girl.
B0013LPS8E|5.0|It's U2.  What's not to like?  The quintessential rock hit, \\"New Year's Day\\" as the premier track.  In my judgement, one of the top 3 rock compositions ever produced.  Named the theme song for my Camaro SuperSport 2, all 427 HP of it.
B001EBROWQ|3.0|We know it's an old movie, but important details of the story were missing, and Jesus character was artificially performed.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfers is a fun way to pass the time and frequentley comes out with updates so you don't get bored.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|This game is rubbish and pathetic do not download it you will hate it very much so do not buy it you will pay the price it lots of money after you buy it
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I know that these are supposed to be &#34;teen&#34; books, but I thoroughly enjoyed reading this series and wished for more at the end of this one!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The graphics are better than I expected for a free game. I am on level 15, and I expected to have to buy gems but since I have been playing for so long, they gave me free gems. Now I have 117 gems.
4770030088|5.0|Item was as described and arrived as scheduled. My teenager is using this in class and finds that it is easy to understand the lessons.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer is an amazing app. Its the new temple run. You have to buy it . It is so fun. Buy it. Rate it. Love it.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|Great movie of one of the most famous musicals. Disappointed that the package was different than some purchased locally. Local packages had photos of the stars and a booklet about the making of the movie.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Action, suspense, drama and the detail the first 3 were missing. If you're a fan of the Lord of the Rings you will love this. Enjoy!!!!!
B003M6EAXM|5.0|So sorry to see this show end. It was exciting and at the same time nerve wracking. The cast did a tremendous job.
B00BF123WG|5.0|What a pleasant surprise to find out there is some great acting to go along with a very important story. There's definitely some parts that will not sit well with the squeamish but once you get past that you have a real story on your hands. In any other year this film owns the Oscars.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|This movie is great and I loved that it was in the package and shipped quickly!! So glad I got it.
B004SDEP38|1.0|I was looking for a word type app and as far as I can tell the only function is to organize files. Horrible disappointment!
B00AO2P3GA|1.0|But there are way to much cussing in the campaign , its friking anoying can u please just make a feature where u can turn the cussing off mutch less just the speech itself, i know i can turn off the sound effects, but i cant hear anything but the music, it is hard to play, please fix this. if u are going to make a cheep knock off of black ops 2/modern warfare make it so u can turn the cussing off, especially if u allow the player to turn off the gore in the first place. the game will b 5 star if this is changed, please consider.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|Absolutely one of my top ten movies of my lifetime.  Individuals that deal with the treatment of the dead are too often stigmatized.  This marvelous script/film not only illustrates the natural occurrence of death, but society's need to accept the compassionate disposition of our loved ones.  Tenderness and kindness go a long way to aiding those in grief.  Don't be surprise if you find some amusing moments along the way.
B000IJ79WU|5.0|Superman II the Richard Donner version  has more realism and is more like the first superman movie.The Richard Donner version and the Richard Lester version are alternate universe superman movies with different scenes and footage that are both like different movies. Richard Donner`s version has scenes that aren`t in Lester`s theatrical version like the magical kiss that makes Lois Lane forget that Clark Kent is superman in Richard Lester`s version.In Donner`s version it is superman flying faster than the speed of light around the earth to reverse time and going back in time and making Lois lane forget that he is superman.General Zod attacking a small town and the white house are a little different in both versions.Superman`s depowering and repowering scenes with his father Jor-el are better  in Donner`s version than with his mother Lara in Lester`s version .The molecule chamber where superman loses his powers and makes the three villains from Krypton lose their powers are better in Donner`s version and the fight in the diner where Clark Kent gets revenge on the truck driver bully that beat him up when he wasn`t superman is good in both versions.They should combine the best of both movies into one film.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|I really liked the book and want to read the others. I wounded what will happen to the orphans. I love this book
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|Easy to use, tons of genre choices, and musically more flexible than Pandora.<br /><br />You can tell people are watching out for their channels, not just an algorithm.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|I'm not the world's biggest Rod Stewart fan, but after watching his PBS special, I had to download the CD and I do not have any regrets.  I thoroughly enjoyed it this past Christmas and will enjoy it for many Christmas seasons to come.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|This is one of my fav. games in the series so far. It plays and looks great. However I wonder if or when they will release a free version of this one like they did with the rest. Seems its been out long enough that there should already be a free version. Alas this is not the case. At any rate its still a fun game with a spin.
B00BHMF578|5.0|be<br /><br />Best<br /><br />Best movie I've seen this year.  Although the tension is often high, there were great comedic moments.  The portrayal of Hollywood is worth the price.  And it only gets better.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|This is a very entertaining show.  I enjoy watching it.  What can I say it is &#34;star Trek&#34;.  I watch an episode a night.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Great film. They did a nice job of taking this terrific book (so if you haven't read it, do that first. And if you see the movie first, you should still read the book.) and turning it into a movie. It definitely deserved the many awards and accolades it has received. The dreamy or mystical quality is very appealing and enjoyable. A definite film you should not miss.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|This is a very interesting series.  It is not what I thought it would be.  I thought it would be like &#34;survivor&#34; but it is not anything near there.  I look forward to each new episode.  Very good acting, directing, producing, and writing.  Top notch.
B00BF11STU|4.0|This film is well done and still suspenseful even knowing the outcome! You won't regret taking the time to see Zero Dark Thirty.
B0045XICB2|4.0|As Bella is left alone, she tries to forget her one true love. The friendships beging to come together, and the characters grow emotionally.
B0099Y2MYK|3.0|This season, they didn't let you enjoy the victories for any length of time before they brought in huge tragedies.  Some even extreme tragedies.  They were so shocking that the feeling that we came away with was doom and anger.  We are very wary as to whether we want to see any more next season.
B000LGOPW2|5.0|Sleepy Hollow was a great movie.  Very suspenseful and interesting. I would highly recommend this movie.  Johnny Depp is awesome!
B004HX0P2Y|5.0|Great action, drama, and comedy.  It's hard to beat a film with Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren, Richard Dreyfuss, Mary Louise Parker, et al.  Helen Mirren never looked better than when she was behind a sniper rifle and a .50 caliber machine gun.  Even the late Ernest Borgnine had a great part.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|its not root explorer...but it works for looking at you sd card on phones and tabs...<br />simple interface- it works
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I'm reminded of the Mario Bros series of games with the coin catching and quick thinking required to maneuver through obstacles. Very fun game.
0393061310|5.0|This book truly changed my outlook on life and how we got where we are. I give it my highest recommendation.
B004J4WNL2|3.0|Check it out, very interesting read for any manager. Really helps you know how to build the right team .
B00BYOEMTQ|4.0|The title fits the movie.  If you like movies true to the book, then read the book.  If you love the hobbit books and find the adventure a real fantasy from the brilliant mind of Tolkien with added Peter Jackson then you will enjoy the continuing adventure.
B008HK3RVY|5.0|I love my case for the Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;! it fits perfectly. I have dropped it a couple times from standing up and always the kindle is still in perfect condition.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was hooked. I took the first book because it was free, ( as a prime customer) and I felt that it was a no risk proposition. Bingo! Totally hooked. I had to BUY then next two books, (clever people, these folks at Amazon) While I don't  rank those quite as highly, that's due to no longer being suprised by the thme of the book.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|This was our book club pick for march.  Interesting story though a little strange.  But I liked it and it was an easy read.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love to take pinterst on the go so having it on my Kindle Fire HD gives me the freedom to do just that.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|If you love to cook and eat out, this book is a real eye opener. My two stepchildren are in the restaurant industry so this book peaked my interest. It is a bit raw in places - Anthony does not have the cleanest language in the world. However, is you can get past that, your eyes will be opened into this detailed, descriptive and often shocking insight into the world of restaurant workers. So if you are interested in discovering something 'new' about what goes on behind that swinging door into the back of the establishments you enjoy frequenting for a leisurely meal, read this book. You won't be disappointed!
B003XVYLDU|5.0|I first read Slaughterhouse Five decades ago, but reading it again is a new experience.  Vonnegut's style is as fresh as any of today's best voices in literature.
B0011TMOIK|2.0|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets -- the WB treatment of the Movie<br /><br />Have you not noticed how WB seems to pony-jerk books when transforming them into movies? How they go with what they think the people want rather than sticking with the books progressions, and losing some great moments on the way?<br /><br />This is one of those movies -- it is a great way to sate a child's interest generally, but beware that once (or if) they read the book, and try to compare it to the book, they are bound to realize just how bad Hollywood is able to read (or Englands version of Hollywood).<br /><br />From this movie to the rest, the split from revealing the HP storyline that was put together by Mrs. Rowlings is muddled even more as we see further splits from the book and even the first two film treatments (Prof Flitwick goes from being the sqeeky what ever he is in the first two films to an un-optimised short statured person seldom heard but shown as if he were not but a musical conductor from HP-3 movie onward).<br /><br />That just goes to show that WB is not that committed to the story and will use what ever shortcuts to reduce their costs as much as they can while enjoying the hype by the fans.<br /><br />Do I recommend this movie -- sure, if you just like a quick thrill-ride for you and your kids. But those interested in the preservation of literary works be aware that this round of HP production is just that -- a quick production.<br /><br />When HP is remade in 3 years from now (either as a Movie Series or a TV Series) then maybe the production will have a better adherent to the books.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|I love this game and so many games!!  From very easy to extremely hard.  I've spent many an hour playing.
B0042816YK|5.0|Ok this is one of my favorite movie! The book is also fantastic! I would recommend this movie to any and everyone!
B0067R0APK|3.0|I really don't care to see the radar pictures of all my locations at once. Seems like overkill to me. And when I select a radar to look at on a page by itself it's not visible at all. I prefer the older version. I appreciate your efforts to give us more options but they don't<br />seem to work correctly on my Galaxy Note II.
B000J103PC|5.0|Such a cute girly movie. Definitely recommend. Although this is always on TV so I would recommend DVRing it if you can.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I fell in love with this game it is awesome if I like it you guys will love it trust me you so will love it

B00AEFXOKO|5.0|This movie takes troubled teens and turn them into champions. This is a prime example on how hard work and dedication can get you far. I recommend this movie, its a good one! :)
B000I9W08I|5.0|I remember going to the movies to see this when it came out.  The period costumes and sets really make this movie a spectacular.  It moves along nicely, lots of movement (dance), scenes shot far away and then zooming in, colors and sounds.  Watched the extras that came with the DVD, interesting about the parade filming.
B000001F76|5.0|Was a gift for my Dad for Fathers Day, so we have not given it to him yet.  But am very greatful that you had it available.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|loved it when it first aired; still holds up a decade later. Fox ought to be charged with a crime for cancelling it...
B0012FHGCW|5.0|In the prepper world we call guys like this 'sheeple'.  He had a great plan but he was not prepared for living in the wilderness.  There are people who actually go off into the wilderness by themselves and they are very successful.  This guy had no clue.  The thing that made the biggest impact on me is that he died in the end, something I didn't expect.  He died from eating the wrong plants when he was starving.  His preps consisted of a jar full of rice, he had no real gun, what about the stream next to him, he didn't even go fishing.  He killed some big game but didn't know what to do with it and it all rotted.  He should have spent a year or two hunting, killing, builing shelters, starting fires, learned how to prepare meat for the long term by drying, salting, etc.  He should have had more supplies, more food, a better plan than just living in a bus.  This movie really opened my eyes to being prepared, we should all know this stuff just in case we find ourselves lost in the wilderness!
B0052AC8C6|4.0|If you like Johnny Depp and enjoy a good story this movie is for you. Also I think this is the only Animated movie I have seen where the charters didn't start singing, like in disney movies.  Is there music yes, but people are not just tap dancing and singing and holding hands.<br /><br />THere are a few things that adults will catch and chuckle, I wont ruin it for you.
1613823649|5.0|if you're into Christian apologetics, then you can't pass up G.K. and this book is filled with solid thinking on the issues of Christ as a central figure of the Christian Faith and how to defend the belief. If you like or dislike reason for God's existence this is a must. The literary language is 19th century but the reasons are eternal.
B004H6G0TI|5.0|Challenging and fun game. Many different planes to unlock and use with unique weapons. I wish people would play me on multiplayer though.
B00B7ERH04|1.0|At first I thought that this app was amazing.... but.... you can only take pics for free you have go get camicoins to take videos. And when I got coin dozed and got to level four the app did not give me my 310 camicoins in return this app is cheap!!!!!<br />(A total piece of Carl)
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|Just a string of tasteless sexual innuendo. No real story, poor acting and mindless humor. We turned it off after 20 minutes.  We aren't prudes but a movie is supposed to have a point and we couldn't see the point of watching this disaster.

B008AK8FHM|2.0|The leader of a weekly seminar I attend recommended this book, thinking it may be of interest to me. I read parts of it, skipping over the family parts. My conclusion: Even if Dr. Alexander has found what he believes to be proof of the existence of Heaven and God, it is not very helpful to the average human if it requires having your Neocortex eaten away by bacterial meningitis on the personal level and having your family's financial situation wrecked by the cost of having week-long stay in a hospital.<br />While I understand that the author was impressed by his experience, he was by no means the only person to have had a NDE.<br />The Encyclopedia of Death, Near Death and Life After Death, J.R.Lewis, states iin the section on Ascension, that \\"several famous mystics of the pre-Christian era (such as Aristeas, Epimenedes, and Hermotimos) knew how to fly in the state of trance. Such state implies the concept of separation of body and soul, which in Platonic thought was related in the tale of Er. Er, wounded in battle, was believed to be dead. But after twelve days he returned to life and gave a detailed account of the afterlife.\\"
B00BYOEMTQ|4.0|This movie started off slow, with a series of prologues dealing with the founding of the Dwarven city and the coming of the dragon Smaug, which we, alas, never truly get to see. Then its off to Hobbitton to meet our favorite Hobbits and a slightly younger Gandalf The Dwarves seem a bit more comical than need be, especially the one with the really odd hat who uses a Dennis the Menace style slingshot that is absolutely useless in battle. He's like the Jar-Jar Binks of the group. NO movie needs a Jar-Jar. I'm hoping he's dragon chow in the next film. The rest of the cast is great though.  Some of the best bits in the movie are in the prologue with the finding of the Arkenstone, the scenery, the fight with the Necromancer, and the Rivendell stuff. Especially the scene where Saruman tries to use his Voice on the Elven High Council and they are not having any of that. Of course, the best part of all is the part where Bilbo finds the Ring and meets Gollum. I liked it and can't wait to see what's in the extended version when that comes out.<br />The bonus features were also good. These were production blogs that were about bits and pieces of the &#34;making of&#34; process&#34;. The best parts of these were the ones discussion and showing the scenery and locations used in the film. Just amazing. They went to all new and different parts of New Zealand for this film than they had been before. Also, Hobbiton is now a permanent tourist destination in New Zealand.<br /><br />A couple extra bits: I am not a fan of 3-D. It was great in Avatar, and there is no point in every movie needing to be in 3-D. You don't need it in the Hobbit.
B0095P33IW|5.0|The movie was great. Exciting and action packed.awesome movie. Good picture.  Nothing more to say I just have to write a minimum amount of characters.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Very rarely do I think a book is good enough to reread. I just finished my second read through of Ready Player One and it retains all the charm and excitement that it had on my first read through. It now joins an elite group of books: the never ending story, snow crash, and slaughter house five. A very short list of books I have read over and over. I LOVE this story.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Daniel Craig is awesome as we all know, but this one just took it to another level.  Great love story but not what you think.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Dr. Alexander's story is fascinating and certainly worth sharing.  I've found it hard to get into - I'm about half way through it but I started it several weeks ago.  Usually, I whip through a book in a few days at most.

B004J4WLB4|5.0|This was a book group selection for me and I was captivated by the story of this young girl and her mentors.  It was heartbreakingly sad in parts but a story of hope, love, forgiveness, and redemption.  The dictionary of flowers has stimulated me, a gardner, to be more aware of what I'm planting and how I share plants and flowers w/ others.
