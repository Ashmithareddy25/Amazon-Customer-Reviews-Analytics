081297381X|4.0|This NYT beststeller may help you become aware of some flaws in your thinking.<br /><br />Among the topics covered are:<br />* there are many things in life that don't follow a Gaussian distribution.<br />* how to handle/prepare for the improbable<br />* we have a too strong tendency to search for causes and reasons, whereas many things are unpredictable, i.e. the are simply due to (good of bad) luck<br /><br />This is an intelligent book and definitely worth reading, although I did expect a little more of it, given the huge attention it received.<br /><br />I think one should read this book, as if it were a thinking exercise: the author challenges common sense and gives you plenty of things to think about. You read it, reflect and draw your own conclusions. Chances are you (like me) won't agree with all of Taleb's claims/conclusions.

0393340244|1.0|Based on a seemingly overwhelming amount of hard evidence, Cordelia Fine arrives at a stunning conclusion : When it comes to cognitive tasks, especially in controlled research environments, there is no real difference between the sexes. We might at least expect that much from a cognitive scientist. However, by stating what seems to be a sound logical conclusion ends up being just that. A logical conclusion based on her own premises and within her own frame of reference. Thereby repeating the same mistake she thinks contemporary neuro-scientists are making, but framed differently : sex differences exist only in the mind of the believer. The world is only what's happening between our ears, on the cognitive level. Descartes couldn't have stated it better. She even expands her theme by questioning all the energy that is spend on the differences. Given our own history, both human and evolutionary, and all the energy that is spend on the difference between the sexes, this would seem to be a good question indeed. Why would we, or life in general, waste such a considerable amount of energy on such a trivial matter that only exist as a result of our own imagination ? If you are looking for answers to this question, Cordelia will not offer any solace. In the end, she repeats what most people already know : both women and men have, in general, the same cognitive abilities. Both can do the math. We might expect at least that much from our own evolution. And the results - in the eyes of others - of these cognitive abilities vary with the expectations, or what we make of these expectations as part of our cognition, of our social environment.<br />As a cognitive scientist, Cordelia doesn't in any way provide the answer to the question she poses on the cover of her book : How the differences are created. Based on her understanding of neuroscience I did expect at least some hints as how all this stuff between the ears came into being and why it would be so persistent. But I have toadmit, I was rather disappointed. Cordelia is looking, albeit in a modern sophisticated way, where the second wave feminists have been looking extensively and thus far only came up with another set of delusions. The question might be why, given the equal possibilities of the cognitive brain, Cordelia is using her cognition by looking for answers to her personal questions in all the wrong places again.
0811729117|3.0|Not a bad read.  On the plus side, the author rarely blashemies or swears unlike so many authors in this genre. The beginning is a little disappointing because it almost completely lacks any description of the author's' first taste of combat or feelings toward Operation Barbarossa.  The feeling among the general staff was that it was going to be an unmitigated disaster.   I was afraid the book was going to read like Marine, the autobiography of Chesty Puller which mentions almost nothing about how he won the five Navy Crosses but concentrates instead on the bureaucratic side of his career.   But this book at least picks up. Id give it three and a half stars.  I much better read is Stuka Pilot, the autobiography of arguably Germany's all time best combat pilot.         I myself am particularly interested in the war on the Eastern Front because that was where 75% of the war in Europe was fought.  I must admit I had some misgivings about reading a book written from the enemy's perspective, but objectivity requires nothing less.  Ive also read books when I could find them written by Japanese and Russian authors about the war.     Generally books like these are written by three kinds of authors: purely patriotic Germans, professional/bureaucratic soldiers, and hard core nazis.  This book in MOST places seems to be a mix of one and two.  Be warned though there are times when the author tries to make the Werhmacht and even the Wafeen SS look like victims???!!! Nevertheless, this genre is a must read for anyone who wants to understand why even using the words Tiger Tank was officially banned from allied military reports.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have a tablet/e-reader that came with the Kindle app, love it!  Then I also use the Kindle app on my computer, which I had to download, and I love it all the more.

B003X7MCGW|2.0|The Crowes rock, no doubt about it.  And they can take a rocker and do it acoustic and it becomes a whole new song with it's own swagger.  Here,  what they've done is not all acoustic, but they took the edge off the songs.  What's left is a bland hybrid with few highlights.  Not sure what they were doing.  2 stars because it's the Crowes and these are good tunes.  Would have been better going all out though - rock it or acoustic.  The hybrid just doesn't work.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|\\"Thor\\" is a riveting, edge-of-your-seat saga for the ages. No big surprise, given that it's directed by perhaps the greatest thing since Billy Shakespeare himself, the esteemed Sir Kenneth Branagh. I mean, talk about the ability to milk a scene like a mad cow driving at the teat. The man is a gift to the universe and, at the same time, proof that evolution does not exist.<br /><br />Fathers and sons are not known to always get along. Such is the case with the rather stiff relationship between Odin and his half-related sons, Loki and Thor. I know, it totally sounds like I'm describing some twink skin flick so far.<br /><br />But Thor is just a regular guy. He likes kicking back and drinking some brewskis with his bad guy-bashing buds, like our former president. He's just a fun-lovin' regular joe with his trusty hammer (sort of like our lord and savior, Jesus Christ the carpenter) who's not too uppity that he can't make you pancakes in the morning -- at least once he's smitten with a mortal, which is kind of perverted seeing as he's a god; it's like you or me going slumming for amputees.<br /><br />Anyway, Natalie Portman, as the love interest, turns in her first decent acting since \\"Mars Attacks!\\" Why can't a girl study her wormhole in peace? That is the ultimate question this film brimming with sexual innuendos poses. Why indeed.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|I don't really care if Mr Lucas wants to make changes to his films.  However, you would think he would be interested in also preserving these films as they were originally presented in the theaters.  Guess he isn't.  Which is surprising given his passionate criticism of the colorization of B&W films for home video.  In any case, I will not buy any copy of these films until the originals are also made available on blu ray.  I would encourage others to do likewise.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|This CD is like the revolution of pop music. I love how different Lady Gaga is from the rest. She has her own unique sound for each song and has written all of them herself. Way more than you can say for everyone else out there. The tracks on this CD are risky, but very likable. Love the dance beats. she is a great entertainer. Maybe not the best album of the year but it is definitely the biggest happening in Gaga's career. I'd have to say my favorite song is Schiebe. :)
B003ZSJ212|1.0|It's so sad George Lucas has killed his former self. During his speech to Congress in 1988 Lucas said \\"People who alter or destroy works of art and our cultural heritage for profit or as an exercise of power are barbarians\\". Apparently his greed and obsession with rewriting his own work has gone too far.    Star Wars is such a cultural icon specifically because of the innovative film making techniques Lucas and his team developed in the late 70's. Destroying that accomplishment by replacing scenes with CGI, introducing politically correct concepts that were not part of culture when the original films came out only proves that Lucas has lost his ways.    It's very apparent LucasFilm does not listen to the fans that fund their own existence so it's only fair we don't buy this product. The blu-ray format allows for such a rich experience but unfortunately the creative genius of Lucas was not around to take advantage of it.     I'll be skipping this one and be happy I have the DVD and original VHS versions of the once classics of our culture.    PS: if Lucas wants to improve the Star Wars legacy he should spend his time digitally erasing Hayden Christensen and Jar Jar Binks from history.
B0052U59F4|5.0|I just love this book, I had actually read it when the characters were different and it was on the fan fiction web site, and had started reading the 2nd part of it on the website the author had, if you haven't read it yet you're in for a treat. This a a very spicy story, and gives a peak into a lifestyle that I was unaware of before reading it, but it's done in a very tasteful way, that is still very steamy. I have read it before, and I know I will again, as with anyone's favorite book!<br /><br />I am anxiously awaiting the sequel!
B00475AUWW|5.0|It's too soon to say if this book has changed my life because I only recently finished it. Nevertheless, its message and presentation strongly appeals to me and, right now, I feel like I got a lot out of it.     The language in the first part of the book is drill sergeantlike. Clever, considering the title. Most creative types can probably benefit an attitude of urgency in their approach. The \\"war\\" analogy to the creative process - whatever your art is - is very pertinent. It is a struggle, just like a war. Touches like that make the writing a cut above the usual self-help book.    The idea behind the book is deceptively simple: you have to overcome resistance in life in order to create your art. However, the way he addresses your excuses that you make to yourself (your Resistance) leave you with a complex set of emotions. Your excuses are your reality and, when you think about it, he's attacking those perceptions. That's what makes this a hard book. Several other reviewers have written they recommend you go slowly over this book. For me, I couldn't put it down. I couldn't go slowly because I wanted to see where he was going. I'll have to reread this and likely will do so.
B001DPC52C|5.0|Within Temptation never fails to impress in my opinion, and yet this DVD exceeded all expectations I had of them. I am completely overwhelmed by their brilliance, both in talent and in vision. What a wonderful concert--I so wish I could have been there. Also, credit must go to the Metropolin Orchestra and the choir, as they too were wonderful. All in all this CD/DVD combination has layer upon layer of inspiring brilliance that will delight you in every way possible. A complete treat for the ears, and the soul!
B000002VTE|4.0|No longer a universal feature on \\"Ladies And Gentleman, We Are Floating In Space\\", the deliberative, note-perfect depth that characterized all of \\"Lazer Guided Melodies\\" and the vast majority of \\"Pure Phase\\" is still present on the gorgeous, anthemic title track as well as several other cuts, but as if reflective of the dichotomous effects that heavy narcotic use as a coping mechanism can generate, the peaceful feeling it evokes initially is offset by the destructive and corrosive effects it is sure to produce later, translated aurally on this release through at least three tracks that dissolve into near-chaos or skirt the edge of utter discordancy.     Some of the tracks on \\"Pure Phase\\" had either a bit of an aggressive, nearly menacing tinge (\\"Electric Phase\\" and \\"These Blues\\"), but were redeemed through the fluid progression of the material within which those rough edges were embedded. Most of the tracks, however, nearly approached the universal cohesiveness of \\"Lazer Guided Melodies\\". Indeed, 'Ladies And Gentleman, We Are Floating In Space\\", \\"I Think I'm In Love\\" \\"All Of My Thoughts\\", \\"Stay With Me\\", \\"Broken Heart\\", and \\"Cool Waves\\" are full of the richly layered, sensitively integrated melody lines that rival anything on the first two releases, and \\"I Think I'm In Love\\" and \\"Cool Waves\\" are singular in their particular sweep and depth.     An insistent, aggressive  dynamic  informs \\"Come Together\\" and \\"Electricity\\" and \\"Home Of The Brave\\", and while none of these cuts manage to shake loose the hook they are arranged around, a great deal of tension exists within all three. \\"The Individual\\" and \\"No God Only Religion\\" have no real formative sense of organic flow and devolve into squalling, squonking freak-outs, while \\"Cop Shoot Cop\\", initially a slow-burning, hook-laden track driven at a deliberate tempo, loses its coherence after about seven minutes and drags on for another ten before closing everything out.     Marking a very negative transitional period in Jason Pierce's life, \\"Ladies and Gentleman.....\\"  reveals an artist in torment through Pierce's brutally confessional lyrics. \\"All I want in life is just a little bit of love to take the pain away\\", the primary refrain from the title track, is uneasily juxtaposed with \\"Love, in the middle of the afternoon/ just me, my arm, my spike and my spoon\\" from \\"I Think I'm In Love\\"; both reflect the longing for points in his life of special significance that can never be recaptured, either through wistful longing or the temporary panacea of (heavy) drug use. For the most part this is probably his most complex work, even if it's not his most cohesive, and it's lavishly produced. Fans of \\"Lazer Guided Melodies\\" and \\"Pure Phase\\" will still find a number of patiently constructed, heavily orchestrated tracks that seem to reveal new wrinkles even after years of listening; I stretch back to 1997 with this CD, which I just recently replaced. I can definitely recommend this CD. Pick up a copy, you won't regret it.
B003ZSJ212|2.0|Why would Lucas choose to once again screw with a perfect product, while many will call those of us delusional and childish about such minor changes in the classic films. The point is that they were classic films and that in making these changes and adding scenes and dialogue that weren't in them previously just because he can seems like he doesn't care what we the fans and consumers want, if these films came out today with Lucas at the helm and with today's technology these films would be panned by critics and snubbed by movie goers because the films would rely heavily on CGI and poor dialogue without a coherent story. This is verified by the prequels and the only reason that they were successful was because of the fan base of the original; which Lucas continues to destroy with his ineptitude.
B0019AGD6A|5.0|I have been reading all the books in this series and enjoyed each and every one.  What really helped was watching the HBO miniseries first.  Helped with pronunciation of names and gave faces to the key characters.  In fact, bought the DVDs.     May the stories continue
1451629184|5.0|This book was something I just couldn't put down. It is so hard to imagine the life this young girl had with that nut case and his wife. Nothing she gets in this world will be enough for the horrors she had to endure for all those years. So glad she seems to be handling it well. I wish nothing but the best for her and her children.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|If I could give this zero stars I would! George has screwed these movies up beyond belief. The product marketing says this set includes \\"The Original Trilogy\\"....what a LIE! These are NOT the original movies. Every change George makes detracts more from the originals. And this isn't just about nostalgia for the originals - these new versions are HORRIBLE not because they are different, but because the changes actually make the movies worse. Vader's \\"Noooooo!\\" scene has changed one of the most compelling of the series and made it cringe-worthy. STAY AWAY - DO NOT BUY!
B003ZSJ212|4.0|Have been a Star Wars fan my whole life.  Was really looking forward to this release.  Already planned on a marathon with friends.  After reading the things changed, I do not want to waste my money.  I guess I will have to wait for whoever inherits the rights and see if they care more about keeping the integrity of the originals.  (Edit) I did breakdown and ended up buying the collection.  For how upset I was about the changes made I took some time to think about it.  The changes only account for a VERY small portion of the movies.  If seen in the theater you would probably miss more movie time if you had to run to the bathroom or refill your soda than you would if you took out the redone parts.  It is a great deal and I suggest if you like Star Wars to buy the complete collection, at less than $14 a movie, it is hard to pass up.
B005COO1X6|4.0|Reminiscent of King's earlier horror like From a Buick 8, this has some vivid, creepy imagery. I read it in a darkened room - just by chance, not by design. To be honest, I found myself just a tad nervous. King fleshes out both major and minor (read: expendable) characters, something I love about his writing. In just a few spare sentences, he makes you care about these people and dread for their futures. Pete's pre-adolescent thoughts about impressing his friends, the lives of Big Kids, sex and various vices are fun to read. The story builds, but doesn't really tell us much. For all the build up, I thought the ending was pretty simplistic. Then again, it IS a novella. It was a short ride, but a decent one. I would like to see this car described in more detail -- maybe in a subsequent book? We never find out where this entity went, so something tells me we've not seen the last of the Morphing, Man-Munching Mudmobile.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved it. Everything has been said about this book, so I won't elaborate further. One of my favorite Stephen King's books is [[ASIN:0451196716 The Long Walk]], which has the same dystopian world and the same competition devised by an absolutist government, where the children are offered as sacrificial lambs to please and control the masses. King's story has a darker edge and it's grittier and more despairing than this story. When I read it like a hundred years ago (I feel ancient these days), I was almost shocked by it. I wasn't shocked by this book, but I honestly couldn't put it down. There were some greats moments that made my heart beat madly in my chest or that made me cry my eyes out       ***spoiler***[Rue's death made me lie in my bed with my eyes closed and the tears streaming down my face, I knew I was being played, but still I couldn't help myself ***end spoiler***.       The resolution was clever, but the book isn't the end of the story. I hope it will maintain the same tension.
B0050XFY4O|4.0|Nice movie to watch. Nothing extraordinary, a just a good one. I wish it was in English, yet there are only subtitles which you have to pay attention to.
B0006GAOBI|3.0|Is Donnie Darko a schizophrenic. Is Donnie Darko a seer who can see the future through time travel, through a worm hole shooting out his chest? Or is it something else?<br /><br />Donnie Darko is filled with Lynch like puzzles, ambiguity, surrealistic realities. Good acting abounds from a great cast, filled with dark humor, smart dialog, & the end is something you'll be contemplating for hours after watching this film. Which is the main reason this film has replay value, but is a tad overrated by it's cult following, though one of the better films influenced by David Lynch. It does lack the visceral images of violence, sex, & general complex ambiguities of the best surrealistic Lynch, like \\"Mulholland Drive, \\"Lost Highway,\\" & \\"Twin Peaks,\\" or the memorable characters & dialog from Lynch's, \\"Wild at Heart,\\" but never the less, a very good film in the head games department.<br /><br />3 1/2 stars = Very Good

I could understand the main plot, but the finale was very weak....one of the cult understands way more than she should be able to in the midst of the action....govt orders are screwy and illogical.

B000V5ZIBU|5.0|Deep Space Nine is the perfect answer to those lingering questions left by many different episodes of The Next Generation.  No, not all our questions are answered, but let's accept the fact that the human imagination is capable of so many iterations of future reality that not all are possible to portray in one show.  I think that the Star Trek creators were testing Trekkie's taste for new adventures that did not fall completely in line with the Enterprise model we've become accustomed.  Take a chance on Deep Space and watch how some really horrible episodes give way to episodes with epic space battles that will fuel your imagination for years to come.  That is the point isn't it...<br /><br />So watch Deep Space Nine and keep in mind that it is a Transition for the future of the Star Trek universe that eventually bolsters the credibility of the newer stories within Voyager and Enterprise and then finally the oh-so-amazing, most recent Star Trek movie...without Deep Space Nine, none of us would have accepted the new faces in Star Trek.
0553801473|3.0|Spoilers<br /><br />I agree with most of the complaints about the various storylines not moving forward, but the one that bugs me the most was around Stannis/Reek and Winterfell.  Stannis' army spends literally hundreds of pages trapped in the snow trying to get to Winterfell to battle Bolton (one of the nastiest characters in fantasy fiction).  Does Stannis ever get there, do they ever have it out?  Who knows, all we get is a cryptic letter from Bolton to Jon Snow to give us a clue which is almost certainly a head fake.  This is the big change in the series.  The earlier books all took their own sweet time but before the end, we had the big climatic battle and we actually got to see it.<br /><br />Still, Martin builds a fascinating world and his characters good and bad are almost all interesting.  (Though I was sad to see Martell fail as he was one of the few characters who was actually proceeding with some kind of specific plan and goal.)<br /><br />So, I'll probably keep reading the series (assuming I'm alive when the next book comes out) but it'll be more just to get to the end rather than out of high anticipation.

0670022411|5.0|Dr. Diana Bishop, a Yale educated Historian, is at Oxford's Bodleian Library when she accidentally sets off a flurry of other-worldly activity. Diana is a witch, orphaned at the age of seven when her two very powerful witch parents were murdered. She is much more interested in scholarly pursuits instead of her own witch power and while recalling a centuries old manuscript, she accidentally discovers it's enchanted. All of a sudden Diana has attracted all sorts of attention - from witches, daemons and vampires. In particular, the very handsome alpha vampire Matthew de Clairmont takes an interest in her. But Diana is nothing if not independent, and resists Matthew's charms. But it turns out Matthew is pretty irresistible and before you know it they are interested in each other. But vampires and witches don't usually mix romantically (to prevent the discovery of the species to unsuspecting humans)  but their relationship, and the fact that Diana has unknowingly conjured the bewitched text, gets them in a whole lot of trouble. Before they know it they are in a wild goose chase that puts all of the Bishop and de Clairmont families at risk. With a the possibility of an all out war and an ending that begs for more, A Discovery of Witches by Deborah Harkness will having you begging for book two!<br /><br />A Discovery of Witches was a great read. The author is a natural storyteller and once I started the book I couldn't put it down. Part of the reason was, I have to admit, the romance between Diana and Matthew. Where the book has some  elements reminiscent of Twilight (mostly the other-worldly and beautiful vampire characters and mushy romantic parts) it was a much more intellectual book. With information about scientific and evolutionary theory throughout the storyline, Harkness does a spectacular job at converging history, science and fantasy in this extremely imaginative novel.<br /><br />While I agree with other reviewers when they claim that the highly educated Diana tends to turn into a mushy teenager with a major crush when around Matthew, it didn't bother me so much. Aren't vampires supposed to be totally irresistible? In A Discovery of Witches, Matthew is the ultimate vampire, so why wouldn't Diana get a little gushy around him? Even if her undying devotion to Matthew does get a bit annoying, at the same time her character becomes stronger physically with the discovery of her many witch powers.<br /><br />In the end I really enjoyed A Discovery of Witches and am looking forward to book two (I heard through the grapevine that sometime in 2012 the book will be published, but even the author on Twitter wasn't sure of the exact date).o a mushy teenager with a major crush when around Matthew, it didn't bother me so much.

B0016OMG6K|3.0|Ladytron is my favorite electroclash band, hell, they invented electroclash. But Velocifero fell flat for me, it sounds like an homogenized wall of shoegaze. The synthesized lead tracks have virtually no dynamic range or variation, looping the same patterns throughout entire songs. Percussion tracks are way down in the mix and often serve as little more than metronome pulses. Everything is then smothered in a seamless avalanche of reverberation - like a seven-channel surround sound mix compressed into a pair of midrange stereo speakers.     Every once in a while during this album there is a break in the wall, allowing percussion and fill tracks to be heard in relative isolation. These brief interludes show how much buried creativity lies beneath the overproduction. Listen to track 10 \\"The Lovers\\" and tell me the subtleties of the quiet swirling intro aren't obliterated by the monotonous synths that dominate the rest of the song.    The saddest aspect of this album, however, is what was done to the vocals. Not only are they distant and indistinct, buried deep below the repetitive synth tracks, but they don't even sound like the original source vocals. I would not be surprised if some of the vocals were in fact looped samples of 100% processed reverb output. Do you think Helen actually sang that many identical takes of the refrain in \\"My Little Runaway\\"?    I'm not saying Ladytron is done in my book, previews of \\"Gravity the Seducer\\" sound far more promising. Velocifero is basically Ladytron flattened into a dance floor mix, and after a few drinks, I'd be sedated enough to trance out to it.

B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Wonderful movie, can be watched by everyone, no bad words and very motivational.  i saw it at the movies and then had to buy it, everyone in it is good looking and nice.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Lucas - it was bad enough that you \\"enhanced\\" the original films when you re-releaded them to theaters and then DVD, but this has to stop.  Please give us the original films on Blu-Ray unaltered.
B004HO6I4M|3.0|This movie was entertaining but had no soul. I didn't really feel for the characters like in other animated movies. Also the beginning and ending felt rushed, I would have liked to see them elaborate a bit more in those areas. Kids might like this movie but for an adult who likes animated movies like I do, it was worth the rent but I won't be adding it to my collection.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|So, i have never yet made a review, however i must at this time say that when all these people make comments about altering and not being a big deal, this is how i saw it in my own mind. yes, we can accept these changes, move on , deal. but.. what would the world be like if people did this all the time? how would it be if someone went into your mind and changed your memorable christmas morning.. or your memorable first time going to a movie.. or the first time you rode your bike.. its not about how he wants things to be or how they should be, its about how it was..... the way it was presented for the first time for the whole world to see..  as a child i have memories of these movies, memories that made me who i am.. part of me.. you cant just go back and change these things ... its one of the worst crimes of artistic freedom i have ever witnessed. its simply history being slowly rewritten. no matter how minor, there is an old saying....  \\"if it's not broke don't fix it\\"

B005KA188S|2.0|Going into the remake of \\"Fright Night\\", I was a bit apprehensive. The original is my favorite vampire film of all time and I just felt that deep down they were going to find some way to mess up the remake. Then the trailers came in (everything looked solid, if a bit underwhelming), then the reviews came in (75% in just about perfect for a horror film), and then the reaction from fans came in--They didn't mess it up! I couldn't wait to watch the remake. I sat down in my seat eager for the movie to start as I put on my 3D glasses and was ready for the wild vampire ride to begin.<br /><br />The film starts quite promising. We are given a skyline shot of houses in the suburb. The kind of suburb where everyone owns the same car, the same house, and the same two kids. And then BAM, three killings before the opening credits can even hit the screen. I was ready! This is going to be the remake to end all remakes! Sadly, it was not to be. The plot is generally the same as the original with a few small changes. Teenager Charley Brewster guesses that his new neighbor Jerry Dandrige is a vampire responsible for a string of recent deaths. When no one he knows believes him, he enlists Peter Vincent, a self proclaimed vampire killer and Las Vegas magician, to help him take down Jerry.<br /><br />What doesn't work about this movie? Well, aside from a few stylish touches...pretty much everything. Gone is the old, charming horror host Peter Vincent and in is a Midori chugging whorish magician. Ugh. Gone is the beautiful shot and exciting club scene in which Jerry seduces Charley's girlfriend Amy (it's here, but the less said about the \\"new\\" version of this scene the better). Gone is Jerry's homo-erotic relationship with his best \\"friend\\"/roommate. Hell, that character isn't even IN this film. What's added? Awful CGI (Amy's vampire scene with Charley is incredibly lame and doesn't look half as good as it did in the TWENTY FIVE year old original) and a final battle scene that belongs more to \\"Underworld\\" than it does to the \\"Fright Night\\" legacy. That being said, It's worth a rental at least. The movie wasn't so much bad as it was incredibly disappointing. I felt there was so much more they could have done with the premise. What a waste.ld\\" than it does to the \\"Fright Night\\" legacy. That being said, It's worth a rental at least. The movie wasn't so much bad as it was incredibly disappointing.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|My son is turning 4 and I've been excited to get the blu-ray set for his first Star Wars experience. After reading about now even MORE tinkering with the originals I'm very tempted to wait.    It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what people want. Keep the original films the same OR AT LEAST include them as the original presentation with the package. Any changes done should get positive approval from the SW community.    You would THINK of all the people working at Lucasfilm that they would have at least 10 hard core fans view all of these changes and give their honest opinions about them. I'm starting to think George Lucas comes up with an idea and no matter how bad it is (like these ridiculous sounding new audio clips) the cronies at the ranch just say \\"Yes, master\\" and do the work without any honest input!    A \\"no-brainer\\" purchase just got turned into a \\"we'll see\\". :-(
B005KGPC4S|5.0|You should be prepared for Red State only by knowing nothing about it except that it is going to be worth your attention. Whether you have low or high expectation, you will not be let down. Michael Parks delivers a performance to be studied, every bit Oscar deserving. Brilliantly filmed. Movie of the year.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|I preordered this months ahead of time and eagerly listened to each song she released leading up to the cd's release. I must say I don't find myself disappointed. At first a few of the songs didn't stick with me. But I'm glad for this. With 17 songs I would have gone crazy if I loved them all at once. I'm one of those people that gets obsessed over songs and can't stop listening to them. I found myself obsessing over 4 or 5 songs at a time, perfect for my work commute. And overdoing 4 or 5 songs at a time got me nicely through the cd, really getting to see how each song was better for different moods and eventually loving the whole thing. I have found myself loving every track on every Gaga cd and this cd doesn't break that streak.
B0019N8P2W|4.0|It´s an excellent series. I strongly recommend it! I used to watch this series when I was little, so this gives me a lot of nostlagic memories    I just wish it has subtitles in other languages
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I don't know that there's anything to say which hasn't been said. I'm utterly convinced that Lucas has no idea what made the original movies so good in the first place and I have no intention of giving him anymore of my money for ruining his own legacy.
B0047S1KMS|5.0|Reality TV meets a Zombie appolipse. This unlikely idea makes for a fastic story, having a fairly linear story line, I  would have liked knowing more about the stories of the many side characters. That said, the advantage of focusing on a small group of Big Brother contestants is in their isolation and backbiting.
B0050PYNP8|3.0|Pegg, Frost and director Gregory Wright (absent here) have previously given us British metapop confections Spaced, Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. With Superbad director Greg Mottola subbing for Wright here, the action moves to America, and while things take awhile to really get going, the result is another humourous meditation on American pop culture -- in this case, centered on alien contact and invasion movies.<br /><br />Pegg and Frost play an aspiring artist and science-fiction writer respectively, delighted to have taken a vacation from England to go to the mega-geeky San Diego Comicon and then onwards for a vacation touring famous science-fiction and UFO landmarks across the Southwest in a rented motorhome. Their characters are more genial and less sharp-edged than we've seen them assay before, fitting for a movie that's ultimately more genial and less sharp-edged than we've seen them do before. The whole enterprise is really quite warm-hearted -- there are villains, but almost no one gets killed. Almost.<br /><br />Stopping to check out a car wreck in the desert, the two meet up with Paul, an alien who looks like a traditional Gray and talks like, well, Seth Rogen when he's being genial and funny, as opposed to Seth Rogen when he's mailing it in or Seth Rogen in a part Seth Rogen isn't really equipped to play. After much confusion and several faintings, the two agree to drive Paul to his retrieval area.<br /><br />Paul's been stuck on Earth since he crashed his spaceship near Roswell, New Mexico in 1947. The U.S. military abducted him then, and he's since been helping both them and Hollywood out with various alien ideas (he consulted on both E.T. and The X-Files) under the mistaken impression that he's a guest of the U.S. government. However, his technological and cultural knowhow exhausted after 60+ years, Paul is now expendable -- the powers that be want to dissect him to find out how his healing and invisibility powers work. Luckily, a sympathetic government agent managed warn him of his coming vivisection; Paul escaped; the government now pursues.<br /><br />The somewhat unlikely trio proceed to have adventures as they attempt to get Paul off-planet ahead of government pursuit. Along the way, they pick up a fourth party member played by Kristen Wiig -- a socially backward fundamentalist Christian creationist they have to kidnap from a trailer park lest she reveal their location and plans to the government. Luckily, Paul's telepathic powers show her that the universe is actually more than 6000 years old and that \\"eyes didn't just happen!\\", and she becomes a foul-mouthed agnostic with a driving need to lose her virginity to Pegg's character.<br /><br />The whole thing's a lot of fun, especially if you've seen the TV episodes and movies Paul refers to both explicitly and in passing. There are also some nice background bits of business, some surprisingly funny stoner comedy, and maybe a few too many jokes about Paul's junk.him of his coming vivisection; Paul escaped; the government now pursues.

B005COO1X6|2.0|Mile 81 is not worth purchasing.  At the time of my purchase I was looking for a spine tingling book that would give me nightmares.  I never watch scary movies or read any scary books, but decided I wanted something to get my blood boiling.  I looked into Stephen King's books and saw Mile 81.  I was very disappointed and was not freaked out at all! I would suggest you purchasing something else.

B003L77GRO|3.0|I've been a rabid Dexter fan ever since Netflix put the first two seasons on Instant Play. Since then I've scrambled to find Season 3 and Season 4 episodes at the library and Hastings, and then waited impatiently for Season 5 to be released on Amazon.     After the great Season 4 run with John Lithgow and the stunner finale, I couldn't wait to start on Season 5 (via instant play from Amazon). Unfortunately, Season 5 is (so far) anticlimactic and even (however briefly) boring in some episodes. Some great production and storylines are still there, but...    -The writing isn't nearly as good: Dialogue is cliched and story lines jump and jerk from high-energy action to plodding explanatory material. E.g. the Fuentes murders story with Debra is engaging but gets put on hold while the \\"informant's\\" (frankly more bothersome than worrisome) acute interest in Dexter Doings alternates with the more interesting (but unevenly developed) Barbie in a Drum plot. The languishing Fuentes subplot is abruptly resolved and morphs into a cop's Wrongful Scapegoat storyline that has LaGuerta acting out of character.    -How much longer can we suspend our disbelief? The messy murders are piling up and it's hard to accept that Dexter has the time or resources to make all the crime scenes spic and span before the \\"good guys\\" arrive to take evidence. Why is everyone doing the, \\"Oh, ya, that Trinity killer thing -- that we've apparently dropped as an investigation, even though we're cops with axes to grind\\"...? How is it that hotel guests don't notice gruesome activities in a hotel room with a busted-down door? (Who fixed the door so that a kill room isn't discovered?) Why are nefarious activities on a boat taking place within (albeit long-range lens) camera-capture distance if Dex's Code includes safely dispatching bagged-but-not-tagged evidence 20 to 30 miles offshore into the Gulf Stream? Why isn't Dexter's former neighbor noticing odd goings-on next door? And who the heck wears a snappy suit to the clandestine cleanup of a swampy dumping ground?     -What happened to our characters? There's a distinct lack or distortion of character development. The Season 5 guest actor's role is just not as interesting as characters portrayed by past stars. Not sure if it's the acting or the lines or both. Furthermore, we are Masuka-deprived (and far less depraved) this year. He deserves more time to provide comic relief in juxtaposition with occasionally serious, human insight. And I miss Dexter's dad's lectures, which are few and far between until near the end of Season 5. Then there's the LaGuerta personality disorder topped by Dexter's lengthy and humiliating exposition in front of an audience of hundreds. It is just plain wrong.     Unfortunately, we can't get Showtime at our house and Showtime no longer allows Netflix the privilege of renting Dexter-time to us customers. We'll have another year-long wait for the presumed August 2012 release of Season 6. But unless Season 5 picks up (I just finished Episode 7 or 8), it might not turn out to be a hardship.     Keeping fingers crossed that Showtime returns to exceeding Dexter addicts' expectations...    *********  Addendum: I just finished the last episode of Season 5 and am sorry to report that, although it wasn't a waste of time, Season 5 was a big letdown. I've moved my original (above) review to the DVD series rather than locate it at an individual episode.    I agree with reviewer \\"R. Recchia\\" that the first episode, \\"My Bad,\\" was more like the fare we're accustomed to, except for the messy loose end of Dexter's \\"emotional outburst\\" and the FBI apparently having no problem with an extremely tardy interviewee. The last few episodes were like watching a 1980s version of The Young and the Restless (if the Y&R starred a serial killer and used buckets of blood and profanity). Some of the lines were real clunkers, and even the fine actors couldn't lift them without visible pain. Until I saw the last episode, I never thought I'd associate the noun \\"maudlin\\" in any way with Dexter.    On positive notes, Quinn's character, although a bit flighty mid-season (as if the writers were arguing about how to develop it), ended up being more interesting (and likable), in part because Desmond Harrington really developed some acting chops by the end. The finale has some of the characters reverting to more familiar personalities. And Dexter's adorable baby is a hoot.    Let's hope that the Season 6 Dexter production gets more studio support and confident, skilled writing. It will elevate actor morale and lead to a better series. And I'll be first in line to buy it.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|Once, I was not happy with the re-edits & updates but, years later, I'm revising this review. I LOVE Star Wars... From the prequels, to the Clone Wars... To The Force Awakens.
0553801473|2.0|Unlike many who have reviewed this book, descriptions of barley porridge and bends sinister don't put me off. In fact, I think many fantasy writers neglect the basics of medieval life whilst they stroke their immense swords. I'm also not one of the readers who get all self-righteous because an author takes too long to write a book. It's his living, his book and I am a paying customer, not an investor.<br /><br />Having said that, I was still somewhat disappointed by this latest instalment for basically the same reason outlined by others who have reviewed it: lack of progress.<br /><br />The key POV character storylines advance very little throughout the novel. Indeed, what little advancement they do make seems somewhat negated by the end points of the threads at the close of the book. Meanwhile, other threads just seem to vaporise and some of the new ones that are introduced are rendered somewhat pointless by their climaxes.<br /><br />In other words, the book seems about 95% padding and 5% substance.<br /><br />The use of journeys, both physical and mental, for so many of the characters is part of the problem. The plot lines become like so many tedious car trips. You watch the scenery roll past to the point of boredom, hoping against hope that there will be something of interest in the next town you enter. Only to realise that the next landmark is fairly much the same as the last.<br /><br />Of course Martin does throw in some of his trademark surprises at the end, but they're starting to become contrived. Worse still, the reappearance of some characters we thought killed now makes anyone else's apparent demise less certain. Like when Indiana Jones goes over a cliff and you just know that he's not going to fall to his death because, well, he's the *hero*.<br /><br />All up I won't give the book one star because it's still a very richly written piece of work. But it's not worth the price I paid for it on pre-order. Perhaps the worst condemnation I can give it is that if you did not read this book, I imagine that you could pick up the next one in the series and not have any trouble following the story.
B0036TGSR6|2.0|Roman Polanski obviously relished directing \\"The Ghost Writer,\\" an attack on the perceived American influence over the U.K.  This story is the perfect weapon with which Polanski smears the country that has legally pursued him.  It is also satisfying to British subjects who have felt resentful towards their declining power in the Anglo-American alliance.<br /><br />Several well-known American and British actors were happy to appear in Polanski's feature.  They are generally well-cast - with the exception of Kim Catrall, who is a British/Canadian citizen, yet has an oddly unconvincing British accent.  Meanwhile overused British actor Tom Wilkenson does a workmanlike job as an American conspirator.  Fired Bond Pierce Brosnan appears as a caricature of Tony Blair.<br /><br />As political thrillers go, The Ghost Writer is as obvious as many others.  Its quality is mainly judged through the prism of ones' political convictions. It doesn't seek to convert, but rather to stroke old prejudices.  If more Americans bothered to see it, no doubt they would be offended.  There's simultaneously an American faction who is equally dissatisfied with Washington's close relationship with London.  Perhaps there's an opportunity here for a lucrative American-made hatchet job too.
B0058A119G|5.0|What a wacky spectrum of opinions this album has incited.  The overwhelming majority are 5-star, but then there's everything from the office of tax-paid employees who sit around all day listening to someone they don't like so they can spew out musically irrelevant insults, to a lapsed fan presenting a conspiracy theory about record executives clandestinely posting favorable reviews in order to boost sales!<br /><br />So here is my honest, unbiased review of \\"What Matters Most\\". Because I haven't really enjoyed a lot of Barbra's CD's over the last five or six years (despite being a fan), I did not rush out to purchase this new recording, and wasn't sure that I ever would. It was actually some of the abominable critiques on Amazon that made me rush to buy it, just so I could see what a train wreck it must be.<br /><br />Imagine my surprise when I popped it in my player . . . and found that it is quite excellent!  A very big improvement over \\"A Love Like Ours\\", \\"The Movie Album\\", and \\"Love Is the Answer\\", none of which are bad, but not up to the standard Streisand has set for herself in the past. On \\"What Matters Most\\", Barbra sounds outstanding, the songs are pleasantly escapist, and the arrangements are crisper and more inventive than of late. And yet, there are these vitriolic one and two-star postings. One person says she inhales too much, another criticizes that says she never breathes at all. (BTW, in order to sound more natural, Babs is probably the only singer in history to insist that her breathing not be erased from her recordings). One listener says she sounds too perfect and has been technically altered, and another insists she sounds dreadful. (I've attended all three of her tours, and she is no more altered than any other singer...but she is light years better). How can there be so many people with tin ears, all hearing completely different things??  I don't ever recall anyone in popular music whose voice has undergone such ridiculously intense scrutiny. But here is a big, gigantic, shocking news flash for everyone: no one EVER ever sounds like they did twenty-five years ago!!!  Voices deepen over time and develop more richness and character. Duh. Who knew???<br /><br />I'm not crazy about all the tracks. \\"The Windmills of Your Mind\\" is too actress-y and not musical enough. Gets the disc off to a tepid start. All the rest of the material is top-notch, but there just isn't enough of it. If Marilyn and Alan Bergman are such extraordinary, prolific lyricists (as they are), couldn't you have come up with at least eleven new songs, Barbra?<br /><br />Nevertheless, \\"What Matters Most\\" is a definite winner.g, gigantic, shocking news flash for everyone: no one EVER ever sounds like they did twenty-five years ago!!!

B002SAS26E|5.0|I just played 2 rounds of this game with my friend in a cafe today and found it is a great game.  Its options for a player in each turn will affect how many score you will get at last. So what should you do?  Wait to collect more goods of same type? Sell the 3 same goods to get a bonus or wait for the 4th? Exchange cards to get better goods?  The game is simple to learn. The staff has just spent 10 mins to teach us then we started to enjoy it with fun.  And I think we can play this game many many times without a boring feeling. Just wonder why it is a 2-player game only. What will be the problem with 3 or more players? Will be too fast to finish a round? If it can support 3 to 4 players, it will be perfect.

B003P2WO5E|5.0|* Note: I've written a simple content advisory at the end of this review.   This is one of the best fantasy books that I have read, which means that this book is pretty good since I've read 500+ fantasy books. I hope that the rest of the series are as good as this one.     This is a very long and well written book that I highly recommend to anyone who likes fantasy. I won't give a summary of the book because there are already so many other reviews.    The only bad thing that I can thank of about this book is that it is the only one in the series so far and since the series is suppose to be 10 books long, it may be like 10-20 years before the series is finished.    Content Advisory:   * violence - moderately high (some chopping off of body parts during combat)  * language - light (none that I can remember)  * sexuality - light (next to nothing)
1589944607|5.0|BSG the board game captures the feel of the mini series pretty accurately. Of course if you've never seen the show you won't be at a disadvantage either which is nice. The game takes a few hours to play which can make for a long night, but as long as everyone keeps their turns going quickly time seems to fly by. The concept is very similar to Shadows Over Camelot. There are two teams in the game, but at the begining no one knows who is on which team which makes for fun accusations. One thing I prefer over Shadows is that in BSG when you are a revealed cylon you still have a lot of interaction with the game and can change the cylon strategy to exploit the weakest point in the human fleet. Overall this is a fantastic game and I highly reccommend it to everyone especially anyone who watched the series!
0440244870|2.0|I'm totally going to admit that I sorta, really liked Sophie Kinsella's Can You Keep a Secret. I thought it was a bit on the hilarious side. Sure, it was mindless fluff, but it was entertaining. However, Confessions of a Shopaholic was, more often than not, completely infuriaing. Definitely not nearly as entertaining as Can You Keep a Secret.<br /><br />Rebecca Bloomwood is an idiot. There really is no other way to say it. What else would you call a person who continues to shop even though she's thousands of dollars in debt? Now, I'm not saying she was in debt, yet kept getting into it, because she had to pay her bills somehow. No, this wasn't the case with idiot Bloomwood. She kept collecting debt by wasting money on things she didn't need. Just because they were brand-name and oh-so-fabulous.<br /><br />This chick is so dumb that she starts to think of outlandish ways to make more money. It's not just that, but she actually goes so far as to believe that it's going to work and that all her problems are going to be solved. For example, she winds herself up believing that she truly is going to win the lottery. Sure people buy lotto tickets in hopes that they will win, but they aren't absolutely sure they're going to win. That way if they do, it will be a pleasant surprise rather than a life-crushing moment. But for Bloomwood is was life-crushing because she seriously thought that she was going to win. That that's how her debt was going to clear up. She didn't think of a Plan B, at least not then.<br /><br />My main problem with Confessions of a Shopaholic, besides idiot Becky Bloomwood, was that the resolution was all skewy. My preferred resolution would be, \\"learns lesson and THEN has all of these fantabulous things happen to her.\\" But nope, that's not the case. It's \\"has fantabulous things happen to her and then learns lesson\\" but even then not really. She doesn't really take responsibility for her actions. And therefore, remains forever an idiot.<br /><br />So, I thought Confessions of a Shopaholic was really disappointing. Two stars for a few chuckles here and there. Plus, I still really wanted to know what was going to happen even though I thought Rebecca was an idiot. But still, I really doubt I'm going to read the rest of the series.opaholic was really disappointing. Two stars for a few chuckles here and there.

B003J27WFW|4.0|Found the movie to be very straightforward and well done, and really liked the early history stuff and interviews with the parents.  My only issue is that it won't play on my DVD player - have to watch it on my computer.  No clue what that is all about.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|Using an AMD Phenom II X4 970 OC'd to 4GHz, push pull config(2nd fan Scythe Slipstream 110CFM), and Arctic Cooling MX-4 thermal paste, my 100% load temps using Prime95 average 50c and peak at 52c. Idle temps average 34-36c(4GHz) and have gone as low as 24c(800MHz idle). Keep in mind that that's the team working together... by itself my core temps would go up to 61c, still better than stock cooling.<br />It comes with brackets to easily install a second fan if you wish.<br />It's a little tall. It fit in my case, but now I can't install the optional 200mm side fan. Everything would've fit perfectly if the heatpipes didn't stick out so much.
1400110602|5.0|This book is interesting, illuminating, and leaves you with a sense of optimism and opportunity.  Any book that can accomplish all of these things gets five stars from me.   Unfortunately, this is the only book that's gotten this rating from me so far.  Oh well.  Maybe Sir Robinson will write another . . .
0062060554|5.0|When I downloaded a sample of this book on my kindle I couldn't get past the thought that it was a \\"50 first dates\\" book.  But, on the recommendation of a friend, I decided to buy the whole book and didn't regret it!  I couldn't put the book down and ended up reading the last chapter a couple of times because it was so shocking!  I think the author did a great job of keeping the story interesting and I highly recommend it!
B000PMLFRA|1.0|People who alter or destroy works of art and our cultural heritage for profit or as an exercise of power are barbarians, and if the laws of the United States continue to condone this behavior, history will surely classify us as a barbaric society.    In the future it will become even easier for old negatives to become lost and be \\"replaced\\" by new altered negatives. This would be a great loss to our society. Our cultural history must not be allowed to be rewritten.    Attention should be paid to this question of our soul, and not simply to accounting procedures. Attention should be paid to the interest of those who are yet unborn, who should be able to see this generation as it saw itself, and the past generation as it saw itself.    -- George Lucas's 1988 speech to the U.S. Congress

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Going to keep this short: if you were born in the late 60's or early 70s, and were even moderately into what was fun/cool at the time...you have to read this. TV shows, commericals, toys, movies, and, of course, arcades and videogames. We're talking the golden years of riding your bike to the local arcade or the Eric Two for a matinee.   The amazing thing is that the author throws in everything but the kitchen sink, and yet it works, and does not feel cluttered. Great book, loved it, I will follow the author going forward.

I didn't think it was slow at all, I thought the movie was engaging and it drew me in emotionally.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|George Lucas continues to rob us of cinematic history with this newest release of the Star Wars movies. The original theatrical versions of episodes IV, V, VI are nowhere to be found. Instead, versions of the films with bad special effects and character altering changes are added. Lightsabers look horrible and the colors in the movies are all wrong.

B002G1YPH0|4.0|This CPU cooler really does the job!  But installation for my setup was less than easy.  I have a Biostar TForce 6100-939 Mobo with an AMD Athlon 64 CPU (Socket 939).  My original CPU cooling unit was only mounted with two screws and I could not figure out for the life of me how to mount the \\"universal\\" mounting bracket that comes with this cooler.  The included instructions are a series of wordless pictures with some very minimal written instructions off to the side.  I went to the CoolerMaster website for help and their instruction video was only marginally better.  Finally I gave up on the \\"universal\\" mounting bracket and figured out a way to reuse my original mounting bracket with only slight modification.  But it was time consuming, mostly just figuring out how to accomplish it.  Oh and be forewarned, unless your case allows you adequate access to the underside of your mobo, you will have to remove your mobo to install the cooler - that is, at least, if you follow the included mounting instructions for the \\"universal\\" bracket.  As it turns out I could have avoiding removing my mobo if I had just used my original mounting bracket (with modifications).    But if you are successful in getting this baby mounted I think you'll be pleased with its performance.  With the original cooler my CPU was running really hot - up into the high 80's to mid 90's C - with the accompanying heat-related issues.  After installing this CoolerMaster unit my temps ran at a comfortable 41-42 C while running my CPU at a near constant 100% usage.  (I ran a scan using Spybot-Search & Destroy which usually takes around 30 minutes to complete on my machine and keeps my CPU usage nearly constant at 100% while scanning.  It stayed cool the whole time!).  I also set my bios settings to run my CPU fan at 100% above 35 C.  The fan was still VERY quiet!  (Another plus!)  Also, after doing a little research, I chose to use ThermalTake TG-1 thermal grease.  I figured it's cheaper than replacing my CPU / mobo / computer which is what I would have had to do if I kept overheating my CPU.    So bottom line - for me a challenging installation, but a very satisfying result!!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|So many stations to choose from. There are also a few podcasts available. So much handier to have this instead of that giant boom box, although those look sweet on your shoulder. Ha
0553801473|1.0|For die-hard George R.R. Martin fans, the quality hasn't slipped during the long wait for \\"A Dance with Dragons\\". With the return of popular characters missing from \\"A Feast for Crows\\" and the introduction of new points of view, fans of his previous book will find the newest offering an improvement. Martin even manages to answer a lingering question or two.<br />But problems remain. Of all the points of view, only a handful captivate. Of the others, words spent on world-building (and endless lists) give the work bulk, but not much else.<br />Huge swaths of this book detail people traveling across great distances while the plot walks down the driveway to check the mail. Characterization and world-building? Sure. But it reeks of filler.<br />Phrases old and new are repeated over and over and over again. You can make a wonderful drinking game of the audio-book. One sip for \\"You know nothing, Jon Snow\\", two for \\"Nuncle\\" and finish the drink on \\"Words are wind\\".<br />Martin likens his writing to gardening. Indeed. He overmulched the perennials, forgot to cut back the liriope and hasn't trimmed the hedges in a decade. Wonderful flowers remain, but they need sunlight and Martin left his pruning shears in the shed.

B003NFM3JU|2.0|Everyone and his mother knows the story of this one and there needs no rehashing, so the question then becomes one of execution.  Were there spins to this tale that brought us to a better understanding of it while still remaining faithful to the story?<br /><br />For me, the answer was no.  This fully CGI tale, like the aliens in [[ASIN:B002VPE1AW Avatar (Original Theatrical Edition)]] and Gollum in [[ASIN:B000654ZK0 The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (Special Extended Edition)]], featured characters based off actors being scanned by computers and then filling in the images later.<br /><br />While this was a different interpretation of the story, I felt that Zemeckis fell a little too in love with the technology and lost focus on what matters--the story.  With a lot of swooping camera shots and a head-scratching action sequence involving a miniaturized Scrooge, this was turned into empty spectacle, not to mention I found it a little creepy seeing Gary Oldman's face on Bob Cratchit's body.  As for the story itself, I found Scrooge's transformation forced, a product more because the makers wanting it to happen rather than arising naturally from the character.<br /><br />While this version may appeal to children or anyone who hasn't seen one of the umpteen other versions of this story, it probably won't work for those us who have seen it before.  For me, the best version is the one with George C. Scott in the role of Scrooge [[ASIN:B003VS0CY2 A Christmas Carol [Blu-ray]]].

B004O3YGMC|5.0|This remote app is awesome!  You pay for the app one time and that's it.  No monthly sub. Sound and vid.  Only wish it was the same as iOS ver., but pretty sure it will be as Splashtop progresses, update, and enhance.  Logmein is good to, but you have to pay for sub to get audio.  Would highly recommend.  Don't think about it, just buy!  :)
B001MS7IBS|3.0|I have been a long time fan of Fringe, ever since the first season. So naturally I wanted to own this masterpiece and add it to my Blu-ray collections. My first issue is that, though minor I wish it was stated or maybe it was out. I received the UK version of season one. The case and sleeve have different pictures and descriptions. I was like OK what ever at first and then i popped it into my PS3 to find out that there is no main menu, no options, it just begins playing with episode 1. Even then I was like I can deal with that I mean honestly I'm a fan right? The video quality is not good it seems grainy and out of focus at some points. Honestly feels like a bootleg. I read everyone's reviews first and nothing seemed amiss so I ordered. I'm sure every one else has had good luck. I ordered season 2 along with it, everything is perfect, the picture, sound and yes even the menus. I do not believe there is anyway to check or verify which version you will get but just be leery.     All and all though I can deal with it, I just thought every Fringe fan should know.

B003QSBYNK|2.0|A politically correct (and therefore tasteless) look at the British Crown.   It is very disrespectful of the monarchy and the Royal Family, and early on plays up the death of Diana (who was a failure as a wife, mother, and human being). There is nothing to commend this disgusting film.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Im well pleased with this watch.Good size, comfortable strap. Stylish look. Thhis watch reminds me of A WW2 Army issue watch my Dad wore home from Europe in 1945
B003YL4LYI|4.0|This was another great addition to an amazing series, but its biggest fault is that it really just set up the next two books. While I loved the adventuring featured in this book, in the end, nothing really happened, there were no changes. My other problem with this book and all of his books is how he switches the point of view every chapter among multiple different characters. Each one is written very well, but the tone shifts with each character, and I end up reading the book chapter by chapter. I couldn't put the book down until I finished reading the chapter, but once it was over I had no desire to read what came next right away, unless it was one of my favorite characters. I also didn't like Jon Snows role in this book, he used to be one of my favorite characters, but in this one he was really bogged down by running the wall. Once again, in this book there were multiple main character deaths, which I find frustrating. Along with cliffhanger probably deaths, which if the people are actually dead I would be very upset and annoyed. It's nice to know that the characters are vulnerable, their victory isn't guaranteed, but I would still like for my favorite characters to win some of the time.<br /><br />My biggest fear with this series is that Martin might die before he finishes it. I don't mean any offense, but he doesn't look too healthy, and I doubt you could get someone to finish the series successfully. The fantasy world was lucky when Brandon Sanderson took over for Robert Jordan, I don't know if they'd be that lucky a second time. I hope that it won't take another 5 years to write each book, because he would then be 73, which is pushing it even for a healthy man. Still, I enjoyed this book and look forward to the end of the series.

B0009P5YXO|5.0|Who hasn't wanted a sonic screwdriver after watching Dr. Who?  It looks great, and the light and sound is perfect.  The only negative is that the special feltpen point for writing secret messages was dry when we received it, so it doesn't work.  But really, who cares?  I didn't order this item because I needed a pen, and frankly, I'm not sure why they tried to incorporate a pen into this device, anyway.  I've only had it a few weeks, so I don't know how long the batteries will last, but so far, so good.  Yes, I would recommend it to any Who afficianados.
0740748475|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my husband when he returned home after basic training. He loves these books and treats them like gold.

I hope it does the same for everyone!

B00127RAJY|5.0|This workout was challenging to say the least and there were several points when I nearly gave up the program thinking I couldn't do it. But then I started to FEEL the results and I knew this was working for me and that I had the power to change my life from the comfort of my own home. If you have the drive and the determination to stick to a program on your own and really push yourself to do the program how it was meant to be done, then you will get fantastic results. I bought this DVD after getting some of the Biggest Loser DVD's and I really enjoyed those, too. I really wanted to have a variety of workouts so I could vary my routine and really get the best overall results. This program is fast paced and you're constantly changing positions and going back and forth and it can be a little overwhelming at first. STICK WITH IT, it's worth it! It may be hard and you will be panting and sweating and tired but that's how you know it is good!   After I had my daughter I was 217 pounds (up from 150 when I got pregnant) and I was not happy with the way I looked. I knew I needed to get back into shape but we didn't have the money for gym memberships and I wouldn't have been comfortable at my current weight in a gym setting. My husband checked the reviews on Amazon and found this program and I thank him for it to this day. I am now 170 pounds, and dropping, with the help of this and other programs, as well as drastic changes to my diet and the help of supplements (Hydroxycut/protein shakes). Always consult your doctor before starting any routine, but this is an excellent program to really see results!
B00005Y6YB|5.0|What a great movie.  The movie follows the book very closely which of course is highly recommended as well.  Duvall and Jones were both perfect for their parts in the movie.  I suspect that many of the old time cowboys were a lot like the characters in this movie.
B000HC2LI0|4.0|Received package in a timely manner, however upon opening was apparent that it was a used collection.  Although we have not watched the entire series yet, disks from Season 3 have minor damage and took several attempts to play properly. Also the pilot script that is supposed to be included in The Complete Series case was missing.<br /><br />As far as collection content, it's The West Wing; the content is superior.

B000001GPX|3.0|Please somebody tell me I'm crazy but it seems that there's a huge mistake in the 4th movement of the 5th. It starts with the famous epic theme and keeps going smoothly. Then, in the beggining of the second minute of the movement, the music changes direction back again to the epic theme that started the movement. This epic theme should not return again until later on the piece and from that 2nd epic theme the movement runs fine until the end without any further mistakes. But, again, the epic theme is repeated 3 times and the movement ends up lasting more then 11 minutes against a regular 8 minutes and something because of this extra music.    Am I the only one who noticed that?!?! Or do I have one mistaken disk? Or am I just crazy????

B000244FDW|4.0|There are 4 film version of Pride and Prejudice, each with something to recommend them. This 4 hour version was done by the BBC around 1979, and it looks it. The color is washed out. I wish they would restore it, for there are some excellences not reached in the other versions, to be found here. I believe the best Jane is here. She is at least equal to Lizzy in beauty, and warm and expessive. The acting by all is well done, as is true for all acting in all versions except Wickham in the Keira Knightly P&P. I'm afraid the costumers did Lizzy no favors in this film (see cover).  She often looks like an atrractive woman in the wrong clothes, today I am specially thinking of her blue travelling clothes when she goes to Pemberley.  These are my favorite Gardiners, too, especially Mrs. Gardiner, although Mr. Gardiner in the Knightly version is also strong.  Pemberly scenes, which are always my favorites, were done well. Our Pemberly here is not as imposing as in later versions, but suitable, and the visitors actually get to go on their walk in this version.  I was a bit surprised to find Lizzy at the inn in Lambton grasping her letters from Jane about Lydia's elopement, and then running from Lambton to Pemberley, altho Darcy brags of doing the run as a youth in the Knightly version. It's a long way. I prefer the wonderful scene in the Keira Knightly version, which is otherwise not as good at displaying Pemberly or the action there. (Unspoiler alert, I'm not going to describe it but it is wonderful.)<br /><br />I hadn't thought of it before, but this movie has voice overs of Elizabeth's thoughts. The novel often describes her thoughts, sometimes dramatizing them but frequently not, and this has always been a problem for people staging or making a film of the novel. Voice overs are not very dramatic. The letters run a close second in dramatic problems for the same reason, yet they deliver key information and must be included. Here they are generally given as voice overs, and shortened. In the Knightly version they are often dramatized, behind the voice overs, which works better as the dramatizations are the images the letters would create in the readers mind, we hope.<br /><br />Reasonably faithful to the book - especially in including some of the later scenes which are often skipped.

B003UESJ9M|5.0|I have no idea why so many critics, paid to provide insight, fail to see the mix of beauty and tragedy in this movie.  If I based my decision to watch Country Strong on what they said I'd have missed out on a remarkable film, rich in many many ways.  I'm not a diehard country music, Tim McGraw or Gwyneth Paltrow fan; nor am I a big movie goer or DVD watcher.  I am, however, a recovering alcoholic/addict and, from that perspective, this movie is one of the best of its kind.  For those in recovery (even those in AFG & similar groups), this portrayal will hit you in the heart.  For those who know someone in recovery, this movie has the potential to add understanding to what it's like to be in the grips of a death-threatening disease (fame aside, there's plenty of everyday Kelly Canters in the world).  For those who have no direct or indirect link to alcoholism, you are bound to appreciate life all the more by the movie's end.    From a purely moviegoer perspective, in my opinion, Country Strong is genuine to the core.  There's no better example of some people being true to themselves and some not.  Paltrow should get an award for this performance, if not at least nominations to several.  The young actors Garrett Hedlund and Leighton Meester give it their all and it shows.  (pay close attention to Hedlund's lines - lots of wisdom there).    If I were to have any criticism of this film (and only bittersweet at worst), it would be casting Tim McGraw in it.  A number of actors could have played Canter's husband to much better effect (absolutely no offense to the trillions of McGraw fans out there). Then again, if he drew more to see the movie, all the better.  I still say stick to the music, Tim - you're a master at that!    With so many in the entertainment industry flocking into rehab, it would be hard to believe this movie doesn't (sadly) resonate with the actual reality of some of their stories.  If someone told me a Loretta Lynn or Patsy Cline caliber singer had the same struggles Kelly Canter does, I wouldn't be surprised in the least.        Two hours of powerful performances, emotion evoking story lines and subtle wisdom - alcoholic or not, you couldn't expect more.
B0048ELDQY|3.0|Well to start with, I bought this book because I thought it was about classical physics. In fact this is a book about quantum physics. Now I like to read about quantum mechanics too, but I feel there should be a subtitle which alerts you to what you're actually getting. Overall the book is a decent primer on quantum mechanics. As a layman I found the information helpful to a point. I feel that too many details were left out, and that the reader was just supposed to accept open ended assumptions about the nature of the quantum world. Although that is a common method of writing books about science in general, this book was over simplified. The dog analogy got to be a little old pretty quick, as before you know it the dog knows as much as the author. I just also read \\"Dance of the Photons\\" by Anton Zeilinger. It's a little more expensive, but I felt it did a much better job of filling in the gaps, and I would recommend that if you are going to choose only one book, get that one instead.<br /><br />Update:<br />The books by Kenneth Ford are the best on the subject of quantum mechanics. I recommend these two highly.<br /><br />[[ASIN:067401832X The Quantum World: Quantum Physics for Everyone]]:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007QWVR66 101 Quantum Questions]]

B001UV4XHY|5.0|Despite the reviews that said the movie was stuck in the woods and terrible, Part 1 was surprisingly good. In fact, it was LESS disappointing than Part 2--which I saw in 3D IMAX for too much money--I have to admit. The Harry Potter-Hermione fantasy that had people up in arms and was not in the book was hilarious!

B005DJRD80|3.0|Going for Juno but failing, Awkward is exactly that...AWKWARD to the extreme. Everyone thinks the main character tried to kill herself when really she just slipped in her bathroom and only nearly died of the embarrassment of having to walk around with a neck brace and an arm cast and being thought to have tried to kill herself. She's in love with a big, awful dork who she loses her virginity to in a utility closet practically before we've even figured out her name. So, far...just plain uncomfortable and kinda vulgar. Though, who could expect less than the latter from  MTV?
1596432594|4.0|I am very much a fan of Feynman. I met him a couple of times, heard him lecture a few times, and \\"grew up\\" on the [[ASIN:0805390456 \\"Lectures\\"]], of which I have copies of the first editions. He was a brilliant physicist as well as a brilliant raconteur; some argue, with cause, that the latter leads non-physicists to overrate his significance in twentieth century physics. But he was one of the leading physicists of his century, and his skills as a teacher made him beloved by the generations of physicists who have followed him.<br /><br />This well done and mostly easy-reading graphic \\"biography\\" tells the Feynman story with Feynman as narrator. It is, of course, a posthumous narration and, as such, represents a bit of hagiography on the part of the author (Ottaviani). But the voice of Feynman comes through, and with it, for me, comes a pleasing sense of nostalgia.<br /><br />What keeps me from five stars is that this is presented as a biography, while it is actually a compilation of Feynman's reminiscences in graphic form. So it is really a posthumous memoir, and if were billed as that I would give it five stars. But it is called a biography, and as such it fails because it lacks any independent or critical viewpoint.<br /><br />But don't let that keep you from reading it. The Feynman story as told by Feynman is a terrific story, even if his contemporaries might have quibbled with pieces here and there. Love it on its own terms.

B005BCE7FQ|5.0|An engaging story that will keep adults as well as kids entertained. Unlike some movies, the 3D version of this movie really is an enhancement. It's not something just thrown together as an afterthought. I watched this on a Vizio XVT3D474SV3D TV from a Vizio VBR133 3D Blu-ray player with active-shutter glasses. The 3D picture is very crisp.

B00540G3G6|4.0|I only had this film on DVD and needed an excuse to upgrade, this combo package gave me the excuse I needed. I am a huge fan of 3D when it is done right, and I recognize converted films don't always look great in 3D, but this one is actually pretty nice. The 3D does work very well by way of adding depth to the film, it's like you're watching through a window, though this feature is more like a value added bonus, it doesn't really add anything to the film itself because the film was not originally intended to be a 3D film. Still it looks good as a nice bonus and you shouldn't shy away from this package, especially if you were turned off by Clash of the Titans, this film makes the case that you can have good 3D conversions.
1451629184|4.0|This compelling story is compellingly told, but unevenly written.  The editors (if there were any) should be ashamed of themselves; there were just too many basic errors in grammar, style and usage. Ms. Dugard deserves great praise as a human being and as a storyteller.
0765324857|5.0|Great read! I finished it in a weekend which is considerably less time than it took me to play the game(s). Starting at the moment when Andrew Ryan decides he must build Rapture and culminating before the events of Bioshock, the book seeks to give the reader an incite into the grandeur of Rapture and it's fall from greatness. It also clarifies relationships between characters that many gamers might find interesting. This book was definitely written with people who have played both Bioshock games in mind, it's almost as though you can see Rapture and hear it's residents when you read this book.
B004SBX112|1.0|I bought this app for my droid x2.  When i tried to install it, it kept saying it needed a wifi connection.  I have a wifi connection and even when I put it right on top of my wifi router, it still would not download.  Angry Birds ad free downloaded and plays just fine.
B004AQPPNM|4.0|Many, many bands after a few albums, start to stray away from the screaming and such, A7X and Atreyu to name two. First, it's pretty hard on their voices as they age (Matt shadows hardly screams any of his old stuff live anymore), and while it sounds awesome, most radio stations don't play heavy screamo. Sad but true. So if bands want to make more money they have to find a happy medium, and I think that's what ADTR is searching for. But I don't believe it makes them sell outs. This album is still good, but you have to look at it from a different perspective. Bands naturally grow and change - just look at Linkin Park - and where they may want to go with their music may not be where you want them to go with it, or where you wanted them to stay with it.   This album is catchy and will bring a lot of new ADTR fans to the scene, especially with songs like \\"It's Complicated\\". If you're looking for an album that is a mirror of \\"Homesick\\" you won't find that here, but you still will find a good album that, in my opinion, is still worth the buy.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|I just really felt compelled to voice my disappointment in this release. I really hate having to submit this 'review' at all as it's a pet peeve not to EVER post any 'review' for a product that is not out yet. So this gives you an idea of how much Lucas' tinkering is bugging me. I'm not going to post the long details as they've all been covered by all those before me who have elaborated on all the changes like Obi Wan's call and Vader's \\"No.\\" in ROTJ that make those scenes laughable now.  Who knows what changes exist that we don't even know about?  But enough is enough. I just cancelled my pre-order. :(
B003V6L94Q|5.0|I purchased this product because my infant (yes infant) daughter was a fan of \\"As She's Walking Away\\" - smiles everytime it plays. I purchased it for long car rides and such because not only does she love it, but it calms her down when she gets upset. Anywho...I don't usually listen to much country, but I have to say I love every song on this CD. My husband is not much of a country fan either, but also enjoys this CD.
0385534639|3.0|To say I had conflicting thoughts on this book would be an understatement.  To make it a bit easier to express what I thought of it, I think it would be easier to divide my star rating into two; for the first half of the book, I give it two stars.  For the latter half, I give it four.<br /><br />I began reading this with very high expectations, which probably contributed to the major disappointment I felt fifty to one hundred pages in.  From the glowing reviews, one even comparing it to Harry Potter, I was expecting to be riveted.  And...I wasn't.  The first few chapters were promising.  Breathtaking descriptions and imagery, and mysterious characters, brief scenes with magical undertones, and an intriguing set-up to the conflict had me thinking the following chapters would be fast-paced.  Not so.<br /><br />This book dragged painfully in the middle, piling details and uninteresting characters on top of each other until I was literally counting down the pages.  This is not to say that the fantastic imagery and description stopped; it didn't.  Morgenstern's figurative language and imagery are top-notch and enchanting, fitting of the visually captivating circus she creates.<br /><br />My main problem with the narrative were the characters.  Good god, the characters.  The protagonists, Celia and Marco, were as flat as cardboard.  I didn't understand either of them, despite the surplus pages featuring their boring interactions.  Maybe this is being nitpicky, but it bothers me when characters laugh too much in dialogue.  \\"Celia laughs\\" seemed to be the main reaction of our heroine, in every scene with dialogue.  For one, it's tedious after a while.  For another, it's almost like the author is pointing out the wittiness of her own dialogue.  Also, Marco and Celia were just too...pretentious and self-important.  Celia transformed from a quiet, abused child who watched her mother die to a radiant, confident woman possessing both beauty and social graces, who spends more time showing off her dresses than I cared to read about.  And Marco was just pompous.<br /><br />As for the supporting characters, almost everyone is just too cryptic.  Tsukiko smokes a lot and smiles, but who is she?  No idea.  Same with Prospero and the grey-suited man.  We're given too many characters with all the answers, who don't really reveal anything, despite having excessive page space to do so.<br /><br />Some of the characters I did find interesting, although they still could have used a bit more fleshing out, were Poppet and Widget.  I almost wished the book had been written entirely about them, because their sibling relationship was much more interesting than any other character dynamic.  Bailey's perspective, at first out of place, really grew on me as the story continued.<br /><br />Now for the ending.  (Maybe spoiler-ish?)  I liked it.  I thought it was appropriate for these characters, and I was especially happy with Poppet and Widget's roles.  Bailey, too, I guess, although he was kind of just convenient.  I didn't really understand the whole \\"it's all about timing\\" bit.  I loved the ship made of books scene--definitely my favorite Celia/Marco interaction, if for the setting, not the characters.<br /><br />I may be being overly critical of the two main characters.  Mostly I grew frustrated with the absurd amount of useless chapters--this book could have easily been cut down by one hundred pages, maybe more.  Although I was expecting more than I got from this book, but that does not diminish the quality of the imagery.  I liked the imagination of the different tents, although the second-person point-of-view felt a bit too intrusive at points.  Using \\"you\\" should really be more for detached observation, in my opinion, not specific actions and choices, because obviously not everyone reacts the same.<br /><br />Before I get too nit-picky, I think I'm comfortable with rating this three stars.  \\"It's OK\\" fits what I felt about this book perfectly.  My earlyfrustration was mostly appeased by the ending, and I'm glad it left off on a good note.  I probably won't be picking up anything by this author again, especially if it's of comparable length, but I may just go see the movie if it has the book ship scene.m glad it left off on a good note.

B0019O6IWU|5.0|After reading this book then many of it's reviews, I believe that maybe my review can help someone make an informed choice. If only for how I listen to, and shape my internal dialogue, this book is an excellent resource. There is never going to be one cure all book. No life is perfectly executed. Everyone can benifit from perspectives outside of their own. Read this book and learn it's teachings then read other books, rinse and repeat. Fill your life toolbox, and enjoy all of the moments.
0736083863|5.0|Not like I was looking for another anatomy book, but when I came across this one, I just had to get it. I really like this book because of the illustrations you see with each Pilates exercise.  It's a great book for those of us who love Pilates and what it does to our bodies, but decided to skip med school.  I wouldn't necessarily call this \\"Anatomy for Dummies\\" but it kind of has that same appeal. It's easy to understand. It wasn't written for doctors or med students.  Worth the money.
B005FRF6PC|1.0|I just read the Sample and could not &#34;Hear&#34; Rafa at all.  Not a word sounded as if it came out of his own mouth......another book actually written by a Ghostwriter......probably with a handful of notes from the subject.  NOBODY is talking about the book at all...or anything that was said in it.  This book was over 20.00 to begin with.  After only one week it is half that.  This tells you all you need to know.    Save your money and pass this one by.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I wouldn't pay for a new \\"version\\" of Citizen Kane with CGI slapped over it and shoddy new voice overs, and I won't pay for this nonsense either. As far as I'm concerned the Star Wars films are simply out of print and unavailable.  Someday, film preservationists may be able to salvage these films for posterity, but sadly for the time being they have been destroyed by their own creator.  He has every right as the copyright holder to do what he wants, but I have every right to voice my disgust and vote \\"no\\" with my wallet.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|George, star wars not need any editing, they are classics (specially original trilogy), no more editing please, get a life.
B005KGPBM6|2.0|When I first started watching this movie, I really thought I was in for something that spoke out against the Fred Phelps mentality in a strong way... or maybe gave us a direction of attack to put those types of protests to rest without us having to give up our right to free speech.  Sadly, I got neither one.  Despite the other two reviews here giving suspiciously high ratings of the film, I really can't recommend it.<br /><br />I'm also somewhat disturbed by how law enforcement is represented here.  It's pretty clear that someone involved in this movie had something against cops based on the portrayal.  Granted, I have a bit of bias here, as I used to work very closely with law enforcement myself, so I tend to side with them more than not, but this movie clearly went over the top to try to put them in a negative light and make them look like idiots.<br /><br />The more I watched, the more I hoped that the movie would turn around at the end, but when I walked away, I couldn't help but think that I should have done something better with my time.  Maybe Kevin Smith wanted to finally end a movie the way he originally wanted to end Clerks.  If that was his goal, he achieved it, but very little else.  As someone who really does like a lot of Smith's other films, I'm really disappointed.
B003O7I6SY|3.0|Unfortunately this decent bond movie was not cleaned up for blu ray release , unlike the other bond movies out on blu ray. There is dirt and scratches present and they could have cleaned these up easily. There is no excuse for this. The colors are not vibrant , but they were not shot on the best of film as I have read.  So the color issue is a minor one, it's the damn scratches and dirt. That's not ACCEPTABLE on blu ray. As for the movie, many hate this one as it's a remake of 'thunderball\\", I don't , It was a hit movie back then in the 80's because it's a decent movie. This has no missing scenes at least. And AMAZON needs to seperated blu ray and dvd releases. But they won't and it's lame. But what can you do?  I would give the blu ray  2 stars alone, but the movie is enjoyable still and Deserves more stars so I settled on three stars.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|There is no way I'm buying this, already bought two dvd versions, the first one and the second one with the \\"original\\" versions which were pathetic.  Now I just saw the abomination that is Obi-wan's \\"howl\\" Darth Vader's Noooooo....my word exactly.
1935670913|5.0|So many emotions ran through me while I was reading this book. I cried over investing more than 25,000 in my own book that isn't a published success. I guess that's when I immediately connected with John.  I jumped for joy when I understood why my book wasn't a best seller and how you showed me a way to turn it into a success.<br /><br />I would have never bought this book, but on one of my adventures seeking help in creating a buzz for my book with the SBDC (Small Business Development Center) they recommended I purchase it. Right away I thought another five bucks out of my pocket. Hey, what's it matter when I already spent over twenty-five grand! This was the best five dollars I ever invested in my publishing business. I know things won't happen overnight. I know I am capable of implementing what John advises and I will be successful at it. The best part is that what John recommends to do is FREE. Here's to hopefully being an OOU someday! I highly recommend this book for all self-publishers!

B003ZSJ212|1.0|After the endless backlash against the previous changes to the films and the incoherent revisionism done to the mythology, you would think he would leave good enough alone. But changing the films again is Lucas spitting in the face of his fans and laughing all the way to the bank. He is simply too arrogant and narrow minded to admit to his many errors and restore them back to the way they should be. If the gullible fanboys still but this tripe then they are just as guilty for supporting it. The ironic part is the abominable prequels will never be altered. To Lucas these are perfect masterpieces.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Half-assed!  Actually, if this set was as half as good as it could've been, I think I'd accept that! More like 1/16 assed!  Do we get a new 4k transfer? No, a 2k one from 2004 with crushed blacks and crappy looking lightsabres.  Do we get the original cuts of each of the films, along with the newer versions, ala Blade Runner, The Exorcist, Apocalypse Now, Alien Anthology, etc. Did Lucas at least come to his senses and remove so of the more maligned changes - Greedo firing first, chopping up the climax of Empire by showing us Vader getting to his ship, every step of the way, including an obvious outtake from Return of the Jedi crudely inserted, Hayden's head crudely cut and pasted on Sebastian Shaw's body at the end of Return? No, he's added even more distracting and nonsensical changes.    At least wait until these hit the bargain bin, maybe less than $30 dollars for the whole set.  Star Wars and its fans deserve a whole lot better!
1451629184|5.0|I read this book on one single sitting.  It's extraordinary, not only for it's content but for what it represents.  I felt like I was looking at a picture from the past, that I was actually given permission to \\"see\\" this wonderful woman's recollections of that horrible time.  The way the book is narrated gave me the opportunity to feel the way a person (Dugard in this case) remembers 18 full years of life.  The moment she describes the abduction I was aware I was reading something pressious, listening to the words that only she could say, the accounts that only a person who suffers such an attack can tell you.  The Refections where a great addition, for they explain most of what's left out on the chapters, and the Introduction lets you know exactly what you get from the book: a real account of Dugard's memories of her \\"Stolen Life\\"

B005DD7H50|3.0|LIMITLESS was one of those movies I really wanted to see after I saw the previews.<br />The premise of the film was great and insightful.<br /><br />The first half of the movie lived up to the expectations and set the proper tone for what this sort of experience and capability would be like.<br /><br />But the second half of the movie seemed like it was written by a different screenplay writer and led by a different Director.<br />The second half of the movie really faded into a sort of comedy and all the tensions and initial build-up was lost.<br /><br />In the end, the film failed to fully capitalize on its initial brilliance.<br /><br />Add to that the fact one must overlook the obvious logic flaws in the movie .....<br /><br />Foe example, if this drug was able to make your mind so sharp and able to learn and master new skills like Classical Music and 3-4 foreign languages in only 2 days, would it have not seemed obvious to spend 3-4 days learning Chemistry so you could synthesize the mind enhancing drug yourself and thus not be reliant on somebody else for a supply ?<br /><br />A good premise and entertaining movie that did not quite reach its potential
B00004U2GH|5.0|Johnny Cash is a voice from along time ago for me, a voice I heard and enjoyed for the first time in North Carolina in the late 60s, yes after Woodstock that occupied my musical conscience a lot too. What attracts me, and many other people, in this music?<br /><br />First it is the country style, and I should say his country style which is very distinctive by the voice and the systematic, too systematic some would say, opening chords. We can recognize his songs because of that trait. It is not in every song, for sure, but quite present.<br /><br />Second the themes are often dealing with crime, outlaw-ness, prison, the death penalty, the loss of freedom and the dream of freedom. Of course his concerts in prisons are famous and the songs he wrote to these prisons are well-known but he sings in prisons and about prisons to celebrate freedom, a sort of compensation for the inmates, a sort of relief for the ex-con he may have been, the demonstration that no matter what a man is free everywhere, even where he is locked up and tied up and humiliated. Freedom is in the head and not in the hands and guns of judges that gavel things away and prison wardens that ring their sticks on all the bars of the gates.<br /><br />The third interest is his singing about love. For him love is simple: I am yours and you are mine, hence I keep on the line. That means love is a way to live with someone else and to share duties and chores, to live under common choices and with common objectives. He does not elaborate on the subject more than that.<br /><br />The fourth element is America and its rebellious history. It is amazing how he rewrites the history of the United States in that simple perspective that the constitution is to be improved all the time to keep the promise of a government from the people, for the people and by the people. At times he speaks like Obama spoke in his campaign. But he does not deal with the serious dramas of modern history that we know. These dramas were divisive and he looks for unity, the unity of the United States after Gettysburg.<br /><br />Then he wrote some songs that were absolutely luminously brilliant and my favorite in that line is the Boy Named Sue. It portrays the relation between a father and a son in the most loving and moving terms. I think that it is probably one of the best songs ever written in the world about that subject, the recognition of the enormous debt a son has towards his father, and the acknowledgement of the tremendous responsibility a father has towards his son. And what's more this is contradictory and that contradiction is expressed entirely in a name. No love is lost here but there is a lot of love there anyway, but certainly not wasted.<br /><br />The song about his ending up in prison because he was picking a dandelion flower after midnight in a city that had a curfew to prevent the roaming around of bad guys is also very funny and original, and yes I have experienced that in a small city in North Carolina. I did not end up in prison and with a ticket but I had to prove my identity because I was too close to some flowers in the street late at night.<br /><br />That's what is most moving in Johnny Cash. He is speaking to us of a world that we have encountered, visited, liked and feared, disliked and jeered, and the night when I was more or less \\"kidnapped\\" for a few hours by some frantic students who pretended to be the Ku Klux Klan is one episode that goes in that direction: a deep love-fear relation with the deeper layers of the American society.<br /><br />And yet I defended peace in Vietnam under Nixon, including in the press and no one ever said anything against the right to do so, even if they were in full disagreement with the content. My best recollection in that line is when I was asked, by a local newspaper, my opinion on Davis California in 1974 or so and I answered that I loved the extreme quiet working atmosphere of this campus city but that it was cut from the rest of theworld like an intellectual ghetto.

But the story in itself is what confuses me.  Why write a teen book with such eerie pictures?  Most of the people young enough to find this story inspiring will find the photographs disturbing and nightmarish, while those who would like the pictures are too old to enjoy such story.  To me this contradiction makes Miss Peregrine's ahd her children's book a difficult one to recommend.

B002ZG98C8|5.0|There will be no Oscars. There will be no awards. But that's Okay. This movie is simply a lot of fun to watch. Sure there are large plot holes. And the scritpt isn't tight. But so what. It's bloody, it's over the top and it's just perfect the way it is.  Danny Trejo has been a favorite 2nd banana actor of mine for years. Great to see him in a lead role. Robert Deniro as a whacked out Senator? Of course, why not! Lindsay Lohan as a drug adled psycho - type casting. Same with Steven Segal - sure he's bloated and weighs 300 pounds, but as a sleazy Drug boss - he's perfect, he may finally have found a role that really suits him.  I love this movie. It's not art, but it's great fun and I expect I'll watch it several times more in the next few years. Highly recommended.

B00428ZRFE|5.0|Her best album yet.  Album is full with singles/hits. This album takes you on a trip to a happy place.  The best album of the year!!!!!! Well done.
B004SC8XHI|4.0|Groovy instrumentals (a few words are spoken during \\"The End\\") by Booker T. and the MG's at their best.  Really gives a new perspective on the songs being done in a soulful fashion.  I guess I know the Beatles album too well as I don't care for the sequence of the songs.  Might have been better had they stuck to the original sequence.  Still, great music from the late '60's and the original Stax Studios.
0812550706|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this story.  It kept me engaged and wanting more.  I highly recommend it to anyone who likes a good story and interesting characters who feel very human in a wonderful science fiction environment.

030746363X|5.0|This book has changed my life. I was 20 years old and weighted in at 305lbs and in just 3 short months I'm down to 255lbs with almost no exercise. I feel amazing, I'm told I look so much better, I've dropped from 5XL shirts to 2XL shirts and probably the most important thing is I'm NEVER hungry. Thank you Tim Ferriss you've changed my life for the better.    I think if your are struggling with weight issues, this will change your life.
B004HO6I4W|2.0|I have purchased the Blu-ray/DVD/Digital combo of Rio and was excited to be able to view the movie in a very crisp, vibrant, colorful high resolution of blu-ray only to find that PS3 would not play the blu-ray disk.  I then went on to do some research and found out that I am not the only one having these issues.  Don't get me wrong, the movie is great, once you can actually watch it.  This review is based on the item, not the movie itself.
030788743X|5.0|I usually don't take the time to do reviews, but this one was amazing.  If you grew up in the 80s, read this book...
B003ZSJ212|1.0|It baffles me how he doesn't care about his fan base. Nobody should purchase these blu-rays. Anybody who does is just encouraging him to to take a flaming dump on these movies. Stop eating George Lucas' doo-doo butter.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Sorry, but I've watched the new added scenes and voices, and it just completely destroys the movies. I don't know Lucas feels the need to go back and change things that never needed changing. Why he ignores his fans at all costs..
B004LWZW4M|4.0|I must say I truly enjoyed this movie.  I heard about it prior to going and I am glad I went to see it for myself. I immediately fell in love with Casear from the time he was an infant. To watch him become so human and smart was crazy it was rather touching and to see that although he was raised with love he infact got to see the real world and the evil there in. I couldn't wait to see the making of the movie for to see apes all over the place and moving at such high speed was remarkable. To see that even after Will had to send him away the initial reception Casear received from the other chimps only for him to be the man in charge in the end.  Loved the communication that the chimps had acquired between themselves, survivor of the fittest.  The affection that Will had for Casear was a parent has for there child so much love and wanting to protect his own. I loved Casear's eyes and I loved the man that played that character for truly he had that role down to a science. He did his research very well to literaly walk in the manner that an ape does with all the emotions/intel that Casear protrayed. I think the producers did a great job and I thoughly enjoyed watching it on the big screen. Yes I will be buying it when it comes out on DVD
B004U8VWLE|5.0|The Bottom Line:    A lacerating, sometimes hard-to-watch meditation on art and the artist, Black Swan is one of the most unsettling movies to gain a Best Picture nomination in some time and certainly one of the most deserving: well-acted (especially by the hit-or-miss Portman), with astonishing cinematography and masterful direction, Black Swan might be slightly below the bar Aronofky set for himself with Requiem for a Dream, but it's a modern masterpiece.    4/4
B0028RXXE8|5.0|great series - fast shipping, product exactly as described- well packed - i liked the extras and the commentary is great to understand some of the odd comments
006097625X|5.0|This is a remarkable book.<br /><br />Its subject matter may not at first appeal to you. As Scott McCloud explains, in many cultures the `comic' is regarded as a third rate communication medium reserved for children.<br /><br />However what Scott provides here is an engaging and compelling exploration of the challenge of communicating ideas, from the lifeless sheet of paper to the readers mind, in ways that energise the reader. What I love is the way the book matches form with function, It is written as a comic and demonstrates the power of the form as it explains it.<br /><br />The description of Magritte's painting `The Treachery of Images' is wonderful, and in common with the book as a whole will help you rethink your approach to communication.
B0051CSIKQ|3.0|i liked the movie, i love end of the world as we know it zombie/vampire movies and books... i deducted a star for the anti-christian theme that was totally unnecesary for the plot line...

Do be sure to measure your device if it is not an Apple 15\\" MacBook. I like the material on the inside, nothing scratchy in there. Well made...
B004123CO4|5.0|One of the best books I ever read about flash photography. A step by step approach, well explained, in easy language, with lots of examples with photos. If you like photography and want to improve your skills using flash this book is for you. By the way I bought the Kindle edition.
B0053EZXRS|4.0|Intense Action from start to finish and a surprisingly well developed storyline!  This movie was completely UNDERRATED, my guess is word of mouth will make it a CULT CLASSIC. Nicholas Cage rarely makes a boring movie - he definitely did not disappoint on this one! Amber Heard also did a great job she's seemingly much more than a pretty face. Check this one out and tell a friend!
0307387178|5.0|The story of the life of Christopher McCandless who aged 24 set off into Alaska on a personal odyssey aiming to survive on what he could gather or trap. Chris was to die only a few months later of starvation losing his personal battle against the elements. His story is carefully told here by Krakauer who not only paints a picture of Chris's life but also shares his personal experience of the compulsion to rebel against a conventional lifestyle.<br /><br />Reading other reviews of the book, many focus on McCandless, either seeing him as naive, idealistic and misguided, or praising him as a courageous modern day embodiment of Thoreu or Jack London.<br /><br />The real joy of the book for me is that it reveals the paradox that he is both of these at the same instant.<br /><br />We are creating an increasingly myopic society with ever narrowing definitions of what is right. The result is an increasing pressure to conform, and the destruction of diversity. We have overseen the destruction of `unworthy' human cultures and are speaking openly of the inevitability that species for which we've found no need will soon disappear.<br /><br />The future has never been less certain, and yet we seem destined to pin our faith on a narrowing set of options.<br /><br />Sad though the subject of this book may seem, it is also a call to each of us to question ourselves about what really matters and the part we should each play.<br /><br />The book has since been turned into a feature film with the same title.

B002ZG97EC|1.0|I purchased Despicable Me (Three-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy) for my granddaughter's birthday. The Blu-ray would not play properly. The DVD would stop playing & freeze in the middle of the movie. I returned Despicable Me to Amazon for a replacement, only to receive a DVD with the exact problem.  Don't purchase this movie, if you do you'll be disappointed.
B004Z2TUGE|1.0|Ugghh! the same ol'dumb story. Pretty girl, pretty boy, some monsters and cool music and lets call it a movie and not a 2 hour long music video.  The plot was simple early in the beginning you've pretty much figured out what is going to happen. The kid is arrogant and his behavior contradicts normal convention. When being chased you don't draw attention to yourself, you especially don't stop to take the time to develop pictures. Hey, I only spent a dollar and two hours of my life, if you have the money and time to waste Knock yourself out.

0865479186|5.0|In Bad Science, Ben Goldacre shares his one man crusade to debunk the misapplication of science by those who claim scientific knowledge and the media who all too frequently take the wearing of a white lab coat as the assurance that whatever crazy idea is proposed, immutable scientific fact has underwritten it.<br /><br />Beginning with softer targets and working to a crescendo, chapter by chapter<br />Goldacre makes a compelling argument that widespread misapplication of scientific thinking, is rife throughout medicine. He debunks numerous health scares and fashionable treatments and aims to help readers better understand where science has been misapplied, or should never have been applied at all.<br /><br />He exposes the systematic misapplication of pseudo scientific mumbo-jumbo, and the widespread inability of the media or the public at large to see through the myths created by those selling their cures and potions, from the herbalist to the multi-national pharmaceutical corporation.<br /><br />The early chapters use simple everyday examples, and having established the mechanism by which illusions are perpetrated and maintained, the later chapters reveal these same abuses applied on far grander scales.<br /><br />For example the detox footbath, in which feet are emerged in an inonising unit which magically changes the `energy field of water', is revealed not to turn the water brown with toxins released from the feet, but simply by the formation of rust. This would be revealed by the simplest imaginable test. Switch on the machine without placing your feet in it, and the water turns just as brown.<br /><br />Goldacre goes on to reveal a suite of approaches, from cherry picking data, to sifting through trial results before deciding what the trial was meant to prove, to the exploitation of the placebo effect.<br /><br />The book builds towards more widespread and large scale abuses, including an alarming dissection of the hysteria surrounding the MRSA vaccination program which is a sobering read.<br /><br />As with the related title `Reckoning with Risk', the focus of the book is on medical science. This is not because it is an area any more susceptible to scientific abuse, but rather because its potential personal impact on each of us, draws our attention more readily. Barely a day goes by without a headline of a wonder cure or an identified cause for disease hitting the front pages. Goldacre has not far to look for a second volume of this work.<br /><br />There is an irony in this book. As his title suggests, Goldacre is a firm believer in good science. The charlatans he exposes are revealed for their misapplication of science and this obscures the fact that there are other ways of seeing the world than through scientific eyes. There is a great danger that in exposing bad science, we sweep aside everything that fails the `good science' test.ogram which is a sobering read.<br /><br />As with the related title `Reckoning with Risk', the focus of the book is on medical science.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|When I watch the Star Wars trilogy on my 90\\" projector screen... I'm still watching it on a 15 year old laserdisc. Why? Because I want to watch the movies that were originally created between '77 and '83. So-called \\"warts\\" and all. Everything Mr. Lucas has released since 1995 ARE NOT THESE FILMS. Break the abusive cycle, and DO NOT BUY THIS SET.
B000TO0T4O|5.0|This is an exciting book to read. I enjoy James Patterson books and was nervous to try another author , I was not disappointed.  I read it in about two days, would have done it in one sitting but life got busy. It was hard to put down.  Looking forward to more of his books.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|ok, I just finished reading this book and I loved it.  I was searching Kindle for an inexpensive romantic read.  I read the reviews and sample and decided to go for it; great decision.  This book was so good.    It simply shows the organic growth of a relationship between college age young adults.  The guy is a passionate man who loves hard and the girl who grows to love him but is challenged by how passionate his love is.    The author did a great job of showing the evolution of their relationship. The story was believable.    You will not be dissapointed; must read.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Jaycee Dugard has to be one of the strongest women in the world to have dealt with the physical and psychological torture that the Garridos put her through. This book was absolutely amazing, and I applaud her for putting her story out there. Please disregard the extra $2.00 for this book as extra proceeds go to a foundation for people that have been through what she has been through. It's worth the inflated price. The book itself is amazing. She constantly apologizes for jumping from topic to topic, but explains that this was how she felt during her time with the Garridos and sometimes wasn't privy to certain information. Basically, we get the story exactly as she went through this ordeal. The writing itself is actually quite good for someone who has a limited education, and she explains that she wanted to be a writer before her life was taken away from her. Kudos to Jaycee for living her dream after having a major portion of her life stolen from her.
B003Y5H5AQ|5.0|I was so excited to hear they were making the movie, that I couldn't wait till July when the movie came out. Loved it so much that I thought they made it so well that today's children could come to Love the Smurfs as much as I did when I first saw them in 1981. I even changed my phone ring to \\"La La La La La La\\". Can't wait to get the DVD on Blue Ray especially with The Christmas Carol Bonus.... Yeah!!! Go SURFS!!!!!!! Lets Make a Sequel!!! Love them Viola and Frank... La La La La La La, Sing a Happy Song...

B004DK49DW|5.0|Social Distortion's Hard Times and Nursery Rhymes is a complete album. I like it more and more each time I listen to it. Each song rocks.  Mike Ness continues to grow as an artist and his versatility is evident with this album. The lyrics are solid and the music is great. I highly recommend it and can't wait for their next release!  SD is still going strong!
B000PMLFRA|1.0|I write this review simply to express my personal dissatisfaction with the missing originals. The problem is, the new blu-ray release of Star Wars does not include original version of the first three movies published (VI-VI), and like many other fans I cannot decide whether do be more disappointed or annoyed.    Other fans are entitled to agree or disagree, I just want to express my frustration and that such frustration should be reflected in the overall rating.    Of course the copyright holders can do what they want - but I am among the many people who prefer the original releases in the case of Star Wars, and I agree with other critics that the later \\"adjustments\\" do not add anything, but rather serve as downgradings of the overall quality of the original storytelling.    But whether one likes or dislikes the revised editions is not so much the matter here. The real issue is: The theatrical releases are very much in public demand, and furthermore, as a general rule, making original releases de facto unavailable is really, really bad form. (Star Wars IV-VI original versions are availavble on DVD - but that's a bit irrelevant now that fans will want blu-rays, much as when the originals were only out on VHS, and not on DVD).    Another movie where the original (first) theatrical release never became available (at all) is \\"Apocalypse Now\\". I have wanted to see it again for some 25 years - but I want to see the version I loved and nothing else. So I must abstain.    The creator of something - anything - has the right to change and revise his/her work - but trying to sort of completely overwrite the original release is slightly suspicipus, and certainly seems rather dumb. Original work that had an impact sort of gets a life of its own - so it might be argued that artists who regret their original or early work should never have gone public in the first place - or at least that such regret should not make it possible for them to take away that others have come to enjoy.Goethe rewrote \\"Faust\\" several times - wherefore the two versions usually performed are the first or the last. They are both \\"the right version\\" but in different ways; one for being the original work, one for being the final revision.    Those who buy this blu-ray version of Star Wars: I wish you much enjoyment :-)    But the joy is not for me. I would buy a box with blu-rays of the theatrical AND the \\"revised editions\\" - and I would buy it in 2D as well as 3D releases. But I will wait until such releases are out - which is, sadly, unlikely to ever happen :-(

B000PMLFRA|1.0|In 1978, Star Wars was nominated for 10 academy awards (including best picture, best screenplay, best supporting actor, etc.) ultimately winning 7 including awards for editing, sound mixing, and special effects. The AFI lists \\"Star Wars\\" as #15 on its list of all time greatest films. Make no mistake, this isn't just a fun romp, it is a very significant and important film.    Understand that the version in this box set is NOT that version, but a version that has been largely painted over with 21st century computer graphics, does NOT include the academy-award-winning sound mix, and with many different and more recent editing decisions. On this version, the effects and edits you see may be from 1977, or they might be from 1997, or maybe 2004, or maybe 2011... they might be the original academy-award-winning animatronics of Stears Dykstra, Edlund, and McCune that have never been equaled, or they might have been replaced by dated-looking 1990s computer-graphics, or they might be new things that were thrown in a couple of months ago. The choice of scenes and editing of those scenes might be the academy-awarding winning ones made by Paul Hirsch and Marcia Lucas, or they might be newer ones made by people who are preparing the movie for future 3D-a-rama. The glorious academy-award-winning sound mix by MacDougall, West, Minkler and Ballhas remains unavailable and has been replaced here by a completely different, over-compressed one that is unlikely to have won an academy award in 1978, let alone today, and wherein the young remixer even inserted his own voice.    In short, this release not only fails utterly to preserve a major artifact of our cinematic heritage, it goes further in that its producer has made it clear that he will never allow that seminal work to be accurately preserved. This is not simply a bad product, it is a serious blow to art history and to our popular cultural heritage.
1609611543|5.0|Wheat Belly is an easy to read and easily comprehensible, fact based look at the dangers of the \\"new\\" wheat in our health today.  It is true that our forbears were able to eat, digest and live happily on wheat and wheat products for thousands of years.  It is also true that over the past 5 or 6 decades the wheat seed and the soil have been greatly altered by human kind in the name of \\"science\\".  We have allowed our food to be genetically compromised without any thought of consequence to our health whatsoever.  We have bought into the RDA, FDA and ADA recommendations of \\"Whole Grain Goodness\\" and \\"Whole Grain Fiber\\" for our health rather than Grass Fed Beef, Farm raised eggs, Organic Vegetables and Organic Fruits in our diet.  We eat the easy, processed \\"wheat\\" bread and crackers.  Couple that with the \\"fiber rich\\" cereals and we have a recipe for disaster in our digestive tracts for years, and years to come.  Why are there so many cognitive issues now?  Ranging from Autism to Alzheimer's when are we going to look at food as a culprit..especially wheat and genetically altered grains?  NOW...Wheat Belly lays out the facts for everyone to easily understand.  In this book are explanations as to why we become addicted, what the addiction does to us and how to eliminate it altogether.  This book is a must have, must read and must share book.  Read it now and change your health as well as the health of your loved ones.  It is imperative that we change our food habits and the way we grow our food before it is to late.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|When this app first came out, I found it fun. You would have to unlock the games by beating others. The games weren't that great, but were a fun time-waster. Now, with an update, which deleted all my previous progress, they are basically just wanting money. I beat all the ones that I had unlocked, and I still didn't have enough points to unlock a new game. It has become just a money scheme now. You can purchase the points you need to unlock stuff. I guess this is how they decided to get around the \\"free\\" app thing. What a waste.

B000SV96MY|5.0|I've read this novel seven, perhaps, eight times, and with this last reading I opened my eyes and was allowed yet another glimpse into the depth of Hemingway's mind. Others have called this work simplistic, its title unrelated to the book's content, something to be idolized by high school English teachers. Ha! If you read only to be entertained, you will miss some of the most poignant features of the work.<br /><br />For me, the characters come alive in the book. They live and breathe as human beings most certainly did during the Spanish Revolution: Golz, Anselmo, El Sordo, Pablo, and Pilar. And although Robert Jordan's intimacy with Maria is cloaked in euphemisms to get it past the censors when the book was first written in 1939, I got the point: the two of them, as sometimes happens once or twice in life, were inexplicably drawn to each other. It's not something carnal or obscene; it's something divine, and that which one should be eternally thankful for. Certainly, Hemingway must have realized this when he created the characters of Robert and Maria.<br /><br />The ending was written some thirty-eight times in an attempt \\"to get the words right,\\" and that speaks volumes about the author's diligence in producing a work of literature that will last the ages. The love which Robert Jordan had for Maria is evidenced in his desire to see her safely away, to give up his life that she may move on and live her life. He knows he is \\"mucked,\\" yet he kindly but forcibly tells Maria they will always be together. Now, that's love!<br /><br />I give this work my highest rating.

It's filmed in a clean, simple yet effective manner to deliver the perfect claustrophobic horror atmosphere and Kathy Bates gives one of the greatest performances on screen. One of the best Stephen King film adaptations.

0553801473|2.0|To put it nicely, this book is a mess.  It seems that the author spent all his time coming up with complicated names for minor characters and locations, and no time at all on where he taking the characters we grew care about in the earlier books.  There are very few interesting dramatic scenes, and many of those take place off-stage, we just hear about them later.  I often find myself flipping back to see if I've missed something, as some POV chapters begin by referencing things that have happened while our attention was focused elsewhere.  There are long, boring passages about various journeys, including mind-numbing lists of fleets of ships--which ones are missing, which ones are still with the fleet, which ships they commandeer along the way--no battles to speak of, they just \\"acquire\\" them.  I am only about 3/4 of the way through it and I am eagerly awaiting the end, not because I expect the end to make up for the total lack of story so far, just because it will be over and I can move on and read something else.
B001AQR3IU|5.0|This was a very creative movie and I love watching this movie over and over. On one side of the wall is mystical creatures with people and witches who can not cross the reverse side of the wall are they will turn to dust.

B001AQO3QA|5.0|If it wasn't for the computers, I would think Alien was made within the last few years. The job they did cleaning this movie up is incredible. Even though I am not a huge fan of Alien 3 and beyond it has nothing to do with the special effects which 1080p shows off to perfection. I have no regrets buying this and would so again.
B00008CLOA|5.0|The iconic cover art has evolved into a poignant representation on the 30th anniversary cover: this time, as stained glass with a twilight/tree setting through the transparency, very reminiscent of my native Pacific Northwest. Aside from the original black cover, it doesn't get much better, image-wise. Very tastefully done.<br /><br />The songs are the same, but there's a new hybrid format: be it played in SACD or in CD format, the sounds are better represented: deeper, clearer, better separation, more intensity, more solemnity. Technology, when applied with technique and conscience, does a world of good for the old-and-perennial works such as this one. May they both continue to lend themselves to one another for their mutual preservation.<br /><br />Definitely a must-have for any library. That goes without saying.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I loved Star Wars for the bigger part of my life. Not mentioning the unnecessary changes, which are awful, I have seen the quality of these Blu-ray disks. It's abysmal! On top of all that, in an unheard of case of false advertising, Lucasfilm claimed they fixed the glaring errors of the DVD edition, and they did so for A FEW shots, they used to promote the set, and left the rest of the movies as they were in the awful 2004.DVD transfer. Maybe a loss of 30% of detail due to black crush is unimportant to many people. Maybe pink lightsabers do not trouble majority. Some people will not object blue snow and almost black faces of characters on Hoth. Perhaps audio problems can't be perceived by everyone. But this is a problem for me, and I am not paying this time!
B0051QO4QY|5.0|I'm going through a religious experience with this album. Every song is beautifully written and composed. HAIR takes me back to when I was growing up and fighting my parents against trying to express myself. Currently BLOODY MARY is on repeat in my car, it makes me want to sip wine and smoke cigars on the roof top of sky scrapper in NYC waving my arms above my head. I strongly suggest purchasing the deluxe cd so that you can hear BORN THIS WAY the counrty road version... Fanstastic!

B005KGPC4S|1.0|Yee Haw! Those whackjob christians are at it again! Thank Obama, our military are there to save everyone---especially the children---just like last time at Waco when they burned dozens of children and women alive... to save them, of course. Mission accomplished! Now, had the director chosen to make a film about religious extremists of another faith, the J word, say? Well then the film would never have been made or seen by anyone.<br /><br />And, by the way, all you shill reviewers... give it up, dudes. The film sucks and everybody knows it. So STFU.
0312430000|4.0|Although this book has a decidedly medical perspective (the author is a renowned surgeon, after all), the concepts in the book can be applied to many situations, not just medical ones. Dr. Gawande begins by describing three levels of complexity: simple, complicated, and complex. He then proceeds to outline the checklist manifesto as it applies to complex problems, those in which expertise is valuable but not sufficient for success and outcomes are often uncertain. In any complex situation, one needs to ask the following two questions: 1) Do I have the right knowledge? and 2) Am I applying it correctly? Dr. Gawande's basic premise is that with complex problems, the power of decision-making must be given to those people who have the appropriate levels of experience and expertise. Moreover, those decision makers must talk to one another and take responsibility for the decision. Complexity no longer allows us to centralize power in any one person.
B000XUBF3I|4.0|Let me start by saying I first used this system when I was a SAHM to an infant/toddler, followed it almost to the letter, and had a beautifully clean and organized house.  Then I went back to work, bought a new house, moved and had another baby.   There is no way I can implement that system now fully with the time that I have unless I have no down time at night.  But, there are some very useful parts of this book that I continue to use daily.  I knocked off one star because the book gives some weird advice for working moms, like we have to wake up super early before our family and put on our work clothes right away.  Sorry, but my baby wakes up at 5:30 and I am not getting up earlier than that.  And I wear a suit to work and I am NOT wearing that while feeding my toddler, much less cleaning.  I find it funny that she tells Payroll SHEs have to do her system exactly as she said, but her whole book is adapted from someone else's book!  So I adapted it to my schedule too.    I still have a control journal, but my morning and evening routines are simplified.    Morning:  - Make bed  - Clear off bathroom counter and wipe down if looks dirty  - 2 min hot spot of kitchen/breakfast area    Early Evening (after my youngest goes to bed):  - Tidy up of living room (toys)  - 15 min declutter (either my most bothersome room or using her zones, missions, etc.)    After dinner:  - Pack lunches for kids  - Dishes, cleaning kitchen and dinner table    I do my weekly home blessing on the weekends.  I don't lay out my clothes or put on my shoes in the morning.  I used to when I stayed home, but I just don't have as much time anymore.      However, I will say that I have read other organization books and this is by far my favorite system.  It is just not 100% workable by working moms.
B005BGBPBG|1.0|I quite like romantic comedies and was in the mood to see one. This actually looked good when it was in theaters but i never got the chance to go so i was all over this rental. Well im sorry to say it was ho-rri-ble! I couldn't even finish watching it, that's how painful it was. Totally predictable, flat; non funny jokes, despicable best friend and just lame across the board. I think i watched about 45 minutes then i could no longer bear it. Wish I had stayed away.
B004WCTLNY|5.0|This is not a movie that you feel like you just wasted 2 hours of your life you will never get back. If you like suspense w/ a little romance thrown in this is the movie for you! My confidence in Matt has been restored!
B000SW2F6M|5.0|One of the best movies out there that represents it's time line. If there were more than 5 stars i would give it.
0062060554|2.0|You know the movie trailers that reveal absolutely all of the funny jokes and leave nothing new for the movie?  Unfortunately, the description of this book gives the reader all he/she needs to know.  There's really not much more to it.  The story line was far too simplistic.  There are no big twists, and when the end comes with all it's predictability, you will be disappointed that you invested the few hours of reading.
B004EPYZZI|5.0|We have all heard the story and know what happened. Movie brings to life the events that happened that day. Director did a great job bringing the events to life.

B000009RC2|5.0|This epic and groundbreaking 1971 debut album from The Mahavishnu Orchestra is certainly not for those whose musical tastes extend no further than 4/4-time sing-along melodies or the unimaginative and formulaic mediocrity which passes for popular music in the 21st century. `The Inner Mounting Flame' is a rarely (maybe never?) equalled exercise in musical virtuosity bursting with energy, power, tight rhythms and complex time-signatures, which invades both heart and mind with something approaching euphoria. One reviewer here claims \\"When I saw the Mahavishnu Orchestra live, I couldn't speak for an hour\\" and, if you've never heard this before, then the first time you do you're likely to have a similar reaction.<br /><br />Fresh from his adventurous excursion into jazz fusion with Miles Davis, culminating in the seminal and mould-breaking `Bitches Brew' in 1970, John McLaughlin formed this outstanding quintet with Billy Cobham on drums, Jan Hammer on keyboards, Rick Laird on bass and Jerry Goodman - the only member not hitherto steeped in jazz but he doesn't just keep up, he excels beyond expectations - on violin.<br /><br />The album's 8 different pieces showcase a breadth of imagination and style rare in music of any genre, but `The Ork' (as they were occasionally called in the 1970s), with their unique blend of jazz fusion and tight rock shot through with Indian raga rhythms and irregular time-signatures, were virtually their own genre all by themselves. The primary reason for this outstanding `otherness' was the jaw-dropping virtuosity of the musicians: I have been playing guitar for 40 years now, and still don't understand how any human being can move his fingers as fast as McLaughlin does, because in comparison he makes almost all other guitarists look like they are playing in slow-mo. Billy Cobham almost exceeds McLaughlin in the fast-and-frenzied play-speed contest, as (with Laird supporting) he belts out 7/8, 9/8, 10/8 and even more exotic rhythms with effortless precision, around which Hammer, Goodman and the speed king himself weave beguiling, clever - at times even witty - patterns of sound. As if this weren't enough, there are frequent mid-piece key changes to keep you, dear listener, on your toes. They make it sound easy, but any musicians here will know that creating music like this is beyond all but the most capable and genius-inspired.<br /><br />It's not all fast and furious. `A Lotus on Irish Streams' showcases a softer, acoustic side; a virtuoso interplay of acoustic guitar and violin flavoured with piano cadences. `The Dance of Maya' with its insistent, slow and punchy 9/8 rhythm will have you up and dancing and, at the same time, trying to keep up with the `skips' of the time-signature.<br /><br />With lesser musicians all this might have risked a descent into self-indulgence, but with these guys it doesn't. The music is ever-mindful to hold the listener's interest, to nurture and transport him on a magical journey which he will be eager to travel again and again. It's clever, sharp, inspired, bursting with energy, and sounds like nothing else you ever heard.<br /><br />If you like very good rock music, jazz/fusion, are a serious (even a classical) musician or just appreciate the very best music from virtuoso performers and you have never heard this, then you're in for a rich delight indeed. Go treat yourself. You'll never, ever regret getting to know and love this music.<br /><br />The follow-up album `Birds of Fire' is very much in the same vein and almost as good - maybe as good as a 19/20 to TIMF's 20/20; and the 1973 open-air live recording `Between Nothingness and Eternity' is also worth checking out.ss precision, around which Hammer, Goodman and the speed king himself weave beguiling, clever - at times even witty - patterns of sound.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Greedo shoots first, Jabba slithers around, Boba Fett is replaced by a voice over and Hayden Christensen appears at the end of Return of The Jedi.  As though these insults to a true fan were not enough Lucas has destroyed the climax of Return of the Jedi by having Darth Vader yell, \\"Nooo!\\" as he kills the Emperor, he has ruined Obi Wan's epic Krayt Dragon scream with a silly computer generated sound and EWOKS BLINK!  We fans endured the Special Editions, weathered through the prequels but finally the last shovel of dirt has been tossed upon the grave of the Epic Trilogy!  GEORGE LUCAS DOES NOT CARE ABOUT THE FANS THAT REMAINED TRUE TO HIS CREATION!  HE HAS RUINED HIS WONDERFUL STORY AND REPLACED IT WITH DRIVEL!  HE SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF HIMSELF!  This tragically settles the issue; as much as we loyal fans have fought and struggled against it, Lucas has worked to prove, Star Trek has won.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS HERESY!  LUCAS MUST BE STOPPED!  If you are a true fan then it is time we boycott George Lucas.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|You can't call these the Original editions when it's not actually the Original, unaltered editions shown theatrically. Boycott these and maybe we'll eventually get the versions of these films that we've all been asking for.
B000RJO578|5.0|I can say with absolute certainty that this is the movie that solidified my status as a Simon Pegg fan.  I loved him in Spaced, thought Run Fat Boy Run was adorable, and was freaked out by but enjoyed Shaun of the Dead, but this movie is just about perfect.  I should clarify that I adore action movies, and just as Shaun of the Dead was a horror movie that just so happened to be a side-splittingly funny romantic comedy, this is an action/buddy cop movie that just so happens to be hilariously funny.  The editing, the soundtrack, the changes in tone, the over-the-top premise, the insanely loud sound effects - it's all a ridiculous amount of fun.  Just watch it - you won't be disappointed, and the ending will have you cheering.

0061474355|5.0|I first read \\"Sabriel\\" in 1997 or '98, around the same time the internet sprang from Al Gore's forehead. It was something my librarian mother had given me, and, without reading the dust jacket, I was drawn in by the exquisite cover illustration by Leo and Diane Dillon. What followed upon opening the pages was nothing short of spellbinding. Since that time, \\"Sabriel\\" has been a constant presence on my bookshelf - that same copy, now almost fifteen years old. Naturally, it followed me to my new home when I married in 2009, and made its way into my husband's hands. He devoured the trilogy on audio book within the week. Now, I don't mean to tell a long story or gush, but, in its way, \\"Sabriel\\" has become an integral part of my life, and has been passed from mother to daughter to a Touchstone of my own.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I grew up wearing out tapes of Star Wars, Empire and Return of the Jedi. Back then I had the original theatrical cuts, which happens to be the one thing that Star Wars fans can absolutely not purchase short of finding old tapes online or hoping to inherit 35mm copies from an unknown uncle who asks only that you spend a night in his haunted mansion to receive the prints (guess what, I'd do it).     No, instead the most anticipated Bluray release ever since we all bought our Bluray players at 5am the day after Thanksgiving is not only going to deny fans the original theatrical cuts that we've all asked for, but also contains an even further \\"enhanced\\" version of the films. Yay! This is almost as welcome as the time my mom took all of my baby pictures and photoshopped in a bunch of other babies wearing cowboy hats; or when dad edited those Christmas home movies of us opening up gifts and finally digitally inserted a bunch of elves and replaced the Super Nintendo I was opening with the Mogwai I'd always wanted; or like the time George Lucas gratuitously made changes to Star Wars by adding eyelids to Ewoks and making Vader scream \\"No\\" in the same terrible way he did that made me cry in shame and disappointment when I saw Revenge of the Sith, oh wait...........it's exactly like that.     I can't understand why fans are denied access to a great, respectful Bluray or even DVD edition of the original theatrical cuts of the original trilogy when it is obvious that ever fan would buy them bundled with whatever crazy editions Lucas crammed in there to make it a super edition. I'm admittedly one of the biggest Star Wars nerds within shouting distance and I've cringed through the prequels, even tricking myself into thinking they were good for at one denial filled moment. I even had a blast when the special editions came out and I got to see Star Wars in 35mm even though I was forced to sit through that weird song in Jabba's palace; but this is just too far.     I love the original Star Wars trilogy, the three movies that need no back story, no corrections, no additional dialogue or extra aliens in the background. The movies that I grew up watching, the ones that made me pretend my bike was a speeder bike on Endor, the one that made me perfect lightsaber and blaster sounds effects so the playground would sound more official, the one that made me want to see a Rancor in real life, to hang out with Ewoks, to have Chewbacca beat up the bullies at school, the one that made my childhood and all of our childhoods what they were. The original Star Wars trilogy gets 5+ stars in my book, however this disrespectful money grab gets the lowest rating I can give.     Until I get the originals in a worthy format I'll be boycotting anything Lucas decides to put out, I hope you'll do the same.     Wow, this was the nerdiest thing I've ever written, but it feels pretty good. Boycott the Blu.     Oh, and Han shot first.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I was never a big reader but decided to check out what the app had to offer. it's great for a handy ' handful ' of books whenever I have a spare moment. I have times when I need to be around for safety but not allowed to do anything (my husbands job has him going in at odd hours). I also love that I can dim the backlight on my phone and read in bed. I read every night in bed next to my sleeping husband. it's a great app for my phone.  (htc evo 4g)
B005GHN2GG|5.0|This book starts off a little slow, but I don't consider that a bad thing, because most of these types of stories usually deliver in the end.  And dealing with my fast-paced life, I like a book that can slow me down a bit.  I will admit that the cover drew me in, and anything with dark, brooding men with long hair, I'm so there!  Yeah, Grace can give you some flowery descriptions, but I'm old school, and she does it quite well.<br /><br />If you enjoy high fantasy, a good old fashioned romance where you're treated to a nice long courtship filled with plenty of light sensual episodes, then you'll enjoy this book.  I loved their little play of \\"and the bed is too far away.\\"<br /><br />I loved Martise, who was written well as a servant and her personality was consistent with her upbringing.  She was subdued most of the time, but outspoken when and if she needed to be.  When it's time for her to deliver, she does deliver.<br /><br />Silhara, what can I say, but mmmmmm, tortured, sharp-tongued, intelligent, and a complete stubborn dolt like most men, he's perfect.  And yes, I loved the part about her singing that had me laughing.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great read for those times when you just want to curl up with a good book and enjoy the story, not one of those books you inhale like fast food.  I was very happy with the action, and once you get to the middle, you're going to roll downhill with the story then, and you're breath starts catching in your throat, especially at the end.  That's a good thing!  Some stories, even though they hold your interest, you're wishing for the end to come just so you can get to your next book, not this one.  You really want to see how everything turns out.  When everything is said and done, you should go: \\"Ahhhhh.\\"  I definitely will be reading more of Grace.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|This album makes you feel free. GaGa truely let herself be shown within every song now that she could create her own sound without any nagging music editors or producers. Every song is upbeat, catchy, and worth listening to. Highly recommend it. xD

0375851569|4.0|Bought as a gift.  Great to see that it is so easy to get these books that were popular so many years ago.  They are still enjoyed by the youth of today.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|this album is very good. it's a different direction for lady gaga but definitely a quality album. each song shares a similar sound yet they're completely different. they're all such catchy songs and the meanings behind all of them are perfect. i highly recommend purchasing \\"born this way\\"! (:
B003UESJF6|5.0|I've come to appreciate the new animated movies coming out. Most have enough adult humor mixed in to keep you entertained. This was the best one I have seen in a long time! It had a great storyline, interesting characters that you actually bonded with, and the comedy was perfect. Laugh out loud moments without being overly silly. I almost felt like I was watching a cartoon intended for adults. This was a pleasant surprise!
B004Y1USV2|3.0|I won't get into the \\"I've been a Yes fan longer than you\\" and \\"I've been to more concerts than you\\" games that people play to assert the superiority of their opinion over everyone else's.    This CD definitely sounds like Drama, but isn't as soaring, doesn't have as much...  oomph?  And the lyrics fall flat all over the place.    Benoit David is a better singer than Jon Anderson - in 2011.  Deal with it.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|We bought this for home and were not disappointed.  Price and quality was good and the story itself would appeal to many ages, for different reasons.

B0007Y08PQ|5.0|I loved this movie because it portrayed a sense of calm and peace we all want in this world. Roddenberry and Piller's dream was to take the injustices in this world, expose them and show a way we could all live, even if it has to do with different forms of life. Critics for this film, and for any review, usually look to the bad and completely miss the point of the matter. It's the message! People can say what they want, but the one thing I want is to live in a world full of peace. This film allows me to dive into that feeling and imagine what it would be like to live forever or a life of peace. No violence, no hate, just peace. Roddenberry thought of this from the beginning to the end. Call it what you want, but this man had a dream and I support it.
B002BCNK1Q|1.0|Inane Story.  But this film shows the harmful reality of contemporary American multiculturalism.  Multiculturalism that is promoted as inevitable and good by the prevailing know-it-alls in American media and government.  Open gates of immigration are not requirements within the American formula.  There are limits to everything.... the immigration standards of limits were exceeded long ago to the detriment of existing Americans.

0553801473|5.0|I had just completed the first four books of the \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" saga by George R R Martin.  I couldn't afford the discounted price on \\"A Dance with Dragons\\" even at WalMart, but found an Amazon associate selling a new, very slightly damaged copy at a big discount.  The \\"damage\\" was just one little ding in the cover, hardly noticeable.  The book arrived sooner than promised, and was just as good a read as I expected.  Now all I have to do is wait for Martin to finish books 6 and 7!

0739317741|3.0|I bought this for myself and found that there was too much detail in how the game is played to be of interest to someone who does not have a passion for the sport.  Be careful if buying this for a younger person as there were many incidents of harsh language.  Would make a great gift for someone who really enjoys the sport and wants to understand the business and strategy behind it.

In my opinion, their break up was probably the best thing that ever happened to them. What If is more seasoned and the songs are so well written. Paul Gilbert and Billy Sheehan are defintely on their A game. If your a die hard Mr Big fan, buy this, you wont be dissappointed! I just hope they stay together long enough to produce another record!!!

0385333846|4.0|War is squalid, mocks our humanity, and is as tragic as it is senseless.  Sometimes, it is most senseless to those who are asked to fight it.  Little more than children, those who survive carry the horrid memories of it for the rest of their lives.  Only those who can approach life with a short-term perspective that revels in moment can endure the threat of its impending presence.  Enter the Tralfamadorians.     Such are the many themes in Vonnegut's renowned novel about a man losing his grip on reality while trying to reconcile his memories of war.  Forced to march through Germany dressed like a clown, Billy Pilgrim (whose first name \\"Billy\\" makes him easier to relate to and whose surname \\"Pilgrim\\" is apparently a play on Bunyan's famous allegory) is the vehicle for Vonnegut's fatalistic viewpoint, which is amplified by the more than a hundred repetitions of his quip \\"so it goes.\\"  As a reluctant participant in its cruelties, Pilgrim endures what the war throws at him only to have it get him in the end.  So it goes.    Compact but deceptively deep, one need not agree with the book's messages to appreciate it.  With only this simple aim in mind when stepping into this book a few hours ago, I step away seeing how it became an American classic.  For that, though not persuaded by Vonnegut's fatalistic notions, I'm satisfied.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This kind of book is meant for people to read.  It will bring tears to your eyes, as well as put a huge smile on your face.  It is something that you CANNOT miss, and after you read it you will know exactly why.    Abby Abernathy is trying to live a normal life. Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately) for her, her life is going to change so fast and so drastically, there will be no going back to her old life.  One guy will love her, break her heart, and change her life forever.      That is all I'm going to say because saying anything else will give it away! READ THIS BOOK!!!! You will definitely not regret it!

B00127RAJY|5.0|I love this work out. In the first 30 days I lost 2 inches in my waist, 2 inches around my bicep and 9 pounds. Level 3 is the most fun level. There is not one exercise on level 3 that I wish I could skip. They're not easy, by any means. They are challenging and different. The time goes very quickly. I feel like I've just started and all of a sudden I'm on circuit 3. I think my favorite exercises of level 3 is the scissor legs and that walking plank.

B000E1ZBFY|5.0|a must see movie! I have watched it twice within the last week of receiving it and found  it very inspiring. The acting was superb and the movie gave an in depth look at   the life of the \\"Pope for the people\\". I highly recommend it not only from a   religious and spiritual perspective, but an historical documentation of what   transpired in Poland during and after WWII.
B005JN9AV8|5.0|This is the best episode of this season so far, in my opinion. This story is especially powerful if you watch it with \\"Silence in the Library\\" and \\"Forest of the Dead\\" from season 4 to see the other end of the story arc. Brilliant writing from Steven Moffat. Extraordinary acting from Alex Kingston as River Song and Matt Smith as the Doctor. All the roles are brilliantly acted, really, even the small ones. I find the story arc just amazing. Best thing on television.
0062059882|5.0|I read this book ten years ago and I still love it!  Since my first time was as a library book, I really wanted to have it permanently this time.  Neil Gaiman is one of my favorite authors.  I find his characters interesting and his story lines fascinate me.  He's unpredictable and fun to read.<br /><br />This book has a way of making you think tool  I really do believe that all those ancient gods are here in America in their own way.  It's very obvious that the author did a lot of research to make his book as plausable as possible.  He convinced me!  I enjoyed this reading as much as I did the first, I think.  Probably because I've experienced a lot more life in the past several years and it hits even more chords for me.  I loved all the places it took my thoughts. Thank you Niel!
B003K72YZ4|5.0|This episode and its second part \\"Forest of the Dead\\" are amazing especially when you watch them with Time of Angels, A Good Man Goes to War, and Let's Kill Hitler--the bookended story arc is moving acting from Ten, Eleven and River, and brilliant writing from Steven Moffat.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Unless you are offering....., time to pull op those pants.  People think you are offering booty!  If you are advertising, at least wear interesting undies.
B003K7GHSO|5.0|This episode and its first part \\"Silence in the Library\\" are so well written and acted, especially when you watch them with Let's Kill Hitler from season 6.     What River does for the Doctor in these two episodes is parallel to what he does for her in \\"Let's Kill Hitler.\\" The bookended story arc is really neat.     The ending is sad and uplifting at the same time. I am so touched by the incredibly moving acting from Alex Kingston as River, and brilliant writing from Steven Moffat. The ending is amazing.

B004EPYZXU|5.0|\\"Apollo 18\\" is great! This is how the story goes: Officially, Apollo 17, launched December 17th, 1972 was the last manned mission to the moon. But a year later, in December of 1973, two American astronauts were sent on a secret mission to the moon funded by the US Department of Defense. What you are about to see is the actual footage which the astronauts captured on that mission. While NASA denies its authenticity, others say it's the real reason we''ve never gone back to the moon.    The cast is good. The directing by Gonzalo Lopez-Gallego is great. The story & screenplay by Brian Miller is great. The cinematography by Jose David Montero is great. The film editing by Patrick Lussier is great. The casting by Johanna Ray is great. The production design by Andrew Neskoromny is great. The art direction by Tyler Bishop Harron is great. The set decoration by Ugo Serrano is great. The costume design by Cynthia Ann Summers is great. The make-up effects design by Gary J. Tunnicliffe is great.    This is a great suspense thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat while your heart is racing and your mind thinking. This is another great found footage movie that keeps you entertained and at times, interested. This, like, \\"The Blair Witch Project\\" and all the others, are well-made stories that make you, again, think.

0743289692|5.0|My fascination with wanting to read this book came after seeing Ms. Hirsi Ali on an episode of 'Real Time with Bill Maher' a few years back. Being utterly drawn in by the story which thrust her onto the world stage -- the circumstances surrounding the murder of Danish film director Theo Van Gogh and accompanying death threats to Hirsi Ali that forced her to go into hiding and subsequently live a life of 24 hour security guards and armoured cars -- I was captivated and wanted to know more. In making the decision to read Ayaan Hirsi Ali's memoir, I soon realized that this woman, portrayed in the media as anything from revered freedom fighter and feminist theorist to naive sell-out and hateful opportunist...has just as incredible a back-story as the one that catapulted her onto the world stage in 2004. For that reason alone, I am grateful for having read this book.<br /><br /> The book is separated into two halves, Hirsi Ali's childhood growing up in various oppressive and dictatorial regimes throughout Africa and the Middle East, and what she terms 'her freedom', or the years after she ran away to begin a new life in Europe. Of course, reading about the political goings-on in Somalia during the 1970's and 1980's gave me an entirely new appreciation for a country I previously knew very little about. For this I am grateful; Hirsi Ali's book at the very least gave me a deep understanding about how the current humanitarian crisis and famine affecting Somalia came to be. As someone who greatly enjoys reading history, it was very engaging to read about the tyranny under Siad Barre, the SSDF resistance fighters to which Hirsi Ali's father was a member, and the eventual civil war that has caused utter lawlessness in that country, with no unified central government being able to take hold since 1991. As Somalia descended further into chaos, Ayaan Hirsi Ali grew up in a house with an absentee father, a devout Muslim mother who was very angry at the circumstances to which her life had manifested, abject poverty and war time and again, all the while being forced to relocate on a moments notice to places like neighbouring Kenya, Ethiopia, or Saudi Arabia. Each of these places presented their own unique set of challenges, and it is fascinating to read how Hirsi Ali navigated such a nomadic and turbulent childhood and adolescence, to varying degrees of success.<br /><br /> The second half of the book catches the reader up to the events of 2004 and how Hirsi Ali left her life (by that time back in Kenya) to escape an arranged marriage that her father had organized with a man in Toronto in the early 1990's. After being sent to Germany to stay with relatives and await her Canadian visa, she ran to Holland to claim asylum after being confronted by some uncomfortable questions she really didn't have adequate answers to. For instance, she wonders how, if her Muslim faith was supposed to be some arbiter of privilege as 'the true believers', either in spiritual or temporal form, why is it that she and everyone she grew up with lived in a seemingly constant state of poverty and war, while people in Europe lived relatively comfortable lives, in safe communities with laws that were upholded by both government and people? Obviously, the answers to a question like this are myriad and complex, bound as they are in the vestiges of colonialism, racism, local corruption and tyranny etc., but in reading the book, one gets a sense of Hirsi Ali's awakening to the idea that life could actually be very different from the one she had previously accepted as fixed and inevitable. Here, she embraces (her critics argue far too naively), the tenets of liberalism and social democracy with an ardent ferocity and ultimately loses her religion. It is these sets of experiences that informs the reader on Hirsi Ali's current self-avowed atheism that is readily apparent in almost any media interview she gives these days.<br /><br /> Ultimately, Ayaan Hirsi Ali's book is as controversial as the woman herself. The uncomfortable memories her family would likely have preferred she kept quiet about, her evolving political beliefs from devout Muslim to liberal atheist, and her focus on the treatment of women globally, is bound to ruffle a few feathers. Though after the murder of Theo Van Gogh transformed her life into one that necessitates round the clock bodyguards etc., it would seem timidity is no longer a very meritorious option. Does the book have some faults? Sure. Hirsi Ali's passion for liberalism and social democracy can at times manifest as a 'rose-coloured glasses' exaltation of the United States and Europe, whereby she seemingly fails to notice any of the hypocrisies and problems inherent in those countries that one native to these places certainly would. Her critics argue that her admiration for the West is really just internalized racism but having read her book I would tend to disagree. I think it is impossible for anyone who grew up in the West to imagine coming of age in any war-torn, impoverished country and the perspective with which that must inform her life and her choices, cannot be discounted. I highly recommend this book as it appeals to such a cross-section of interests and people. Whether you like her or not, agree with her or not, Ayaan Hirsi Ali has lived one heck of a life and it is pretty awe-inspiring to imagine everything she has both survived and achieved, all by the young age of 40. As the back cover of the book notes, in this age of globalization and transnationalism, where religious pressures routinely collide with democratic ideals, it goes without saying that this book couldn't be more timely or relevant.
0062060554|2.0|Hugely disappointed after hearing wonderful things about the suspense in this book, which I found oddly tedious. The author has chosen such a clever, if unlikely, premise--with the narrator needing to reconstruct her memory every single day--that he spends most of his energy in trying to make that premise work. Let's see: \\"Would Christine really have known that? When and how did she find out? When and how did she remember?\\" If people really experience this pattern of memory loss, it must be awful; and reading about it isn't much more appealing.    And then--in a rush--All is Revealed, in a melodramatic climax, followed by a sentimental denouement that suggests there might be Glimmers of Hope after all. The premise, the characterization, the revelations all felt manipulative and far-fetched to me--more like a writing exercise than a compelling, convincing story.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|I really enjoyed this album. Lady Gaga keeps pumping out the hits and I definitely love SEVERAL of these songs. Definitely not a one hit wonder albume!
0240815807|4.0|Great book, has a lot of information ranging from studio monitors (speakers), to compression, to mixing/mastering, to reference material. had a lot of reference sites for different sections of the book. Wish it had some sort of a DVD to go with it so you could listen to what different effects do, it would help beginners a bit more, or a dvd lesson on the mastering process but still well worth the 30ish $. Really helped expand my knowledge of what exactly i'm doing regarding workflow, and what im doing with certain effects. of course nothing is better than practice, but this is great for people looking for more info on home studios and producing music.

B005EP1PJQ|4.0|I'm one of those readers who was really hesitant to read this book even though there were so many raving reviews.  Honestly it seemed like it would be a cutesy, cheesy, love story, set in Paris, but boy was I wrong.  There was plenty of drama and heartbreak to keep me entertained.  Anna is sent to Paris for her senior year which leads to a lot of complaining in the beginning which got pretty annoying after a while.  Who wouldn't want to be in Paris?  Of course her disappointment doesn't last long when she meets a super cute looking boy named Etienne St. Clair, problem is that cute boy has a girlfriend which leads to plenty of tears and many, many mixed signals between the two of them.  I did enjoy Anna and the French Kiss but Etienne and Anna both had their faults one they both shared was not being able to communicate their feelings for each other. Obviously there wouldn't of been a story had it been resolved that easily, but still all thir back and forth made me want to yell at them, \\"You both like each other now go for it!!!\\"  Overall it was a really addicting, charming, fun, book and Stephanie Perkins is officially on my must buy list of her future releases.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|I think this is the best Rock/Blues/R&B (or whatever it is)(it is all of those genres) album of 2011 and should win a few Grammys.  Susan grows up from being a Raitt sound-alike to her own, very sexy woman.  Derek is of course impeccable.    This album is sexy, steamy, mature and very listenable from beginning to end.  Tasty band that never gets in the way of songs.  Music like this is not made anymore!
B000001F6B|4.0|Like the group Journey, the Moody Blues lps took the listener to a higher level with each album release. This one is no exception. The cassette is worth listening to again and again. Though this release is not as gripping as the Days of Future Past it is still a wonderful album that takes you on a wonderful musical journey into ones imagination.   The difference in the Moody Blues albums and say rap or hip hop is that the Moody Blues released music and the others didn't.   Today's kids are depriving themselves of a real musical experience. I understand that some of the prior decades had their share of thumping garbage noise, but not nearly as bad as today's garbage thumping.  If you really want to listen to some of the best ovatious music rock out there pick a Moody Blues tape or lp. Slide the tape into your car's player, crank up the volume and enjoy the ride. You can't go wrong with this album or any of the Moody Blues releases. They are all pure ear candy just like Question of Balance.
1451629184|5.0|A Stolen Life: A Memoir by Jaycee Dugard was a fabulous read. It kept me spellbound with her story of betrayal, loss of childhood and how love and hope kept her alive. I feel like I know Jaycee now. I also have hopes and dreams for her family. I thought with all I had read and heard about her on TV and magazines that it might be a waste of time to read her book but it wasn't. There is so much more to her story and I am glad that I read it!
1592400876|4.0|First, the Cons:<br />1. Read all about it in the New Yorker review. The author mentions that the New Yorker magazine renders \\"the nineteen-eighties\\" as \\"1980's\\", and, boy, they just went after her. They didn't even spare the gentleman who wrote the foreword.<br />2. Punctuations, as the author indicates in the last chapter, are about conventions; conventions vary from place to place and from port to port. Straddling across conventions or across the North Atlantic implies a lack of one. Beware of getting your conventions mixed up.<br /><br />The Pros:<br />1. I've never been able to read a book on punctuations/grammar without dozing off in a matter of minutes, but this one is an exception. Granted, it's not really a book for the puritan, but it should satisfy the practical needs of many out there --as long as you get your convention thing straightened out, and as long as you keep a wary eye for the errors.<br />2. The humor/humour is nice. Where else would you find a comma described as, \\"... it tears about on the hillside of language, endlessly organizing words into sensible groups and making them stay put: sorting and diving; circling and herding; and of course darting off with a preemptory \\"woof\\" to round up any wayward subordinate clause that makes a futile bolt for semantic freedom.\\" Every time I see a dog nowadays, I see a comma on its forehead.<br />3. The history is nice, but sometimes it tends to drag a bit. If you're interested in what Gertrude Stein or George Bernard Shaw thought about the punctuation marks, it's all here.<br /><br />Once you complete a chapter, you may want to take a few online quizzes to make sure you got it right.<br /><br />My first reaction after writing this review was to plug my ears, and run as fast as my legs would take me. On second thoughts, however, I'm staying put. If there are punctuation errors above, I'm willing to suck it up.

0140441409|5.0|Enjoyed Maxwell Staniforth's translation; it's elegant and flows easily. The introduction he provides is pretty good. Here we get an overview of the Stoic school of thought; it touches upon some of their early philosophers such as Zeno and Chrysippus; about their knowledge - Logic, Physics and Ethics; a brief sketch of the life of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, the emperor who scribbled down his thoughts and which has come down to us as \\"Meditations\\".<br /><br />Meditations consists of 12 chapters (called Books), each of which is a collection of his thoughts. The thoughts are not in any specific order and, at times, the same theme can be seen repeated multiple times using different words --unless, of course, the subtleties avoided me. The core message is to live in conformance with the nature and to live a life free of wants, ostentation and ornamentation. Be righteous and let your actions display that. Meditation is religious only insofar as it is Monistic; it considers our soul as a speck of the divine whole, the speck itself representing the whole in its entirety. It's moral in that the emphasis is on leading a virtuous life. The Books start with Marcus Aurelius thanking his family, tutors and friends for inculcating in him the outlook that he possess.<br /><br />Here are a couple from my notes:<br /><br />Were you to live three thousand years, or even thirty thousand, remember that the sole life which a man can lose is that which he is living at the moment; and furthermore, that he can have no other life except the one he loses. This means that the longest life and the shortest amount to the same thing. For the passing minute is every man's equal possession, but what has once gone by is not ours. Our loss, therefore, is limited to that one fleeting instant, since no one can lose what is already past, nor yet what is still to come--for how can he be deprived of what he does not possess? So two things should be borne in mind. First, that all the cycles of creation since the beginning of time exhibit the same recurring pattern, so that it can make no difference whether you watch the identical spectacle for a hundred years, or for two hundred, or for ever. Secondly, that when the longest-and the shortest-lived of us come to die, their loss is precisely equal. For the sole thing of which any man can be deprived is the present; since this is all he owns, and nobody can lose what is not his.<br /><br />When an object presents itself to your perception, make a mental definition or at least an outline of it, so as to discern its essential character, to pierce beyond its separate attributes to a distinct view of the naked whole, and to identify for yourself both the object itself and the elements of which it is composed, and into which it will again be resolved. Nothing so enlarges the mind as this ability to examine methodically and accurately every one of life's experiences, with an eye to determining its classification, the ends it serves, its worth to the universe, and its worth to men as the members of that supreme City in which all other cities are as households.<br /><br />A great collection of the emperor's thoughts (Marcus Aurelius actually reminds me of Ashoka the Great). Those of us who were not lucky enough to get privately tutored by the likes of Diognetus, Rusticus and Apollonius can certainly benefit from his notes!e exhibit the same recurring pattern, so that it can make no difference whether you watch the identical spectacle for a hundred years, or for two hundred, or for ever.

6304696515|5.0|Glenn Close and John Malkovich are two sides of the same coin in this feature. They are superb at portraying predators: they are elegant, malicious, deceitful and manipulative. Their goals are sexual conquests and/or ruining reputations and marriages. Uma Thurman, on the other hand, portrays an innocent girl who becomes their catspaw. Not only the acting but the directing, the cinematography and the screenplay are all perfection.    The plot is as follows: Close asks Malkovich to seduce Thurman prior to her marriage to Close's ex-lover, who insists on marrying a virgin. Malkovich declines as it being too easy and, besides, his sights are on Michelle Pfeiffer, who is famous for being a virtuous, married woman. Thurman's mother, however, warns Pfeiffer not to believe a word that comes out of silver tongued Malkovich, that he is really a scumbag. Malkovich redoubles his efforts, but as revenge will also go ahead and seduce Thurman. Unintentionally, however, Malkovich begins to fall in love with Pfeiffer and he relates his feelings to Close (he is even beginning to develop a conscience!), totally oblivious to the fact that she is now becoming jealous and angry. So now, Close begins to manipulate and scheme against her former ally. I will not say any more in order not to spoil the movie.
B003V9OCIS|5.0|A must watch for all those who love and value friendship, romance, sacrifice and adventure. One of the very few films that could rightfully be called a \\"thriller\\" in every true sense.

0375703764|1.0|Let me start by saying that I love a challenging read, in fact, in the best case scenarios, the more challenging the better. I love authors who not only assume their readers have brains, but expect them to use them. However, this book was definitely NOT the best case scenario.<br /><br />I'm aware that many reviewers here are \\"Wish I could give it MORE than 5 stars!\\" crazy about this book, which is partly why I gave it more than one try. But I simply got tired of Danielewski's smug tone and gimmicks such as forcing the reader to literally turn the book upside down to read (what I assumed were supposed to be) post-it notes tacked over pages, sometimes written in languages I didn't even recognize. I was downright exasperated when I found out that the point of an incredibly long list of names that filled the margins of a few pages was that you could find the author's name spelled out among the initials of those names. My question: Why is finding the author's name buried in a tediously long list supposed to be important to me? How is this challenging my imagination or giving me any sort of pleasure. My answer: It's the author himself who is getting pleasure out of this mind-boggling instance of self-indulgence. And I suppose readers who go to the trouble of mining out the author's name will get some sort of kick out of feeling clever and \\"in on it\\"...? I really don't know.<br /><br />I apologize to the readers who honestly enjoyed and benefited from this book. But it's hard not to read a lot of the excessive praise without wondering how many enthusiasts simply feel hipper-than-thou for claiming it as an all-time favorite. The words that kept coming to my mind when reading the book and thinking about the author were \\"pseudo intellectual attention hound\\" and - I hate to say it - \\"fraud.\\"
0307279189|5.0|I don't think I can fully describe what a shock it was to my system when I read this book for the first time. I couldn't believe the possibilities and ease of running that was available. The lies that the running shoe empire were based on also blew me away. But not only that I totally loved the story and was pulled in from the first moment.     I read this story a few years ago and went from only running a kilometer or two here or there to running marathons and I'm about to participate in my first ultramarathon next month. I used to be sore after running and some of the tips in the book helped me so that I'm almost never sore anymore. I can't recommend this book highly enough when it comes to running.

0553801473|3.0|After a very long wait for Mr. Martin's next novel I found myself forgetting most of what had occurred in the past books. I needed a refresher on the Feast of crows. The HBO series refreshed me for the beginning of his series.<br /><br />The bottom line: I was very disappointed in Dance with Dragons. I felt like this book was simply a set up for his next novel. After hundreds of pages I found myself bored and longing for some of the action of his earlier works.<br /><br />Way too much detail:  I don't get the extensive details of characters that are not interesting and don't seem to be major players in the plot.  I had nothing to hang this information on and the archaic names made it even more burdensome to try.<br /><br />Masochism: The author seemed to dwell on certain characters getting above and beyond their share of abuse. After a book full of Reek being verbally, physically, emotionally...abused, I grew weary and disinterested. It seemed to me that the author could have conveyed this in fewer , much fewer pages. We get the picture.<br /><br />Dragon Queen: This is not the same Queen we knew in earlier works. She is stuck in nowhere's ville and out of touch with her dragons. In keeping with the title this book would have been a chance for the author to make the dragons center stage and really bring them to life. Instead we are disconnected from them as they are left to languish in their dark, basement cell.<br /><br />With more books to come I hope the author delivers. I am not willing to wait 5 years for the next book. I also expect some creative action and set all these characters in motion so that we get what we come to expect and deserve since we have stuck with Mr. Martin through two duds.

B003L8GPSY|3.0|The album was shipped in good packaging and was one of the first to reach us in Australia via international shipment from the US. The 1974 sound reminds one of Hendrix ever so often and is soulful - blues rock - good so far. The album as such is 2nd solo one for Trower after his Procul Harum days. But the quality was not as clear as one would have. There was a 'veil' effect through out the album. Wonder if this has to do with the original studio sound engineering in the mid 70s?
1433502410|5.0|What can I say? It's God word, so it's perfect.  The ESV is a great resource study Bible with many maps and historical information.  Written in a simple way, but with enough information for the most educated and intellectual readers to be challenged.
B0000DJYO1|5.0|Product arrived in good condition via an international shipment from the US to Australia. Delivery time was quick. The vinyl is a fine pressing! Quality of sound is as clear as it gets and brings out the essence of a band like Deep Purple at its finest in a 1972 release from Montreux Casino, Switzerland. Zappa's band burnt the building down and Purple captured the experience as 'Smoke on the Water'! Well packaged too.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Michael Jackson was a naturally handsome man, but he did not perceive himself as such, and this unfortunately led to self-mutilation over the years.  George Lucas's irrational need to constantly \\"improve\\" his films has become creepy, not unlike Michael Jackson's obsession with plastic surgery. But in this case the addiction is CGI & Editing. Spielberg needs to arrange an intervention because Lucas may be suffering from some variant of OCD.
B002IVLWI8|3.0|Excellent album. Great music. Starts off soft and then works its way through the pair's best years together of creative genius. Pressing: the sound quality is not amazingly impressive though. Both sides of the vinyl have a muffled 'veil' effect and crackles through out. Had to crank up the volume to get through to a bit more clarity. Wonder again if it has to do with studio sound engineering in 1970? But the music is 'memory lane' material!
B00005K9LM|5.0|Both Screaming for Vengance and Defenders of the Faith are powerful gut wrenching albums. These are true masterpieces and the bonus tracks on either remastered version of these albums are true gems. They were ballads and Turn on Your Light is one of the most beautiful songs that I ever heared from a Metal Band. Some Heads are Gonna Roll and Rock Hard Ride Free are anthems. The Guitar on all of these songs is supurb.<br />I want to mention that The Sentinel is a song that reminds me about the Mexican Motion Picture of Pedro Navaja. He was a lone figure who with a blade killed all who opposed him and condemned to Hell died a violent death. In the Film he dies after killing his scorned wife who shoots him at the same second that he stabs her also in passionate rage.<br />Take These Chains is a great Ballad when Night Comes Down is a dark ballad of loneleyness that is just as amazing and Fever is a passionate ballad. Jawbreaker reminds me of comic characters such as the giant in the Amazing Colossal Man and War of the Colossal Beast. You've Got another Thing Comming is an anthem when The Hellion/Electric Eye is a Sience Fiction epic.<br />I am happy that someone already wrote about Love Bites being about Vampires. Listening to that song today made me feel the same way.
B001DSNFZA|5.0|Particularly impressed by the quality of this vinyl pressing - the original recording was in 1959!! Reproduces all of this Mingus classic album's traits. It matters when you are listening to jazz like this. A masterpiece from a bassist, alternating between a genius dissonance and an amazingly beautiful sound. Well packaged for an international shipment from the US to Australia. Arrived safe and well!

B00008ENTJ|5.0|Excellent album, pressing quality, sound, music and band! Also arrived safely and in good time!! Very melodic, structured, textbook perfect English 'art' rock. Somewhere between symphony and rock 'n roll. It should have been one of the greatest albums of all times and probably is?...
B0054N73EY|5.0|These guys are true artists. I was a little unsure,I loved Stadium Arcadium, they had a new guitarist...how can they do it again? Wow! I got chills listening to it. Josh is terrific although very different from Frusciante and changes their sound. Each album is a complete work,entity all it's own. Their music is full and rich and hip and they take the best from those who came before them,digest it and make it their own. These men continue to grow and develop and we are the very fortunate beneficiaries of their immense talent. I'm so grateful for hearing.
B004KNM3EY|4.0|Heartbreaking.  These reissues are so spectacular in nearly every way...except sound.  You know what I'm talking about.  The loudness war.  Brickwalling.  Compression.  How you can't play it loud without it hurting your ears and it sounding terrible.  And you already know from experience how you find yourself always turning the volume down in an effort to make it sound actually good.  You've been here before.  So if this sort of thing really bothers you, think twice about buying these Suede reissues.  And just keep listening to your old copies.  And maybe create playlists from already existing releases of these records and b-sides.  But, man, isn't it frustrating to have to go to these lengths when they almost did these reissues right.  But, hey, now the record company will have ANOTHER opportunity in the future to again re-release these recordings, \\"NOW WITH ACTUALLY GOOD SOUND!\\"    UPDATE: It turns out that the rest of the Suede reissues do not have this problem.  In fact, the debut album sounds terrific.  So perhaps this album was originally compressed within an inch of its life in 1996, and this reissue retains that quality.  But, seriously, the rest sound GREAT!
B005AUWXZ0|1.0|I was very disappointed with this movie. My son was a huge fan of Cars until he watched Cars 2. The story line is very hard to follow for kids and then there are guns, killing, drinking... This movie is just awful! I don't think the people writing this movies have kids.     This movie is just a terrible influence on children. I don't care what the final message is if on the way they had to use tons of guns, kill someone and get drunk!
B0015AARJI|5.0|My husband and I were very pleased with the controller! We got our order very fast! I think we ordered it Priority shipping only 3 bucks more; very late Wednesday night and received it by Saturday morning! Just in time for the weekend to play COD! It was in GREAT condition just a small cosmetic blemish and the sticks were nice a tight! My husband liked it so much he gave me his and kept this one for himself! We were very pleased with the product and how fast and AFFORDABLE everything was! W will deff order from this company again!
B0034G4P94|4.0|I'm not a fan of MMA. I don't hate it and I can sit down and watch it, but I'm not a fan of the sport. I'm also fairly certain I've never seen a Gavin O'Connor directed film until now. To be honest, the one thing that made me want to see this movie was Tom Hardy getting top billing. Hardy's been around awhile, but most probably didn't give the guy much thought until he started showing up in Christopher Nolan films. Bronson was the movie that made me admire his talent though. Warrior is fairly outstanding in general anyway, but could also give even more weight to Hardy's name.<br /><br />Paddy Conlon (Nick Nolte) lost everything when he was a drunk. His wife died without him by her bedside and both of his sons cut him off almost completely. His younger son Tommy (Tom Hardy) shows up on his doorstep one day after being in the army wanting nothing more than a coach for the big Spartan MMA tournament coming up. Tommy is withdrawn and doesn't want to share anything about his life and it turns out that there's a reason for that. Meanwhile Paddy's other son Brendan (Joel Edgerton) is facing a foreclosure on his house and was suspended from his teaching job after being caught fighting in the parking lot of a strip club. Brendan enters the tournament in hopes of keeping his family afloat while Tommy's purpose has something to do with his army brethren. Warrior is more of a story about the Conlon family struggling to find it within themselves to forgive each other rather than who will win this massive MMA tournament.<br /><br />The cast is really phenomenal in this. Nick Nolte manages to outshine both Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton as far as performances go. While Hardy and Edgerton are off beating the crap out of each other in the cage, Nolte portrays some amazing emotion. You can tell he's a broken man trying to get his life back on track and everything seems to be blowing up in his face. Joel Edgerton really plays up the whole underdog thing. A physics teacher in an MMA tournament? He doesn't stand a chance. Edgerton displays emotion as well, but his performance is otherwise forgettable. Tom Hardy plays the typical tough guy. Nothing is going to stand in his way. He'd rather not talk if he can help it, but he's an absolute beast in that cage. While each lead actor in the movie has their own strengths and weaknesses, they have all the bases covered between the three of them to make everything come together.<br /><br />Some of the supporting cast is really interesting. This was an intriguing film to follow up leaving \\"House, MD\\" for Jennifer Morrison and it's nice to see Kevin Dunn be at least somewhat amusing and not completely irritating like he was in the Transformers movies. It was crazy seeing Kurt Angle in this though, especially as a Russian. It's as if he was playing a modern day version of Ivan Drago who took up MMA instead of boxing and never had anything to say about it.<br /><br />Warrior did have its shortcomings though. It is a bit clich&eacute; and predictable. The whole movie is centered on these two brothers finally fighting in the cage and you can probably guess who's going to win; is it going to be the guy that breaks every rule imaginable with a chip on his shoulder or the kind, warm school teacher with a family that everybody loves? But the whole experience was about more than just who would win that fight though. Thankfully there's a bit of a deeper meaning to it. The camera work got really annoying at times as well though. It was as if it was attempting to go for this gritty, realistic style and it just came off as somebody not being able to hold a camera steadily or terrible perspectives that blocked more of the shot than anything else.<br /><br />Warrior packs one hell of a punch. Its incredible, emotional, and powerful story is told by a talented cast amongst a flurry of knockout punches and submission holds that'll force you to tap to the spectacular journey you just experienced. Nick Nolte gives a scene stealing performance while Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton pick up the scraps and tend to take pride in delivering what Nolte couldn't follow up on. While Warrior does have its flaws, it's essentially to MMA what The Fighter was to boxing. In the end, Warrior is surprisingly heartfelt and delivers a wonderful message.n pick up the scraps and tend to take pride in delivering what Nolte couldn't follow up on.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|As we have all heard, Fuhrer Lucas' increasingly out of control OCD is on full display here, when he should be putting his time toward another three films while most of the original cast is still alive. I'm sure Mark Hamill needs the work.  Seriously. Lucas thinks people will buy this AGAIN just to see Ewok eyelids and the further pussification of Vader? They're his films and he can tweak them all he wants, he just needs to keep it to himself for his own private wanking sessions.
B003Y5H53S|5.0|Rango is funny, poignant and has several pointed messages. The allusions come so quickly one after another that I had to watch several times and still I was picking up ones I hadn't noticed before. The scene from Gone with the Wind when the defeated soldiers straggle home, the Death Star fight scene from Star Wars, Clint Eastwood as Dirty Harry, and many, many more.
0788859544|3.0|The DVD itself is fine and the product delivery was as it should be. I do have a complaint about Disney's claim that the \\"Two-Disc Platinum Edition\\" includes activities and games. The extra material actually consists of \\"promos\\" for the Little Mermaid ride at Disneyland and guys talking about how that \\"attraction\\" was created.  Not what I would call \\"games and activities\\". You might as well get the single DVD with just the video for a few bucks less.

B004WKOCP8|1.0|I have been a hardcore Incubus fan since Make Yourself. This was a very talented and driven group and one of the reasons why I got into other rock bands like Hoobastank and Trapt, which ultimately led to me encompassing a new genre into my music arsenal. This album, in my opinion, dragged on and was very boring. It's almost like the band ditched their own sound and copied Coldplay, whom I despise. I would rate song by song, but to save time every song on this album is not my cup of tea except for Adolescents. That's the only song getting any real play on my player as I deleted the other songs. I hope this is not the last album for Incubus because I really would like for them to go out with a bang but this album did nothing for me.
B0002STNQ2|5.0|My 3rd book from MC and I am hooked! Could not put them down. Now I want to read all his books. Awesome Author, easy read. A classic example of technology misuse and ignorance leading to a mistake that could change the world as we know it.  Also loved Jarassic Park and Lost World.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I like so many others, have purchased every Star Wars set released, VHS, Special Edition VHS, Original Trilogy DVD, Complete Saga DVD. Each and every time I've been able to rationalize the expenditure, this time they'll fix the color timing, this time they'll include the original theatrical versions, this time Lucas won't re-imagine scenes that have been etched in cinema history for more than thirty years. Unfortunately each and every time it's the same story, we lay down our hard earned money, are disappointed and only encourage continued edits, shoddy video transfers and ridiculous audio mixes. Well George, you won't be getting my money this time, or any other time. I'm done.    Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice shame on me.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|First of all I have to mention that I'm a proud little monster and I love Gaga with all my heart.  I have waited for this album almost half a year and I have to say that the waiting was worth it.  After I bought the CD (I bought both regular and special edition) I put the Disc in my computer and listened to the whole album and the second \\"The Edge Of Glory\\" ended I burst into tears of happiness and proud.  And now there isn't a day passing by without me hearing the album.  I Love You Gaga!  Thank You.
0312330537|5.0|Shantaram was recommended to me by a friend of mine who had read the book. I was sceptical at first as I do not usually enjoy long, lengthy books, often finding them very drawn out and repetitive ....... WELL, Shantaram changed my thinking forever...... what an awesome read, I could not put the book down, from cover to cover it held me enthralled. The descriptions of India, its people, its fundamental character and the people the author met and befriended, his encounters and experiences, his empathy, understanding and compassion left me with a feeling of wanting more, more more.    What happened after Shantaram, where did the author end up, has he found solace for his soul, these questions leave me hoping that there will be a follow up to this novel.    I rate this one of the best reads I have ever read and highly recommend it. It is a book that you will remember and treasure forever.
B001GQSY5U|4.0|This is a CGI animated movie filling in the gap between episodes 2 and 3 of the Star Wars saga. It is not, as you may have assumed, a remake of the miniseries \\"Star Wars: Clone Wars\\". It is a new story and it entertains, but if you are a hardcore fan, you will find plenty wrong. I am a hardcore fan and I think it's worth your time. There is a TV series so, you might check that out as well. As a note: The 2003 miniseries was better so, that is also worth seeing.
0060555661|3.0|I won't discuss the content as by the time you read this you will have already known what the book is about, but I will discuss the jarring format: a chapter written by Graham followed by a commentary by Zweig discussing the previous chapter. This sudden switch between voices, time periods, and writing styles makes reading the first few chapters agonizing but by the middle you end up getting used to it. By the end I loved it.    Many reviewers are poo-pooing the Zweig commentary, which doubles the size of the book, but I disagree. The original text is incredibly dated and by this writing I'd say 40% of it is inapplicable. Zweig's commentary is necessary to put it in a modern context, especially after the advent of the index fund. Nonetheless, Graham still managed to convince me that value investing is the way to go, that is, after Zweig's caveat that 90% of my investing money should be in index funds of course.
B001UV4XHY|1.0|DVD was a clumsy knockoff...flickering images, bad sound...a great disappointment and complete waste of money Seller should be banned from Amazon.
B003UESJH4|4.0|The story of the King overcoming his stutter to speak publicly with the help of a self-taught speech therapist with whom he develops a friendship is heartwarming and important.  However, I don't see as well as I used to so I kept wishing they would turn on some lights somewhere or do more of the filming closer to the windows.  It was tedious straining to see what was going on.  Also, the movie moved slowly and seemed repetitive for endless minutes.  It bothered me too that the King was tense and unable to speak up until the very end when he gave the WWII speech, when he suddenly became confident, smiled, and was able to speak.  A little cartoonish to me. The Mozart and Beethoven music helped to evoke emotion.  But overall a fairly good movie, though I wish I had rented it instead of buying it.  I'm not interested in sitting through it again.
0525425578|4.0|I have read all of John Grisham's books and this is just as enjoyable as all of his others.  You don't need to be a young adult to enjoy this one either, just like the first Theodore Boone novel.  It is a refreshing change but at the same time keeps the intrigue and twists going as Grisham's previous novels.  You won't be disappointed.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book is geared toward married folks, but works just as well for the &#34;seriously dating&#34; as well. I had just about given up on my boyfriend of 4 years two winters ago.  We had been through my being away at grad school for 3 years and the death of someone very close to him and had somehow forgotten to communicate.  This book was HIS idea, not mine.  But it worked.

B0028RXXE8|5.0|An epic show about a pivotal period in Rome's history: the rule of the Republic is usurped by the rule of the Caesars. Cannot say enough about how great this was! Watched all 22 episodes within the space of a few weeks. As others have said, this may never be equaled. The Blu Ray tranfer is exceptionally good as well. Maybe one day HBO will revisit Rome.

0596522347|4.0|slide:ology is designed as a reasonably comprehensive how-to guide on creating compelling visual material for presentations, promotional materials, and stories. The book is an easy read and visually very appealing. With a list price of $34.99, I found the book to be a very affordable introduction to the world of the graphic designer.<br /><br />I bought the book at a time when I was struggling to depict a very technically complex manpower planning system in a way that was intuitively understandable. As I worked through the illustrated 260 page volume, I found myself nodding my head throughout. That is, Duarte's expertise shines through as she provides a very good basic structure for presentation design. This book was useful to me in my work; I incorporated some of her recommendations into the presentation that I was building.<br /><br />From a critical perspective, I can't say that much of the material is original or unique to this volume. I've seen many of the principles described here in other works. Duarte also has a slight tendency to pad the prentations: saying in 5 pages and 20 pictures what could be said in a few sentences. Even with these limitations, Duarte's collection and organization of existing materials (with some original material sprinkled in), her easy-reading delivery, and her very strong visuals make this book a worthwhile read.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I like a lot of people have gotten sucked into the story of Harry Potter, and I can seem to watch it over and over without getting sick of it. I look forward to compleating the collection with DH 2 when it is out on DVD. I still am not sure I am ready for the end, but I have had fun with the journey so far.
1582701709|5.0|This is a great book, I don't think you can take the \\"law of attraction\\" 100% for it's word, but none the less, this is a great book to motivate you to do better in life, love harder and appreciate the things you have, which will ultimately result in a happier life.

1439102813|5.0|There are not enough stars or thumbs to express how excellent this book is.  \\"Still Alice\\" is the story of a 50 year old woman with early-onset Alzheimer's disease.  I've read other books, both fiction and non-fiction, on this subject...but this book is unique in that it tells it almost exclusively from the point of view of the woman herself.  We live with her the annoying memory lapses and attempts to rationalize, her growing concern and fear, and the diagnosis that seems impossible.  Most stories about Alzheimer's sees the person affected through the eyes of family and caregivers.  In this one we see the family and caregivers through Alice's eyes.  As the disease progresses, we see through her eyes the loss of words, memories, family.      The book is beautifully written and rings so true to life.  It brought back so many memories for me of my two years working with patients who had Alzheimer's and other dementias.  While it bothers me that most books I have read about Alzheimer's have been about highly-educated, well-to-do, people who are robbed of their intellect.  I would love to read about someone who has little or no education, someone who is poor, someone whose family has limited resources.  But this is a minor criticism that does nothing to lessen the beauty and horror of watching someone lose all that matters most to her in life and struggle to the meaning of who she is.

We finished it about 4 months ago & I'm ready to start over & watch it again.  I still don't understand it, but every time you watch it you see something new.  I'm waing for the movie to come out.  This is a great series and the characters seem to really care about each other.
B00006F7S4|1.0|That is the only explanation I can come up with as to why Beck sounds like he's mumbling his way through this entire album.      A lot of the time I'll mention songs that stand out and then go through a breakdown of which songs are bad and which ones are okay.  There's no reason to do that since all of the songs, with the exception of Paper Tiger, are awful on this album.    Seriously: Get ahold of Paper Tiger (which is frankly an amazing song) on iTunes and forget the rest of this album.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|why ignore fans that have made you a billionaire, even when you sold them crap like the phantom menace.  why not give them a new true blu-ray transfer with all versions of the film like aliens & blade runner.  why make more changes when last time it upset most fans. oh yea I get it so next year you can release the original original & charge us another $50.  then in 2 years sell us the 3D set for another $100 I can't support a franchise that has made more money than any other off of its fans & then completely ignores them & does the opposite of what they want.  If you want to make changes & tinker fine.  But I still want the original product which is what I enjoyed.  Adding \\"Nooooooo\\" to jedi is unbelievable.  The entire movie Luke is saying he feels the conflict within his father & in that moment we silently see that conflict.  Adding that stupid \\"Noooooo\\" just brings me back to that stupid scene in Revenge of the Sith when he yells \\"Nooooooo\\"  That was a giant low point on that movie to have Darth Vader, an iconic villain, scream \\"Noooooooo.\\"  As far as buying this for the deleted scenes, they will be all over the internet once it's out.  In the words of many internet users \\"EPIC FAIL\\"  AGAIN!!!!!
B000TEPLFQ|5.0|Here it is, the truth about Blue Lines...<br /><br />It's a good album, but also, it's a bit dated, and not really trip-hop.<br /><br />If you want to hear the praise of the fans, go read the other reviews.  There are plenty of fantastic reviews for this album that give more than enough points as to why it's great.  I don't want to just re-iterate that.  What I want is to point out a few things that they aren't.<br /><br />1.  This is an old album - Now that isn't to say it's bad, or anything negative.  I am saying this because if you are a fan of trip-hop, you might not get what you are looking for with this album.  This is a very jazzy sound, especially the tracks Blue Lines, Be Thankful for What You Got, Lately, and Hymn of the Big Wheel.  The only tracks I would call true trip-hop would be Unfinished Sympathy (which is my personal fav of this album) and One Love.<br /><br />2.  This is not as Trip-Hop as Protection/Mezzanine - In addition to what I pointed out in the first point, I wanted to add that it's their following albums that really solidified them as trip-hop.  If you have those albums, and you've never heard Blue Lines, you may be a bit disappointed (though true fans of MA will likely still feel the vibes from Blue Lines).<br /><br />3.  The term \\"Trip-Hop\\" did not exist when this album was released - It's also my understanding that MA didn't like the term at first.  I've always thought that MA was a very unique band, with a sound that's hard to label.  Trip-hop makes the most sense, but after hearing Blue Lines I knew that to be wrong.  MA will always be the guys that got the ball rolling on this new sound, but I don't personally think of them as a \\"true trip-hop\\" band, and for good reason.  Listen to this album, and you will see what I mean.<br /><br />All that being said, I can still say this is a FANTASTIC album!  It really blew me away the first time I heard it.  I got lucky and found it at a used CD store for 2 dollars!  They had no idea what it was, nor did I really, I just knew that I had heard of them (Unfinished Sympathy was on a movie soundtrack I had).  Once I heard it, I knew I had to hear more.  But the more I heard, the more I realized that they had moved away from the sound of Blue Lines, and had added more electronic elements to their music.  Still great, and I love that sound too, but Blue Lines is such a unique Album.<br /><br />I recommend this to anyone that is a fan of modern jazz mixed with soft elements of hip-hop, electronica, and even a little reggae.  Fans of Tricky and Massive Attack will likely get a lot out of this (I think Tricky is on this album for a few songs, though I can't back that up).  To fans of trip-hop, be warned; these just might not be the droids you are looking for.eard of them (Unfinished Sympathy was on a movie soundtrack I had).

0007294662|4.0|This book is really cool and it opens your mind up to new possibilities for presenting information in dynamic ways. Not only was it an interesting read, I think I'll actually incorporate the presentation styles into presentations I do for work. The only complaint I had was that a lot of the data was pretty sketchy at best. If you read the footnotes about where financial and environmental data was derived from, you'll see that, in several cases, it might not stand up to scrutiny.
B004EPYZSU|3.0|Short attention span summary:<br /><br />1. Man wakes up in the desert and can't remember who he is or how he got there.<br />2. Fortunately, he's not at a bachelor party in Vegas, and instead of a cheap wedding ring, he has a metal band on his wrist.<br />3. He heads for Absolution, and finds a preacher, but then lands in trouble when he is recognized by the sheriff.<br />4. Alien spaceships attack!<br />5. Man gradually remembers stuff through many flashbacks.<br />6. Attack on alien spaceship!!<br />7. Harrison Ford and Olivia Wilde can't save the last part of the movie from over-cgi-zation.<br />8. Demons will take your hard earned cash if you buy this movie, so wait until it shows for free on television.<br /><br />This mix-up of the flinty cowboy movie genre immortalized by Clint Eastwood mated with a cheesy alien invasion a la \\"Independence Day\\" makes it difficult to decide whether it's supposed to be a comedy or an action movie, although there's plenty of material for both.<br /><br />The first part of the movie is pretty good, but after that it's hard to decide whether you should laugh or cry. The cast is an excellent ensemble, and I guess this would be the main reason to go see or buy the movie.<br /><br />An outstanding cast does not always make a great movie, as evidenced by the opening weekend box office figures that had this movie just barely passing \\"The Smurfs\\" for the top spot.  At the very worst, we have to fear the quote from Harrison Ford's character Col. Woodrow Dolarhyde - \\"They're coming back! They're coming back!\\"<br /><br />Amanda Richards, September 3, 2011

B0051QO4QY|5.0|I had loved every song on every album she has put out this far and I still do!! GaGa just keeps getting better and better and is still able to throw some surprises and shocks in there as well and this is why she is the number one pop star in the world. I've had this album since it came out and I still listen to it all the way through at least once a day. Every song on this album is different, not one is the same as the last and that's why it never gets old. It's a more mature sound for GaGa and not as popish as The Fame but this album should make her die hard fans happy as well as get her ALLOT of new ones. Mother Monster!

B0051QO4QY|5.0|I must say I am biased. I think Lady Gaga is THE most talented songwriter to come along since Tori Amos. (And if you knew how much I worship Tori Amos, that is saying alot) Born This Way is all at once; Sexy, Fun, Pop, Dark, Haunting, Freeing, Enlightening, Brilliant, Insightful, Educational and completely addicting. I have to have listened to this album several hundred times already. I highly suggest you buy it NOW! Seriously!!

IT'S ABOUT 2ND CHANCES AND HOW YOU DON'T THROW A LIFE AWAY JUST BECAUSE IT'S BANGED UP A LITTLE BIT AND HOW THE HORSE HELPS THE PEOPLE AND THE PEOPLE HELPS THE HORSE. WONDERFUL MOVIE AND IT'S BASED ON A TRUE STORY.
030788743X|5.0|I just finished this amazing story that will have broad appeal for a wide variety of readers.<br /><br />It is a dystopia. Wade Watts lives in a slum called the Stacks outside of Oklahoma City. The Stacks are piles of mobile homes, RVs, and other such vehicles that house those too poor to live anywhere else. Wade is an orphan who is theoretically cared for by his aunt who care manifests itself in taking his food vouchers and having her boyfriend of the moment take anything else of value that he might have.<br /><br />While Wade's real life is bleak and hopeless, his online life in the OASIS is something very different. The founder of the OASIS, which is a very souped up version of Second Life, died and left a contest in place. The winner will get his whole multi-billion dollar estate and control of the OASIS too. Everyone spends most of their available time in OASIS. That is where they go to school, and work, and spend their leisure time too.<br /><br />Wade immediately begins searching for the treasure. To find it he has to become an expert on the founder - James Donovan Halliday - and has to become an expert on all the things Halliday loved. Halliday was a geek who loved science fiction authors (I have actually read quite a number of them), 1980s movies (I have heard of them but not seen them), and all sorts of video-games (which are totally a mystery to me).<br /><br />Cline lards the book with all sorts of 1980s pop culture details. It made me want to check out some of the videos, games, and stories that he mentions. Those who are hunting for the prize must collect three keys. The book is divided into three parts. Each of them revolves around the hunt for one of the keys.<br /><br />It is an adventure novel. Wade isn't hunting alone. He also has some online friends on the hunt too. Aech is his best friend. Although they have never met in real life, they spend a lot of time together learning about the 80s and playing lots of those classic video games. Another friend is Art3mis. She is a popular gunter which comes from contracting egg hunter. Wade, who is known in OASIS as Parzival, has been following her blog and has developed a massive crush on her. There are also two other hunters who are of importance in the story - Daito and Shoto. While the five are rivals, they are still friendly.<br /><br />It is a romance. Parzival falls in love with Art3mis. He has gotten to know her online. She doesn't believe that he could love the real her. She wants to concentrate on winning the prize. She wants to use the money to feed the hungry. She tries to discourage all of Parzival's attempts to get to know her.<br /><br />But the real rivals to their search are the sixers who are employees of IOI, a megacorporation that wants to win the contest to take over OASIS and change the parameters. There plan to institute a fee structure would price most people out of it. The leader of the sixers is Sorrento. IOI is willing to go to great lengths to win the contest. After all, the winner will have great power and wealth. In fact, they are willing to resort to murder. A good part of the story has to do with the way Wade manages to stay one step ahead of IOI in the real world while pursuing his search for the keys in OASIS.<br /><br />This was a gripping adventure, a celebration for geeks everywhere, and a great romance too. I recommend it to readers of any of those genres. I can't wait to see the movie!er which comes from contracting egg hunter.

B004DI7HZ6|2.0|This book started out promising.  The heroine was educated and independent. The settings were lushly described.  However, once the \\"romance\\" started, it went downhill fast.  The book is slow.  Nothing happens.  They drink tea and go to \\"creature yoga\\". The promising premise of a bewitched manuscript becomes a joke. The main character turns into Bella Swan which for me is the ultimate sin as I couldn't finish the first Twilight book.  I was very disappointing as the premise was so promising.<br /><br />PS:  Did I mention it has no ending and its going to be a trilogy?
B002ZG98C8|4.0|Machete\\" is one f those films that you need to view when you are in the proper frame of mind.  And while you are in this zone, you need to consider just what the film is and what the film is meant to be.  I watched this one late at night and ran across it while channel surfing, which is the only way I watch T.V.  I have to tell you that I very much enjoyed it, as hokey as it was.<br /><br />Hey, you have Danny Trejo (A recent favorite of mine for action films; he is as good as Arnold and most certainly can act better) staring along with Robert De Niro, Cheech Marin (Now who on earth does not like Cheech?), Jessica Alba and Lindsay Lohan (They both could do a movie without saying a word and I still would enjoy it), Steven Segal (Playing Steven Segal...need I say more), Stacy Keach and a slew of other familiar faces.  This is a good cast and each named here have turned out some fine movies...well, most of them have.  If you start with a good cast not much can go wrong...right?  Well the answer to that question will all be in the eye of the viewer.  Let's take a look at what this movie is and what it is not.<br /><br />First, as other reviewers have so well pointed out, this is a parody of the old racial exploitation movies of the 1970s, make no mistake.  To take this movie with even the slightest grain of seriousness would be a grave error and greatly distract from the enjoyment of the entire film.  The plot is absolutely silly and the action shots will stretch the viewer's credibility to the limits.  Many of the lines in this movie can best be described as hackneyed at best.  It must be remembered though that this was done on purpose.  The maker of this film was out to make a point and in my opinion, he did his job well as did his actors.<br /><br />Secondly, there is scene after scene after scene after scene of extremely graphic and completely gratuitous violence.  I lost track of the body count and the maiming early on in the film.  Again, as far as I can tell, this was the intent of the films maker.  It also contains completely gratuitous nudity and partial nudity, but considering whose skin we saw, I must say I was grateful for this aspect of the film.<br /><br />Third, the movie does exploit and does make a political statement, crude though it may be.  We basically have illegal and legal Mexican immigrants' verses stereotyped right-wing gun nuts and racists.  Both the parts of the abused and down-trodden immigrants and the wing-nuts are overplayed to the hilt and both are so stereotyped that it is quite obvious that it was done on purpose.  If it had not been so grim and gruesome, it would have been funny.<br /><br />Forth, this is most certainly an action thriller and the action is plentiful, graphic and almost nonstop.  The severed heads and limbs are without number and the casual shooting and blowing up of people...well; even the most jaded viewer should be well sated after this one.<br /><br />On a personal note; Steven Seagal really needs to stay away from the surgical enhancement people, the botox parties, and back away from the chow table...Steven, Steven, Steven!<br /><br />I am giving this one four stars simply because I am taking the film for what it is and it was sort of fun to watch...once.  I am taking one star away because I would have loved to have seen a bit more of the gratuitous nudity and semi-nudity and I most certainly would have liked to have seen more of the leather warrior woman outfits.  Warrior women in leather with flat abs...does it get any better?<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarkse films maker.

0307388719|5.0|Winston's War is an astonishing feat--it chronicles the activities, thoughts, ideals, politics, relationships, and personality of a man through five long, complex years and does so without becoming boring or losing sight of some one of these parts of the man. The man is Winston Churchill and Max Hastings has done a remarkable job of describing Churchill's experience during World War II.<br /><br />Hastings follows Churchill through the war closely, especially during the tense first days of Churchill's premiership and through the American commitment to Europe in North Africa. I won't recapitulate the chronology here--it would bore those already familiar with World War II and just be so many unfamiliar names to those who aren't. The impression gained from this book is that through all five years Churchill was constantly on the go, moving between the headquarters of various generals, the ministries in London, and overseas meetings with his allies, Roosevelt and Stalin. The constant balancing act Churchill faced--as politician, PM, diplomat, strategist, and human being--would have destroyed a lesser man, and Hastings evokes the myriad demanding duties well.<br /><br />The book had two great strengths. The first was the attention Hastings gave to lesser-known operations. This must come with the territory, as Churchill was notoriously fond of derring do like commando raids and sabotage. But Churchill also pushed for, planned, and executed several large-scale but little-known missions during the war. There were, for instance, the \\"second Dunkirk\\" during late June of 1940, during which more British troops trapped in France were evacuated, and the disastrous invasion of the Aegean in 1943. Churchill's campaign into the Dodecanese, the Greek isles, meant to bring the Turks into the war on the Allied side but was ill-planned and even more ill-fated, reminding many of his botched Gallipoli campaign in the same sea during World War I. He also urged constantly the creation and supply of resistance groups in occupied Europe, the usefulness of which--in light of terrible German reprisals--is still debated. Hastings clearly illustrates the complexity of Allied planning, as numerous proposed or planned operations came to nothing.<br /><br />The book's second strength was Hastings's focus on Churchill the man. It is easy for historians to forget that their subjects got tired, sick, cranky, drunk, or jokey, but Hastings always keeps Churchill as human being in the foreground. He reminds us that, though Churchill is now an inspirational icon, he was an old man. He was moody. He kept odd hours. He was by turns abrupt and affectionate. His health was a constant worry. And he wasn't always popular--in fact, political enemies agitated constantly for his removal from the premiership during the last half of the war. Churchill's story is often one of frustration, especially after the Americans entered the war. Roosevelt, to whom Churchill gave enormous attention early on in the hopes of currying American favor, shunned and ignored Churchill more and more in favor of Stalin. Stalin, who knew Churchill hated the Soviets, was inscrutable but clearly enjoyed the favor he found with Roosevelt at Churchill's expense. Churchill was always the least of the Big Three and he knew it, and his frustration with Stalin and especially Roosevelt was pitiful.<br /><br />Winston's War, of course, is not solely about Winston, and Hastings does an excellent job of describing the personalities and relationships between the many figures--important or not--who interacted with Churchill. As I said, I won't bother with specifics of chronology here. The best thing I can say is to read Winston's War. Max Hastings has written an enormously detailed and engaging book on one of the most important figures in modern history.<br /><br />Highly recommended.pply of resistance groups in occupied Europe, the usefulness of which--in light of terrible German reprisals--is still debated.

B005KGPC4S|5.0|This film is nothing less then brilliant, I think it's genius. Genius because it goes against the machine of the movie industry, it's exactly what Kevin Smith wanted it to be. Red State is nothing I expected and I've followed this film since 2007 when I first started listening to SModcast, All the way to the last chilling word uttered in this film I was in suspense and glued to the edge of my seat upward with sweaty palms, completely in awe of the horror the likes of witch I haven't seen since I saw Aliens in the 80's.       This movie will throw you off the typical trail of the predictable horror or terror movie, it by no means is a commercial film and I've seen negative comments because it lacks a general predictable approach that the studio's always take in making movies, they expect a certain style of movie because that's all they've had fed to them their entire lives by the studio system, but that's what makes Red State so genius. It's got elements of all colors as far as tone and setting for the scenes and I'll not give away any spoilers unlike other reviews, it's like a game of clue in that right when you think you have it figured out, you don't. Brilliant is all of the actors in this movie, I can't say enough about the absolute genius in this movie given by the cast without seeming hammy so I'll spare the details except to say that the performances given in this movie are so convincing that I found myself totally in the scenes 100% like a fly on a fencepost, David Klein's camera work as his team seems fantastically omnipresent and elusive not to mention crisp and clear with great hand held quality, I even backed up a tad when things got a little close, and I'm not an easy person to sell when it comes to suspending disbelief.    Great Film, all the actors deserve awards for their performances, it's rare today that an original film is even made in the world of reboots and prequel's, that Red State would exist with such great veteran actors that give their all,all together in a scene like when Ralph Garman's mute character takes charge of the screen with such intensity with all of these other guys, to where I believed in that moment they were these people they were playing, is non existent in the super hero laden scape of cinema today. When Melisa Leo's character did... anything, my skin crawled and felt creepy outright frightened by the intensity, Frankly she reminded me of the coat hanger metal skull plate having guy in Texas Chainsaw Massacre part 2 when we first see him in the radio station lobby in the \\"Sonny Bono Wig-Do\\" as he burns the hanger with a lighter then scratches his skull with the hot wire. Freaked out to hell.      Anyhow Garmy Strong!   Enjoy Red State like I did today then listen to SIR with the rest of us when you're done on smodcast.com!

I am a middle aged cat lady and will have this CD wore out in the near future.  I see from the other reviews that others have also noticed Adele has a multi-generational appeal.

It talks about asking the zoo for a pet and they keep sending crazy animals that won't work (elephant, lion, camel, monkey, etc) until they sent the perfect one, a puppy.  Too cute.  My kids loved to yell out the names of the animals as we opened the flaps.  It is also made well and has made it through all three without ripping which I considered an amazing feat because so many of our flap books have been torn.  Overall, great, well-made book!

0439023521|5.0|Lately I've been reading several of the classic dystopian novels and wanted to add a few recent ones as well. I added this one to my list and I couldn't be happier that I did.<br /><br />While the book does have some serious underlying themes - there is more than a little criticism of the current class warfare of the wealthy against the majority of Americans - it is mainly just a great yarn. It starts off a tad slow, for about 20 pages, and then kicks into gear and I was unable to put it down. The book is vaguely predictable, in that some of the major aspects can be anticipated, but this in an unpredictable way. In other words, the book ends pretty much like you expect it will, but with twists that you don't anticipate.<br /><br />I love Katniss Everdeen, who is a delightful antidote to the appalling Isabella in the horrific TWILIGHT books. Instead of being passive and pathetic, she is self-sufficient, extremely intelligent, and enormously competent. She is one of the more appealing teen female heroes that I have encountered in fiction.<br /><br />For parents wondering if this book is appropriate for their kids, they will need to make a judgment call. Technically it is a juvenile novel, though in fact I suspect most readers are adults. But it is a pretty violent book with some pretty gruesome scenes, and some of the more graphic moments are particularly nightmarish. But the violence aside, this is a very fine novel, sort of \\"The Lottery\\" meets \\"The Most Dangerous Game.\\" Absolutely everyone who enjoys dystopian novels should definitely give it a read. I believe it will go down as something of a classic.

0545259088|3.0|Some people really hate this book, some people really love it. I'm not one of either of those people.    You're probably not checking out \\"Forever\\" unless you've already read the first two books in the Wolves of Mercy Falls series, but I'm going to say a little about those in this review anyway. Undeniably [[ASIN:0545123275 Shiver (Wolves of Mercy Falls)]], the first book in the series, was excellent and unlike anything that was out at the time. It was riveting and amazing and made an excellent stand-alone novel. I was actually a little disappointed when the second book,  [[ASIN:0545123291 Linger (Wolves of Mercy Falls, Book 2)]] came out because \\"Shiver\\" was such perfection, why mess with that? Although I soon became intrigued by the addition of the Cole and Isabel story in the second book, which i think was just the spark that was needed to continue the series without getting stale. So when \\"Forever\\" came out, of course I had to read it to see how everything ended for the characters i had come to love.     Understandably, the third book in this series doesn't have the same excitement and sparkle that the first book had. I knew it wouldn't before i read it because that's just how series work - the first book is always the best. I also trusted that the author, Maggie Stiefvater, would step up with her usual excellence in writing and plot development. My expectations were *mostly* met. So why have in only given it three stars? \\"Forever\\" IS a good book.... but i have come to expect amazing things from Stiefvater and \\"Forever\\" just wasn't amazing. The ending felt so unnatural and contrived that it was hard to believe. It felt like Stiefvater wrote herself into a corner and just took the first, most improbable route she could think of to get her characters out. However, in spite of the shortcomings of the plot resolution, \\"Forever\\" DOES have a reasonable amount of suspense and romance, and it ties up all the loose ends, giving the reader a rather satisfying ending.    But honestly, my opinion doesn't matter much, does it? If you've read the first two books you're going to read this third book no matter what i tell you. So have at it.
0880796863|4.0|Overall I would say this is a good deck. But not for a begginer. It is obviously a classic. But, if you are looking for a detailed explanation of the cards you won't find it here. There is no leading explanations for a begginer, which could be tough if you don't know the cards. So if your starting out, learn on a smaller, simpler deck with some explanation of the cards (just so you have an idea). Then I think this would be a good, classic deck to use.

I watched it back to back over a weekend once I got it and I LOVE it.

On a second viewing it was as good as the first, and I know it will be one that I will watch again. The cast is excellent, the action is understated but realistic, and the story crackles. Ed Harris is fantastic, Renee Zellweger was great as well, especially as she looked \\"real\\" with minimal makeup. Not at all Hollywood. Jeremy Irons and Viggo Mortensen were superb and all the \\"minor\\" characters were fabulous. Thoroughly recommended if you like a more mature western, excellent writing and characters that have some dimension to them. More Arthouse than Blockbuster and all the better for it. Highly Recommended.

Then all they want is to get their parents back together. This is really funny.
B004498KPU|4.0|Let's face it. Michael was one weird guy (hanging his infant over the hotel railing as an example). However, there is no denying that he was definitely the king when it came to music and dancing, and this DVD set showcases all of his talents!    This set has both pros and cons as far as I can see. More pros than cons though. I'll start with the cons:    CONS:   GHOSTS, as others have pointed out, this is not the full version.  Most videos are NOT in widescreen format, which means those of you with \\"wide\\" TVs will have black bars on the left and right sides of the image for most songs.  There is NO option to play a 5.1 or DTS soundtrack. So no 5 channel sound on this one.  It's missing at least 2 of Michael's videos (even if they would have just included them on the \\"bonus\\" disc it would have been nice). Those songs are WE ARE THE WORLD and BEN.    PROS:  The picture is definitely sharper than the HISTORY DVD I previously purchased.  The sound (even though it's only 2 channel stereo) is crisp and even sounds better than the past DVDs released.  You get a lot of video for the money with this one. Not just one, but 3 DVDs (the first 2 are more than 2 hours in length each).    All in all, this is definitely worth purchasing if you are a \\"Michael fan\\". There is some great music on these DVDs.    Check it out...even if you've bought other DVDs in the past...it's definitely worth it.
B000JQUZCI|4.0|The book, written by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, the young wife of the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, is incredibly different from the movies made over a century later. The writing style is typically old-fashioned but tends to be a bit over-burdened at times which is why I give it 4-stars instead of 5, but the story is heart-breaking.<br /><br />Young Victor Frankenstein is a son of privilege. He has a loving father, two charming brothers, and a beautiful cousin that the family hopes he will one day marry. While studying medicine, Victor becomes obsessed with the concept of creating life and he begins a series of experiments which result in his creation of a \\"monster\\" but the minute the monster comes to life Victor is horrified and repulsed by his creation and promptly rejects it. He casts his creation out in to the world with no preparation for life whatsoever and tries to distance himself as far as possible from what he has brought into being. This, of course, does not work.<br /><br />Victor returns to his studies and to his life but, soon after he finishes his studies, he is called home because his younger brother has been murdered and the foster child his father raised, a lovely but fragile young woman, has been accused and is about to stand trial. Victor hurries home but to no avail. Justine is convicted of murdering the son of the family that raised her and is hanged. Victor, of course, knows she could not have done this and suspects it is the work of his own creation. He sets off into the snow-bound secrets of the Alps and there is met by his creation who tells him his tale.<br /><br />His is an incredibly sad story. The monster, cast out into the world knows nothing -- he cannot speak or communicate, he does not know how to care for himself, he is utterly alone in the world with no skills at all. The only thing he knows is that he is much bigger and more powerful than other men and that his appearance terrifies them. He eventually finds himself in proximity to a family -- a blind old man and his two grandchildren who care for him. By living hidden but close to them and eavesdropping on their life, the monster learns to speak and also learns about the world. He is the most pitiful of beings, leading a lonely, hidden life. He tries to help the family he lives near by gathering firewood he leaves outside their door along with nuts and berries but he is completely alone. When ultimately he tries to contact the family he is met with hatred, fear and terror and runs away again.<br /><br />The monster begs Victor to make him a companion. He cannot bear being alone in the world and promises that, if only Victor will create a partner for him, he will go as far away a possible and that they will never be seen again. Victor agrees and goes to an island in the Orkneys with the intention of creating an \\"Eve\\" for his \\"Adam\\" but is so repulsed by the process, even though he did it once before, that he gathers up his work and deposits it in a lake. The monster, who has followed him, observes this and begins a series of murders out of rage.<br /><br />This is an incredibly sad story. Victor comes across as an obnoxious, spoiled, insensitive brat who is constantly falling into illness because of his own rash and imprudent behavior. And the monster is the saddest of creations -- alone with nothing in the world to support himself except his incredible strength. By the end of the story one cannot help but ask \\"who is the real monster here?\\" The answer is pretty apparent.a family -- a blind old man and his two grandchildren who care for him.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|Star Wars: Episode I made me a fan of the Star Wars saga.  Yes, that reviled prequel.  I was 13 years old in 1999 when I first saw TPM.  That film made me conjure up VHS tapes of the '97 special edition original trilogy.  I watched them all (Greedo shooting first and all the other \\"corrections\\").  I was a teenager kid and didn't really know of these mistakes until much later.  I grew older and still love the entire saga of six films because it is one glourious story.  I matured and realized the flaws in the prequels (script issues, overdone cg in some cases, wooden acting, and the like).  However, I still stand, that as a whole, it is one beautiful tale about Anakin Skywalker's journey; from Episode I all the way to Return of the Jedi.  It is monumental piece of work in not only American film history, but the history of film itself.  BUT. BUT. BUT.  A line has to be drawn.  A huge, distinct line of knowing when to finish your work, when to stop \\"tinkering\\".  You cannot keep touching up a painting after it is up and framed in the Louvre.  Star Wars is already framed; it was done.  It is inducted into the AFI.  It is recognized as a cultural landmark.  I ask this question.  WHY DOES GOERGE LUCAS KEEP ALTERING THE MOVIES?  WHY?  I can live with the new changes (the eyelids on the Ewoks, Jabba's new giant door, even the Krayt dragon scream).  BUT, making Vader scream \\"NOOOOO\\" at the most pivotal scene of redemption in the Return of the Jedi took the cake.  That was the final straw.  That was it.  I cannot take it.  It became a farce.  The \\"noooooooo\\" was never okay in Revenge of the Sith, and it is not okay now.  It is cheesy and out of place; something that belongs in a comedy or better yet, a parody.  It does not let the viewer think.  It is handholding.  The viewer has no idea what Vader is going to do during that scene.  With the utterance of the \\"NOOOOO\\", now the viewer knows exactly that Vader was disapproving of Palpatine's torture to Luke.  I mean come on!  I cannot take this anymore.  I was going to buy this first day, first touch.  It is a sad and irreconcilable shame at this point.  Only a theatrical release of the original trilogy on Blu-ray can redeem George Lucas to not only me, but a whole legion of fans.<br />You cannot change art.  This work of art is George Lucas's. Yes.  But, he gave it to US.  He cannot give us a gorgeous piece and take it back.  I don't know if this is a blatant money grab to keep re-releasing these films, but Lucas is getting quite stale.  He can be a God among directors with only 6 films in his repertoire but he keeps spitting back at his patrons.  I don't get it.<br />Don't buy this.  That \\"nooooooooooooo\\" is the final nail in this coffin.  Yes, it is really that serious.  He never said \\"NOOOOOOOOOOOO\\" back in '83, he shouldn't say it now.  For crying out loud, I expect that kind of joke to be inside the Family Guy parody of Star Wars, not the original film itself.<br />This is a mess.<br /><br />Edited on 9-7-12:  Ended up acquiring this; this is Star Wars.  Enough said.

B0034G4P80|3.0|The beginning of the movie was great. But when he got to earth it got stupid. Like how did he fall in love with the girl and there was no leading them to it. They just did. The rest of the story was fine. I guess i WOULD REALLY GIVE IT A 3 1/2. But I couldnt watch this over and over again
B0028RXXFC|5.0|Wow...bought this as a hit after watching 'Pillars of the Earth' DVD series which was fantastic. Rome in my opinion surpasses even 'Pillars' which if you'd said to me before watching Rome I would have scoffed at. This series is just brilliant, The attention to detail and scenery magnificent, the characters, custumes and acting faultless. Was glued to it till the end and felt when it had finished a little depressed thinking there was no more. Please HBO bring out a series 3 and bugger the cost. [I know all right for me to say but would definitely buy it]<br />PS my wife thinks exactly the same as me!
B0034G4OUO|5.0|I really dont get why it was called faster but I loved it anyways. Dwayne Johnson was great. I also admired how the assasin lived life to what seem to be the fullest. He felt like he had to prove himself because it was a hobby that he thought he was great enough at to call it a hobby
B005JE7WKI|4.0|Tucker and Dale vs Evil is a great movie. Don't expect the best slasher movie of all time, and don't expect Deliverance. Its a PBR soaked comedic romp. Something you and your buddys would watch in the other room when your girlfriends wanted to watch the Notebook. Ends somewhat predictably but honestly thats half the fun. I would recommend it.

Will Ferrell didnt make this ovie like he makes many of his others. Shannon shined. But Ferrell's input was muchappreciated. And was it just me or did anyone else think his character was gay?

Even if you don't use it to make anything from it, it's a good addition to those Harry Potter fans.  I love it.

B005DD7H50|5.0|Limitless is a psychological thriller that has the feeling of Strange Days, The Illusionist, Pulp Fiction, and Crank; quite an odd mix of films. Limitless had a lot of style, excellent acting, and a story that I enjoyed.<br /><br />The film opens with an uncomfortable series of shots where the camera flows through the streets of New York City - at times the camera passes through cars and trucks, the color is highly saturated, and there is an odd repeating feel to some of the segments. The director, Neil Burger, uses this technique at exactly the right moments after Eddie takes the mind enhancing NZT drug. Eddie is seen standing on a ledge outside a modern apartment with somebody beating his door down. He is on the verge of jumping. The film then flashes back to how Eddie got there. The flashback story starts showing Eddie as a failure (he hasn't written one word of his novel), looking like a homeless person, and his girl friend breaking up with him. The film is about the effect of NZT on Eddie life and everybody around him.<br /><br />Bradley Cooper did a great job as Eddie Morra. He's come a long way since The Hangover. Cooper had a believable style and grace about him. Abbe Cornish is gorgeous has his girl friend. Robert DeNiro does a pretty good job as the CEO of a huge corporation. What I think made this film so good for me was the script and directing. Neil Burger directed The Illusionist, a film I enjoyed very much. He did a great job showing Eddie on the drug NZT, what his world might look like. There is a fine line trying to make drug induced euphoria look believable in a film; Burger succeeded.<br /><br />I watched the PG-13 version of the film. I can imagine that the R rated version is much better. There were a number of bedroom scenes that were tamed down to the PG-13 level, and would work much better at an R rated level. For parents considering watching this film with their children - this is a rough PG-13. There is a lot of violence, a lot of drug use, a character drinks blood off the floor, and some intense bedroom scenes (there is no nudity). Finally there is the message at the end of the film, I'm not sure a younger person should see this conclusion (essentially the short path is the successful path). A mature thirteen year old might be fine with this movie. It feels like the R rated version is the better choice.<br /><br />There were a few moments where I wondered, why did they do that? It doesn't make a lot of sense; they should have done this other thing. Mostly I could forgive those short lapses in logic; I bought into this film and the story.<br /><br />This was a good film.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|I am old enough to remember watching the original releases of all the Star Wars movies prior the \\"Special Editions\\"    Whilst not perfect, they still hold a special place in my memory for having the most astounding special effects of it's day. These are the films that should be lovingly preserved in their original form and cleaned up for re-release on Blu-ray so that the current generation can astound at what beauty can be generated from models and stop animation prior to the coming of the CGI juggernaught.     George Lucas has destroyed the time consuming artistry of the original special effects crew by cheapening the original films with horrible stop-gap measures to try and make the original trilogy more visually similar with Episodes I-III.     There are an overwhelming majority of 1 star reviews on this sight already so I shan't go into the extensive details and changes which are already painstakingly noted by fans.    I just want to add another 1 star review to vent my frustration at how that idiot Lucas succeeded in making a legendary mythology into a steaming pile of trash.

B0054SMIH6|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie- great plot and excellent acting. Some of the camera action left a lot to be desired though. One scene looked like an 8 yr old had control of the camera, but other than that bit of distraction it was good. This movie wasn't what I expected after reading the movie description- in fact I almost didn't watch it. A client with a secret, a super clever attorney, and a marijuana-manufacturing biker gang combined with a beautiful detective, cynical rude detective, DA ex-wife and a mother who would do anything for her son makes this movie worth watching.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|Lady Gaga is an amazing person with a great heart and a great attitude and this album simply says that. I believe that not only is this album enjoyable for anybody it could also be helpful for people who are gay and cant accept it because there parents say its a bad thing or they get teased or something. This album helps you accept the fact that you are who you are and you should be proud of this.

B00338QENI|2.0|Let me start by saying that I am not in the medical field nor do I have a strong affinity for science.  I decided to read this book because of the Top 100 Amazon Kindle placement for hundreds of days and stellar reviews.  For me, I struggle with the hype of this story and did not feel this story warranted a 300 page book.    You may be interested in this book if you have a medical background, are into science research, and possibly the African American community may appreciate the history of this book.    I will tell you that I thank Henrietta Lacks for her impact to the world medically.  We all live a life and die - most of us vanishing from fAmily and friends memory as time goes on, but never really making a forever impact on society and the world.  Henrietta Lacks was able to make that impact.  I realize she did not donate these cells, but I do believe if consent would have been asked the answer would have been Yes.  Henrietta was about helping people and if given that opportunity I believe she would have.  Yet the other side of this - even if ask for consent I do not believe Henrietta or the family had the education to understand the question of consent if presented.    The gist of this story was good to know - as I had no idea who Henrietta Lacks was prior to reading this book.  However, it   bothered me how much time was spent on talking thru the research process.  The book really should have just been the story how it happened, impact to family, and HeLa cells impact to science.  This book was probably 100 to 150 pages too long.  On a positive note, if this book at all is providing some financial gain for the Lacks family then I am glad I purchased it.  It is a shame after all HeLa did for science that her family couldn't get medical care - that was too unfortunate for me.    As long as cell and tissue testing are used for positive advancements for all mankind, I say keep working scientist.  Why let good cells go into a casket and die when there are people that may be able to use them to better the lives of our children and grandchildren.
B000S9HVZU|5.0|This is one of those books that makes you so sad but also makes you feel like you had no choice but to read it. It's beautiful and thoughtful and Cunningham does a great job of bringing all the characters together, despite their disparate lifestyles and eras. I will be reading more of his books and even watching this movie.    I can see where this book would be frustrating for some people. I liked how the first-person narrators fit together, but they are similar. Also you have to appreciate more of a poetic writing style for this. I loved how very basic the characters' activities were, but that's probably another point of frustration for some people.    Regardless, I could relate to the characters and their thoughts and hopes and sadness. Refreshing read.

I would think that this book was an entry for a Twilight Zone episode. (Being a huge fan of the series).  Great character development, creepy, suspense, and plenty of mystery.  Not to mention an easy read.    HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!
B004G6009U|5.0|At first I was skeptical about this movie.  I had it sitting next to my tv for over a month thinking it probably would not be anything spectacular.  Then one day I turned it on for my daughter to watch and she loved it.  It is the only movie she can sit all the way through with ought getting distracted.      So my daughter watches this movie at least 5 times a week and we do too, and every time we are still able to enjoy it cause the story is so good and the technology is amazing!
B0015DROBO|4.0|This series is very well written and has great characters, especially the heroine, but over the course of the three books it becomes a little predictable.  The first one was riveting, the second one very good, if a bit overwritten about the newspaper business, but then you start to see the plot coming from miles away, and still you keep reading because it's somehow addictive.  Some of that earlier fire just burned itself out.  Overall, a good series, however.  I guess nothing lives up to the hype.
B005KP7EK4|4.0|Surprised.  Not by Shepard, who I've long thought is one of our great under-appreciated leading men, but by the story, the style and feel of the movie.  I think I loved it.  I've read some critics have called it \\"slow\\".....absolutely, its what I call a \\"slow burner.\\"  Not every story needs to move like a freight train.      There are a lot of ways the writer and director could have screwed this up, in just my opinion they dodged all the bullets.  Like so many people I have a long term love affair with \\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\\" so any movie taking a stab at sequel-ing that is running on dangerous ground.  But they pulled it off.    If you like sweeping scenery, genuine-feeling westerns, GREAT acting (Shepard is beyond perfect all the way to amazing) those are all reasons enough to watch Blackthorn.  I paid $9.99 to watch \\"before its in the theaters,\\" and it was definitely worth it for me.
1451629184|5.0|This was a very interesting book. I couldn't put it down. Jaycee's incredibly brave for sharing her memoir. A true raw survival story that should make us all want to hug our families tight and be thankful for all we have. I am so thankful that it has a happy ending.

0553801473|5.0|Much has been made about the nearly six-year void since George R.R. Martin dropped A FEAST FOR CROWS into our laps. Impatient readers were up in arms as other books hit the shelves with Martin's name splashed across the cover, and yet the eagerly awaited fifth installment of the immensely intriguing A Song of Ice and Fire seemed no closer to completion. At one point, Martin refused to discuss the book anymore, and more recently, fellow authors Neil Gaiman and John Scalzi jumped to defend Martin against the ire of fans --- the former bluntly intimating that Martin doesn't owe anyone anything, and the latter logically laying out the facts that, given the size of the book, it was just necessarily going to take as long as it did. Weighing in at 1,016 pages, A DANCE WITH DRAGONS seriously could not have been written any faster. Now that the results of all those long agonizing years of waiting are finally revealed, it goes without saying that cover to cover, page for page, it was absolutely worth it.<br /><br />A DANCE WITH DRAGONS is not a direct sequel to A FEAST FOR CROWS. Originally the two books were one, but it was decided that the most logical way to split the book would be along character lines. Instead of telling half the story for all the characters, the full story was told for half the characters in each book. Approximately 2/3 of the way through DANCE, however, the storylines converge once more and the combined storyline resumes.<br /><br />Martin spins his story like a spider spins a web. Each chapter is from one character's point of view, comprising the rings of the web. But moments exist when a strand, a main arc, runs across all the rings, connecting the storylines to the larger core plot. So as one reads, they will essentially be jumping from ring to ring, back and forth, experiencing an advance in the smaller personal stories until they collide into the story proper. It works brilliantly, but it does require a reader to pay attention. This is not a bookone can skim through. This should come as no surprise in a book where there are 18 viewpoint characters. It covers activity in three major areas of interest: the lands beyond the Narrow Sea, the Wall and the world north of the Wall, and a few specific locations in Westeros, such as King's Landing and Winterfell.<br /><br />Across the sea, Daenerys Stormborn, the Mother of Dragons, is trying to hold together her rule in Meereen, seemingly reluctant to continue on to reclaim her throne in Westeros. She is burned by betrayals of the past but also seeks a marriage that will bring peace in the city. Two of her three dragons have been confined to a hold, while the third, Drogon, roams free and is reported to have been killing children as well as livestock. In her company is Ser Barristan Selmy, the former commander of the Kingsguard of King's Landing until newly-crowned Joffrey had dismissed him. Tyrion Lannister, the Imp, continues his flight from Westeros after poisoning his nephew, King Joffrey, and murdering his own father, Lord Tywin. Tyrion's goal is to find Daenerys and offer his services to her, but through a series of misfortunes, he finds himself enslaved just shy of the gates of Meereen. Along the way he has also encountered Aegon Targaryen, son of Prince Rhaegar, long thought to have been killed when Robert Baratheon captured the Iron Throne. Aegon has set his sights on the Iron Throne for himself once he learned that his Aunt Daenerys seems content to stay in Meereen.<br /><br />In the North, Ramsay Bolton is prepared to marry Arya Stark in the ruins of Winterfell, which had previously been sacked by Theon Greyjoy. Bolton and his disgusting slave/servant, Reek, lead a full contingent of men to Winterfell for the wedding and also to rightfully lay claim to the castle as a provocation against Stannis, the proclaimed King in the North. Stannis has been desperately seeking former Stark bannermen to join his forces and reclaim the Iron Throne since he is the onlyrightful heir to his late brother Robert's crown. Stannis has sought assistance at the Wall, though Jon Snow, the bastard son of the late Eddard Stark and the new Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, refuses to betray the vows of the order and take sides in the conflict. Stannis wants the castles and lands on the Wall, but Jon refuses to yield them. At the same time, the Others are massing on the opposite side of the Wall. Jon has stirred the frustration of the King and the dislike of his wife, not to mention his own brothers on the Wall, by reaching out his hand in an effort to unite with the Wildlings, the age-old enemies of the men of Westeros. And as winter begins to unleash its fury, King Stannis and his men march on Winterfell in an effort to rescue Arya Stark and bring Ramsay Bolton to his knees.<br /><br />And that gives you the bare bones of about half of it. You can see why this is not a quick, breezy read.<br /><br />While the novel is engrossing and encourages late nights and much page turning in earnest, the moments spent with Jon Snow on the Wall are the most intriguing and intense. Seeing him surrounded on all sides, struggling to do his duty to the realm and finding that his former enemies seem to be his only friends, is nerve-wracking. His story seems all the more intense because, as the noose tightens on all sides, he is, as an ever-loyal member of the Night's Watch, confined to the Wall. This inability to leave his surroundings serves to heighten all of the tensions.<br /><br />Of course, across the Narrow Sea, talk of Jon and the mysteries of his parentage are again brought up, and readers are left with another possibility of just who Jon is born of. The other characters and their tales are freer, more liberated. It does not make their stories any less interesting, mind you, for there are intrigues upon intrigues and conniving machinations aplenty. It is also interesting to see the ruin previously known as Theon Greyjoy. The Turncloak, who betrayed the Starks and brought down Winterfell, Theon has been tortured mentally and physically by Ramsay Bolton and, quite literally, is missing a few firing connections in his synapses. That he can cause a reader to feel sorrow for him and his present station in light of the anger he also invokes, given his past treachery, is a wonderful example of Martin's mastery.<br /><br />Martin is an amazing storyteller. Although he writes in the epic fantasy world, it is obvious when you start reading that he just simply does not write the way others do. His work is steeped more in history than fantasy, but it does nothing to remove the majesty and magic from his work. Readers of fantasy live in a gifted time, as there are many tremendous authors working in the genre. Along with Martin, they serve to elevate the world of fantasy beyond the sneered-upon marginal work into true literary marvels that deserve the attention they are getting.<br /><br />A DANCE WITH DRAGONS is wholly remarkable writing from a wholly genius storyteller. If you have not yet become ensnared by the web that is the game of thrones, now would be the perfect time to begin your adventure. If you've come this far, this new installment will serve to whet your appetite until THE WINDS OF WINTER lands on shelves. However many years that may take, do not grow angry or frustrated, or complain too loudly about the time that elapses. Martin will take every minute he needs and pay back your patience with gold.

B003YL4LYI|5.0|Hooked since a couple of weeks inside this incredible saga.  I recommend strongly to read such so well written historical (from no where !) series. Kindle version also available.  If you watch on Youtube, there are videos and slides dedicated to the books, worth seeing them.

0596806027|4.0|This book by Mark Pilgrim entitled HTML5 Up and Running will teach you \\"what's new\\" in HTML5 and is a good first book for the novice. The author begins with a short history of HTML, W3C and web standards and then introduces the new HTML5 features.<br /><br />To answer the problem of how differently browsers support new HTML standards, the author suggest the web developer test support for each HTML5 feature used on the website. He discusses four techniques for testing. Next, he walks through each tag on a generic HTML5 webpage, including the new HTML5 elements such as section, article, header, footer and more. As you progress through the book, Pilgrim points out potential problems you may encounter with Internet Explorer.<br /><br />Moving forward, Pilgrim introduces the HTML5 Canvas drawing API. He uses a simple Halma 9-piece game to demonstrate how the Canvas feature works. He moves on to the new video and audio tags that eliminate the need for plugins. He covers several methods for encoding video including Firefogg, HandBrake and ffmpeg. He demonstrates a WebM sample and then discusses the Geolocation API to display the user's geolocation on a map.<br /><br />Pilgrim returns to the Halma game to demonstrate local storage and offline applications, new HTML5 features. Pilgrim discusses how the web developer can use local storage to save key/value data pairs on the client's browser and how adding a manifest file to a website can be used for saving and updating the state for offline applications.<br /><br />Next, Pilgrim discusses the new HTML5 form input tags such as placeholder text and spinboxes. He covers the code for each and their uses. The final chapter covers how to use the new HTML5 microdata feature for browsers and search engines.<br /><br />Mark Pilgrim works for Google and specializes in open source and open standards. You can learn more about the author and this book at diveintohtml5.org.<br /><br />*O'Reilly provided a review copy to me free of charge.
B004EPYZXK|1.0|Terribly boring movie with bad, black and white, choppy footage.  The story is a bit ridiculous, blood thirsty creatures on the moon.  It seemed like another zombie movie, basically.  They could easily just call this movie Quarantine 3 and get away with it.<br /><br />It might have been better if they didn't try to make this a \\"found footage\\" movie.  Watching bad quality, black and white, choppy scenes wasn't pleasant and it takes down my rating quite a bit.
B0043GXYBO|1.0|NOTE:THIS SERIES IS NOT SUITABLE FOR YOUNG READERS!<br /><br />I did not like Zoey Redbird at all! The story did not catch my interest and was very predictable. I don't know how I managed to finish this book.This book made me realize that Twilight is genius! I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone!<br />The only thing I liked about this book was Zoey's group of friends.<br />Secondly,This series has scenes which I don't think can be classified as YA.<br />I usually never rate a book as 1 star but this book is one I would not buy.<br /><br />Tip : I f you really badly want to start this series I would recommend starting from Untamed as things really start looking up from that book.<br /><br />Check out my review of the entire series(in one post) here: [...]
B000PMG16U|1.0|....because GL took a giant dump on the OT and his legacy by making these films.<br /><br />GL is not a gifted storyteller or filmmaker or artist.  \\"Star Wars\\" may have given us that impression back in 1977, but his writing and directing output since then have tipped the scales back in the other direction.<br /><br />\\"Star Wars\\" was the result of a lot of hard work by a lot of gifted model makers, special effects artists, and countless other people, and not to mention heavily influenced by the Japanese film \\"The Hidden Fortress\\".  The \\"Star Wars\\" prequels, on the other hand, were the result of a creatively lazy billionaire enjoying the chance to play with his digital effects toys.  No solid or compelling stories to be told, no intelligent script, and worse - no other creative team members to keep Lucas' questionable judgment in check.<br /><br />Lucas has become what Elvis Presley used to be -- a rich, isolated man surrounded by sycophantic \\"yes men\\" who cater to his every whim and applaud his every thought, no matter how pathetically misguided.  At least Elvis had the good sense to pass away before he truly became a walking parody of himself (though he was getting close).<br /><br />The SW prequels are horrible movies.  They may look spiffy, but so what?<br /><br />I've taken to calling these movies the \\"Sarah Palin Trilogy\\" -- pretty on the outside but empty-headed on the inside.
1926778103|3.0|I LOVE the art in this book. It is a fantastic treat for the eyes and if I could I would give this book 5 stars. However, the binding is ridiculously poor. I have barely looked through it twice when the binding has given out. The pages are no longer glued to the binding and keep slipping out. For book quality I would give this book zero stars
1612930174|4.0|More so than many of the Sherlock Holmes' stories, The Hound of the Baskervilles involves elements of the supernatural: legends, curses and the general theme of good vs. evil. The novel opens with Dr. Mortimer, friend of the family, relating a strange legend to Sherlock Holmes which supposedly explains the curse placed on the Baskerville family. When the authorities find both Hugo Baskerville and the maiden dead, there is said to have been an enormous, supernatural hound at both of their sides. Thus begins the curse. Now, recently, Sir Charles Baskerville has been found dead under suspicious circumstances, and it is up to Sherlock Holmes to solve this puzzle. Ignoring a mysterious plea to stay away from the estate, the new heir Henry Baskerville, along with Watson and others head to Baskerville Hall.<br /><br />One enjoyable part about reading The Hound of the Baskervilles is not only trying to solve the central mystery--the cause of Charles' death--but the many other smaller mysteries that surface once Watson and Sir Henry reach the Baskerville residence. There are several suspicious individuals that are encountered, and Watson is always looking over his shoulder with the feeling that something is watching over him. Doyle`s use of the moors as a backdrop create the mysterious, almost unearthly feel goes right along with strange happenings and the curse of the hound. We have the odd sounds, a dangerous criminal on the loose, people creeping out at all hours, and a general gloom that pervades the landscape. Holmes has quite a job on his hands in this case, and needs his trusty sidekick Watson to help.<br /><br />One problem some readers have with The Hound of the Baskervilles is the curve balls thrown at them in the form of red herrings to get them off the scent of the crime. I can forgive Doyle for this; his writing makes up for it. He has an impeccable way of getting into character's heads, examining motives, and putting the pieces together.<br /><br />Sir Arthur Conan Doyle treats us to a compelling and clever Victorian mystery, with well-timed suspense and build up to the resolution, engaging action, and fantastic pacing of events. I also really enjoyed the portions of the narrative from Watson's point of view; he really holds his own in this mystery, having a prominent role in the case and keeps the story engaging. Doyle's mystery finishes with a clincher that unravels nicely.<br /><br />The Hound of the Baskervilles is definitely a treat of a mystery, one Sherlock Holmes' fans should enjoy.to a compelling and clever Victorian mystery, with well-timed suspense and build up to the resolution, engaging action, and fantastic pacing of events.

B005HSL626|2.0|My 3 yr old loves this app on my iphone.  However, free version on droid has PG-13 type ads. I mean really, an ad to see what you look like as a zombie (with before and after shots).  My son screamed when it popped up after his game ended. He had nightmares two nights in a row.
B0055FR5PS|5.0|How about a short, concise review?  My wife didn't like it and said it looked like one of my Xbox 360 games, so OF COURSE I LOVED IT!    The action reminded me somewhat of Aliens without all the disgusting special effects. It drags just a bit in the beginning overall is a fantastic departure from reality. Highly recommended.
B004ZZLX5W|5.0|I bought this. Watched \\"Scenes from the Suburbs\\" and I loved it. Then I put the album in my CD player in my car and listened to it at least 27 times all the way through. It's a perfect album.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|AMAZING! I MEAN IT COULD OF BEEN A BIT MORE LIKE THE BOOK BUT IT WAS GREAT!!!!! IM SO SAD TO SAY \\"GOOD-BYE\\" TO HARRY POTTER IT WAS SO AMAZING AND THE SEVENTH INSTALMENT WAS A PERFECT ENDING TO A LONG BUT GREAT JOURNEY!
B002GYI9C4|5.0|At first this story looked too bleak, morbid and depressing; in a way it had to be, but ultimately it is a story about hope.  Like Elantris, Sanderson made a completely new magical realm where the rules change from a typical sci-fi, and in a good way.  Don't read this book if you are looking for another Tolkien clone.
B0040UEI7C|5.0|I have this Album on vinyl,but I could no longer enjoy listening to it, since it's becoming harder to needles and sylus' for turntables.I was very happy to find this version of Aida on C.D.! After so many years, I still love the Triumphal march and ballet on disc two, in the old days I used to crank up the volume on this part of the opera. Ricardo Muti did a beautiful job conducting this verdi opera,after 37 years,I still hold the music of this particular album, dear to my heart!
B000UZQI0Q|3.0|I agree with many other reviewers that this story suffered a bit from pacing issues.  It was a slow start, and the newly introduced characters were not as well developed.  The politicking, feuding, backstabbing, and other \\"game of houses\\" like drama got a bit tiresome and predictable.  Yeah - we know that mankind is corrupt and bad - original sin and all that baggage.  Too many \\"Bad-guy\\" cardboard characters existed to enforce this idea.  The first novel in the series worked in these themes without feeling as preachy.    Mr. Sanderson, I complain because I care.  IMO, you're the best sci-fi writer alive today.  Next time a publisher tries to push you to release something that is not ripe use some \\"Brass\\" to calm them down.    That said, if you loved the first book in the series, you will find a lot to love in this second book.
B005COO1X6|3.0|I like the idea of Kindle singles (short, cheap stories) but maybe not from King. I was shocked when this book was over, not because of the ending but because I had just sat down to start reading it! There's a sneak peek of his next novel at the end of this book, which added an extra 25% to it, making it seem I was only 75% done with the story,   I do love most of Kings short stories, but I guess I prefer them in a group of 10 or more so I can get my fill.   Also, the ending was pretty bad and felt thrown together at the last minute. Like worse than The Dome.
B003VANOFY|2.0|I ordered this item via a 3rd party amazon retailer \\"B&H Photo\\" and I've had it for about a week now. The sound quality is nice except for the fact that it randomly disconnects every 10-15 minutes regardless of which USB port I plug the dongle into. I have a wireless router about 8 feet away from the dongle with a wall and 4 layers of wood between them. I figured it was wireless interference but I've tried moving the dongle as far away from the router as I can but I cannot get this thing to stop randomly disconnecting.    I expected a lot more from a pair of $170 headphones.      Update: I changed the wireless channel of my router from 6 to 11 and it seems to have fixed the issue so far. Considering how many people have wireless routers and how many of them would know how to do this, I think this was a big oversight by Logitech.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|George Lucas.... Boo this man!     I have very fond memories as a kid watching Star Wars. I've easily watched the first trilogy hundreds of times. This Blu-ray is packed with garbage such as lame CGI musicals, changed voices, Han shooting second, Darth Vader screaming NOOOOO!!! at the climax (which might be appropriate in this case)... and the last straw.... the VERY LAST STRAW... Hayden Christensen now appears at the end of Return of the Jedi replacing Sebastian Shaw... just to remind you how badly you've just been messed with for the past decade.    You can shell out money for some hacked up crap that they slap a picture of Darth Vader on it and call it Star Wars: The Original Trilogy, I'll wait until either Lucas comes to his senses or until the next \\"rights holders\\" decide to finally include the \\"original\\" theatrical release.

0307595579|5.0|These three books by Stieg Larsson are true 'page turners'.  I listened to them on my iPod but I simply could not stop listening. Very well written. The character so engaging!  You would finish one and could hardly wait to start the next. Wish there were more.  Highly recommend!  I did not read \\"On Stieg Larrson\\" but it is probably very interesting also.  I understand these were published after his death?
B002ZG9968|5.0|We liked this movie because it brings easy comedy to a stressful and frustrating time.   It's enjoyable comedy situations that most understand.
B004T5R2HQ|4.0|Love this app!  Works great, easy and the upload to Evernote was exactly what I was looking for!  Amazing how closely it resembles a real scanner.
B0054N73EY|3.0|This album is definitely a pop album. The days of funk and rock are long gone for these guys.  Maybe they're too old, maybe they sold out, maybe they were just uninspired, but this album definitely lacks the edge of the more aggressive albums that came before it.  Anthony Kiedis is notable for a poor performance.  It sounds like a teenage girl wrote the lyrics to the majority of the songs, and he often \\"sings over\\" the instruments instead of in chorus with them.  He also doesn't allow any space for just instruments.  He continuously sings through virtually every ounce of every song.  Josh Klinghoffer actually sounds pretty great on this album, and I just wish he was more present throughout the project.  It's hard to complain about Chad Smith's drumming, he has probably been the most consistent of the crew in regards to putting forth quality.  That leaves Flea.  I am a bassplayer and I picked up the instrument because of this guy.  I have been playing for fifteen years now, and he has been a great influence and inspiration in my personal life (which is why I am writing this review).  I desperately want this guy to put forth some edginess and aggression, because he is so good at it.  However, it is absolutely nowhere to be found on this record.  Their idea to \\"go pop\\" will certainly sell records, but to the faithful fans such as myself, it is an utter disappointment.  Many of my friends agree.  If someone had told me fifteen years ago that the Peppers would put out a pop album someday, I would have laughed.  It would have been appropriate really, because this album is kind of a joke.  I know that they are still capable of so much more.  Flea has recorded with the Mars Volta, The Gorillaz, and Thom Yorke.  I know he has it in him to make some tunes that absolutely wail.  Chad and Josh are fantastic.  Anthony needs to cut out the juvenile lyrics, let the other guys have some space on the album, and put some aggression back in his bag of tricks.  I hope for something better in the future, I just hope it doesn't take another five years.  Please stop writing songs for teenage girls, Peppers.  I love you, I'm just disappointed in the direction you are taking.
B00328G4Y8|5.0|This is one of Jimi's best in my opinion. I first heard it in 1967 when it came out. Over the years I wore the lp out, and was so glad to find it on CD almost fourty years later!
B0051QO4QY|5.0|Lady Gaga is such a talented person (as we all know) but this left me speechless! everything is written beautifully and is full of deep meaning and things this generation can relate to.Im actually listening to Hair right now! I honestly cant pick a song as a favorite because they truly are the most amazing lyrics and music I have ever heard.No I am not kidding,either. Mother monster understands us and songs like hair have the power to make everyone feel strong,confident,and happy. Gaga is a talented artist and deserves all the little monsters and money she earns! <3 so buy this cd because you will not regret it all.I honestly can say with no exaggeration that I listen to it every day and it never gets old. This album will be the best one you own.That's a promise
B002ZG99N6|5.0|SUCH A GOOD MOVIES  I LOVE IT! AND IT WAS SUPER CHEAP! SEEN IT AT MOVIE'S  AND I KNEW WHEN IT CAME OUT ON DVD I JUST HAD TO GET IT!!
B004HD2ZIQ|3.0|Motorhead is a GREAT band but this is a good album. It's worth having but if you were only going to have one Motorhead album...... this ain't it
B0051QO4QY|5.0|This album is awesome. It contains 8 more tracks than the original edition. Which are: Black JesusAmen Fashion, Fashion of His Love, The Queen, Born This Way-Remix, Judas-Remix, Marry The Night-Remix, ScheiBe-Remix, and Fashion of His Love-Remix. As a fan of Lady Gaga this is the must have album. I have both orig and Special Edition. The songs are GREAT and unique in their own way.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|THIS ALBUM IS PURE PERFECTION. SHE DID SUCH A WONDERFUL JOB ON IT, IM SO PROUD OF HER. i SERIOUSLY LISTEN TO AT LEAST TWO OF HER SONG EVERYDAY I LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!!
B004ZG5F3M|5.0|This original story was told wonderfully, with a multi talented cast of actors, wonderful performances of different charactors, excellent quality, beautiful scenary of the town, romantic & magical with vital philosophies of choices. I adore this movie & recommend it.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Well after finding out the Original Theatrical Releases arent included in this box set ive cancelled my order. I still have my Laserdiscs and i'll continue to watch them. People need to go to savestarwars dot com if any attempt to restore the OTR is to be made. Shame on you George Lucas, Shame on you!
0060763280|5.0|This was definitely worth the read! Quick and easy to get through. Definitely helpful in finding the underlying ideas about why we think what we think! Focus on changing the internal thoughts, and the outward appearances will begin to align with that!
B000YIGNKE|3.0|The romance builds at an exceedingly slow pace.  Since the story is told from Anne Elliott's side and in keeping with the strict protocols of British manners, you're not even sure that Captain Wentworth still cares for her until close to the end.  She is not a pretty heroine, but her fine acting draws you in and you feel her anguish.  As for the Captain, he's so gosh-darn handsome and plays his part well.  He acts indifferently, but eventually reveals his passion.  All's well that ends well.  I'd live to give the movie 3.5 stars.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|I LOVE this album! I truly do, it's simply amazing! I happen to be a HUGE Little Monster and in extreme anticipation pre-ordered the album from Lady Gaga's online store, it arrived on May 23rd (the release date) and every since there has not been a day go by without me listen to it! The beats, the lyrics, the music in general, AMAZING! The lyrics come through so beautifully, you can feel the emotion while the beats and music make it even more powerful... I was Born This Way!
B0054N73EY|5.0|This album shows that the Peppers are simply ROCK SOLID. I heard the first release and knew I was gonna buy the album when it came out. I haven't stopped listening to it and its by far the best $10 I've spent in a long time. CAN'T WAIT FOR THE TOUR!!!!!
0470913029|5.0|this is really a great book if you are interested in eating a healthier diet and lost of veggies along with meat  and fish protein. Also great because it keeps you away from products such as soy and corn ( and corn created products) which are two very important things you should think twice about before eating. This book just has lots of great eating lifestyle informaiton to consider.

B00466HM28|5.0|Some people think that Akai really dropped the ball on making a mini USB powered keyboard but they would be wrong. Akai decided to do something unusual by combining two products they already had on the market and making them into a tiny portable keyboard and drum machine. This keyboard does what it is intended to do even though it only has 25 keys. While you would seem to question how much it can do because it's nothing like the other MPK models, giving up certain functionality is needed to make this worth it.
B00026WU7I|4.0|\\"Blood on the Tracks\\" is a classic Dylan CD which has been remastered to sound fresh and new.  He is known for being a lyrical poet and this CD is a perfect example of this trend.  Created before Dylan became religious, the themes of lost love and longing dominate the music.  Those who love Dylan will be enamoured.  Those who are annoyed by the off-key nature of his voice and the twang may be unable to appreciate the genius of this work.  A few tracks, such as \\"Tangled up in Blue\\" have been used as the background for more modern songs, so the uninitiated will find them familiar.  I find myself possessed by the music and lyrics which often pop into my head during the day since I have been listening to it.  Don't miss this one!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I don't normally approve of reviews written before the finished product comes out. But in this case, I'll make an exception, because the Blu-rays have leaked, changes to the films have been confirmed by Lucasfilm, and there is no evidence that they have seriously tackled any of the problems from the 2004 DVD release.     Sure, they might have fixed a couple SHOTS, but the color timing is still way off, Hoth is infested by blue snow, and lightsabers are inconsistent at best. For this reason alone, I wouldn't pay $90 for this set, but then we have even more needless tinkering by Lucas.    One of the pivotal moments of the entire saga is ruined by an idiotic dialog addition, Obi-wan's Krayt Dragon call now sounds laughable rather than intimidating, there are more rocks concealing R2 as he hides from the sand people, and there's a frakking Dug walking around Jabba's palace. But Ewoks now blink, so it's all okay. It's baffling why Lucas would focus on these types of stupid changes rather than fixing the obvious audio/video problems that plagued the 2004 release.     Don't waste your money on these sub-par blu-rays that don't do Star Wars justice.
B003L77GRO|5.0|I don't get Showtime, so I couldn't wait to get this when it came out!  Loved it like all Dexter seasons! Received it only like 3 days after it came out!
B001GWK2MC|5.0|This bouncy house is great fun for my 2 yr old son. and me alike! Its pretty darn big thu, and once inflated, very difficult to move, so pick a good spot. only have had a few weeks but  my little guy slept in it the 1st 3 days!!!! its perfuct size for this age group, highly reccommend buying it!!!!!
B001G5ZKZS|5.0|This is everything the reviews say it is. Stunning video, well-mixed audio, a good mix of new and old songs, and just some tremendous concert footage. Wow, I was very impressed. I've not seen any other Rush concert videos, but I can't imagine any of them being close to the quality of this one. Cheaper than a concert ticket and better seats, if you're a Rush fan (and I assume you are), you won't be disappointed.
B001GCUO5M|4.0|The film begins just as another thriller - 2 men on a mission.<br />Actual puzzle opens up much later - when the 'cat' himself discovers that he has become a mouse - or in trap much bigger and sinister in nature.<br />It is rather a complex film - better followed on repeat viewing.<br />Reminded me Hitchcock (Vertigo in particular) as well as little bit David Lynch.<br />A tight and gripping film but I will mention two points:<br />The film ends rather abruptly.<br />Also all through the color and camera were too inclined to typecast this as a mystery or a scary movie - as if something to happen; all persons in the island behaved strangely to strengthen the impression - that could have been avoided.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I dont want to fault the sharpener for the fact that it is difficult to use on some items.  This is a nice sharpener for your back pack, puts a good edge, but if you want it to take care of all your sharpening needs, I would look elsewere. It is not what I would use for something that is extremely dull, or had a thick blade or even a stainless steel blade.
B005ETA5K2|5.0|Well well well, I have to say I'm very impressed with this item, at first it was tough getting it going, but the alfa team was very very helpful with the whole thing and after they got me the new drivers from realtek, this thing is a blast. I now pick up networks i never knew were there, waw its amaizing, the network I'm used to getting is sooo much stronger, this thing is amaizing. I realy want to say thanks to the alfa team for their amaizing customer support, thank you. What a great product.
B003102JDM|5.0|Great service-no problems.  Would defintely use this vendor again. I am a totally satisifed customer and happy with everything.    Completely satisifed.

B0018LX9T4|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. It's one of my all time favorites. It's more than just quirky or a good romantic comedy. I'm one of those folks who admittedly finds it arousing. I guess it really is a matter of perspective. Either you \\"get it\\" or you don't. I don't know what else to say. Those who can relate to D/s will love this movie. Those who fear other-than-vanilla sexuality or who don't understand the D/s dynamic may not enjoy it as much or at all.
B0054N73EY|4.0|I was saddened that Fruciante left(again)and was thinking;here comes another 'One Hot Minute'. Josh Klinghoffer comes thru though, big time. This band is maturing musically and still growing. It's amazing. This album reminds me of 'By The Way' but better. The harmony, oh the harmony throughout the album and especially on 'Dance,Dance,Dance' is spine tingling. Flea is at the top of his game with a more pronounced bass. 'Monarchy Of Roses' has flea doing a hard funky bass line, the weebly wobbly echo of Klinghoffer's guitar on 'Factory Of Faith'. The RHCP just don't make bad music, they always step up. It's another funky ride.  KEY TRACKS  -Monarchy Of Roses  -Brendan's Death Song  -Dance,Dance,Dance  -Did I Let You Know  -Annie Wants a Baby  -Goodbye Hooray
B005BGBPBG|1.0|I LOVED Something Borrowed the book, so I was cautiously optimistic when I heard it was being made into a movie. The movie is rarely as good as the book and unfortunately, that holds true here too.     For starters, as another reviewer pointed out - how awful, a movie about a girl who cheats with her best friend's fiancé?? The book does a much better job of detailing how selfish and manipulative Darcy is, and the long journey that is Darcy and Rachel's and Dex and Rachel's relationship. You see the constant competition, and how Darcy always steals Rachel's thunder. Even though you do not want to sympathize with or like Rachel, you cannot help it. By the end you are cheering for her. I was not doing that in the movie; in fact I could not stand Rachel in the movie.   Next, Darcy in the book was model gorgeous and very stylish, in the movie Kate Hudson had put on weight and the clothes that they tried to squeeze her into accentuated her extra pounds in all the wrong places and made her look trashy. On the other hand - Rachel looked frumpy, tired, and old. Whoever dressed these characters missed the mark.    Basically, if you have not read the book, you may like the movie. If you have read the book, you are going to be sorely disappointed in this awful adaptation. Rather than buy the movie - get the book. If you really want to see the movie wait for it to come out in Redbox - it's worth the dollar - anything more is a waste.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|This movie is very good story-telling. It does not have the glitzy glamor, super-packed action, and sex-infused aspects of Hollywood film-making. But it is subtle, intelligent, and multi-layered. One of the better vampire stories out there. An American version has already been made, entitled \\"Let Me In\\". I prefer the Swedish original, even with the irritating subtitles. But for those who dislike subtitles, there is an English-dubbed version.    The story begins with a mysterious girl and her \\"father\\" who move into an apartment building occupied by, among others, a lonely, fragile young boy named Oskar. Oskar is the victim of schoolmate bullying, and the daily occurrence has taken a tremendous psychological toll on him. He has withdrawn from a normal schoolboy life, and maybe for that reason is immediately drawn to Eli, his strange, new neighbor. There friendship grows, despite Eli's secretive existence, until she finally trusts him with her secret. Their friendship has tangible benefits for Oskar, while at the same time leading him down a path of no return.

1400069181|2.0|Toms. The espadrilles that socially conscious twentysomethings like to wear with a defiant message \\"we're both wearing shoes, but mine make a difference in a shoeless child's life.\\" Win. Match point. I just wear shoes. For the quick 411, Toms shoes are argentinian canvas shoes. For each shoe purchased ($49.00 MSRP for basic styles) a pair of shoes is donated to a destitute child. That's laudable. But, as founder Blake Mycoskie mentions, combining social action with commerce is new. I question whether paying a high price for canvas shoes so a child can receive a pair that I'm essentially buying is social justice or conniving feel-good retailing. That being said, it doesn't matter to a shoeless child how he/she received their pair. So, the skeptic in me questions the motivations, but I can't argue with the results. In returning to the book, the initial content with requisite struggles and missteps is the truly passionate part of the book that was enjoyable to read. Less compelling were the subsequent chapters detailing family specs, other inspiring product retailer tales, and an annoying final section with preachy suggestions such as to follow Blake's lead and abandon your condo for a 200-square foot boat because \\"things\\" weigh you down. To each his own!
0307408833|1.0|All the recipes I've tried from this book have been extremely expensive failures. I thought it was me, but then a friend who is an experienced pastry chef gave it a go and also got poor results. The directions are very brief and leave out critical steps. e.g. the frosting (which, as the previous reviewer mentioned is not the one used in the bakery) comes out weirdly gritty every time. I just learned -- because I went online and read Erin's blog -- that in any recipe that calls for coconut oil you are supposed to melt it before using. I went back and read every reference to coconut oil and nowhere in the book does it say to melt it first. EPIC FAIL. This book is a cheap PR stunt.
0061726826|5.0|Love, and everything that goes with it, is a curse in Delirium. People have operations to change the part of their brains that causes them to love, to hate, and even to feel. Society is perfectly in order, and there is little crime. But is it worth the price?<br /><br />After meeting Alex, Lena doesn't think so. She's feared that the virus of love has run through her veins her whole life because her mother succumbed to it. After meeting Alex, she learns to embrace her emotions. The society built around her is a bunch of lies, and the only way to break free is to escape and never go back again.<br /><br />I loved this book. The constant intensity of an oppressing society held my attention throughout. The characters are all very well rounded, (even the flat toned ones that have had the operation-which I'm sure is hard to write). The best relationship is between Lena and her best friend, Hana. I enjoyed reading about them whenever they were together.<br /><br />This book ends on quite a cliffhanger! I've already pre-ordered the sequel, Pandemonium. Excellent job, Lauren Oliver. You've got my attention!
B003YHSE7W|4.0|Did a decent job of following up Iron Man 1. I missed Terrance Howard, But Don Cheadle is also a great actor. I liked the S.H.I.E.L.D. references and influence on the movie. Can't wait for Avengers
B004OCCFFI|5.0|This is a live recording from the 2010 Lucerne Festival, though no applause or audience noises was audible.<br />I think Claudio Abbado really made a tremendous effort in interpreting the score as well as 'amalgamating' two chamber orchestras and one chorus.<br />As is noted by other reviewers, the ensemble work and orchestral performance are truly terrific. Starting right from the Overture, Abbado gribs his audience and put them all on their chairs' ends.<br />The soloists offer a very solid and even performance with a couple of standouts. Christof Fischesser and Jonas Kaufmann offer outstanding performances as Florestan and Rocco. To a slightly lessor extent is Nina Stemme's Leonora and Falk Struckmann's Don Pizzaro, but both are still sterling in their respective portrayals. As the young couple of Jaquin and Mazzeline, both Strehl and Harnish are nothing less than sterling, as is also the case with Mattei's Don Fernando.<br />True that Stemme in the big aria Abscheulicher! Wo eilst du hin? could not bring out the dramatic intensity completely, but she was still convincing enough, whereas Jonas Kaufmann is truly amazing in Gott! - Welch Dunkel hier! as well as the trio Euch werde Lohn in bessern Welten.<br />The orchestras yield forth opulent sounds under the seasoned direction of the veteran Abbado. Indeed, the overall beauty of the performance is too overwhelming for minute quibbles, and a solid 5-stars is inevitable.<br />1 August 2011
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Just no. I will never buy a Star Wars item until the original film is restored. If that's never... fine.
B002E9HACG|5.0|This album is a killer and I can't understand why more people don't know about it. Grab a copy and play it loud. The title track is just haunting. \\"Catch that Plane\\" is a fun tune. \\"The Beast\\" \\"U Devil U\\" and \\"Run with the Angels\\" are tough tunes if you like the harder Europe. \\"New Love in Town\\" is an awesome power ballad, but stripped down without the 80s glam. Tempest's voice is naturally not as high as it was in his younger days, but I happen to think that maturity is a good thing for their music. My favorite track is the bluesy ballad \\"In My Time\\" which captures Europe at their best and includes a two minute closing lead solo by John Norum.
B00006AW2J|5.0|Fantastic sound from this 16bit cd. The DSD mastering is a big step up in quality from the earlier issues from the Stones catalouge. The music is kind of all over the place, but shows the changes their sound was going through at the time. Some great songs, some not-so-great. Overall, well worth the purchase price for fans.
B004QK5N5W|1.0|I recently purchased this adapter so that I could watch Hulu on my HDTV. It does not work at all. I have a Polaroid TV and when I connect the adapter and tried to play an Itunes video, it registered that it was connected and playing on the TV but all there was, was a black screen. Double checked the HDMI connection and the output channel and still nothing. Watched youtube videos where it was so easy. NOT FOR ME! Buyers beware.
B001KL3GZO|5.0|Wonderful version of this classic album! This is the 3rd version of Kind of Blue I have purchased on CD, and its by far the best. Excellent sound quality for a 16bit disc. I also really enjoy the extra takes on the 2nd disc. Sonically, not as lush and spacious as the new LP version, but very good for a redbook cd.

B003Y5H4Y8|4.0|Debts take time, even generations, to settle. What we owe friends and loved ones often carries more urgency than those we'd eagerly pay enemies.<br /><br />In John (not football coach) Madden's taut espionage thriller \\"The Debt,\\" young Mossad agents Stephan (Marton Csokas), David ( Sam Worthington), and Rachel (an electrifying Jessica Chastain) felt they owed their families, countrymen, and the world the capture and trial of Nazi war criminal Dieter Vogel (an superb Jasod Christiansen), the near-demonic \\"Surgeon of Birkenau.\\" Their meticulous plan falls apart,  but Rachel's brave and resilient act ends Vogel's life.<br /><br />At least they return with that story to their home country, becoming national heroes and inspiring Rachel's daughter's best-selling book on the event. It also became their near30-year secret until stunning news in 1997 draws out a now-retired Rachel (the always stunning Helen Mirren) as the only person to settle accounts not just for Vogel's victims but for her family. (Mirren sounds especially convincing telling her child's father, \\"I wanted to do something to make my daughter proud of me.\\") Their cohort, David, may have been owed the biggest debt:  Vogel taunted him and his race years after murdering his family, and David took the guilt of the trio's secret to his grave.<br /><br />\\"The Debt's\\"  settings masterfully capture gray, decaying East Berlin under constant watch, tension, and cigarette smoke. Madden builds explosive action scenes from cramped, vulnerable backgrounds: the leaking apartment young Rachel cannot leave, the doctor's office where the Surgeon of Birkenau has her legs spread in stirrups.  The 1997 scenes serve as character development and don't quite measure until the film's jaw-dropping conclusion.  But Mirren's key scene getting needed information from an after-hours newsroom packs its share of humor and tension (sexual and otherwise).<br /><br />\\"The Debt\\" is a sturdy, grown-up spy, revenge film, with Chastain and Mirren  providing a femimist twist.  Their thoughtful, even athletic performances settle the imagination it takes to see both actresses as one character(especially when dealing with David as lover, then martyr).  In a dwindling summer film season of sequels, special effects, and over-the-top acting, \\"The Debt\\" pays the audience its best returns.Their thoughtful, even athletic performances settle the imagination it takes to see both actresses as one character(especially when dealing with David as lover, then martyr).

B004LWZW2E|4.0|This is a great old-fashion haunted house movie. The score is creepy, the atmosphere is thick, plenty of shadows, and suspense. Unfortunately, the ending putters about and gets a little hookey, thus losing a star.    A young family has just moved into a new home, when one of the sons mysteriously falls into some kind of unexplainable coma. Now most of the weird things begin. Things move, doors open, voices are heard, figures are seen. Just when the couple thinks that they have solved their problems by moving, we realize the the problem is far worse than a haunted house.    The acting is very well done, and the camera angles and shadows are all thoughtfully arranged. The figures are shown just enough to be scarey, but not too much to lose their edge. Also, there is virtually no blood or bad CGI, which is a nice change to more recent thrillers. And the characters are not stupid, they are appropriately scared, don't want to be alone, look for help when they realize they need it, and they move when they think they have too. Lin Shaye does a great job as a psychic who tries to help them. And while I liked her character, it was at this point in the movie that the pace to begins to slow, as explanations are given.     I won't say that the premise of astral projection is stupid, as others have, because in a scarey, ghost movie, I don't think that many premises would be stupid, pretty much anything goes. However, the pace of the movie slows down. Also, the movie switches gears a bit, from focusing on the mother to focusing on the father. Not that Patrick Wilson did a bad job acting, I just found Rose Byrne more believable and her character more empathic. Also, this is when the \\"ghosts\\" are on screen more, and this is where the premise of the astral projection becomes a problem - how to show it on screen. I just thought it fell a little flat, and that more could have been done, thus making the ending scarier. That said, I still enjoyed the movie overall and highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys haunted houses and ghost story movies.
0439023513|5.0|After reading some of the reviews for this book I was almost on the fence of not reading it. If you feel the same way I urge you to do as well. None of the negative comments seemed true to me. A lot of people complained that the author failed at creating likeable characters and I found that to be untrue. Katnis was a little unstable for my taste but who really knows how shell shocked 17 years old would feel like?  A lot of people complained about the ending but I think it was awesome, edgy and surprising. I love it.  All in all, a great ending to a great series. I really do not understand the people that gave the book 2 or 1 star, they must really of had some interesting expectations.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|George Lucas has no talent, and I'll leave it at that. He has luck (New Hope), and money (stupid people like us who buy his deuces whenever he craps them out). The best of Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, barely has any Lucas on it at all. That should tell you something.    But now, he's intent on further raping what he's whored for decades. I'll say it right here, and right now: No more Star Wars, no more George Lucas. It's obvious that we won't get what we want or deserve, so it's high time to move on. Star Wars has died.

B000I2J6K0|5.0|I bought this DVD going into my 3rd trimester. Up until then I had been doing prenatal yoga and still going to the gym. I just started feeling like I wasn't getting as much out of them as I wanted. At the gym I was doing light weights and cardio, and third trimester yoga is very limiting. I started feeling like I was completely losing all of my muscle tone. The last I wanted to feel, on top of everything else going on in my body, was soft and out of shape. This DVD targets all the areas I was concerned about (biceps, triceps and thighs). It also gets your heart rate up without causing you to feel like you are over-doing it. Another bonus is that you don't have to buy equipment along with the dvd. She uses her coffee table, a chair and the wall. I personally love this DVD and I am so glad that I found it. I am in my eight month and I still have so much energy and sleep really well and I definately feel like this video helps me attain that.
B0034G4ORM|5.0|This movie is definitely a war movie first, alien movie second, so for those of you skeptics out there I highly recommend you pick this movie up if you are at all a fan of war movies. What I love about this movie is, while the aliens DO have different and slightly better technology(as far as body armor goes anyway) they are not completely out of this world like your typical sci-fi/alien movies. NO laser guns or force fields whatsoever. They're weapons sound and shoot just like ours, the battlefield is fair ground for both sides except for....well I won't spoil it for ya...    HIGHLY highly recommend giving it a look.

My husband and I are furiously debating all the details of this book and the last, wishing and wishing that we could just start Day 3.  This is a wonderful book full of twists and turns, with characters so rich and well-drawn, that I find I know them as I would a friend. Patrick Rothfuss is a masterful writer, and can turn a phrase like no other.

We are our memories, are we not? It is what makes us who we are. Our anchor in this crazy thing we call life. Even though we know that memories are unreliable and get changed every time we access them, there is still this sense that we remember. And because we remember we know who we are. The book explores who we are when we do not remember our lives. Much to think about.

B005DI65L2|2.0|I learned one thing new in the book, about wolf packs. Here is a quote from Ms. Horowitz' publisher with her:    \\"So when your dog licks your mouth, he is probably doing something similar: seeing what you've eaten, and encouraging you to spit some of it up (they will never be unhappy if you do...unlike the others in your life who may kiss you on the mouth). On the other hand, it is still fair to call this behavior a \\"greeting\\" behavior -- one which despite its gory past, is also indication of recognition, familiarity, and -- perhaps! -- affection.\\"      Only the dumbest dog owner would not know that their dog is not kissing them because they love them, although dogs use their tongues for much more than fact finding, such as communicating \\"I want.\\" The dog does give a little lick as a kiss now and then, but they want generally to know where you have been.  They smell your pants leg, your hair, your hands, your mouth and your butt to know what you have been eating.  Dogs do have hope, because they're hoping that some of whatever you've touched will come their way, such as the hamburger you picked up from the drivethru.  But a dog knows through experience that you will not vomit up some food for him, so he is not trying to spark your regurgitation \\"zone,\\" as Horowitz likes to cite her professors.  Perhaps the licking was intended to induce vomiting when the dog was a puppy, but Horowitz doesn't acknowledge that dogs are highly intelligent beings who quickly figure out no one's vomiting a Big Mac for them today.    The licking is a dog's conscious means of bonding, and unconsciously, his way to leave his scent on the rest of his pack without peeing on them.  It's no less affectionate than kissing one's spouse as they leave the house to remind him he belongs to you, and again when he comes home as a reward for returning.     I'd have liked for her to write less like she was livening up her doctoral dissertation, and even less like we needed her dog Pump as an example.  More examples, please.  Reading this book felt like listening to a insecure person talking about her dog.

B003L77GRO|5.0|I'm a Dexter fan, he's my hero. The thoughts running through his mind reflect how a lot of people feel about criminals. Loosing control is a constant threat for Dexter and he walks a fine line trying not to get caught. His method of disposal is interesting and his ability to hide in plain sight is almost unnerving. Gotta love Dex.
0307454886|3.0|Right after I finished this book I watched Elegy, which is a movie based on the book. I'd say you could skip the book and go straight to the DVD.<br /><br />It's not that I didn't enjoy it. I just don't know that I would have enjoyed it if I didn't know as much about Roth's background as I do. Because you see, it was based directly on a situation in his life.<br /><br />That situation is basically that he's an old man but he still loves the young ladies. He is a professor at a major university, sets his sites on a Cuban girl in his class and begins sleeping with her. Eventually he does weird things like lick blood off of her legs.<br /><br />The book is a pretty self-indulgent undertaking. It is clearly just him trying to make sense of the affair and an attempt to discern why it affected him so much. I don't think he quite accomplishes that but I did end the book feeling like I'd gotten some useful insight into his own life and how it's affected a few of his other books.<br /><br />Overall : I would not recommend this to anyone who is just starting out with Roth. In fact, I wouldn't even recommend it to a Roth fan who hadn't read both The Professor of Desire and The Breast.

193413712X|5.0|Tinkers was a gift from my mother for my half birthday and, it turns out, a gift from Mr. Harding as well.<br /><br />The novel begins: \\"George Washington Crosby began to hallucinate eight days before he died.\\" While the story is told from the viewpoint of George on his deathbed, it weaves in and out of time, from the story of his epileptic father, whose seizures are proceeded by the feeling and taste of lightening, to George's minister grandfather and through some of George's childhood memories.<br /><br />I finished this book only an hour ago and immediately went to read reviews of it. I was surprised to see that, despite having won the 2010 Pulitzer, it had mostly mediocre reviews. Most of the complaints were that `nothing every happened' and `there was no plot'.<br /><br />Both are true, but that's what made this story so beautiful. It wasn't a story that felt crafted by an author, though the prose was lyrical and delicious. It wasn't complicated. It wasn't a story of what happens to people. It wasn't even a story of who those people were. It was simply a story of what people choose to do with what's given to them.<br /><br />George's father was a small time door to door salesman, traveling via a horse and buggy. Much of the story was the recounting of things that once were fixed, that we are now quick to discard. Clocks, clothing, furniture... things that are now considered disposable that once were worth mending.<br /><br />Though, during the same time frame that we're following George's father helping to mend the broken possessions of his neighbors and customers, his father was himself thrown away. As he aged and his seizures became more violent and severe, the only thing to be done with him was to send him to a home for the criminally insane.<br /><br />I really don't know how to put into words what I learned from this book or what I thought about it. For me, reading this book was an experience. It touched me more deeply than anything I've read in a long time. This is a book that deserves being re-read, and I have every intention of doing so.<br /><br />From a review by Elizabeth McCracken: \\"Paul Harding's Tinkers is not just a novel - though it is a brilliant novel. It's an instruction manual on how to look at nearly everything.\\"nd I have every intention of doing so.

1400077915|5.0|Runaway is a collection of short stories written by Alice Munroe. I first discovered her last year when I was actively working to read more women authors. I picked up Women & Fiction, a collection of short stories, one of which was written by Ms. Munroe. Despite not typically being interested in short stories, I was taken with her story and thus sought out this volume.<br /><br />I couldn't have been more impressed. I have a few issues with short stories, generally. First of all, it is very difficult to gain my attention in a span of 5-50 pages. I am much more impressed by and interested in character development than plot development. I've found that very few short story writers have the chops to interest me in their characters with so few pages.<br /><br />There are some exceptions and some short story writers who have impressed me. Still, I've always been left wishing they would have made a novel out of it. Short stories always feel unfinished to me and I always feel like I'm just getting a glimpse into the story, when I want the whole shebang.<br /><br />With this collection, Munroe has proven to me that there is indeed at least one short story writer out there who can complete perfect stories in a such a short time frame. While I did love her characters and stories, I did not come to the end and wish they would continue. I came to the end of each of them and felt . . . satisfied.<br /><br />I can't recommend Ms. Munroe enough.

B001EQ5ZJK|1.0|Let me cut to the chase on this. After reading the book, it now appears it was nothing more than  a come on to get you interested in a consciousness raising program called Psych-K. Oh yes, the author is directly involved with the Psych-K program and profits directly from it.<br /><br />The author proclaims himself to be a cell biologist. So we get to hear lots about cell division throughout the book and learn a bit about epigenetics. Before long, we're moved into prenatal and perinatal environmental influences on children. And without missing a beat, the author offers his hopes for mankind to defy evolution's survival of the fittest pattern, and replace it with a \\"love conquers all\\" paradigm. It works for Bonobos, so why not for humans.  For those of you who have enough years under your belt, you may want to find your old love beads and break into a chorus of John Lennon's \\"Imagine\\" ( a song I do like).<br /><br />As I worked my way through the book, I kept asking myself where it was going, as it seemed to lack coherent direction. The author kept alluding to his spiritual awakening which paralleled his new found understanding of cell biology. And as the book pulls into the final destination we discover that his spiritual metamorphosis was accomplished through PSYCH-K. Ah, so that's where he was leading us all this time ! We are never told exactly what PSYCH-K does, but are encouraged to check them out, visit their website, etc.; in other words, buy more books,tapes, sign up for a seminar. And you'll find the author's name prominently displayed over in PSYCH-K land. If you want another copy of his book, you can even get it there.<br /><br />In reading the book, you'll pick up some catchy words or phrases to impress your friends with: e.g. epigenetics, fractal geometry, quantum physics and lots more...<br />You'll enjoy the book if you appreciate the author's ability to quickly transition from pseudo scientific jargon into pop psychology and mysterious mental-spiritual voodoo.<br />I'm pretty sure that I downloaded this book as a freebie. And that's about what it's worth, unless you like paying for sales pitches.<br />Considering the self serving ending of the book, I would pretty much question the validity of most everything else that went before it.

My musical tastes have changed over the years from dance, hip hop, and pop to mostly alternative and indie rock but I always buy Melanie's albums and I always enjoy them.     If you liked Melanie's previous albums, you won't be disappointed with The Sea. It continues her style of pop mixed with rock and occasional dance. Many of the songs incorporate elements of a few different styles so they can be hard to fit into one category.     Here's a quick run-down of the songs:  1) The Sea - Kind of dark, definitely interesting song. A good way  to kick off the album. My second favorite track.  2) Weak - My favorite track. Rock mixed with Middle Eastern beats.  3) Think About It - The most poppy song on the album. Sounds like it could easily fit in on American radio.  4) Beautiful Mind - Nice song. Reminds me of Carolyna.  5) One by One - An acoustic pop song  6) Stupid Game - Really cool song. Kind of 80s-ish.   7) All About You - Slower acoustic song about breaking up.  8) Burn - Pop song similar to previous Mel C songs  9) Drown - Ballad with a bit of an edge  10) Get Out of Here - Kind of old-fashioned belt-it-out-type song  11) Enemy - Another really cool song. A rock ballad with a powerful symphony.    To sum it up, this is an album I can listen to without skipping tracks. Not every track is a masterpiece, but I can find things about all of them to like. If you like even 1 or 2 Melanie C songs, I think you should check out this album. Thanks for another great album, Melanie!
B004EPYZXK|1.0|SPOILER ALERT - SPOILERS MAY FOLLOW (you have been warned)    I really wanted to like this movie.  I like sci-fi and I like the occasional scary movie so even seeing that it was not getting good press I decided to chance it.    First off, this is one of those shaky-cam films and that just isn't a good gimmick.  The premise is that this is recovered footage, blah blah blah, but it is just a film style that is unpleasant for me, even when it is done well (and this is not well done).  There is a lot of blurred video that cuts abruptly and makes it hard to watch.  In addition, the audio doesn't match what you are seeing.  Sure, when someone talks the audio syncs up perfectly, but other times the audio track carries on and on all the time with radio messages while the videos are cutting and jumping all over the place.  If the video is cutting then the audio should as well.  And it does cut (complete with ear-numbing pops, squeals and blasts of static) but it doesn't do it at the same time the video does.  So not only is it shaky cam but the audio doesn't help matters any.  It is not a long movie but it is tiring to watch.    The movie starts out well enough and builds up the tension steadily but then near the end it just jumps into fast forward and ten minutes later you are done.  Watching it feels like a lot of work for very little payoff.  Almost as if they spent all their energy just setting up the introduction and then just slammed out an ending as soon as they could.    The ending (and really the whole plot) is just not that good.  This is one of those movies that gives you only a brief glimpse of menace and then never really has it materialize into something you can understand or appreciate.  It felt almost like they understood how implausible it all was and so they didn't offer you anything substantial as a way to avoid having you tear holes into it - and boy, you can really tear holes in this movie.      The whole premise (SPOILERS!!!) is that certain rocks on the moon \\"feel odd\\" and then sprout legs and attack you when you are about to escape.  The Department of Defense, with an unspecified level of help from the Russians, know something is up there killing cosmonauts and so someone at NASA or DOD or something figures they should send some more fresh meat up there without giving them any warning and only the most basic of instructions (\\"hey you, set up these motion cameras in case some Russians happen to walk in front of them\\").  Not sure what the goal there would be because if they knew there was something up there it would seem like they would want to have a well-informed and well-trained crew to get the most info possible but then you wouldn't have an Apollo 18 movie so...
B000JBWWQ0|5.0|\\"The Celestine Prophecy\\" is a learning experience as well as a wonderful film. I bought this movie after I read the book \\"The Celestine Prophecy\\" which I enjoyed very much. It is a thought provoking film with great scenery and action. I have now completed most of James Redfield's books and hope for more.
B002ZG99QS|4.0|Our family liked the action in the movie, except for at the ending of the movie.  We liked the special effects. -The End
B004I1AGTC|4.0|Donnie Yen comes back as Wing Chun martial arts grandmaster Ip Man in this thrilling sequel to the 2008 hit \\"Ip Man.\\" Set in 50s Hong Kong, where injured Ip Man is taken after what happened at the end of the original, the story of the loose biopic takes a similar course to that of its predecessor, though martial arts stunts remain as effective as before.     Ip Man and his family move to Hong Kong under British colonial rule, where he opens a martial arts school to propagate his discipline. Things are not easy for the master, however, as a street scuffle involving his first student Wong Shun Leung (Huang Xiaoming) leads to a brawl in the market, and then a fighting ceremony attended by local teachers including a Hung Ga master Hung Chun-nam (Sammo Hung), where, he is informed, the reluctant hero must prove his skills.     But Ip Man's courage and strength is really tested when a British boxing champion \\"The Twister\\" (Darren Shahlavi) insults Chinese martial arts and his country too in public.    With Donnie Yen and Sammo Hung, \\"Ip Man 2\\" does not fail to deliver top quality action scenes aplenty, though some of them clearly rely on wire stunts (which I do not hate). Donnie Yen is in perfect form as the titular hero with fast blows and defenses. His intense close combat style is impressive.     With more focus on our hero as a loving husband, \\"Ip Man 2\\" explores his personality with several episodes not directly related to fighting. Simon Yam reprises the role he played in the original, as Zhou Qing Quan, Yip Man's best friend. Lynn Hung also returns as Ip Man's understanding wife, now pregnant. Even Fan Siu-wong, who played the original's aggressive martial artist-turned robber Jin Shanzhao, shows up.     All in all, Wilson Yip, director of the two Ip Man films, manages to keep a brisk pace, though some viewers (especially those who haven't seen the first \\"Ip Man\\") might think that the film could have been better without some supporting characters. What I find irritating is some of the British actors and their terrible overacting, which I hope is intentional. But, with an amusing reference to Bruce Lee (one of Ip Man's students), \\"Ip Man 2\\" is an enjoyable martial arts action film.
B002ZG976U|5.0|I loved this movie!!!  I don't know why the critics blasted it.  It's a pleasant upbeat story that doesn't take itself too seriously.  I knew about Christina Aguilera but I wasn't really familiar with her singing other then her contribution to the soundtrack of Moulin Rouge (which I also love) were she sings Lady Marmalade with Pink, Mya, and Lil Kim and it is fabulous.  I thought her acting was just fine but her dancing and singing in Burlesque was sensational.  If you want to watch an entertaining movie with a happy ending then Burlesque is for you.
B0000047CW|5.0|Its probably fair to say that this album, today, lies a bit in the shadow of the somewhat more well known and truly outstanding \\"Getz/Gilberto\\".  Don't let that fool you.  Jazz Samba is every bit as good.  As on Getz / Gilberto, Getz's playing here is gorgeous - the man had a one-of-a-kind tone on the tenor saxophone and it shines through here.  But as compared to Getz's other bossa nova efforts, including Getz / Gilberto, the guitar here is a bit more in the forefront - these pieces are really duets between Getz and Byrd on his guitar.  Byrd's guitar playing here is intricate and improvisational, and he and Getz are playing off each other.  On some of Getz's other bossa albums, the guitar playing is generally more subdued, a little more subtle and not as improvisational - perhaps more indicative of the \\"true\\" bossa style, as the guitarists on those albums were several of the Brazilians at the core of the bossa movement - but IMHO even if this CD is less authentic, the guitar playing is generally more effective here.  Another difference between this recording and Getz / Gilberto is the lack of vocals - the instruments take center stage on this album and they stay there.  Although I love the vocals on Getz / Gilberto (and on Getz's effort with Lois Bonfa, Jazz Samba Encore), there's something to be said for doing away with them and simply focusing on the music itself.     As to the tracks themselves, Desafinado (\\"Off key\\") was huge hit off the album.  The full album version is here of course, but a bonus track at the end of the disk is the abbreviated 45 rpm single version that was played on the radio at the time.  This track was also recorded for and included on Getz / Gilberto, but I prefer this version - here Getz's saxophone takes over the vocal role and in my estimation its more effective that way.  The Getz / Gilberto version sort of gets lost in the shuffle of the other excellent tracks on that disc.  Here, it stands out.    The other track that tends to get mentioned a lot is \\"Samba de uma Nota So\\" (\\"One Note Samba\\"), and also E Luxo So, but for me the real standout track on the album is Samba Triste (\\"Sad Samba\\"), a beautiful, plaintive, minor-key track that Getz absolutely soars on - I could put this track on single repeat and never get tired of it, and never reach for another CD again, ever.
B0043KK4N6|4.0|I loved the movie Burlesque and was looking forward to this soundtrack which is good but not great.  I can't put my finger on it but something is missing.  I wish I could be more specific---I'm going to listen to this soundtrack more often and hopefully it will go from good to great.  If you liked the movie then purchase this soundtrack--I know you will enjoy it.
B004K8WPUQ|5.0|used it in interviews and even to record through the speakers at a wedding and it works great! It is is the best for it's price as i have found with weeks of research before purchase.
B002RHGYOA|5.0|Again a very nice read from the series. I devoured the 2nd in the series, almost faster than the first one. Salander is an intriguing character - and her fight against all evil is cleverly composed of details.
B0058S0OMS|4.0|Wow, defiantly waiting now  looked at it 13 bucks  went back to order it now 20 bucks   that sucks, Still a fantastic movie tho
B005KGPC4S|5.0|I can see why Kevin Smith went outside the traditional Hollywood prodection model with this one: Red State was wholy unexpected and pretty much devoid of Smith's trademark, fouled mouth, outlandish humor. With only a few known faces among the cast, it was surprisingly well acted, well written and put together in a compelling way. I can't be sure because it wasn't credited, but I'm fairly certain Mr. Smith upheld his tradtion of appearing in his films: I'm pretty sure he delivered the last line of the movie, from offscreen. If I'm correct, I'm fairly certain I know Kevin Smith made such a movie: The burning desire to deliver such a statement to narrow-minded hatemongers who couch their fears and hatred in religion.    Not sure why this was listed as horror though. The story and the motivation of Abin Cooper(Michael Parks) and his followers were in truth, horrifying, but the content of the film isn't what one would expect from a \\"Horror\\" film. Watch for more of KErry Bishe' in the future, Hollywood loves young blondes and she played Cheyenne as if she were born for it.    Great movie, well worth the 10 bucks.
B004DK5CYM|5.0|I received my purchased in a very timely manner. Awesome company. I highly recommend them.The packaging of the product was great. The disc was in outstanding condition.[[ASIN:B004DK5CYM Secretariat (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo)]]
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I'm not even a big fan of Star Wars, to be honest, but I completely agree that Lucas has made a mistake by refusing to release the original theatrical versions.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|It is amazing to see the negative response over this set. On one hand, it is a little premature to review something that has not been released yet. On the other hand, everyone knows what they are getting here.    On its merits, I am sure the films look amazing. I thought when the first prequel came out in DVD almost a decade ago, looked amazing. I thought the 2004 box set looked amazing. But like many others, I was surprised by the ch-ch-changes, which is why I am not jumping up and down for this set (in fact, I am more geeked over the Jurassic Park Blu Ray!)    What confuses me is this reluctance Darth Lucas has on releasing the films that people obviously want. I don't get it. Surly, if you add the original ORIGINAL trilogy/Christmas Special/and hell, the Ewoke Adventures for good measure - increase the set to say, $150+, people would buy it. I would buy it! And if Lucas wants to be money-hungry (as we all know and love him as!), he can throw in all the various versions of the films - add another 50 bucks, and get more money.    The idea is giving the consumer, and indeed, the fans - options. I am so glad many people have mentioned Spielberg, my childhood favorite. Both E.T. and Close Encounters include his farting around and the original. Now, take something like Blade Runner. There are MANY versions of that film, and luckily, you can obtain the various versions on DVD/Blu Ray.    The uproar seems to be shared. But life will go on, folks. I still got my '04 DVD set.  I am not either losing my sleep or holding my breath for a COMPLETE set, but it would be nice. And when that day occurs, it will be an instant purchase for me. I am sure I wouldn't be the only one either!    In the mean time - keep fighting rebels.  Darth Lucas will be defeated some day!   Live long and prosper, may the force be with you in the `verse, and long days/pleasant nights!

B003ZSJ212|1.0|First of all, read this \\"review\\" as if it were written with a voice of sadness and disappointment as this review was not written in the \\"heat of the moment\\" like so many other reviews here.  With that, I am extremely happy for those who will enjoy this Blu-ray set.  I envy you.  I envy you not only because you have an extra $90 to squander, but because you are going to enjoy this set for years to come (or at least until the next revision).  Unfortunately, I can't enjoy this set due to some creative choices regarding the films and, especially, the bonus materials.  I actually canceled my pre-order on May the 4th when all was revealed. It certainly was revealed to me and opened my eyes wide as a result.  I knew the lackluster bonus materials were only the tip of the iceberg.    As most people already know, Mr. Lucas and his employees have further altered the Star Wars films.  I am not going to go into detail regarding the changes as countless websites and almost every \\"reviewer\\" on Amazon has already pointed out the newest changes.  As mentioned before, I am not angry at anyone, just sad and disappointed.  See, I was very excited when this set was announced over a year ago. I own less than ten films on Blu-ray.  They are films that are worth the money to me and films I know I will watch repeatedly.  Star Wars is one of the movies I can watch forever and still get goose bumps.  However, I can't buy this set and still have a clear conscience because it will be money wasted.  To me, the only worthy feature of this set are the deleted scenes from the original Star Wars films.  However, I would only watch them once to whet my curiosity.  So, the deleted scenes aren't worth $90 to me.  Instead, when I canceled my pre-order on May the 4th, I donated the $90 I saved for this set to various charities in my area.  I felt much better doing that instead of buying this set.      It wasn't easy accepting that Star Wars' creator is also its destroyer.  You put a good fight, Star Wars, and you were good company.  RIP.
0440178002|5.0|I read all in the Asian Saga and loved (just about) all of them. Shogun and Tai-Pan are the best, and I am constantly searching for other books that can compare. So far I'm not doing that well...
B003ZSJ212|1.0|First I want to say I have been a fan of Star Wars from the beginning, and being that I was born in 1977 Star Wars played a huge part of my childhood.  At four I was convinced I was Luke Skywalker.    In High School I watched the VHS copies so much I literally wore them out.      And now, reading about all the changes made to the original triology makes me feel like a huge part of my childhood has either died or that the Star Wars I loved was only a lie, due to the many changes made to an already great iconic movie.  I was excited about this release, and due to so many more which may seem minor changes I will not be buying.  Maybe on Ebay I can find the VHS versions...    The Fans have made it clear that the much loved orginal movies would be GREATLY appreciated.  Even if this new blu-ray editon had the orignal added with a higher price, I would be the first one at the store with money in hand.  But without that option, I will quit buying any new release of Star Wars that has, in my eyes, been perverted by greed, and not artistic expression.  True, the orginals were not perfect, but it was the imperfections that made the movies perfect!  Puppets were more real than that fake CGI crap that has become too common.  It was bad enough that Indiana Jones 4 has ruined a great iconic triology, but at least I can watch the orginial three with my mind at ease.  I am not given that choice with Star Wars.  and so, without even watching the new edition, and not even wanting to give this crap even one star....I feel like the force has left us.      Lucas, give the fans what they want.  Seriously, what was so wrong about the orginal three that you have stated yourself you will never release?  If they were that bad then why at every Scifi convention the Star Wars community is so huge, and not because of the new released triology but based on the orginal three.  It's not about CGI, Changes, and etc, it was about the innocence of the unaltered orginal movies that were so frickin incredible.  The new changes are just too distracting, and what I have seen with the new changes (AGAIN) is just too disturbing.  Like Michael Jackson (may he rest in peace) you can go one change too many, so many that it changes the original that we loved so much.      RIP Star Wars....until the orginal is released....I will now find the orginal VHS versions and transfer to DVD, that way I can enjoy them the way they were orginally intended, although  maybe not perfect in your eyes Lucas, to us the fans they were truly magic, and what you have done is literally too much for me to handle.
B003GSTLAS|5.0|It's been years since I've watched a TV show with such incredible character development and writing. Here's hoping all involved parties stay involved. If the show breaks bad, it'll break my heart.
0316017930|5.0|This book is both well-written and eye opening.  I began reading, \\"The Outliers,\\" on the recommendation of my younger adult son. He thought that as a psychologist and a parent, I'd find the premise, a critical analysis of what factors may account for extraordinary performances of contemporary as well as historical figures, quite engaging.  He was right.  Western culture seems so focused on the individual accomplishments of our \\"heroes\\" that we sometimes forget that many of those extraordinary accomplishments were the results of personal gifts like intellect, dedicated practice and tenacity but also, happenstance.  In the United States, in particular, we are closely wedded to the notion that success is inexorably tied to one's ability to pull one's self up by one's own bootstraps. Sometimes this perspective even prevents us for offering those in need, a helping hand believing that if such individuals or groups are truly motivated, they can help themselves out of their current or even historical quandary.  Having internalized this \\"bootstrap\\" notion, others sometime reject assistance believing that their accomplishments would be viewed as less \\"worthy\\" since the successes they sought were not then entirely the fruit of only their efforts.  Gladwell makes the case for our expanding our list of attributions for achievement beyond the boundaries of the individual to include all sorts of variables over which the individual had virtually no control.  These examples serve as useful reminders that we should admit to some questions of even of our most basic of assumptions.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Cancelled my preorder, adding Vader saying Nooooo as he throws the emperor in to the reactor was too much for me.  Why ruin a perfectly great moment using the same Nooo! That so many people made fun of in episode 3?  Oh well, saved me $40 today.
0553801473|5.0|Given the long wait for this book reactions are bound to be extremely polarizing; I can't imagine someone who's waited since Storm of Swords to find out what happens next with Jon, Tyrion, and Dany being indifferent to where Martin takes the story in this volume. I was spoiled for most of the major events in this book prior to reading it thanks to the early release overseas and I think it helped me focus on the journey instead of rushing through to the ending. If you want resolution to any of the dangling plot threads you will be frustrated as mostly Martin moves pieces around the board to position them for whatever he has planned next and even introduces new ones (hello Griff and Quentyn) to shake things up. He also expands the scope of the story by moving much of it beyond Westeros in this volume; which contributes to the feeling that things are not progressing towards a resolution on who will win the game of thrones but adds to the depth of the story Martin is telling. I feel like this is a book, like A Feast For Crows, that will be better appreciated when the series is concluded and readers are able to gain perspective on how much the world building and character detail Martin is providing gives weight and scope to how the Song of Ice and Fire eventually concludes. A couple of quick notes: I love the Golden Company and wish Martin was writing a series about them except that then everyone would say he was ripping of Glen Cook; I'm excited that events from the Dunk and Egg stories are tying into the larger story so tightly as it explains why Martin feels the need to take time away from writing the main series to write them; hopefully this means we'll get additional Dunk and Egg stories and an eventual collected volume to put on the bookshelf next to ASOIAF; I absolutely love the depiction of the Northmen in this book, particularly the mountain clans, as it reminds the reader what a truly great leader Ned Stark must have been when he was in his element and underscores how much he was out of that depth in King's Landing; and having re-read the entire series prior to this volume coming out I have to say I do not get the hatred for the Ironborn. Aerion Damphair; okay I get it, but Asha and Victarion are both great (yes Vic is a sadist and a misogynist but that doesn't make him any less entertaining than Jaime Lannister the incestuous attempted child killer)and (belated spoiler) Theon makes a comeback of sorts in this book and earns a certain amount of pity if not respect. A Dance With Dragons might not deliver the Others coming over/through the Wall or Dany and her dragons arriving in the Seven Kingdoms but it does provide a satisfying return to the characters and world that readers of the series have been captivated by for years and set the stage for a potentially incredible climax.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|This app is amazing and a must-have for music lovers. I can listen to my favorite Hawai'ian music stations (yes!) no matter where I am. It stores everything you've set, even if you uninstall it for awhile. I am very happy with it.
0553801473|2.0|Having now finished reading all five volumes of A Song of Ice and Fire, I find myself frustrated, like many others, at the glacial pace (how ironically appropriate) of the plot development, or at least any significant plot development.  For make no mistake, George Martin has a unbridled penchant for weaving interminable plot expansion  with infinite character development until your ready to scream \\"Enough!\\"  Yet somehow it manages to hold your interest through five thousand some pages, though that interest in now being sorely tried as things drag on and on and on.<br /><br />I am also beginning to tire of the horrific world Mr. Martin has created.  It appears to have no redeeming social, moral or other value other than titillating one's libido or vicariously satisfying one's blood lust.  It is next to impossible to really like or identify with any of the main characters with the possible exception of Jon Snow and Arya.  This contempt, or is it cynicism disguised as realism, certainly separates Martin from the likes of Tolkien and Brooks and most other fantasy writers of note.  It does work in the first three books, but is beginning to wear by volumes 4 and 5.  One begins to hope the dragons will level the whole fracking place!

B004A8ZWVU|5.0|The Help is easily the best new movie I've seen in a long time. It really manages a perfect mix of comedy and emotional drama. There were scenes when I laughed out loud in the theater and there were scenes when I cried. More important, the laughs and tears were well balanced throughout the movie so the movie doesn't feel like an out of control emotional roller coaster. On top of that, The Help is a compelling emotional exploration of racism and social ostracism, particularly during the early 1960s. This is a somewhat longer movie (over 2 hours) but you'll feel like every minute was worth it. Absolutely recommended!
B004Y1USV2|3.0|It is not bad, but I was not very impressed.  I tried to be open-minded about a Yes album without Jon Anderson and Rick Wakeman, but I just haven't cared for this one.  When I bought Drama, I was predisposed to not like it, but I liked it very much.  I would recommend saving your money and passing this one by.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|It has been clear since 1997 that George Lucas views movies differently than many of his fans, including this reviewer.  Lucas sees films as inherently imperfect so they should be constantly updated and tinkered with.  I find it astounding that he considers all of his changes to be improvements though- no matter what you think about the changes, I don't see how anyone could like the new dance number in Jabba's palace!  But given the recent history of Star Wars, these new changes should not surprise anyone.  If you haven't heard, the two most objectionable changes are a \\"NOOOO\\" scream to the scene where Darth Vader kills the Emperor, and a new animal call to the scene where Obi-Wan Kenobi scares away the sand people.<br /><br />I think Lucas's way of looking at movies is fundamentally flawed.  Movies are imperfect, but they will always be imperfect.  Even if you change special effects, they will eventually look outdated anyway.  Even the new ANH Jabba sequence had to be updated AGAIN in 2004 because the CGI started to look fake.  I like to view movies as a product of their time.  I don't mind continuity errors in casting choices or old special effects.  What George Lucas is doing goes against the ideals of film preservation and that is just one of the reasons I will not be buying this product.  But even if I accept Lucas's conception of movies, I can't help but think that most of the changes either aesthetically damage the movies or make no difference whatsoever- rendering them utterly pointless.  It goes without saying that I will not be purchasing this blu-ray release.  I am satisfied with the 2006 DVD release which has the original versions.  Buy them while you can, because I heard Lucas will be recalling them once the Blu Ray comes out.

1423101464|5.0|The Battle of the Labyrinth is the 4th book in the Percy Jackson and the Olympians saga.  With Percy getting closer to the infamous age of 16, things are starting to heat up as Luke has discovered the legendary Labyrinth and plans to use it to attack camp half-blood before turning his attention on Olympus.  With the threat of Luke's attack, the rise of Kronos almost upon them and the sudden announcement that Grover might lose his Searcher's License, things are not looking good for Percy and his friends.  Some familiar faces return to team up and attempt to conquer the Labyrinth and hopefully put a stop to Luke's plans.<br /><br />This happens to be my favorite of the books I have read so far (Books 1 thru 4).  It brings books one thru three together exceptionally well to set up what I am sure is going to be an epic conclusion to the 5th book.  The Battle of the Labyrinth follows Rick Riordan's classic style from the previous books, keeping the pace fast and furious with little down time.  At 361 pages (hardcover), this book constantly kept me on my toes as to what might be around the next corner.  I almost felt as if I was in a Labyrinth with Percy and his friends.  Each turn they would make felt as if they just stumbled into a random event.<br /><br />The impending evil that is growing stronger can be felt throughout the book.  There is a slightly dark theme to this book than the previous installments, as well as more complex emotions.  This theme suits the book, especially during the major climax, so well you won't want to put the book down once things start to get going.  Despite the slightly dark theme this book is still perfect for Age 10+.<br /><br />OVERALL this is the best book in the series so far(in my opinion).  There is a lot of depth that is kept simple for the reader.  Rick Riordan does a great job making a book full of twists, turns and action without leaving unanswered questions; a problem I felt the 3rd book had.  With Kronos on the rise Percy and his friends have to risk everything to try and stop the Titan God's revival, even risk challenging the Labyrinth.  Doing so puts Percy on his best and most complex adventure yet.  A definite must read book that will easily entertain you from start to finish.<br /><br />**NOTE: The copy of Book 4 I purchased came as part of a Hardcover Boxset (Library/School binding). It is exceptional quality and built to withstand a lot of reading and abuse. The text is legible and well spread out on the pages making for an easy read.<br /><br />ISBN: 978-142310146-8sk everything to try and stop the Titan God's revival, even risk challenging the Labyrinth.

0439023513|2.0|So like the rest of the fans of the Hunger Games series, I came into reading Mockingjay after I have read the original Hunger Games and Catching Fire. And I have to say that the final installment of the series was a serious disappointed. I was surprised by Collins' lack of in depth detail that made the two of the previous books vivid and captivating in this book. I was debating whether or not to read this book, because such well written book series usually have letdown finales, this one being no exception. The ending does not allow you to draw the future of Katniss and other characters because of its sense of finale, but is ambiguous enough to make you think, \\"what just happened and why?\\"    In conclusion, if you're the type that enjoys continue a series' characters alone, DO NOT read this book. It will let you down.
0545265355|4.0|Will say this series will stick with you.  Either because of how riveting it is, by how much it will haunt you, or how heart wrenching it is.  For those of you that are over 14 I would say this will be an amazing read, it will make you think of things in a way that many have never had to before.  It makes you look at life if you truly had some tragedies in it.  It also makes you look inward and see just where your line for taking a life would lie.  Some who could never do it, others to only protect, others for vengeance, and then there are others who would do it for the mere entertainment of it.  It also opens that door on how you would handle/feel about it afterwards.           But because of these things above I do feel anyone under 14 should not read it.  One of the messages in the book is how we should protect our children, not just from death but also from having to grow up too soon.  To face things that children really shouldn't have to.  Now I know that depends on the child, and the parent but I for one wouldn't want my 11 year old nephew to wonder and think about things that are in this book just yet.  I believe that they only get to be innocent once why make them lose that so soon?          That said, I will have to say I couldn't put this series down.  I finished it in 3 days.  I did get chocked up and my girlfriend laughed at me till she cried a couple of times.  Once in the first book then again in the third.  I will not say where, but when you do read it, you will know.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Probably my most used app. Very reliable. Works great- consistently. Totally recommend it. Hate it because it wakes me up. Love it because it wakes me up!
0553386794|1.0|Because if you do, you'll be stuck fast in the mire of it, too. I've read up till the third book, and it took me about two weeks to get that far...but it feels like months I've been slogging through this series. There are spoilers ahead.<br /><br />There is one commenter who referred to this series as \\"evil trash\\", and I really feel that \\"evil trash\\" is about as succinct as it gets. I love fantasy fiction. It's hard to believe that I would be three books deep into a series and be completely disgusted and enraged by said series, but here I am.<br />I read some review of this series that referred to Martin as \\"America's Tolkien\\", and I can't fathom how you could compare the two. Tolkien created \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", which are not only exceptional pieces of writing, but also enchanting tales that few readers can help but be sucked in to, heart and soul. Middle Earth becomes a real place you wish you could visit. Martin's series, on the other hand, is almost exploitation- of the reader, to see how far he can push you. Cheap violence, copious mentions of rape and horse slaughter, stupid plot twists. He drags you through endless chapters from a certain character's point of view, during which time they accomplish little to nothing in the way of moving the plot forward, and then he mercilessly kills off that character just as you've begun to be truly interested. He wastes time on pointless characters that are not interesting, while doing little service to the characters who ARE interesting.<br />It is a tedious, slogging series that could be easily fit into two or three books....but FIVE?Six or even SEVEN?? I'll go no further than three. I'll find a synopsis online, and not have my time wasted with shoddy writing and pointless nonsense. In another author's hands, this could be a decent story. Stick with the HBO series, it's pure trash...but better than the books.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I love the flexibility this alarm app gives with setting different alarms and &quot;repeatability&quot;. I also absolutely love that I can set it to play a random song from a specific artist.  the only improvement there I could suggest would be for it to be able to read playlists.  Customization is also a huge win with how you want to snooze (button or shake) change time intervals between snoozes, etc.
0553582038|1.0|I read a review of this series somewhere that referred to Martin as \\"America's Tolkien.\\" I hope Tolkien was rolling in his grave over that, because this man is as much like Tolkien as I am- which is to say, not at all. Truth be told, I haven't read the fourth book yet, but based on the reviews, I'm seriously considering throwing in the towel. Or at least finding a synopsis online somewhere, so that I can find out what happens without wasting even more of my time on this drivel. I'm thinking, in fact, or posting a review on the first book that says \\"DO NOT START READING THIS SERIES\\". The show is infinitely better...and the show is trash, too. You might ask why I'm so angry, and it's just this: Martin is wasting my time. I've been reading this series for what feels like months, although in reality just a couple of weeks. The series is tedious and it drags. I just realized that there are FIVE books, and got so enraged I couldn't see straight. Five books? You could tell this story in two or three, at the most. There are hundreds of pointless characters, stupid plot twists, and Martin mercilessly kills off one protagonist after the other...after dragging you through the many slogging chapters from that character's point of view. The constant descriptions of horse slaughter and rape got pretty tedious as well.  Medieval history is quite unpleasant enough, but it might actually be more interesting than this pap. \\"America's Tolkien\\", indeed.
B004Y1QKKK|5.0|Delphi has become my first choice when purchasing collected works of authors and their Oscar Wilde collection is one of several I have purchased from them. I can get public domain works for free, so a seller has to offer something more to convince me to pay for something I could get free. As with Delphi's other collections, this is a first rate product. The works are in one folder, which makes my Kindle library more manageable, but other sellers offer that convenience. The comprehensive, complete public domain contents, active table of contents, numerous photographs, numerous illustrations, biographical information, contextual notes, low price, ability to receive upgrades, etc., set Delphi's collections apart and make them a bargain. The buyer who constantly gives Delphi one-star reviews must have a personal vendetta, because the product is definitely deserving of 5 stars by any objective standards. Collections where copyright laws prevent inclusion of an author's total oeuvre, are as complete as legally possible, and this is not the seller's fault and is not a fraud. The seller clearly states that non-public domain works are not included. The collections are still a bargain, and one can always supplement them by filling in the gaps from other sources. I hope Delphi continues to add more authors to their catalogue, because I prefer their collections to anyone else's. As for the works themselves, this is Oscar Wilde and that says it all--five stars!
B000JML7EC|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed a chance to read Treasure Island after so many years. I enjoyed it as much as I did the first time I read it so many years ago. I highly recommend it to others who are seeking some escape from the modern era.
1594744769|4.0|I really liked this book.  The story was fresh and engaging.  The plot twists kept me thoroughly hooked for the majority of the read. Rigg's use of the authentic vintage photos was inspiring.  (Enter the creepy zone at this point!)  The story went from very normal, to mystery to adventure flawlessly, although I did feel the adventure portion was a little trite and contrived.  The overwhelmingly quick and smooth pace of the book seemed to get bogged down once the mysteries were solved.    I can see this book becoming a very popular movie someday; the visual imagery was grand!  I think it's a must read for young people who know Riggs through his big screen work.  They would pick it up for that reason alone!  My one complaint is a rather obvious flaw in the plot.  (Don't read on, this could be a spoiler.)  Fairly early in Jake's adventure with the peculiar children they discuss the fact that they cannot spend lengthy amounts of time in the \\"real word.\\"  If they do, it is clearly implied that they will dry up, or shrivel up, and die.  This is demonstrated by an apple that Jake takes from the loop into the real world.  However, by the end of the book, they are all out in the real world, out of the loop, and on a huge adventure to rid the world of hallows and wights.  So...how, in less than 200 pages, did they gain the power to do this?  Unless I missed a key piece of info while reading, I certainly hope Mr. Riggs explains this early in the sequel!    This inequity is probably one of the reasons it took me a week to read the last few chapters, versus the several days it took me to read the rest of the book.  Except for this one flaw, which is pretty big in my opinion, the book is a skillfully written coming of age story.  I would definitely recommend it!
B005C9YZKU|1.0|Okay, this packaging looks beautiful and all, but it seems ironic that such wasteful packaging was used on this series about our Earth.
B005J0VPNC|2.0|no flash. no option to export photos. basic effects compared to similar apps. some of the free apps are superior.
B0024Y7H10|4.0|I cant believe I never watched this before. Great series. Not perfect, but I wish  i could get in a bubble travel back a couple years, and get everyone to watch this. Maybe then, Fox wouldn't have terminated my new favorite show  =(      PS I love Summer Glau & Amazon Prime <3
1416562605|5.0|I have recommended this book to many friends and readers.  A wonderful narrative voice that is both horrifying and lovable.  Such a unique perspective on India and the choices that individuals make to navigate a path through this intricate society that is both very modern while also rooted in the beliefs and behaviors of the past.  This is one narrator you will love!!
B003Y5H53S|2.0|Let me start by saying I did not read any reviews before purchasing this... wish I had.  I assumed it would be a \\"kid friendly\\" movie.  I was shocked that there was cussing in this movie.... why is that necessary???
B0057A6GA6|5.0|This game is super Awesome and addictive!! I just can not wait till other levels and Grave Defense 2 comes out.
B000O8OTNC|2.0|first off, i wasnt to crazy about the way the sharpener felt . it just felt really cheap.  the diamond stick sharpener literally fell apart after about 4 minutes of sharpening my ka-bar,  the coarse and fine sharpeners performed really well considering that its a cheap sharpener.  overall , its really one of those \\"you get what you pay for\\" deals.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Great product. I wore these during my workouts while I was in Afghanistan and they held up great through all the sweat and heat. For $10, you can't beat the quality and durability. They're small so they won't produce concert hall quality sound, but for their size the sound is great. They won't fall out of your ear, either, so they're great for any workouts where you're jumping around a lot
0316154687|4.0|\\"...and being kicked by a donkey with socks on.\\"  Sharper and darker then other Sedaris books I've read, this one still kept my attention and had me laughing uncontrollably many times throughout the book.  I love how he strikes incredibly awkward & painful moments against a quirky random line of thought.  On the bow tie and what it says of the wearer: \\"Not that you're powerless, but that you're impotent... a neutered cat in need of a good stiff cuddle.\\"  The section of tales on the monster of a landlady, Helen was a particular favorite.  The power struggles of the powerless and the games they like to play with other people's lives.  All as an illustration of just how useless and ineffectual she was as a person by her own choice and making.  When Helen yells from her window at someone and loses her dentures in the shrubs below, Sedaris retrieves them and returns them.  As soon as she has them back in place, she cusses up a blue streak.  Sedaris notes: \\"She slid the dentures, unwashed, back into her mouth, and it was like popping the batteries back into a particularly foul toy.\\"  Similar power struggles over airplane seats and the way people react when they don't get what they want when they want.  \\"Seventeen across: a fifteen-letter word for enlightenment.  'I am not an a**h***,' I wrote, and it fit.\\" I think my favorite section closes the book, the periodic journal - stream of conscious, at times like fortune cookie slips - which follows Sedaris's effort to give up cigarettes.  This is the sort of writing, I enjoy the most.  It felt like I was getting to read Sedaris's work, direct and almost unedited, work that hadn't been worked over several times for effect.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|like this keyboard a lot esp the predictions.issue I have thought is that the keys sometimes freeze most often spacebar thus I cannot press desired key. I'm then forced to exit what I was doing example writing a text and reopen it. can get frustrating.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|One of the most important scenes in the final Star Wars movie cycle has been altered beyond all recognition. Where there was silence and profound emotion there is now ridiculous dialogue. I've never been into the whole geekdom of Star Wars, just a normal guy. But when you change beautiful moments in cinema this much, its like changing the final scene dialogue to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Lucas has officially just defaced art. I wonder what young George Lucas would say? Oh yes...    \\"American works of art belong to the American public; they are part of our cultural history. People who alter or destroy works of art and our cultural heritage for profit or as an exercise of power are barbarians, and if the laws of the United States continue to condone this behavior, history will surely classify us as a barbaric society.\\"    George Lucas speaking at Congress 1988.    ....George Lucas is officially a Barbarian.
B000ZBUY78|3.0|I like its look, it's small, kind or light weight, has a calendar, glows in the dark and doesn't need battery, BUT I hate the fact that you have to wear it everyday or it will stop.    I had a couple of automatic watches before and none of them required to be so \\"active\\" -which I loved.    I work in an office environment and obviously most of my activities just involve finger movements, so it is very common that my watch stops every evening. The other bad thing is that often times the time is backwards for a couple of minutes.
B005J0VPNC|2.0|Droid x, would not allow interaction or photo selection from gallery while using app. Cool pics with this app but make it applicable to all photos for five stars.
B001EO748M|2.0|...VERY soft history.    (I'm one of those who cringes watching JRM rather than panting and sighing, which I gather other women might.) A beautiful production with some fine actors involved--too bad the script is absurd.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|This is really probably the best album I've heard. I've only lived 18 years, but nothing has been as amazing to me as this album. I can't even choose a favorite song, it's so good! :) Everyone should hear this, and give it a real chance. She has some real talent.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|Look, it's not really about the money. Money comes and money goes. It doesn't love you. You shouldn't love it back. How could you have any self-respect? That's why I'm always in the gym working out at the bench press. Sometimes I'm in the tanning bed. I special order those tiny big-boy tees.<br /><br />No, it's about family. It's about all my friends. It's about kicking back with some brewskis and making sexist comments when our Penthouse Pet cohorts are looking the other way.<br /><br />It's about recklessly endangering lives of pedestrians and other drivers, and destroying millions of dollars of city property wherever in the world we choose to go. Like I said, it's not about the money, but god forbid you have more money than me, and I happen to get wind of it. I'm sorry, did I kill your puppy while I was on my driving spree? Just having a bit of fun, me and the boys, didn't you see my dastardly yet charming grin after your car blew up?<br /><br />You see, it's all about freedom. So if you don't get out of my way, I'll have to kill you.
B004T5R2HQ|5.0|This app performed much better than I expected. Started with a few coupons and printed them out. They looked perfect and they scanned fine at the store.<br /><br />I guess the camera makes a huge difference in quality. I scanned a doc and used ocr to transcribe the text. Small print (&gt;10) had to be in perfect focus. If your camera macro setting is lacking, you'll notice lower quality.<br /><br />For basic documents, this app is pretty cool. I'm gonna try some other documents such as embossed seals and heavy paper, and some off white paper to see how they turn out.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|The DVD changes were hard to live with but I was going to upgrade to the bluray to get clearer picture at home, but the latest round of changes for the bluray is just too much, (Vader yelling 'nooooo' as he throws the emperor, cgi ewok eyes, etc.) canceled my order.
B001IBIHQ4|1.0|I knew before I sat down to watch this that I wouldn't like it as much as Band of Brothers.  I'm a former paratrooper, not a former Marine.  But I still thought I would at least enjoy it on some level.  After 4 episodes I realized that I really don't care at all for this miniseries.  I didn't care for the plot.  I didn't care for the relationships being built (or not built) between the characters.  I didn't even care for the characters.  I'm sure my love for Band of Brothers set my expectations pretty high for The Pacific but I didn't realize that I'd be so disappointed that I wouldn't bother watching any episodes after the fourth one.  I'm so glad I rented this before buying.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|I love this  DVD. It is one of my favorites. I ordered it for a friend and found out she already has it too.  So if you haven't seen this production it's awesome:)
B0024FADAQ|4.0|This anniversary edition of \\"The Last Starfighter\\" has few extras but is a clean print with great sound. It was as much fun to watch as when it came out in the early 1980's. I was hoping that<br />perhaps the primordial CGI FX had been reworked, but they had not. However, those effects are simple part of the story and are easily accepted, as the story's the thing.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|With much pain, I've cancelled my pre-order of this set.  I've been trying to justify a reason to keep the order.  The Darth Vader \\"no,\\" I reasoned,  \\"it's just a small tweak.  You can get over that, no big deal.\\"  And the other changes, I hardly care about... an Ewok blinks?  Sure, at this point, why not?    But then I thought of all the other irksome changes in this movie that I let slide in the past.  I miss the original Max Rebo band song, the Nyub Nyub song.  The EpIV Greedo shooting first scene sucks.  At this point, all of these \\"little\\" changes are starting to add up.  Why should I spend money on a version I will like less than the last version I bought?    It's amazing how much disdain Lucas seems to have for his biggest fans.  At least when Spielberg altered ET, he put both versions in the set.      And the last straw:  I remember buying the original trilogy on DVD the day they came out.  Lucas said in interviews, he would never release the original versions on DVD.  And then a funny thing happened, the original versions WERE released on DVD.  And I had already forked over the cash for these altered ones.  I'm not going to get burned again.  I'll buy the movies on Blu-Ray when the originals are part of the set.    So I cancelled it, and directed my money towards some other blu-rays worth getting.  And I feel much, much better.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Fans of these movies want the real movies, not George Lucas's 4th alteration of them.  The prequel movies are universally viewed as inferior to the original trilogy, yet with each tinkering George makes the original trilogy more like the prequels - lots of CGI with no heart.  Blu-Ray technology easily allows Lucas the ability to incorporate more than one version of the film, so if he must alter them over and over, he could at least include both versions (or even all four versions at this point).  Lucas doesn't care about the fans.  He doesn't care about quality.  He cares about getting paid billions of dollars more to fund his next Star Wars alteration - the 3D version that's coming, with doubtless more \\"surprises\\".  This is not the product most fans want, so it's being rated poorly.  Hopefully sales for it will bomb and Lucas might finally get the message.
030788743X|4.0|I have never ever played a video game and movies like 'the matrix' totally confuse me BUT i still very much enjoyed this book...what an imaginative tale of the not too distant future where just about everyone on the planet spends their days in a virtual reality world.  this book really makes you think about the future and the ever-evasive internet...this scenario could totally happen!  it's going to be a brave new world out there and big brother will most definitely be watching!
0307272702|5.0|I rarely rate purchases on line.  Maybe regular people should do more of it to water down the effect of shills.    This is just flat out a great book.  You have to admit this truth, America is just plain fat, and trending more so.  There has to be a reason, and it isn't because we don't exercise enough or try dieting.  Sure, not everyone exercises, but there plenty of fat folks trying to exercise their fat off, and it is not working. And we are diet obsessed.    Taube's puts forward a reasonable explanation (a high sugar and starch diet), and offers suggestions for a solution (a whole lot less sugar and starch).    It's been 4 weeks, and I've lost 12 pounds (targeting 25). The best part is that overwhelming cravings and overly intrusive food thoughts have dropped away.  If you havn't seen Robert Lustig's \\"Sugar: the bitter truth video\\" on youtube, that pair's well with Taube's book.  Lustig is a Endocine doctor who treat's obese children at UC San Francisco.    I'm buying 5 and sending them to my prediabetic friends.
0061726826|5.0|I disagree with the other reviews about it not being fast paced. I read this in one day, and it is not a short book! Love the writing style, almost poetic. Great love story. Didnt think it would have a sequel because of the ending but I am happy to hear there will be another one!
0312430000|4.0|This is pretty useful and applicable book for improving performance on day to day basis. I like how the author presents his case for using checklist and presents case studies from different industries (i.e. medicine, aviation & finance) however he doesnt push it down your throat. He makes it clear that checklists wont work if you dont really want to use them. I started using checklists to organize my weekdays which are pretty routine but I was just not getting things done, since I have started using a checklist it is way easier for me to stay on task. I really liked this book and would highly recommend it.

B004FSC52E|5.0|This is one of my favorites of all time.  The colors, music, and story give me a lift on the dark days. The comedy takes getting used to, as it has that foreign flavor... but it's a wonderful trip into something delightfuly different.
0553582038|4.0|This book is a bit harder to get into than the other ones, so far. I've only read the first 300 pages of the book, but it is taking a bit longer to get extra exciting like the first three were. I've no doubt it will pick up and be just as incredibly awesome as the other ones, but for now there is a lot that has to be said that isn't just as much of a page turner as it's previous books.  Still a really good read and i highly recommend it to anyone who likes fantasy but wants to look for something more than just sword fights and magic. The shift in the narrator at each chapter, despite the fact that it makes it hard to follow each story, enables the author to develop the story a lot more. A truly amazing series
0765326353|5.0|This book rocks... The best epic fantasy I have read to date. WoT is good, but this one feels better, more complex and if possible grander in scope.

B004SGWYVA|4.0|High School of the dead is a little bit of a misleading name, as the majority of the series doesn't actually take place in a high school, albeit most of the characters are related to the high school in one fashion or another.<br /><br />This is your basic zombie apocalypse story delivered as anime. It consists of all the things you expect from this kind of story, gore, blood, human interaction, mental breakdowns, and nudity. In all reality, HOTD has a lot less nudity than some anime I have watched in recent months, only consisting of a single episodes with anything of the sort. The fan service instead relies on women with abnormally large and giggly chests more than openly graphic nudity.<br /><br />HOTD provides less flat out humor than you might expect from most \\"funny\\" anime. However, it provides jokes in a much more subtle way that still let's you enjoy yourself. For example, in one scene, a character decides to use a girl's breasts to stabilize his machine gun as he fired it.<br /><br />I really liked some of the characterization in this anime. People aren't quite as idiotically stupid as they appear in other zombie films, and will often say what you might expect them to. I particularly like the smart girl with glasses, as she quickly manages to reason out what is going on instead of rambling around for 3 episodes saying... \\"Oh is that what is going on?\\" like is produced in many Hollywood movies.<br /><br />This is not a horror anime, and I can't say I was scared for a single moment. The main characters seem relatively invincible so far as they work together to blast through one zombie infestation after another. Three of the characters, specifically, seem to be able to beat and hit their way through any amount of zombies without a second thought, giving you very little sense of danger. If you try to see this as some kind of horror flick with building dread and suspense, you will be be disappointed. If you see this as some fun zombie killing good time guilty pleasure like Zombieland or Left 4 Dead, then sit back and enjoy yourself, as this anime can be very enjoyable.<br /><br />One last thing, this is not the full series.

The next series is said to start soon and I eagerly await for it's release as well.<br /><br />To sum it up, this is a good fun watch but there is very little substance here. It's a zombie smashing, boob swinging, good time and not much else. I give it a 4 star because within one season there is very little progression storywise, but is otherwise a fun watch.t 4 Dead, then sit back and enjoy yourself, as this anime can be very enjoyable.

B004TMPJP6|5.0|I have read the descriptions on all the list managers, downloaded and tried Wunderlist and MLO, and selected Wunderlist as my list manager.  It has a few more options and a few more capabilities than MLO.  It certainly has more than I need and now I read their broadcast that they have a major new upgrade ready for release.  I have already recommended it to my daughter who keeps lists for everything.
0439023483|3.0|The book get's you hooked from the first page and the storytelling is at times excellent. I finished this book in half a day, but was left with the feeling that I just read some high school short story. The unfolding of events turned childish and the characters just seemed to have no real depth.    Mostly an entertaining read, but perhaps I have been too spoiled by character portrayals from authors such as Robert Jordan and George Martin.
B004G600A4|5.0|I was a bit ify when it first came out but I knew that in order to make a fair judgment I would have to see the movie. Now I own it and have watched it several times. I love this movie and will definitely be showing it to my kids once I have some. Awesome family movie!

B005COO1X6|4.0|Mile 81 was pretty much a typical King short story, though this one was perhaps a little too short and could have benefited from some additional time to percolate. While the story had some of King's trademark humor, horror and intensity, I felt like the story was perhaps a bit too rushed and didn't really allow the story to develop as fully as I would have liked. Which is to say, I liked the story we got and would have enjoyed a bit longer experience than the hour or so it took to read it. In the end, I think that's what kept this from being a \\"great\\" book for me and undercutting some of the potential of the tale. Still, any constant reader of King's should definitely give this story a quick spin.
0393338827|4.0|What would a massive financial crash be without Michael Lewis?  Having long ago cut open the sordid sardine can of Wall St. in his initial masterwork \\"Liar's Poker\\", he's demonstrated over and again, in works like \\"Moneyball\\" and \\"The Blind Side,\\" that his technique of transforming numbers into a compelling literary tool was no anomaly.  Here again, in \\"The Big Short,\\"  he ascends to the top of the crowded pile of recaps and rehashes of the 2008 debacle by offering up a compelling swirl of personalities, situations, and mathematical facts that reads more like a suspense novel than work of financial history, but for the knowledge we all have going in about where this story ends.     Unlike most of the rest of this quickly developing genre of \\"crisis lit\\", Lewis eschews a linear analysis of the mortgage crisis and its continuing aftershocks, choosing instead to take the reader on a visit inside the minds of three players who knew better, and emerged fabulously wealthy thanks to their perspicacity and guts.  Steve Eisman, Mike Burry, and the upstart team at Cornwall Capital, Jamie Mai and Charlie Ledley, all came into the mortgage market through different openings in the early 2000s.  Eisman was an old Wall St. hand and hedge fund manager, Burry an Asperger's suffer and cancer survivor who jettisoned his medical career in favor of the trader's life, and the Cornwall Capital boys were just a couple of guys with a Schwab account and an idea.  But each of these forces of financial nature saw, years before any of the statistical sophisticates on Wall St., that the subprime mortgage market was out of control, a fuse to a time bomb lit by the complex derivative contract known as a CDO.     Once armed with this insight these guys' jobs became startlingly simple: buy as many CDO's as institutions would sell them.  And institutions sold them like hotcakes, oblivious to the fact that they were insuring billions upon billions of loans with only the slimmest chance of repayment.The machine just wouldn't stop, since securitizing mortgages resulted in outlandish underwriting fees, and took risky loans off the books of the banks.  The idea was that the risk would be diversified into non-existence.  The reality was that unmeasured, untenable risk flowed into the veins of the financial system like poison.     That it would take minds that worked differently than anyone else to discern these facts isn't surprising.  What's surprising is that these three were apparently the only forces working to exploit what now seems obvious to everyone.  Lewis turns the spotlight on the herd mentality with ferocious effect here, planting seeds of distrust in almost any institutional actor in any sphere of society.  The little guy put his faith in the brilliance of the professionals' minds.  But the professionals didn't know what they were doing, or worse, just did it until they couldn't milk the dead cow anymore.     Lewis is helped greatly in the telling of this story by his background in bond finance during the 80's.  His mastery of his subject suffuses the book, but also makes one wonder where he was while the crisis was brewing.  But where was anyone besides Eisman, Burry, and Cornwall Capital?  By focusing on these three forces and revealing something about their reasoning and the workings of their minds, Lewis has given a valuable gift to those who might hestitate to question the logic of giants.
0756951410|3.0|For the most part I enjoyed this book. It pissed me off and lost its way in some parts, but I still liked it.
0553801473|2.0|5 years was way too long to wait for A Dance With Dragons.  I'll give GRRM the benefit of the doubt that he knows what he's doing with the series that started out so promising; but only for one more book.  If the next is no better than Feast or Dance, I'll not read another.  Well, at least not in hardcover....  Compared to the first three in the series, this, well, sucks.  The only reason it's better than A Feast for Crows is that we don't have 30 new characters 3500 pages into the story.  But one can't help but wonder if Martin is as lost as Jordan became?  If so, he's taken what was the best series outside LOTR and turned it to so=so, hum drum mismash.  What a shame that would be.<br /><br />GRRM, if you are reading this, please, please, please, get the story moving again.  Your fans have suffered through the last two, please don't make them regret their investment in Song.
0061765236|2.0|I like this author but then I don't. Is she being controversial just to say she was? I want to love the books I  have read of hers but they piss me off too much. Besides this, I have read My Sister's Keeper and The Plain Truth. I enjoyed parts of all 3, but for the most part I was just mad.
B005D9MUWY|1.0|Got this app while it was free. It actually was, unbelievably, harder to use than the regular android keyboard. Part of the problem was the phone's screen was not that accurate. I used the app for about 2 weeks and got tired of it making so many mistakes. Uninstalled thereafter. If you want to try the app, I recommend waiting till it's cheaper (or better yet free) and see how you do with it on your particular phone.
B004L3AR0K|4.0|I don't know what I was expecting, maybe Sweet November or something, but this was a fair share better than your typical sob-love romance. Yeah, it had some of the elements of it, I mean, the gal is chronically ill, so there will be no true fairytale ending. However, this movie has a good shot of humor, and I found myself laughing out loud on multiple occassions. Definitely worth the watch, and I will share it with others.
1594481717|5.0|This was one of the most incredible books I have read in a long time--It is relevant to everyone, especially those of us who are in the teaching field. Our book club discussed the concepts in great length-both right and left brainers and we discovered that most of us were were pretty balanced, more so than we had thought before reading the book. Several schools in our area are using the book as required reading for students, teachers and hopefully parents.
B0055FR5PS|1.0|Another pathetic shaky-cam movie. There is not a single frame of the entire movie where the camera is not deliberately shaking, or being rapidly zoomed in and out, or abruptly panned here and there. This ridiculous filming technique makes the entire film unwatchable. The only way this movie could be actually watched would be to rip it to disk, process it through an anti-shake video filter, and then view the result. I pray for the day when TV monitors will have image stabilization software built into them so that shaky-cam movies can actually be watched.
B003UESJH4|5.0|This is a must-see for anyone with a speech impediment.  It effectively illustrates both the embarrassment and disability that is inherent in stuttering.  And it also shows the importance of skill and empathy on the part of persons who attempt to help those with such impediments.
B004G600A4|4.0|My kids saw this in the theatre and liked it, so we let them do chores to earn their own copy.  Good movie - nice, solid Disney plot line with some creative twists to it.  Good art.  Good music.  The best part is probably the vigilante horse...
0307473708|5.0|I did not know of Dexter (the book) until I started watching the show on HBO.  I liked the show on HBO (most of the series the do, like the other cable channels are really some of the best television out there.)    When I found out it was a book I decided to read this to start, though I made sure to let time pass, since it is often unfair to compare tvs or movies to books straight away...so I let some time pass so the details would not be as clear and felt I could look at it in its own right since there is a conflict often between them.    I really enjoyed this book and will read more.  It is not the same as the show, but is good anyway.  The writing is well done for a murder (kind of) suspense book and the charactors are developed.    Just like the show, you find yourself rooting for a \\"bad\\" guy who does things no one condones, yet is alot of fun ultimately.    Relax and enjoy it for what it is, a special twist in the mystery arena.
0446585327|5.0|Yes, this is a good book, and I am recommending it all around to colleagues, to bosses, to students. It is a good book because it shows how things can be done differently, and because it speaks to a younger generation with a different attitude to, and different expectations from, work.  As a sociologist of work, I was happy to see that Zappos exists, and that people not only made it work, but are having fun doing so.  The portions of the book dealing with Tony's early entrepreneurial efforts were less important to me, but the values, and the relentless (and deservedly so !) pounding about culture-culture-culture are well described.  Now ... I wish I could get some people to read this, who are of the \\"old guard\\" and harken back to times of Taylorist notions of geniuses at the top, and peons in the trenches.  There are too many of those people around - and it will take this younger generation of Tonys to replace that old corporate model, and the guys on the top.
B000000ORE|5.0|WOW, WHAT TO SAY? THIS ALBUM WAS AND STILL IS ONE OF THE DEFINING POINTS OF THIS PERIOD OF ROCK. TESLA ROCKED THE ARENA'S OF THE WORLD AND THIS ALBUM WAS THEIR BREAK OUT.

1936719118|5.0|Derek Sivers gets it.  Figure out why you are doing something, strive to have a deeper understanding at what makes you happy, and just as important, what doesn't make you happy.  Derek founded (and later sold) CD Baby, an online distributor for independent musicians looking for a place to sell their CD's.  Derek's core mission statement is based on his customers point of view of the \\"utopian music distributor\\".  How else would you come up with a mission statement? By focusing on the customer the mission couldn't fail.  Brilliant.<br /><br />The book goes through Derek's story teaching you lesson's on the way through his unconventional approach to business.  It's refreshing to read such an inspiring story of counter-intuitive decision making but never veering away from the mission of the company, customers first.<br /><br />Here are a few of the amazing quotes throughout Anything You Want.<br /><br />\\"Success comes from persistently improving and inventing, not from persistently doing what's not working.\\"<br /><br />\\"We all have lots of ideas, creations, and projects. When you present one to the world, and it's not a hit, don't keep pushing it as-is.  Instead, get back to improving and inventing.\\"<br /><br />\\"If you're not saying \\"HELL YEAH!\\" about something, say \\"no\\".\\"<br /><br />\\"Any time you think you know what your new business will be doing, remember this quote from Steve Blank: No plan survives first contact with customers.\\"<br /><br />\\"Do you passionately love the \\"Terms & Conditions\\" and \\"Privacy Policy\\" pages on other websites?  Have you even read them?  If not, then why would you go putting that garbage on your website?\\"<br /><br />\\"That's the Tao of business: Care about your customers more than about yourself, and you'll do well.\\"<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend you buying this book if you are at all interested in business strategy, entrepreneurship or radical business success stories.  You will learn much from this book.

This book is amazing and gives such interesting details, facts, history, and everything else you can think about for all of you fellow animators out there... very inspirational. I am an animator myself, but I bought this book to help me along the way of my beginning stages and I believe this book will help me a lot for what I plan on doing...If you are curious on how this book is helping me you can see my animations on my new youtube channel HumorWiseSurprise ... I will be posting toons very shortly after reading the rest of the book!
0670022411|4.0|An excellent cross between The Da Vinci Code and the Twilight series, this book really keeps you on your toes the entire time.
B0034G4ORM|5.0|Great movie. It doesn't try to be something it's not; it's simply a great action movie. it doesn't try to take the moral high ground to deliver some message. It doesn't descend into some kiddie show where a bunch of U8's save the world. It's just a great \\"popcorn\\" movie. Having said that my one criticism of the movie is the cliché of the heroes being marines. It's always either marines, green berets, etc. Never a bunch of average enlisted personnel from any branch of the armed services.    The blu-ray is great. The picture is second to none. The sound overall is good, although i did find at times the talking was a little quiet but that may be due to my sound setup and not the disc itself.    I try not to over analyse movies. I try and judge each movie on its own merits. I tend to watch movies for the escapism and this review should be considered in this light.          I hope you find this review helpful.

B00192IV9U|5.0|I really love this album of Michael's, even thought it came out recently early last year, still his beautiful voice is what captures this album. And also it has really good songs to it. Before i purchased this product, i didn't realize that there was going to be another album since i already have his Invincible album which i love also. Every song has a meaning to it also as well.

B001TW68P4|4.0|I was impressed with the sound quality of the cd. Sometimes when I purchase a cd, I find that there are more great songs than I counted on, and this is one of those times.    Anyone who treasures music of this time frame will appreciate this soundtrack. If you want to have all their great songs on one CD, then this is the one to buy.
0316044938|4.0|One would not conceive a success for a novel about pedophiliac murdering man who manages to escape conviction when the family and friends fo the murdered 10-year old seemingly diminish as people against the bold backdrop of the author's harsh world. But this does.<br /><br />Written in the peculiarly child-innocent voice of a the murdered child, accounts of the growth and aging fo the parents, sibling and friends as witnessed by the naive and innocent eyes make this book enchanting - almost cute in the world of culturally conceived cruelty. This child, whose ill-conceived fate is a clearest violation of many of the Judeo-Christian ethics, seems to change the tones from harsh colors to hues of pastels.<br /><br />Like the great Irish account of childhood in the rough - [[ASIN:068484267X Angela's Ashes: A Memoir]] - this book allows the adults to learn from the child.  The different perspective intertwined with the acute senses of the child make the reflections of what happened and what will happen seemingly adorable.<br /><br />In the end, a phenomenon is unveiled and we read how the author got the title, \\"These were the lovely bones that had grown around my absence: the connections -- sometimes tenuous, sometimes made at great cost, but often magnificent -- that happened after I was gone. And I began to see things in a way that let me hold the world without me in it. The events my death brought were merely the bones of a body that would become whole at some unpredictable time in the future. The price of what I came to see as this miraculous lifeless body had been my life.\\"<br /><br />From other sources, the author has revealed this fictional murder is her writing about a personal rape encountered at a young, but no as young, age.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Take your Jarjars, Clone Wars, and Lightwave 1990 rendering attempts, and don't bother us again, Lucas. I'm so sick of this crap. My kids are old enough now to watch Star Wars, and one just can't begin with the new trilogy. It's something they have to decide for themselves when they are older, like watching the matrix 2+3.  But now Lucas has reached the point, where I cannot even introduce my kids to the old classic trilogy. It would be just wrong.  I won't buy this, I just can't, and with age comes a more relaxed standpoint. I just have to accept that Star Wars is dead, and I think, I can cope with it.
1934030198|5.0|This is a very good book for anyone wanting to start training for triathlons. I was a beginner when I bought this book and it helped me learn some basics to succeed. It also has enough information so when you grow in the sport you can get something out of it as well. If you are unsure of a good book on the triathlon subject, go ahead and buy this one. It's a great tool.
B003R0MF1W|5.0|My wife is watching an episode while I'm writing this review.  We have really had fun with the humor and the intrigue of this series.  I'd love to get the 3rd season, but it runs about $40 so I'll wait to get that one when it goes down in price.  The episodes are fun enough that we enjoy watching thme more than once.
B003Y5H53S|5.0|I saw Rango at the theater when it was released, and I, and my family...all adults...were quite glad to see that this was an animated film with ADULT humor.  So much out there is mindless fluff and predictable children's storylines.  We tend to be fans of the old west, and love to watch western films of all types, both old classic and modern.  Like other reviewers have said, many of this film's quirks and giggles come right out of those old films, so I can see where the humor might be lost on those not familiar with the genre.  Rango has a more subtle humor...not a pie in-your-face-haw-haw-haw type.  And for that I am glad. We thought the visuals were stunning, the characters enjoyable and engaging, and the movie, as a whole, a delight.  No...the children might be bored, but then, remember Bugs Bunny and Bullwinkle...alot of their humor was aimed at a much older audience as well.  Not everything has to be Disney twinkle and glitter.
0978606310|5.0|My girlfriend finally decided to sell her extensive My Little Pony G1 collection. She had 170 MLPs with all sorts of additional parts, clothes, accessories and structures. I bought this book to help her identify her MLPs and it was perfect for that purpose.

With this book, I probably saved her days, if not weeks, of time doing that research. This book was an invaluable resource for her. I recommend it without reservation.
B003UESJ9M|5.0|I rented this movie when it first came out and loved it. I was so happy to find it on   Amazon for way cheap then anywhere else. They shipped it out right away  and it got to me just in the nick of time. Great purchase.
B002436WFI|3.0|The movie arrived in a timely manner and in excellant shape. The movie itself isn't as good as I'd hoped though. I enjoy longer movies but this one is just too slow and plodding so I never have watched the whole thing. I'll give it to my great nephew and niece incase they'll like it.
1596680199|5.0|Although Ms. Carol Blackburn's focus for the book is on making beads, this book can be used as a polymer clay technique encyclopedia.  I've used polymer clay to make ornaments, doll heads, and simple beads.  Although my building skills are good, I knew there was more I could do with the medium.  I found this book and kept it on my wish list on and off, because I didn't know if it would help me.  Finally, I ordered it about a month ago and haven't regretted it.  There is a plethora of information that can be applied to any project to take it from nice to stunning.  The detailed instructions and multiple photographs will guide you through each and every step.  Since the tools she uses are not always readily available, she also gives alternatives for many of them.  Rather you are considering further explorations with polymer clay medium or are looking for a book with advanced faux effects, folds and sculpts, this is the book to get.
159514188X|2.0|I get what this book was supposed to represent. I understand what it was trying to say.  But, like the book \\"Before I Fall\\", which is also receiving a lot of un-warranted buzz, this weapon was shooting blanks.<br /><br />Here's Why:<br />- The main character was a whiny brat. She couldn't stand up for herself... ever.  She made excuses for everything she did.  wah, wah, wah.  If you want to score with a book like this, especially if you're target audience is \\"12 years and older\\", then you need to give them someone worth looking up to.  Someone to emulate.  This Hannah was NOT it. Teenage girls are NOT helpless.  Every one of us has been put in the same positions as Hannah was as far as boys go.  The first time it happened to me, I didn't say anything... because that's how I read in books that that's the way teenaged girls are \\"supposed\\" to act.  The next time it happened...and the time after that, the guys got a violent shove and a visit from my boyfriend's fist.  I understand not reporting to police, but I don't understand allowing something like that to happen over and over without doing anything about it.  When your target audience is so young and girls are reading this story when their ideas about relationships and boys are still forming, why not give them a stronger character to want \\"to be like\\"?  I hated Hannah.<br /><br />- If I had received those tapes, I would have thrown them away (if I was anyone who didn't \\"do\\" anything), like some of the girls on the tapes.  Reputations will follow you where ever.  And if someone wants to believe your reputation over getting to know you, then that person is not a friend you'd want in your life anyway.  Get over it.  EVERYONE has a reputation that follows them around.  Not only that, but suicide is the biggest cop-out in life.  It is the lowest thing you could possibly do.  I am so tired of media making suicide out to be something that's so dramatic and worthy of sorrow.  Everyone has thought about it.  Most kids have practiced it.  The ones who realize that high school DOES end (you know, the intellegent ones) work through high school, like everything else in life, and focus on the bigger picture.  High school sucks for EVERYONE.  Why did Hannah think she was so special?  And why would kids who had nothing important to lose (aside from Bryce & Clay) complete her last requests?  If suicide is the person giving up, they relinquished their right to have their voices heard when they swallowed that handful of pills.<br /><br />- The prose was really distracting for the first three chapters.  Yes, it took me half of the book to get used to reading Hannah's italics versus Clay's present day thoughts and conversations.  The book was written like a screenplay.  But, those types of things don't go over well in book format.  If you wanted to write a movie, you should have done just that.<br /><br />- There was no one to love in the story.  No character that made you say \\"I want him/her to get through this\\" or \\"I want a happy ending for him/her.\\"  There was no one worthy of your heart racing.  And not once did I shed a tear through this whole story.<br /><br />Look, suicide is a serious topic.  It is something that has always existed, but is getting ever-increasingly committed by younger and younger kids every day all over the world.  If you're going to have your target audience so low in age, maybe you should be focusing on giving them reasons to understand that suicide is the stupidest, unworthy of respect, disgusting thing that you can do.  And if you're going to commit suicide, you no longer have the right to carry out last requests.  Your voice dies with you.<br /><br />For a good book like this one, check out \\"If I Stay\\" instead.

B0059R5Q08|1.0|The movie is not horrible I give it that, but I would say it leaves out too much of the story and takes too many dialogues out of context.  Yes, I am I die hard fan of Jane Eyre, read the book many times and have watched many of the versions that are available in movie and on television.  The actors are okay and most do justice to the characters, but none would I call my favorites or flesh out any of the characters well.  The chemistry to me is lacking, the story is rushed and some key elements in the story have been left out (the change in ending, the gypsy seen omitted, the development of the relationship that is reflected in the many dialogues between Jane and Mr. Rochester that have been left out, etc.).  It may just be me and the way I first envisioned the book when I first read it but this movie is just lacking in all these things and more.  The novel is a bit dark at times, but not like this and to me this version is overly dramatic at times.  Yes, I am one who likes the BBC version, the Masterpiece Theatre Version and I can also enjoyed versions such as the 2003 (William Hurt & Charlotte Gainsbourg) version  and 2007 (Orson Welles and Joan Fontaine) version.  I not against some deviations from the novel, but to me the importance is with the chemistry between the characters, the main bulk of the story falling in line with the book and in reading the development of the characters as individuals.  Many people may love this version, but in my opinion this is a version is one that I can honestly say I definitely wouldn't have missed anything if I never had saw.  But, I have said it is a matter of taste...apparently not mine but may be to someone else.

1400052181|5.0|What a terrific book.  I am usually not interested in anything related to science but was without a book to read on vacation & my husband had just finished his copy.  I am so glad I started reading ... the story is full of suspense and the writing is beautiful.  Such irony that this woman's family couldn't afford health insurance while their ancestor had given so much to the world of medicine.
B004AYCWY4|5.0|Written with classic lucidity, this rare volume of insight and scientific knowledge is a must read for those who will allow themselves to understand the true origins of this planet and others without falling back on mythologies of antiquities.  Dawkins, a scholar of immense reputation and learning, details carefully how evolution transpired and transformed the planet with live on without the need for any god or goddess.  His excellent work refutes the panderings of Stephen C. Myer and his apologia for Intelligent Design with resounding eclat, noting how it is intelligence that leads to perfect, not mere brute strength as is the skeleton on which the myths of Adam, Eve, and their three named children are based: replicas of cave people who murdered and etched out a living without consciousness.  Truly, Dawkins has given the world that reads cause for pause and reflection, and from there to build on this foundation of sense a better thesis for years to come.  I heartily recommend it to everyone who is able to think for himself or herself.
0345529057|4.0|This is a wonderful series!  My only wish is that I hadn't read it yet.  The 4th book was done in 2005, so I thought I could pick this up, then order the next books.  In fact, that is the promise the author made at the end of the 4th book.  He said he wrote enough for that book to be twice as large, but it would be too much for one book, so it needed split into a fifth book...       Well, despite saying that in 2005, the next book just came out a couple of months ago in the middle of 2011, and from what I hear doesn't wrap things up... which is fine- author's choice and all that, but it's something I'd want to be aware of up front before starting an epic series and being left dangling (I really feel for the people who got stuck back in 2005).  So, read it, get hooked, and then get stuck waiting, or get it, and hold onto it to devour back to back when the series has been concluded.  Either way, these are great books.  Just be warned these 4 books does not comprise a complete series, and you will be wanting to know how the game of thrones plays out!     Each chapter shows you the point of view of one of the many characters- none perfect- some downright rotten struggling to do what they think is the right thing, or the wrong thing for the \\"right\\" motives.  I've read books where you're practically rooting for the bad guy before, but this series takes the cake!  The characters are deep, and it's sad when one gets killed off, but the others keep moving along unpredictable paths and it keeps you engaged.  This is not formulaic fantasy (which I enjoy as well), but a multi-point-of-view epic saga.  Yes, there is some magic, but it's not the main focus, and so far (after 4 books) not a McGuffin to drive everything.  There is a bond between direwolves and some of the main characters, but it flows as part of the universe not many characters encounter, and thus not as a driving factor for everything.  The plot revolves around the game of thrones- and how court intrigue, treachery, honor, and courage play out with and against one another.    This story (they're all one continuing story with multiple book covers) is one of the best I've ever read, and I'm looking forward to reading them again and finishing the series once it is completed.

3899552512|4.0|this is adapted from a longer review at my blog liberal sprinkles      Paper comes to life in so many ways in this book. Art installations, portraits, animation characters, 3D posters, cutouts of figures, people, animals and objects big and small, Papercraft: Design and Art with Paper is full of fun examples of what can be crafted with paper.    There are numerous works I recognize, including some from Jen Stark and Ferris Staverman, whom I've blogged about. There are also pieces from other artists whose works I've seen on the Internet or pinned at Pinterest, so in some ways, this book was very familiar to me.    But there's a huge lot of other works that I was introduced to. A wide variety of works in multiple  structures and formats are presented. Some are functional, others purely decorative; some are playful, others thought-provoking. Nothing is boring or common. The works exude creativity - there's lots to grab your attention and give you ideas of how much can be created from a flat material.    My only complaint is there's very minimal information - if any at all - on the works and the artists. But there's still plenty of eye candy to enjoy.    4.5 stars

B003ZSJ212|1.0|I grew up watching the original films in theaters, and remember the years in between, just waiting for the next episode.  The original trilogy quickly claimed the number one place on my list of all time favorite movies.  But they were more than that.  Some of my favorite memories of childhood involve Star Wars.  As the years have passed, and Lucas continues to tamper with them, the love I had for these films has faded.  The main reason for that would be that Lucas has so drastically changed the originals.  Each time these films are re-released, we find that he has again \\"improved\\" the films.  These improvements have been decried by long-time fans, and yet he continues to change the films.<br /><br />I had held off pre-ordering this box set, and was just about ready to give in and order them, when I got an email about the latest confirmed changes to the original trilogy.  I went online and found the sight where I could preview these changes.  Replacing the puppet Yoda in Ep. 1 I think was actually a good thing.  The puppet used in that film just didn't equal the original Yoda.  The next clip I watched was where Vader now screams NOOOOOOOOO as he throws the Emperor over the railing.  I felt sick when I saw this.  First of all, the voice doesn't seem to be Vader's at all, and secondly, this really robs the scene of the emotional impact it had in the original.  When I first saw this in theaters, I remember wondering if Vader would choose the Emperor or his son.  I didn't need a lame scream from Vader to understand the emotional conflict he was feeling.<br /><br />OK, now I would watch the clip that would just wipe any hopes of this release redeeming itself.  It's the iconic scene from Ep. 4 where we encounter Ben Kenobi for the first time.  Luke has been attacked by the Tusken Raiders, and they are looting his land speeder.  In the original, we hear an eery sound echoing in the valley, and then we see a shadowy figure coming towards the speeder.  We soon realize that this is Obi-Wan, and we realize that because of his powers, he was able to emulate this sound which frightened the Raiders.  The new scene shows Obi-Wan approaching just as in the original, except for one major difference.  Where once we were given a sound that would truly frighten someone away, there is now a sound that would cause someone to bend over in uncontrollable laughter.  Why would Lucas think this is an improvement?????  This one sound totally destroys the whole scene.<br /><br />The final changes I've seen really don't seem to detract from the original.  The fact that we now are treated to blinking Ewoks actually does make the scene seem a little more natural.  However, I have to wonder why all this effort was put into making Ewoks blink when there are still some major problems that have not been addressed.<br /><br />Lucas seems to have a major problem with letting these movies go.  I find it hard to understand why he seems intent on totally destroying these iconic films.  It really upsets me to watch what was such an integral part of my childhood slowly evolves into something that is barely even watchable anymore.  I feel that Lucas has no respect for his fans, and he continuously shows this by changing them even though he hears our cries from the sidelines screaming, \\"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!\\"  Unfortunately, our cries have gone unheard.  After watching these latest changes, I have finally decided that I have no desire whatsoever of watching these bastardizations of what was once a landmark trilogy.  And I certainly have no intentions of adding any money to Lucas' greedy pockets for this travesty.<br /><br />The Force has gone out in the galaxy.......sad sad sadand we realize that because of his powers, he was able to emulate this sound which frightened the Raiders.

0312933541|5.0|I have not read too many Jeffrey Archer books, and ones that I did, I find them mediocre at best. A Matter of Honor changed that! The book is a thrilling page-turner with unexpected turns in the plot all along. Very gripping narration and story-telling. The protagonist, in an attempt to get answers to questions left by his father, undertakes a journey that is spellbinding. If you like thrillers and suspense novels, this is a very highly recommended book!!
0767903862|5.0|The first time a read this book I enjoyed it. The second time I read it,  a couple of years later after learning a great deal more about Australia from other sources, I loved it. Bill Bryson does not take you to the typical tourist stops. Rather he takes you to many places best avoided, but he explains why in the process. His focus is on odd happenings in history, and quirky people he meets along the way. He is always researching museums and reading local papers to ferret out more little know factoids about the place. He does not spend a lick of time at the Great Barrier Reef except to tell us about the couple that was left there to try to snorkel thirty miles back to shore.  They were most likely eaten by sharks as they tried to reach a buoy resting on the other side of a deep channel where the big boys roam. Instead, he takes us to the distant shores of Western Australia, a place so vast that it has never been completely explored, to stare at blobs of matter called stromatolites credited with being the first bits of life in our universe. No matter where we are he always throws in a bit of sly, self-deprecating humor.  Fun read chock full of information and insights into the people and the place down under.

B005FUTBWS|4.0|I'm actually surprised that this is the first Kevin Smith I'm reviewing. I've really liked his films over the years, even MALLRATS, which Smith himself seems to dislike at times. Personally, I'd like to think that Kevin Smith is the John Hughes of my generation, but I grew up with Hughes the same as Smith did, so I'll just say that they're in the same league of filmmaking. However, I don't think John Hughes would have made a film quite like Red State and he would've stayed more in the comedy genre. With Red State, Kevin Smith broke away from the comedy genre and went into something completely different. Part psychological thriller, part social commentary, part horror film, part action flick; Red State is something uniquely it's own.    Red State is essentially about Abin Cooper (Michael Parks) and his Five-Point Trinity Church. Red State delivers a horrifying look at Christian fundamentalists and how absorbed into their own twisted views on Christianity they become. Basically, Kevin Smith portrays Abin Cooper as a cross between Fred Phelps and David Koresh.    The movie opens with three teenage boys being led to meet a 38 year old woman at her trailer in the middle of nowhere for casual sex. Not knowing it's a trap, they all are kidnapped and soon become the victims of the Five-Point Trinity Church and their plot to rid the world of sin and sinners.    Having been on the radar from the ATF for harboring illegal firearms, Abin Cooper is currently under surveillance so the ATF send in Agent Joseph Keenan (John Goodman)to head up the invasion on the Cooper compound. What happens next is essentially a stand-off between local law enforcement, headed up by sheriff Wynan (Stephen Root), and the ATF agents.    Basically that's the plot without spoilers and the best I can do to sum up the essentials in simplistic form. I'd rather not go further into details and spoil anything, so we'll leave it at that short synopsis. What I really enjoyed about the movie was how it shiftedgenres or combined several at once. Kevin Smith superbly weaved together a great narrative and character piece by combining different elements of filmmaking and the end result was Red State.    The acting in this film is truly top-notch and brilliant. Michael Parks totally embodies the Abin Cooper character and shines as the brilliant religious zealot. The sermon he delivers in the first act is truly creepy and so well acted that I was lost in every word he spoke. John Goodman, although looking kind of old and haggard, plays the conflicted ATF agent very well. If it weren't for Michael Parks stealing the show, I'd have a lot more to say about Goodman. He was excellently cast and really did a great job. However, every character was cast perfectly and acted their respective roles brilliantly.    The script was excellent. Smith has a knack for realistic and witty dialogue with a lot of banter between characters, but here he seems to transform that ability into monologues (the sermon Michael Parks delivers) and short interactions between characters. It's almost as if he streamlined what he normally does (long dialogue scenes between characters) and made the pacing faster and smoother. It works great here, but I doubt it would work as good in his previous films. I think that's what I admire most about Kevin Smith as a writer. He adapts to the film he's working on and writes what's best for the story. Here is no different.    The directing Kevin Smith did here is probably his best job yet. The camera work was so unlike any of his previous films, but yet it felt like a Kevin Smith film. The pacing was perfect and the film didn't stall out once. From the opening scene until the end credits, Smith has the viewer hooked and leaves them reeling at the end and wanting more. This is his best piece of filmmaking yet.    My gripes with the movie are really small. I felt the running time was a little on the short side and wanted to really get some back story and set-up with a few of the characters. I mean John Goodman comes into the film about thirty minutes in, and although he does a great job in this role, I felt cheated with his amount of screen time. The same can be said for Stephen Root and Kevin Pollack who are two amazing actors that I loved seeing, but they were hardly in the movie. This isn't saying this is bad, but I just wanted more. More characters, more story, and more time with the film. Clocking in at around 95 minutes, I felt this movie deserved more running time. I would really love to see a director's cut of the film and see another thirty minutes or so cut back into it. Overall, this gripe should say something for Kevin Smith and Red State. I wanted more and if that's my biggest gripe, that's saying something.    All in all I thought Red State was a great film. It made me run the gauntlet of emotions and I felt that I was truly watching something great. Mainly because I was doing just that. Red State is above average on all levels, and I think ultimately had it been longer and some of the plot points and characters developed more, it would be a near perfect film. My hat is off to Kevin Smith as he promoted this movie all on his own. He got it distributed himself and took it on tour like filmmakers used to do decades ago. That took serious balls to attempt, especially for this type of film. I won't go into too much detail here, so if you want to know how Red State came to be and how hard a time it had getting shown, look it up. It's just as interesting a story as the film is itself.    Overall, I recommend this movie highly, but warn that it should be watched with an open mind and not be taken seriously. Although, it should be taken serious enough when dealing with religious zealots like the Westboro Baptist Church and Fred Phelps. I'm glad Kevin Smith made this movie and I'm glad that the film sneers at people like Fred Phelps. Someone should show how nutty these people can be and how violent it can all end (ie- David Koresh). Red State has the balls to show them for who they are, even though it's fictionalized for entertainment sake.    Stephen J. Semones  Review originally hosted on The Back Lot  [...]

B000XUBFE2|5.0|What a wonderful book. Three weeks after finishing it, I find it has taken up roots in my subconscious. It's dark to be sure, dark enough that it is not a book I would normally pick to read. And it's sad but not maudlin. It's sad the way Dickens is sad because the world can be a dark and cruel place. But those aspects of the book are just on the surface. There is hope and human kindness tucked in among the stories being told. There is so much more going on in this book than what you might expect from the book jacket, and it took me quite by surprise. These are characters to love and remember. Clearly, this is the best book I have read this year and one of the few I will reread.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|OK, maybe \\"thriller\\" is too strong a  word but it becomes quite gripping! Anyone who liked films like the excellent \\"Memento\\" or on a lighter note \\"50 first dates\\" will enjoy this book. Not to summarise the plot as it's been done, the whole process of muddy memories getting clearer, with false starts and wrong assumptions along the way,is quite fascinatingly rendered here, and the slow, painful self-investigation and putting together of bits and pieces of the main character's former life. So, why not 5 stars? I read this is the author's first novel and the result of a course on how to write fiction. Well, it shows in the writing, which is still a little stiff/exercice-like sometimes. But a very good first book still!

030746363X|2.0|I bouight this book after a friend of mine who had good success using his technique.  I have been having trouble loosing about 10 lbs and thought I would give it a try.  The thing that I questioned from the start is that this whole diet is based on one person's experience.  There is no science backing him up.  He does provide some data to support his views, but most of the things he talks about have no science or studies to back up his claims.  I am a vegetarian and an endurance athlete, so training and following a plan are not new to me.  I decided to give his diet a try for one month.  I lasted 9 days.  I never felt good using this plan.  I was tired and irritable.  Eating was a chore.  I decided to stop after 9 days because I had lost only a pound and I couldn't see suffering for another 3 weeks to see if this was going to work.  I think there is something fundamentally wrong with a diet that tells you not to eat fruit everyday, not to mention other good carbs that you can not eat on this diet.  I'm sure there are people that have success with this program, however if a program seems to good to believe, it probably is just that--fantasy.  I highly advise against the purchase of this book.
B004A8ZX28|1.0|It takes a really bad movie to make Liam Neeson boring, and this is such a movie. The plot is a collection of blatant ripoffs from other movies that were mindlessly cobbled together. In this category of movie, the \\"MacGuffins\\" (or plot coupons) don't need to make a lot of sense because the action and pacing is _supposed_ to pull the viewers along, and not let them recognize that it is a MacGuffin, much less linger on it. This movie fails in both regards. First, the MacGuffins are so in-your-face preposterous that I couldn't not think about them. Second, the slow pacing of the movie didn't give me the opportunity to ignore how preposterous they were. Third, the action sequences are boring because they are mundane technically and I had no investment in any of the characters or in the story.<br /><br />Liam Neeson's performance most of the time feels like a reading during a walk-thru (possibly one to determine why a scene isn't working). A photo of January Jones (the wife, third-billed) seems to have more on-screen time than the actress herself, and even when she is on-screen, the script and director seem to use her as little more than a mannequin. Diane Kruger (second-billed) gives a much more animated performance, but the script has her character as such an incoherent combination of parts that it comes across as \\"sound and fury, signifying nothing\\".<br /><br />The preposterousness of the plot is hard to even partially explain without spoilers, but here's what I can say: The impetus for the whole story is Neeson's character leaving his briefcase at the airport, something that that character would _never_ have done. When he comes out of a coma four days after an accident, he finds that no one came to the hospital looking for him. Whether he is the real Dr. Martin Harris, an impostor, or something else, I could not conceive of any circumstance where he would not have been missed and someone would have tried to find him, and succeeded. When what is really happening is finally revealed, it only confirms how preposterous this MacGuffin was. Similarly, the bad guys attempting to kill him makes absolutely no sense from their perspective, and it is there simply to enable various chases and fights.<br /><br />The two Dr. Martin Harrises are impossibly perfect in their identical knowledge of events and trivia. Not just far, far more than the plots requires, but detrimental to the plot. And preposterous relative to what the viewer eventually learns.<br /><br />The best example of the how lazy and ill-conceived the script is can be seen in the coded message MacGuffin: The message is something that could have been trivially memorized. Even if there were some reason to write it down, it would have drawn no attention as clear text. In fact, the only purpose of the trivial encoding is to draw the attention of the characters to that information and its importance.<br /><br />The MacGuffin of none of Dr. Harris' scientific collaborators being able to identify him is a \\"homage\\" to the 1920s and 1930s when long-distance travel was difficult and expensive.  The update is inconsistent. He talks with the collaborators on the phone, but doesn't use video chat -- an international collaboration is more likely to use Skype than traditional telephony. He has a web page with a picture on it, but none of the collaborators had visited it. Although to be fair, there are plenty of other movies in that category committing similar sins.<br /><br />The over-arching MacGuffin here, involving genetically-modified organisms, is so in-your-face stupid and nonsensical that  middle-school students are likely to spot it and be insulted, unless they had already given up on the movie.<br /><br />For the inevitable (negative) comments citing \\"willing suspension of disbelief\\": This normally applies only to a few contrivances _necessary_ to enable the plot (example: awaking from a 4-day comma alert and physically robust). Wholesale lack of internal consistency in the story isacceptable only for full-throttle action thrill-rides such as \\"24\\", parodies,...<br /><br />Added 11/28/2011: Using a crossword puzzle as an analogy to the plot puzzle presented to the movie's viewers: When you finally get the \\"solution\\", you discover that the clues fit together only if you misspell some words and enter wrong words as answers to others.parodies,...

B004WR125O|4.0|I bought this at the same time as an Onkyo TX 8050 receiver.  See that review for a little more detail.  The adapter works great... has no trouble  connecting to my wireless network router which is in the next room.  I had thought that it would enable me to connect to my computer so that I could select the music source from there.  A read of the owners manual shows that it only allows you to connect directly to the wireless router.  Which is fine.  I am using Pandora and it synchs up easily.      Really I could give it 5 stars, because the misunderstanding on the connectivity was my fault and not due to misrepresentation by Onkyo.      Very satisfied, no regrets for buying this adapter or the receiver.    Also very satisfied with Vann's (the Amazon merchant).   Great transaction and rapid shipping.  My items were well packaged and 100% damage free.

To go into a movie with not a lot of expectation other than hoping that being a comedy with an all star cast, it would at least keep me somewhat entertained, and come out of the movie still laughing and laughing for days afterwards, is all I can say.  I knew immediately I would have to have this movie on dvd and am pre-ordering it.  If you don't think this movie is funny, then well, you just don't have a sense of potty adult humor, and that is unfortunate.  I have also seen 'Bridesmaids' and 'Bad Teacher' this summer and while they are both very funny, they really don't even compare to 'Horrible Bosses'.
B000005RT8|4.0|I am a HUGE Macca fan--and I would likely listen to him sing the phone book, yet I somehow never appreciated this album until now. To be fair, I was only 17 when it came out--I pretty much played \\"Coming Up\\" and \\"Waterfalls\\" and that was it. I didn't \\"get\\" the electronic music and wanted him to be rockin' out. With the arrival of the CD, my vinyl copy got put away and I never managed to purchase the CD version. Then last year at Paul's Hollywood Bowl Concert, I realized that the cool music playing before the show was from this album and I was really digging it. So I dusted off that ol' vinyl copy and gave it another spin. I don't know if I have simply matured in my musical tastes or this album was twenty years ahead of its time, but it sounds so fresh. Different than his Fireman efforts, which I also like. \\"Bogey Music\\" is a laff--like something John would have done. \\"Nobody Knows\\" is a cool bass-driven rocker. Also love \\"Check My Machine\\", \\"Front Parlour\\" and \\"Frozen Jap\\". \\"Temporary Secretary\\" seems like something Devo or the B-52s might have done. \\"Blue Sway\\" is beautiful and ethereal. \\"Waterfalls\\" is a classic Macca ballad, as is \\"One of These Days\\". \\"Summer's Day Song\\" is also quite pretty.    The most \\"out there\\" songs, \\"All You Horse Riders\\", \\"You Know I'll Get You Baby\\" and \\"Bogey Wobble:\\" were left off the album, but are pretty cool electronica themselves. You can find them on \\"The Lost McCartney II Album\\".    BTW, none other than John Lennon said he liked this album :)
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I just bought this set and it's amazing. The bonus disc are fun but the best part is the 1080p transfer. Rots which is my favorite of the PT looks amazing and the sound rocks. It's so much more fun watching Star Wars in 1080P. As far as the OT well I'm lost for words. Episode 5 is my favorite movie of all time and now it just got better. The details pop out on my 1080p TV. I'm not to crazy about some of the changes especially the Vader NOOO but it doesn't bother me to much, I wish it wasn't there but I still love Star Wars and I love this set. If your a fan or just a Blu Ray person get this set.....Thanks
0307716511|4.0|This book was kind of slow starting out but it picked up after the first one hundred pages. I had no idea who it was until the end and loved all the twists and turns! Very well done! Can't wait to read more by this author!
B000NDMRCS|5.0|First off, this movie is SPECTACULAR!!! The graphics were great, the special effects were AMAZING, and the characters has a good dialogue to follow. The point is, this is what 2012 (the movie) was built from, and 2012 was worse than this. 2012 had the action moments be short, but many in the movie. The Day After Tomorrow had the action moments ALL throughout the movie, making you glue your eyes to the screen for fear that if you blink, you will miss something exciting!The Day After Tomorrow will not let you down, and I fully recommend it for a good suspenseful movie!
0385523912|5.0|Descriptively vivid, chilling and factual retelling of the lives of six North Koreans who eventually leave the land of the beloved Dear Leader, for a new life, free from the shackles of minders, starvation, mind control, fear of prison,leadership deification and juche.  A well-crafted text that captures the reader's attention from the first page through the last.  Author Barbara Demick's excellent writing skill provides a rare glimpse into this closed and secretive society ruled through fear, intimidation and indoctrination.
0307408833|5.0|Who knew that cake could be delicious and not super duper fattening. Also, the ingredients are easy to find and the recipes are easy to adapt. Bravo. 5 stars!! My non vegan friends also like the recipes; what they don't know about nutrition won't hurt them... :)
0553801473|5.0|To all who care to read this before reading the next installment, take this for what it is worth. The last tale A Feast For Crows and this A Dance With Dragons are one book split in an unusual way. I will spoil it by telling you that it is in the same time frame as the former but because if he had tried to publish them as one he could not have done it justice or even kept it under the nearly 2000 pages the two are in combination. Think of this in that way when you read it and you will love the story. If you loved the others as dark as they are you will love this.
B003L77GRO|1.0|Dear CBS,    I understand that you're trying desperately to sell BluRay, but the quality of these DVD transfers just keep getting worse every year. The film transfer would be of a higher quality if you sold the bootlegged version. No excuses -- do better or we'll quit buying altogether.
B0036T32LQ|4.0|Was looking for a good spooky movie to go with the weather outside and was pleasantly surprised at how good this was! Acting was very good. Setting creepy. Did get a bit tiring going back over and over the same scenes (you'll see what I mean if you watch but I guess that was part of the story). Well worth the watch!
030746363X|5.0|Timiothy Ferriss has a lot of interesting ideas on how to get in shape, improve areas or your life, and become the person we all say we want to be.  He has a lot of great points that you can apply to your life or simply reflect on and helps encourages you to make those changes you've always wanted to.  He spells out exactly what you need to to for results and provides lots of data/science on how his plans work.  I found it very interesting and like the way the book is broken up into sections.
076115678X|2.0|Having read all of the reviews on this website, I bought the Curly Girl Handbook with high hopes. All I can say is, the method doesn't work for me. Perhaps it's because I've never attacked my hair with straighteners or hair-dryers in the past, or used a lot of products (I gave up trying to do anything with it at an early age), so maybe there just wasn't THAT much difference between a stretched-straight, blow-dried-to-death \\"before\\" / happy-ringletted \\"after\\" look for me - my hair has always been curly and in good condition.     The book basically advises you to clean your scalp with a bit of nasty-free conditioner (not shampoo); rinse; then condition your hair, leaving most of the conditioner in to hydrate the curls. And only to use your fingers to comb it. (There, that's it - saved you 188 pages of reading.) But instead of taming the frizz and giving me gorgeous locks, this method just made my hair go into greasy-looking coils - and that was on day 1, straight out of the shower! To have the hair of a dirty scumbag when you've just washed and dried the stuff is so disappointing. But maybe I'm just the exception to the rule - there seem to be a lot of people out there who swear by the CG method.     As for the book itself, I appreciate what it is trying to do, but wish it would treat its readers in a less patronising fashion. The non-stop puns, personal stories from random women about how growing up with curly hair has traumatised them for life (32 of them, most taking up a whole page each), \\"horoscope\\" chapter (because all girls love horoscopes, right?!?!?!?!?), \\"12-Step Recovery Program\\", and photos of the author's baby are all irritating space-fillers.     I did like the chapters on: why curly hair behaves in the way it does; homemade hair-care products (although these are all traditional recipes that you could easily find online); and the chapter showing you how to put your hair up. But a lot of the book wasn't relevant to me; and I would guess that unless you have a large intergenerational / multiracial family, all with curly hair, much of the book will not be relevant to you either.     I am very grateful to the Curly Girl Handbook for opening my eyes to the grisly list of chemicals to be found in the average bottle of shampoo (how does the beauty industry get away with it?). But maybe the answer lies in using sulfate-free, organic shampoo brands sparingly, instead of walking round with a head full of slimy conditioner?     If you have curly hair and spare money to spend on books on personal grooming, then maybe you should disregard my bitter comments and buy the CG Handbook anyway - it might work for you! But if money is tight, I would suggest testing the method out first by, for example, following the instructions on Wikihow; then if it changes your life, perhaps this book will provide you with extra detail - there are some interesting pieces of information hidden amongst the padding.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|You know Lucas can do whatever he wants to his movies. They are his creations. They are his artistic vision. Where he is wrong though is not including the original versions and remastering them for HI-def as an option. No other filmmaker has done what he has which is basically not acknowledging the existance of the original version. Yes these are his movies, but they also belong to us the fans because the fans support and love for these films made it the phenomena that it is. Sorry Mr. Lucas but I will not be ordering these. I'll stick to the laser discs.     You know on second thought all these changes since the 1997 Special Editions til now have only made them consistent with the mediocrity of the Prequels. I always believed that the Original Trilogy existed in its own parallel universe separate from the six episode series anyway. Sort of a \\"Mirror Universe\\" version of Star Wars which is fine. The George Lucas of 2011 is certainly not the George Lucas of 1977. So these new versions of Star Wars should be called Star Wars : The Rise and Fall and Redemption of Anakin Skywalker which is the way Lucas sees these films as nowadays. The Original Trilogy should exist as Star Wars : The Adventures of Luke Skywalker which I believe was the original conceptualization of the series. This if I remember correctly was used for the original novelizations of the trilogy.     Darth Vader was always a much more interesting character when his origins were a mystery and only hinted at. This only enhanced his legend, mythology and aura which is why everybody loved this character in the first place. He was essentially a sci-fi version of the\\"boogie man\\" . The Original Trilogy made him the pop culture icon that he WAS. Unfortunately these special edition versions basically broke down Dart Vader into something a lot less. Lucas essentially made him into some gifted and whiny kid who was screaming out for help. This is fine if that is what Lucas wants of course. But as I said earlier givethe fans the option of which version they want to see. There is no reason why they cant both exist. It is a big universe anyway.     What I would like to see in an original trilogy Blu-ray set :     Restored unaltered versions of the Trilogy with cleaned up effects and Original sound mixes as an option.   Deleted scenes   Original Making of documentaries.   Star Wars to Jedi Documentary   Empire of Dreams Documentary   Star Wars Holiday Special (Restored and Remastered)   Vintage Interviews with cast and crew   Audio Commentaries   New documentary on the Star Wars Phenomena from a 1970's early 80's point of view which includes vintage toy commercials, actor and character appearances on such shows as Donnie and Marie, The Richard Pryor Show, The Muppet Show, etc. and interviews with illuminaries and fans of the period.   New documentary on the merchandising bonanza of the series.   Promotional art and trailers

B002MQYOFW|4.0|Suzanne Collins' first book of her Hunger Games series was quickly paced, believable without being predictable, and entertaining to read despite the horrifying content theme.  Apt descriptions and authentic characters clearly illustrate the scene and scenario as readers are faced with an unbelievable (and believable) tale.  I found Collins' style to be excellent for the young adult audience and also think it will introduce to young adults the concept of criticizing the world around you without becoming a cynic.  The heroin might come through in the end after all...
1401216676|1.0|I know this will go against the grain of a lot of Batman fans out there and draw harsh and intense criticism; but when the book advertises itself as one of the best Batman stories ever written, it sort of sets pretty high expectations. The forward itself places The Killing Joke among Watchmen, The Dark Knight, and Batman: Year One- all of which I am a huge fan of, by the way. It is much shorter than the others so it must be self-contained. That's fine. Also, the artwork of the Deluxe Edition- beautiful. Masterfully done. I also praise Moore for his other works.<br /><br />I get the message of this story. It's just nothing that original when it comes down to it despite all the self-aggrandizement. People enjoy reading Batman and \\"superhero\\" comics altogether because they choose to believe that despite all the injustice in the world, good will prevail and evil will be punished. Forgetting the last part is one of the biggest faults I see in this comic.<br /><br />The remainder of this review contains SPOILERS. Do not read further if you intend to read.<br />[SPOILERS]<br />I don't have any qualms with how most of the story was executed. My complaint lies how a certain victim in the story was written off with such callous disregard. That in itself may not warrant harsh criticism- except for the fact that the story ends with no mention of any hope for this individual. Again, I cite the main reason why people like reading superhero comics: good will prevail despite the great adversity set against it; and evil will be punished. How can they end the story without offering even a bit of hope for the said victim or family. (Yes, I know in comics nothing is permanent; but in a self contained story; it's important to offer a glimmer of hope no matter how miniscule.) I understand that the father of the victim's role in the story was to remain as the constant guardian of \\"justice\\" whatever that means to the comic's writers- though both father and Batman's reaction was just aboutthe most unrealistic and unsympathetic in the ridiculous fantasy comic's history (which is saying a lot!). I know if these circumstances happened to any real person, their reaction upon confronting the antagonist would be: \\"Hey, I want to help you\\" instead of \\"I don't care what your reasons or madness are; I am going to stop you from ever harming another innocent soul\\". \\"We have to show him that our way works\\"? What is \\"our\\" way exactly? Last I checked the law is constantly evolving and the only reason it is, is because it is far from perfect. Meaning the law was pretty unjust when first laid- that's kind of why superheroes like Batman were created to begin with, no? Vigilante justice fighting for those who the law could not protect?\\"<br /><br />Wheres I understand the ending was intentionally left open-ended (I won't argue this- sort of clever, but comes across more as cowardly as they didn't want to permanently change the character [Batman] either way- and effectively- extremely frustrating to readers). If the reader is to satisfy their sense of justice and have the Joker killed- this would break Batman's and Gordon's ideals they were fighting for; and if not- we are to see that both Batman and Gordon are impotent fools who can not even protect the ones they love despite all their efforts. Gordon himself mentions \\"..everytime he [Joker] escapes I just hope he doesn't do anything to harm anyone\\". What kind of establishment does Gotham City Penitentary exactly run? I'd trust Colonel Klink to hold these villains more than Arkham Asylum!<br /><br />Final thoughts- I for one thought that DC was unfairly judged when comments were raised how not enough female employees worked at the company. Now in reading women's criticisms to this specific story, I am starting to believe that there may be some truth to this argument. If one is going to take an important female hero in the comic- maim her, humiliate her, and use that as a pivotal point in the story- one better add somesaving grace or glimmer of hope that they will fight on and recover - you know, like a superhero comic?. Otherwise, I can just hear about this stuff for real on the evening news.<br /><br />Oh.. and Joker's origin? Eh.<br />[/SPOILERS]
B002ZG999U|1.0|I love action films and lots of gratuitous violence, but this insult to human intelligence was one of the worst DVD dribbles I've ever wasted my time on.  Horrible script, mediocre acting. In fact, I'm hard pressed to find anything positive to say about this load of garbage. It is not worth the DVD it's recorded on.
B000NVIGC0|3.0|Having always felt that a certain amount of warmth was missing from this band (since Being There, anyway), I was looking forward to hearing this when I heard that the relentless sonic lab work was relenting a bit on this album.  The truth is, however, that no matter how removed the band felt, there were always very strong songs in the mix on every album. \\"What Light\\" might be the only song on this album I want to repeat again and again.
0316010669|1.0|I read Outliers and I decided to buy Blink as well.  It seemed like a good idea.  BLINK is possibly the worst book ever written and believe you me, i will return it to amazon for a full refund.  I have never felt so strongly about a book.

0394800184|4.0|Are You My Mother? was one of those books I'd always see as a kid, but never got the chance to check out for one reason or another. I recently bought it as a surprise for my daughter, and have to say that it's a pretty cute book, and I didn't see anything objectionable about it as a few other uppity people have. I think they might have skipped the first couple of pages showing how the baby bird ended up in its situation. This book is a fun, quick read and would make an ideal book for kids who've learned how to read a little since there aren't many lines on each page, and no tough words.<br /><br />A mother bird is sitting on her egg one day, when she realizes that the baby will be hungry when it hatches. She goes off to find food, and shortly after, a baby bird is born. The baby falls out of its nest and begins to search for its mother, which is kind of tough since it doesn't know what she looks like, and doesn't know that it's a bird either. The baby wanders around asking different animals if they're the mother or not, and always gets a 'no'. It eventually sees vehicles like a boat, thinking it could possibly be the mother too. In the end, the baby bird finds a power shovel and asks the construction vehicle 'are you my mother?' too. The power shovel can't answer, but lets out a loud 'SNORT!'. The baby bird finally gets that this isn't its mother, but somehow, the shovel ends up carrying the bird back to its nest, and the mother arrives immediately with food.<br /><br />This is a cute book and within the first couple of pages has something most kids will react to- the baby bird walking past a rock that its mother is behind. This is the kind of thing that would've made me go 'she's right there!', and sure enough, my daughter said it herself. The little bird has a long journey trying to find its mother, and when it does, it realizes what she is after listing everything she's not. My daughter got a kick out of the power shovel being called a Snort, and has been using that word a lot ever since I read this to her. The artwork is minimal but nice. My only nitpick is that the author kept using 'said' instead of 'asked' when the baby bird would ask the different animals and things if they were its mother. That just seemed weird to me, but doesn't matter much.<br /><br />Give this one a shot if you haven't yet, and don't worry about any objectionable content.ver since I read this to her.

0385523912|5.0|I was introduced to this book through a book club.  I didn't look forward to reading it but I'm so glad I did.  It was truly an eye-opening experience for me.  I have recommended the book to many with my opinion that \\"This is an important book.\\"
B001FSDOZO|5.0|I love Nickelback and this CD was no disappointment! There are a couple of tracks that I didn't like as well, but overall this was a great album! If you're not familiar with this band be aware that they can comes across as a little vulgar at times.
B004HYGF18|5.0|Nothing has grabbed me so instantly as this album. The Rifles - The great escape hit me almost as fast and are who I would probably compare the Vaccines to in terms of bite and quality. Each has the driving beat and vibrancy that connects you with the quintessential UK lusts and melancholies familiar to those that grew up with the Stone Roses / Suede / Blur / Pulp / Oasis ... and other 90's rock.    Every song is a grabber, none of them took time to warm up to for me and they have so much energy that they're brilliant for driving, partying or working away at something. Usually, an album has 2 or 3 perfect songs if it is a good one, almost all of the songs are perfect on this one. Instantly 2 or 3 stand out like Blow it up, Post Break up sex and A lack of understanding; later on others stood out as strongly.    I can't recommend them enough, they reminded me of being 20 and listening to Supergrass I should coco because their voice is just as strong , the feelings so unrestrained, just pure emotive energy.
B000TSIK14|5.0|I've been a Scorps fan since the mid 70s, but somehow never heard anything about this effort.  That's too bad, as it has some outstanding tracks.  Got it as a a gift recently, I'm sorry that I overlooked this great album.
0553801473|5.0|The 5th book in the series is a strong one. The writing is excellent - as always - and the story is great, and doesn't always go where you think it will.<br /><br />I gave this novel a 5 star rating due to the quality of the writing, however, that is not to say the novel is perfect. Some might say that the plot doesn't really move along, and that is a valid criticism. Events which took several chapters to occur could very well have been reported second hand via raven. There is POV on characters which I, personally, don't care about - the ironborn for example. Additionally, the main story doesn't really advance as far as it should. On the plus side, I think Martin did a good job of setting the stage so that events can move along in the next book.<br /><br />My biggest complaint occurred with something that happened at the end of the novel. I don't want to be a spoiler, so let's just say that someone acts completely out of character. The entire scene seemed forced.
B001E57SH8|5.0|There are some negative reviews that are due to improper use/operation. If you read the directions this product works perfectly. 2 points... If you are having trouble lighting, you are supposed to push the flint wheel down before striking, lights every time. Next point, refueling... Hold lighter upside down, and fill for about 4 seconds, repeat this until full. You are supposed to read the liquid level with the lighter inverted, not right side up. If this lighter does fail it has a lifetime warranty, and made in the USA, it doesn't get any better.
1862055149|5.0|This is the must-have second or third Thai cookbook you should own.   It is massive and would be overwhelming as an introduction.  But when you want a book that has almost everything Thai - this is the one.    The extensive introduction gives an excellent background on what you are eating and where is comes from.      This book meets my usual criteria for a good ethnic cook book:  1) It is written for the western reader.  Ingredients are identified by English names. Ingredients are possible to obtain - or reasonable substitutes suggested.   2) The writer has extensive in-country experience.  Thompson is Australian but spent years in Thailand.    3) I am leery of books written by professional cooks - which are often full of difficult restaurant recipes - good only when you have a staff to help.  This book is written for the home cook.  I have cooked a number of recipes from this book so far - without issues.   I should add that Thompson makes all his curry pastes from scratch.  The modern Thai cook does not do that - they buy from the tubs of fresh curry paste available at any market.  Unless you have loads of time and a very good Asian store nearby - you should too.  Thai curry paste in a number of different styles is available in many Asian markets - and Amazon - although more dear.  Take the recipe - and figure out which one he is making - and dip it out of the container.  (Full disclosure - I do a lot of ethnic cooking and not much phases me except too long ingredient lists and excessive preparation.)
0743454537|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. Jodi Picoult somehow managed to make every single character relatable - even if their decisions or actions were reprehensible, she made me understand and even agree with each one of them, which I thought would have been impossible, considering how contradictory their opinions were. I found it impossible to decide which characters were right and which were wrong - meaning Jodi Picoult successfully managed to expose all the shades of gray in the issue of \\"designer babies\\" and all its emotional consequences - an issue that is almost always seen as black and white.     Most of the things I disliked while reading this book, for example that the reader didn't get to know Kate's opinion on her sister's fight for medical emancipation, were explained later on. The only problem I still have with the novel was the Julia-Campbell storyline. It seemed somewhat corny and I didn't feel like it added too much to the main plot. I understand that the \\"mystery\\" around Campbell and his service dog and Julia and Campell's history helped support the author's theme that every person and every issue is complex and cannot be judged one-sidedly, but I still think the author would have been able to get her point across without this storyline.     This next paragraph contains vague information about the novel's ending, which could be considered spoilers!)  I've heard a lot of people say they were unsatisfied with the ending. However, the unpredictable ending was one of the things I liked best about the novel. The author couldn't have let one side \\"win\\" without ruining the novel's moral. No, this solution (if you can call it that) wasn't the most probable or realistic, but it was the perfect way to help the reader make their own decision. I bawled after reading the ending, so the author must have done something right. I especially loved the epilogue describing the aftermath of the death for the family, and I found the last sentence so powerful and moving I can't get it out of my head anymore.     Overall, an emotional and thought-provoking read. I definitely recommend it!
B005BCE7FQ|5.0|This movie is great for all ages, especially if you have a 3D television.

So far I have only watched this movie in 3D, but the colors and animation are so beautiful I would imagine it is just as much of a visual thrill in 2D. The story is lovable, which seem pretty rare now of days in visually pleasing 3D movies. Kids and adults alike can enjoy this funny colorful adventure. I would recommend this movie to anybody who enjoys films along the lines of Pixar material ([[ASIN:B0030IIYWA Toy Story (Two-Disc Special Edition Blu-ray/DVD Combo in Blu-ray Packaging)]], [[ASIN:B001KVZ6G6 Up (Four-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + BD Live) [Blu-ray]]], [[ASIN:B004UFEJXK Wall-E (Three-Disc Blu-ray / DVD Combo)]], [[ASIN:B004I654WQ Cars (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo in Blu-ray Packaging)]] etc.)  Overall I broke down my scores:  ***STORY LINE: 4.5/5 (Comical and whimsical yet overall solid with strong characters)  ***VISUALS: 5/5 (Amazing colors and detailed animation)  ***3D: 5/5 (Great dimension and some moments when things fly off the screen right into your home)    This is surely a movie any family with kids must pick up, the film is a pleasure for the whole family.
0802798225|4.0|I'm pretty much the last person to read Perfect Chemistry, so writing this review is kind of pointless, but I'm going to do so anyway. I'd heard so, so many great things about this book, so I had pretty high expectations. While I did have some problems with this novel, I loved Perfect Chemistry - it's a hot romance novel!     Honestly, the story sounds really clichéd - the typical good girl/bad boy love story. And while their differences do play an important role, Perfect Chemistry is so much more than that cliché. Alex and Brittany are no clichés - they're fully-developed, complex characters, and I loved both of them. Alex is the poor Mexican gang member, but he's also sensitive, thoughtful, and, well, kind of adorable. Brittany is the spoiled rich girl, but she has problems, too - she needs to take care of Shelly, her sister who has cerebral palsy, and try to convince her parents not to send Shelly to some kind of institution.     I loved these two characters so much, and I could relate to both of them easily. Perfect Chemistry is written from alternating perspectives, and both Brittany's and Alex's voices are great. In my opinion, alternating points of view often don't work out because the voices are too similar, but that's definitely not the case in Perfect Chemistry - the voices are destinct and portray the characters perfectly.     Even more than the characters themselves, though, I enjoyed the relationship between Brittany and Alex - their chemistry is amazing. I love how they're so different on the outside but still have so much in common and are actually really similar. In the beginning, though, I thought the way the romance developed was kind of forced. Alex and Brittany hadn't gotten to know each other yet, so what happened in chemistry shouldn't have been that big of a deal. The focus on chem class is too extreme in my opinion - several times, both of them complain about how strict their teacher is and how terrible the class is, even though (to me) itseemed completely normal. Later on, though, once Alex and Brittany get to know each other, I loved their relationship and how it develops.     What's lacking in this novel, in my opinion, is the writing. It's okay, but there's nothing special or beautiful about it. In particular, I was annoyed by how the author used Spanish in Perfect Chemistry. I don't mind that she used Spanish - it makes sense, since Alex is Mexican - but I disliked the way she used it. It doesn't seem authentic, more like the author wanted to use some Spanish but was too focussed on making the reader understand it - she either said something in Spanish and immediately repeated it in English, or she used sentences like \\"Sí, everything's bien,\\" \\"He's got nada to brag about,\\" and \\"La policía are looking for us,\\" saying words everyone knows in Spanish but the rest in English. While I understand that she wanted to let everyone understand what the characters are saying, that just doesn't seem realistic to me - why would anyone in real life speak like that? I think I would have preferred it if either the whole sentence had been in Spanish (you can probably get what they're talking about from the context even if you don't know any Spanish), or if she'd written the sentence entirely in English and then written something like \\"...,\\" Alex said in Spanish. Maybe it's just me, but Spanish used like it is in this book (and lots of other books) really annoys me.     Despite my dislike of the writing, Perfect Chemistry is a great romance novel with fully-developed characters. I'm planning on reading Rules of Attraction, the companion novel, soon - even though I'm not sure whether I'm going to enjoy it, since it sounds really similar to Perfect Chemistry...
0765348780|4.0|I see that I'm joining a long list of reviewers so I'll keep it short.  Although I write it, I don't read a large volume of fantasy.  I can't get through a single title by Jordan or Goodkind.  I thought Game of Thrones was \\"pretty good.\\"  But I really loved this book.  I enjoyed the casual integration of the magic system, I enjoyed the large cast of characters, I loved the different species of humanoids, I loved the gaming-like caste system of thieves, assassins, mages, warriors, etc.  I did not have  a problem with the books complexity at all.  Yes, I agree some of the characters had questionable motivations, but Erikson's writing made you forgive them.      My only complaint was that the last quarter of the book seemed to wrap of the fates of characters a bit too quickly and without foreshadowing.  The first such character to suffer such a tidy end was Hairlock.  After that, it seems that Erikson kind of starts winging it.  We have the climax villain -- the Jaghut Tyrant -- striding forth with much fanfare, only to have him trumped in villainy by a bottled demon that could have been summoned at any single point during the novel.    Otherwise, I have to say the first 3/4 of this novel is the best fantasy I've read since Donaldson.  I am still hooked enough to have already purchased Deadhouse Gates!
0142418471|5.0|I love John Green, so I was excepting to enjoy his parts of the novel, but I hadn't read anything by David Levithan before Will Grayson, Will Grayson, and didn't know yet whether I'd like his parts. I immediately fell in love with John Green's Will Grayson. His hilarous, self-deprecating style fit this character perfectly. Will Grayson is awkward in a very relatable way, and I always enjoy those kinds of characters.     It took me longer to start liking David Levithan's Will Grayson, and while I know that's superficial, a main reason for that was the all-lowercase writing. That type of writing already annoys me online, and I didn't think I could take a whole book written like that. David Levithan's Will Grayson was hard to like, for me, and it was hard to relate to his angry, angsty (is that a word?) personality. Later on, though, his character grew on me, and I started to like him more once I understood the point of writing all lowercase. Actually, if I'm completely honest, I didn't really get the point - I thought it was to show how little he cares, with the depression and all. In the back of the book though, there's a conversation between John Green and David Levithan, where David Levithan explains his reason: His Will Grayson sees himself as a lowercase-person, especially since he projects himself mainly online (those are David Levithan's words, just so you know, not mine). That explanation made me appreciate and understand his Will Grayson more. And I started liking him even more once both Will Graysons met.     Anyways, as I expected from John Green, the writing in this novel is amazing. The metaphors are great, the writing is lively, and, I don't know how else to explain it, but his style is just so easy. David Levithan's writing and style matched John Green's perfectly. One of the things I like best about John Green's writing is how much it can make you feel, and David Levithan mastered that, too. This novel is so hilarious it makes you laugh out loud at parts and so deep and touching it really makes you think at others.     The characters are great, too. All of them are complex and realistic, as well as their relationships. One of my favorite parts of the book was Tiny Cooper. I'm not sure why I enjoyed him so much - I'd imagine him to be obnoxious and kind of annoying if I met him in real life - but as a character he's just genius, and loads of fun to read about. I love how lightly this novel deals with homosexuality - not in a preachy, annoying \\"Oh my God, I'm gay, what will I do?\\" way, but in a realistic and honest way - some people are gay, and that's the way it is, so deal with it.     All in all, this is a great read - hilarious but with a touching message of acceptance. The writing and characters are great. I'm already a fan of John Green, and I will definitely read more by David Levithan in the future!
0061673730|4.0|I think everyone should have it this book.  It is sometimes slow and difficult, but the pay off is huge.  I still think about the book, years after reading it.
0142410705|4.0|There is no doubt that John Green is an amazing writer - almost anyone who has read Looking for Alaska or Paper Towns would agree. What makes him so great, in my opinion, is that he manages to make the reader laugh out loud and cry within a few pages - sometimes even paragraphs. But his second novel, An Abundance of Katherines, has been critiqued several times for not showcasing this talent. Even though I understand where this critique is coming from (the book definitely showed John Green's distinct sense of humor, but didn't touch my heart or make me cry like his other novels), I don't think these reviews do the novel justice. It is, quite simply, a cute and entertaining read, which happens to be extremely well-written.     The characters' personalities were quirky, distinct, and fun to read about. To me, they are what make this story work, as the plot alone (which I have to admit was pretty predictable) would not have satisfied readers. The way he shows the readers his characters' personalities is what makes John Green's writing so special. I especially loved Lindsey and her relationship with Colin. One of my favorite parts of the novel were the cave scenes and the metaphor they provided (Lindsey's physical hiding-place being the only place she does not have to hide her true personality), which I thought was cleverly crafted.     The novel has been critiqued for not being as serious as Looking for Alaska or Paper Towns, but the summary alone shows the reader that this is supposed to be a light, funny, not completely realistic read. Especially the footnotes and the comments on the math show that the author doesn't take himself or his book too seriously.     One aspect of the novel I did have a problem with was the point-of-view. I thought the first-person narrator worked very well in the rest of John Green's writing, while the third-person narrator made this novel lack some of the teenage-authenticity I loved about his other novels (especially Looking for Alaska).However, maybe this sacrifice was necessary to help the author create a certain distance between the protagonist and himself - Colin's problem of taking himself too seriously wouldn't have fit John Green's self-deprecating style of writing.     Even though An Abundance of Katherines is not as emotional or powerful as John Green's other novels, I'd still recommend it if you're looking for a quick, funny and entertaining read. If you haven't read anything by this author yet, though, I'd suggest reading some of his other work first.
030745455X|4.0|I like this one better then the gitl with the dragon tatoo (which I really really liked as well).  This is is fun to read.  You can't wait to find out what happens next.
159514188X|5.0|This novel took my breath away - I could not put it down until having finished the very last page, and I loved everything about it. First off, the format was a great idea. It was a very original way to let two distinct voices merge, and Jay Asher made it seem effortless.       Both of the main characters are raw and realistic. While I didn't like Clay too much in the beginning (back when he felt this was all a mistake and he didn't belong on the list), this seemed like a realistic reaction, and later on I warmed up towards him. Hannah, though, I loved from the beginning on. I liked that Jay Asher didn't go with classic bullying as the cause for her suicide, but chose a more subtle (but nonetheless hurtful) way of constantly not being appreciated. Her problems seemed like things that could happen to anyone, but showed that if you add them all up, the do affect people greatly. I found it easy to relate to Hannah and I was drawn into the situations she described - so much so that I felt her excitement, her anger and her desperation.       What I admire most in this book is the wide range of emotions it evoked in me. It was sad, obviously, but it was also uplifting. Despite the solemn topic, I could not stop smiling after having finished the novel - the last scene had such a powerful and uplifting effect on me. The book also scared me, to some extent, as I thought I related too Hannah a bit too easily - when she described the thoughts and feelings leading up to her suicide, I felt myself go \\"I've thought that, too,\\" or \\"I've felt that way, too,\\" which surprised me as I don't consider myself a particularly depressed person.   Most of all, though, the novel is thought-provoking. By explaining that little, unimportant things that seemed like no big deal at the time played such a big role in Hannah's suicide, Jay Asher made me question the way I treat the people around me. He made me think twice about saying or doing something that could be considered hurtful, things I don't usually pay attention to. I honestly cannot think of anything bad to say about this book.     This is a thought-provoking novel I think everyone should read, even though it isn't an easy read due to the many issues it addresses. You will not forget this book, as it will make you question the way you treat people. This book could really make a difference. It is both heart-breaking and hopeful and it conveys a beautiful message.

0671027344|5.0|I'm stupid for having waited this long to read The Perks of Being a Wallflower. I'd heard it's amazing, but it never really appealed to me. I know it's pretty ridiculous, but I don't like \\"old books.\\" I like books that take place now. Since this takes place twenty years ago, I considered it \\"old\\" and didn't think I'd like it. I didn't get what it's about, nothing except that it's a coming-of-age story, which isn't all that special. Neither of those was a problem, though - I rarely noticed it takes place twenty years ago, lots of it could happen now, too; and not having one set topic is one of the things I enjoyed about this book. Even though it deals with loads of serious topics, it's not an issue book. I really liked not knowing what the main topic is and discovering more and more about Charlie's issues along the way.     When I first started reading The Perks of Being a Wallflower and saw it's written in a series of letters to an anonymous friend, I thought the format was kind of strange. It only took me a few pages to get into it, though, and I ended up really liking the format. It felt like Charlie was addressing me, much more than with a traditional narrative. I felt like I was the anonymous friend and wanted so badly to write back to Charlie.     The writing is amazing, so insightful and touching. What I mean isn't that the writing is flawless, it's more how the style and Charlie's voice shine through perfectly. It's raw and honest, so real I could imagine Charlie telling me all of this. Charlie is just such a great character. I felt for him and wanted to somehow help him throughout the book. His feelings are so raw and so relatable. I can't even express how I feel about Charlie - I just love him.     One thing I thought was weird, though, is Charlie's friendship with Sam and Patrick. He's a freshman, and a pretty immature and not exactly outgoing one at that, but he's friends with all these seniors. How does that work?     I could talk about all of the issuesCharlie has, but I don't really want to. If you haven't read The Perks of Being a Wallflower yet, you should have the same reading experience I had, not really knowing what those issues are. I'll just say that what Charlie has to go through is heartbreaking and shocking and had me crying several times while reading.     My reluctance to read The Perks of Being a Wallflower was not justified at all - this book really is as great as everyone else has said it is. I got this at the library, but will have to buy my own copy to re-read and keep on my favorites' shelf. I know most of you have already read this, but for those who haven't, I really recommend it!
0812973992|5.0|This is a great book.  One of the best things I have read a very long time. Everyone should this one.
0316044938|4.0|I didn't really know what to expect from The Lovely Bones. I'd heard great things about it, but I never really got the concept before I started reading it. So if you're like me, and don't really get it, let me explain: the main character, Susie Salmon, who was murdered and is now in heaven, tells us about what happens to her family and friends after her death. I love the idea of using only one person's voice but being able to know everyone's thoughts and feelings by having the story be narrated by a dead girl. This concept gave the whole novel an incredible amount of layers.     Alice Sebold's writing is amazing and captivating - every single word in this book is simply beautiful. I absolutely loved the characters in The Lovely Bones. To me, they're what brought this story to life. They were all fully-developed and complex - each of them is completely individual, but they are still realistic and relatable (well, almost all of them were relatable - I wouldn't say I could relate to Susie's murderer, but I don't think you'd want to relate to him anyways...).     What I liked best about this novel was how beautifully Alice Sebold portrayed raw, honest emotion. I could understand each of the characters' feelings. This novel really made me feel something. It was heartbreaking to read about Susie's fate, especially from her young and innocent voice, which will definitely stay with me. I felt all of her pain and despair, and the other characters' pain as well. This novel's message is beautiful.     I know this is just a tiny thing, but one thing that often annoys me in books is that the transitions between flashbacks and present time seem forced, and luckily that wasn't the case in The Lovely Bones. These transitions were seamless and the past and present complemented each other perfectly.     I did have some problems with this novel, though. I don't know if this is just me, but some parts in the middle were kind of boring, and it was hard for me to stay focused on the plot. Some parts were confusing, too - I didn't always directly get who Susie was talking about and what had happened - sometimes, I only figured out what happened by seeing how others reacted to it. (For example, I didn't get that the father was injured or that Mr. Harvey moved away until later on.) Maybe that's my fault, though, and I should read it again to really understand everything.     ***This next paragraph contains spoilers!***   One scene I didn't get was near the end, when Susie comes back down to earth into Ruth's body and has sex with Ray. I just didn't see the point of that scene. I know it helped Susie move on, but I don't really understand how having sex with Ray could help her. I'd have thought that if she had another day on earth she should have done something more meaningful or something to help her family deal with their grief.     Even though I had a few problems with the novel, as some parts are boring and confusing, this is still a great read. The writing is beautiful, the characters are fully developed, and the whole novel is heartbreakingly beautiful, conveying great emotions. Definitely worth reading!
0375701427|5.0|This book is a classic.  It is everything that books should be. More than an interesting story, this is a work of art.
014241543X|2.0|This was one of the rare books I'd heard almost only good things about, and it seemed right up my alley - I love being moved to tears by a book - so naturally, I was excited to read If I Stay once I got my hands on it. And at the beginning it seemed like it would live up to my admittedly high expectations - the scene of the accident was described so well that I could visualize it all easily. I actually had the feeling I was there with Mia when she found her parents.     However, things started going downhill fast. After the accident, I found myself unable to relate to Mia anymore. Some of the flashbacks connections to the present seemed forced and unnecessary - I remember one scene where Mia talked about how quickly time passed the time she went to a casino just to explain how quickly time passed at the hospital. This, like a few other flashbacks, added nothing to the story whatsoever. I was also annoyed by the characters, who (except for Mia and Adam) seemed very one-dimensional and stereotypical, like Mia's parents.     My main problem with the novel, though, was that, too me, it was lacking feeling. This surprised me, as lots of others say they bawled while reading this novel and it's usually pretty easy to get me to cry. The concept was sad, but for some reason I didn't feel much of anything and didn't shed a tear. The writing even seemed matter-of-fact at times - Mia isn't affected at all by her parents' death, she only states she figured out they didn't survive. It just wasn't fleshed-out enough for me, and I wasn't drawn into Mia's character, so that by the end of the novel I didn't really care whether she stayed or died. The ending confused me more than anything - I didn't understand what message Gayle Forman was trying to convey, and it didn't feel uplifting to me, which many others have called it.     On a brighter note, I did enjoy the cute love story between Mia and Adam. I also liked the references to music and how the author used their different tastesin music to explain Mia's feeling if not belonging into her family and Mia's character in general.     I really wanted to like this novel and I feel bad about giving it only two stars, but there wasn't enough substance or emotion for me. But since Gayle Forman achieved to move many people, she must have done something right, and I won't say it's a bad book. Maybe it just didn't speak to me personally.

B004K4IZ3G|5.0|In the first \\"TRON\\", a video game designer named Kevin Flynn, searching for proof that his work was stolen from him, became trapped within the digital world he helped to create, forced to fight in gladiator-style games to the death against computer programs that appeared very human in the world of the Grid. It was a strange world in which the programs viewed the \\"Users\\" of the real world as godlike figures. TRON was the greatest gamer on the grid, and TRON fought for the Users.<br /><br />\\"TRON Legacy\\" takes us back to the world of the Grid, when Kevin's son, Flynn, follows a mysterious message from his long lost father and ends up trapped on the Grid himself. There, he finds things are not as wonderful as his father described since a troubled program called CLU began running things. Sam soon must go into hiding with his rediscovered dad and a lovely girl named Quorra who is more than she appears. Together, the three must plan a way to escape from the Grid and thwart CLU's dream of crossing through to the real-world and \\"perfecting\\" it. And what of TRON himself? Yes, he's in here too in a most surprising way.<br /><br />1982's TRON and 2010's TRON Legacy are now available in a variety of purchasing options. Myself, I picked up the Blu-Ray + DVD combo of each film separately. For me, this was the best way. I don't have use for digital copies, nor 3D discs, as much as I would have liked the collectible identity disc packaging, ha. I doubt it is even full-size anyway, but I'm not sure since I've never seen it in stores. Anyway, this review is for the Blu-Ray/DVD of the 2010 sequel to TRON (the Original Classic), TRON Legacy.<br /><br />As I said in the title of this review, this is a great sequel that surpasses the original in many ways. Not every way maybe, since one can't deny the first film's status as innovative, and groundbreaking, and all that jazz. It was a daring movie to make. Tron Legacy is a little safer, as sequels tend to be (though it's tough to really say that in this case, with TRON being a bit of an odd duck and nearly 30 years old). The story in TRON Legacy is simpler and easier to follow, I think, catering more to a wider audience, more than anything because it is less stiff and computer-geek-centric, I'd say. I imagine back when the first film came out, a lot of folks didn't know what all the computer jargon even meant. I mean, I know WE didn't have much hands on experience with computers back in `82 in MY parents' house. The outfits and light cycles and stuff still were cool through the eyes of a kid though. However, the original TRON, while I find it IS a very interesting movie with a great cast and good characters (though we only really got to know Flynn really well), is a film that one can, frankly, really fall asleep too. If you're determined to watch it, you may decide it's a pretty good movie. I think it is. But, no doubt, it takes concentration; absolutely no distractions. It's like... reading a book.  Miss a beat and you're lost. Allow yourself  to get lost, and you'll probably drift off to sleep. TRON Legacy is a different story. The visuals are far more real than the first film, which attempted to show off very primitive computer animation that wasn't actually realistic at all (but still kinda works in the world that film created). While TRON Legacy improves on character development as well as visuals, the plot is easier to understand with much livelier action, music, and fun. The emotional levels are much more present too. Yeah, you can nit-pick at some of the concepts in the film, but really, this is pure fantasy anyway, so if it's not interfering with your enjoyment and just adding to the story rather then mucking it up, why do that?  TRON Legacy is just lots of fun, full of visual eye-candy, and also loaded with lots of clever stuff for both new fans and fans of the original to appreciate. And, ya gotta love it when, nearly 30 years later, the original actors return to make a sequel probably noone in the general audience would have guessed would ever actually happen.  Yes, Jeff Bridges returns here as Kevin Flynn/Clu, Bruce Boxleitner returns as Alan Bradley/TRON,  and there is a franchise teaser on this DVD in which Dan Shor returns as RAM, in a sense, hinting that he and perhaps others may return for a third installment, which Bruce Boxleitner has already claimed to be a Go project. David Warner is suspect to be back the third time `round as well, which would be very cool, especially if Cindy Morgan is brought back as well, but I digress. Returning to the topic of Legacy, the are fresh faces on board too, including Olivia Wilde as Quorra, Garrett Hedlund as Sam Flynn, Michael Sheen, who is a highlight in the Bowie-esque roll of Castor/Zuse, Beau Garrett, another highlight in the drool-inducing roll of Gem, and Cillian Murphy doing a cameo as the son of David Warner's character, Dillinger, hinting that he will be back to play a villain in the third TRON film. Daft Punk, who provides the electronic soundtrack, also appear as D.J.s in the film.<br /><br />TRON Legacy is a great movie that pulls at your nostalgia-bone in particular if you have any fond memories of the 80's at all, or if you're a Disney fanatic like myself. All the stuff called back from the first film is just awesome, and that scene where Sam is checking out the arcade with Journey and the Eurythmics playing in the background is just too sweet. It's also just a great sci-fi flick with a great cast though. There is one thing I must mention, however, and I nearly forgot. There's been a lot of talk about the younger version of Kevin Flynn seen in the film. Basically, it's a CGI Jeff Bridges. Filmmakers have never learned that CGI isn't wholly perfect looking yet, especially with human characters, and it may never be. I don't have a big problem with CLU looking a little CGI since he's a digital entity anyway (though none of the others have that issue), but even I have to admit that they probably should have given a clear shot of CGI Flynn during the flashback scenes. The really clear, direct views didn't work that well. This is more a problem in the opening flashback than anywhere else. However, this does not spoil the movie for me. I hope it won't spoil this great movie for you. The Blu-Ray sadly has no commentary track, Disney's stuff rarely does, but it does have some nice behind the scenes featurettes, as well as a pretty cool Daft Punk music video with really retro TRON graphics and a cameo by Olivia Wilde, and you get the sneak peak at the upcoming TRON animated series, which is worth getting excited about with its great cast and cool visuals. \\"The Next Day: Flynn Lives Revealed\\" is probably the highlight bonus feature though, as it gives us a deeper look into what happened when Kevin Flynn disappeared and what happened when Sam returned. In other words, this is a cool set up for a 3rd film. I can't wait! As for the included DVD of the film, it holds the sneak peak at the animated series as well, plus two of the behind the scenes bonus features from the Blu-Ray. All in all, a nice package, but be sure to buy the original classic on Blu-ray too! In all honestly, the existence of TRON Legacy just makes the first one more interesting and easier to watch, because now you're thinking about how it led to the events of that film as well.ould have guessed would ever actually happen.

B004CAWKXE|3.0|I've heard people make the argument that MCR's previous albums all embrace different styles.  Why, then, should fans dislike a new album which similarly embraces a new style?    The ocean between Danger Days dwarfs the creek between Three Cheers and Black Parade.  Danger Days feels generic.  Gone is the edgy atmosphere that permeated both albums.  Instead, we get ballads, punk, and arena rock.  In fact, Danger Days reminds me of what happened to Linkin Park (regardless of what you think of them).  They forgot about the signature style that brought them to prominence and have subsequently lost any relevance.  The comparison is even more apt because both bands are known for emo-ish lyrics and a younger fanbase dealing with issues like break-ups,suicide, or both at once.  Music critics love to lampoon this sub-genre- perhaps both bands felt pressure and desire to step into more respectable musical climates.  Well, fine, sing about ponies if you want to, but don't abandon your amazing sound!    That's not to say all of the cuts are bad.  Na Na Na, Bulletproof Heart, and The Only Hope for Me Is You all feel like MCR- especially the former.  And the rest are ok- they might be good tracks on a more boring band's album.  U2 maybe?  But not for MCR.  What's worse, most of the tracks don't showcase Gerard Way's unique vocals.  His intonation is the lifeblood of the band, and the production of the album largely obscures it.    I know the album has largely been a success, but here's hoping MCR returns to more familiar territory in the future.

1451629184|5.0|I bought this book when it 1st came out and i just got through reading it. It was very painful reading what this young lady had to endure for so long. I cried and had to put the book down because of the pain i felt for her. Two weeks later I started to read again and I was able to compose myself but not for long. There were a couple light moments i had to smile about, because currently I am going through it (taking care of a toddler), hers was A. I would like to meet Jaycee one day just to tell her how much i appreciate her taking the time to allow us into her life and the ordeal that she had to through and knowing she is not alone. I hope she continues to have an awesome recovery and knowing that she won the battle she had to fought. Good luck to her.
B002SRQ214|5.0|This is a great processor. Idles at 39, and after hours of gaming has went to 51 under load.  I dont have a problem with these temps.It reached 51c after hours of gaming with crysis,and running fraps.  So can expect some high temps. Game long enough,and stock fan will reach 5000rpm which is kinda loud.  If fan noise bothers you gaming. I say buy some better speakers:)

B004EPYZUI|5.0|I often read the reviews at Amazon and Netflix, but this is the very first time I've felt compelled to write one.  That's entirely due to this movie, every second of which I found to be mesmerizing and top-notch.  This is truly a fantasy masterpiece.    Based on the number of reviewers who, for reasons I'll never understand, seemingly didn't like it, I can't wholeheartedly recommend this movie to everyone.  Moreover, this movie would be unsettling for younger children, and I wouldn't recommend it for early teens either, due to its dark overtones.  But to me (and presumably others like me), this movie is a multiple orgasm of visual and auditory bliss, and an elevation of the action/fantasy genre that borrows the best of the elements in that genre and from them weaves together something unique.      It takes the slow-motion over-the-top fighting seqences from marshall arts films and the arresting visual graininess of movies like 300 and Sin City(without being overdone).  It is a marriage of photography and CGI ala Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (but not so animated as Beowulf).  It is a fantasy within a fantasy within a broken reality, reminiscint of the Matrix. Shutter Island, the Sixth Sense, and Inception.  But above all, it is its own, a consolidation and a permutation, raising the bar by culling the very best from what we have so far while infusing some new inspirations (and a whole lot of writer/director Zack Snyder).    The movie snob that lives inside my head compels me to point out that plot and storyline take a back seat to the audio and the video, existing primarily to provide a platform for the images and music, which perfectly compliment each other.  Don't get me wrong, there is a story here, it's just that the storytelling is not of the usual style.  It's a kind of a visual shorthand, done in such a way as to keep the viewer involved and the movie moving forward without getting in the way of the incredible imagery and dynamite, rocking soundtrack(which contains refreshing and inspired covers of some of the great rock tunes of yesteryear).  Like most action movies, the characters don't develop.  Instead, they're deftly executed snapshots of people, not simplistic but satisfying and sometimes self-mocking, done exactly as they should be done for this movie.        The movie makes a statement, perhaps several.  And it's all put together seamlessly, with ingenuity, taste, and a perfectly aggressive, non-stop pacing.  Unfortunately, it would appear that Sucker Punch and Zack Snyder deserve far more recognition than they're going to receive, but mark my words, this movie will continue to gain a following, and will go down in history as a mainstreamed cult classic in the same league as the Rocky Horror Picture Show and Firefly/Serenity.    If you kinda liked the movies I referenced above, you're gonna love this!

B00008977N|2.0|I owned the VHS of this concert which looked and sounded great. The transfer to DVD was really disappointing. The sound fades in and out and the female back up singer (can't remember her name) almost seems to have been intentionally subdued in the mix. The video is terrible as well, everything appears muted and out of focus. This was an amazing performance, I just wish I still had a VHS player to enjoy it with. I probably will not watch this train wreck of a DVD again.
0307277887|4.0|Dexter Morgan has always been different, and not in the \\"anti-social high school outcast\\" kind of way, either. No, Dexter's kind of \\"different\\" is, unfortunately, more of the \\"hears voices that tell him to kill\\" variety. That's right. Dexter Morgan is a serial killer, a man incapable of feeling emotion like a real human being and driven to murder by \\"the Dark Passenger,\\" a mysterious presence that lives in his brain. Fortunately for the rest of us, he's much more interested in carving up child killers than helpless women. What drives him down this particular avenue--to target other killers, instead of the innocent--is thanks to his policeman foster father, Harry, who has taken a rather unconventional stance on the matter. Instead of the old \\"If you can't fix 'em, institutionalize 'em\\" approach, Harry has instead advised Dexter to aim his destructive energies at those who \\"deserve\\" it: a predatory priest who preys on children and a noxious nurse who intentionally overdoses her patients on morphine, just to name a few. With this advice in hand, Dexter prides himself not only on pretending to be \\"normal,\\" (just your average, mild-mannered but charming blood spatter expert for the Miami police force), but also on his true, cold, calculating nature. But what happens when he starts making some very human mistakes? What Lindsay has wrought here is a great, fresh twist on the police procedural genre, with a wonderfully sardonic narrator with a wonderfully elegant way with words. Sadly, the ending is the weakest link in this otherwise unique, quirky novel. It comes rather abruptly and contains some revelations that, although very interesting to say the least, feel a tad bit forced. In this case, however, this shouldn't be seen as too much of a hindrance. Turns out there's several more adventures in store for Dexter, which certainly gives the author some room for improvement. For those mild-mannered readers who like the occasional romp on the ghastlier side of life (permitting that it's within comfortable distance of your armchair) get ready for some good ol' psychopathic fun.g that it's within comfortable distance of your armchair) get ready for some good ol' psychopathic fun.

It was helpful for when my husband got a song and I wanted it...no need to find a thumb drive.  Just go get on amazon...sweet!  However, I wanted one of those smart phones.  I was looking at the EVO 4G, not the 3d one, and I was absolutely sold on it when I learned it came with this pre-installed.  However, waiting gets the best of us.  I decided to get Sprint's HTC EVO 4G View tablet.  I thought the 7\\" display would make me happier b/c face it, it might be cool with unlimited internet on that phone, but if you run the battery down or get tired of the 4 inch display it will frustrate you.  And this had wifi--something I already had at home and was used to using and will use a LOT.  It gave me internet when I needed it and wifi when I didn't.  This way I get what I wanted (android stuff) and I didn't have to wait.<br /><br />But definately one of my main reasons was to get away from itunes....can I have your credit card number every time I upgrade....uh no sorry I'm in the middle of dishes and I can't get that....plus if I buy something here, which I love doing for the points and other reason...then it's available on my PC...unlike on itunes where you have to have ipods connected to certain accounts and stuff and lots of log on things and hook the device to the computer.....this is much easier.  I got my tablet last Sunday and by today not only did I download all I wanted from my cloud...plus I can shop from the tablet...but I put all my old amazon songs on my card and it went into the cloud player...even the itunes stuff...with no problems.  No searching this folder or that.  I think I may have just replaced itunes and my ipod with my tablet and this cloud player.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like was that for some reason I can't figure out how to not download a whole album...but that doesn't take away from this b/c I did figure out how to delete stuff from the player :)<br /><br />If you love amazon, want great music that is easy to get to, and want to go droid this app is great.

1400076943|4.0|I read her short stories and fell in love with her writing and then read all of her books.  Purple Hibiscus is a touching story of a young woman coming of age in Africa and by reading her story we not only get a glimpse of another culture but we see the humanity in us all.    I recommended this book and all the other books she has written.
B0053F042G|5.0|I had expected something like Ground Hog Day because of the other reviews - and there was that aspect - but they also threw in a decent mystery to solve and some quantum physics on top.  While not entirely unpredictable as a whole it had its own ending that worked very well.
1451629184|4.0|Jaycee's story is such a stirring testimony to hope and the human instinct to survive. She details in raw imagery the nuts and bolts of her kidnapping and the many events that followed during her years in captivity. For several years I lived near where she was taken; therefore, I have felt involved with her situation since that sad day. It could happen to any of us, to our children and grandchildren, anytime, anywhere. It is humbling to read an account written by a young woman whose schooling ended at 5th grade. She had been taught well both by her teachers and her mother. We can never know the impact of the tidbits of information we pass on to our children, students, or neighbors during any ordinary day. Jaycee helps us understand this.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|i loved this movie.  It was not the same old thing.  I love movies with court room drama.  i'm sick to death of the ffff word , explosions, It's nice to watch a movie with some good old dialog.

B0036S4CTS|5.0|I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie.  I purchased it with the expectation that it would just be another \\"Before Sunrise\\".  Boy, was I wrong!      The storyline was so moving, I could not put the book down.  The author's words made me feel like I was in the room with every page I turned (or clicked, in my kindle's case).  Without giving too much of the book, I was not keen on Dex's character.  Don't get me wrong, the author described him very well, I just did not like how he (Dex) was a jerk.  Emma's character was beautifully written, a perfect balance to Dex's arrogant persona.  But, it all made sense.      I loved how each chapter took place on the same day each year, hence the title, and showed the changes each of the characters went through.  And the ending?  Well, I don't want to give that away.  Let's just say that it's pretty typical of any fiction book, slightly predictable, but still a nice twist.      I have yet to see the movie, and though I'm not a fan of the female lead, I pictured her the entire time while reading.  I cannot wait to see it on the silver screen and see the changes they made.  A truly must-read!!!
0553801473|2.0|Overall the series has its ups and downs; and it does inspire mixed emotions.  You climax with emotions.  I've read all 5 books in the last 3-4 months, and somewhere in the middle watched the HBO series.  The author is without a doubt a literary genius. It's obvious that the series does seem to drag out. Especially in books three and four.  Now a days why not make 7 books instead of just 2 or three ($$$). There is no doubt plain as the nose that used to be on Tyrion's face the author has been stalling. Throughout the series you can't help the feeling that there are more questions than answers as you continue reading.  The characters that you once despised you can't help but feel pity for; or should I say secretly cheer for.  Dare I say I had emotions as Cersei was taking her walk of shame. I couldn't help but thinking this would never have happened if Twyin Lannister was still alive.  Or if Tyrion was still the hand of the king.  Martin is definitely a master of suspense.  No doubt he is cleverly manipulating the reader into feeling anger, surprise, suspense, etc.<br /><br />OK back on track this is a review of the 5th book after all. The Author seems to be getting a second wind.  In all honesty I really have learned not to try to predict or hope for anything. JUST READ and enjoy.  I can't recall what I was hoping for from the inception of my adventure in the George R. Martin books.  I think I always wanted the Starks (remaining) to come back together to Winterfell.  Who knows?  The biggest Con of this series and any of its books is the Ocean of characters that actually have depth.  There's only so much time for one or any specific character.  So there's always going to be a feeling that you aren't getting enough of one character or the other.  That's the biggest criticism in this book and entire series.  That and the other small thing, PLOT RESOLUTION PLEASE!  There is none so don't expect any.  All in all these are the type of books that you have great difficultyputting down.  The first book is definitely better than the 5th; however, the 5th book is still quite good.  Anyways \\"in for a penny in for a pound\\".  What are you going to do quit on book number five.  You've already blazed through half of the series...<br /><br /> In all honesty if there where some more plot resolution and less stalling this would outshine the Tolkien series without a doubt.
B005J2UM9S|5.0|This movie was really good.  I am a horror fan who does not care for general slash and gore movies, it has to have some substance to it.  This fit the bill for spooky.  The sound track and quality was good, along with the acting.  The \\"Ghost Investigators\\" bear a striking resemblence to a \\"Ghost Investigation\\" team which is currently airing on PBS.  So, there was some tongue and cheek humor in it, and I found that amusing.  But, for the most part it is a horror movie based on the supernatural and was really scary at times, more so than any other documentary style horror movie that I've seen.  If you have small children please be advised that this movie will give them nighmares!

1451629184|5.0|I was so moved by this book.  As an adult survivor of horrible, violent, repetetive sexual torture as a child, I could empathize with Jaycee Dugards trapped feelings. Although I technically could have run away,  I was not kidnapped as I was living with a parent as an abuser and could have freely gone to the police, I just did not feel that I could.  So I empathized along with Jaycee as she recounted  the events of her life with her captors, yet I think anyone could learn from her. Her survival skills are incredible, going on from day to day just because she had to and later on because she had to live for her girls as she says. This book really makes you value your freedom and your life. Truly inspirational.

0307946711|4.0|I thought the book was good, but I think the editor should have been fired. There were way too many punctuation errors in the dialogue, such as the rule commas and periods ALWAYS go before the ending quotation mark. Although the content of the book was good, it was distracting with all of the errors and there were numerous errors. Someone should have caught the mistakes before it went to publishing. Overall the book was good. I gave it a four out of five stars. It was worth buying.
B005IKZ1B0|2.0|One Love rocked.... it was a great balance of pop, techno, dance and had really nice variety from track to track so it was fun to listen to. For Nothing but the Beat, there seems to be a conscious decision to use the same formula for every track - it gets stale - very quickly. Without You (feat. Usher) is nice. But imo, there is a complete sell to poppy/trashy lyrics \\"atypical\\": Where Them Girls At, Night of your Life, I'm a Machine, I Just Wanna F. type of songs that unless you're 18 and hot to chase tail, this isn't an album for you. Bummer because One Love was such a great work to release crap like this right after is a lost opportunity.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|Of the eight movies I watched this summer: X-Men First Class, Super 8, Pirates of the Caribbean 4, Captain America, Cowboys and Aliens, Transformers 3, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows II, and Green Lantern...Captain America was easily the best. Great effects, great action, great fun. I can't believe it hasn't made more money at the box office than it has. This one was much more enjoyable than the loud, overblown, and seemingly endless Transformers 3. Captain American actually had a storyline and characters you wanted to root for. If there was one movie this summer I would go to the theater to see more than once, it would be Cap.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|Wasting Light is close to, if not, the best album to be released by the veteran rockers. Foo Fighters have no doubt had a fantastic showing over the last 15 years with top-selling album after top-selling album, but Wasting Light comes full circle, masterfully combining elements from all of there previous studio albums, but there's a maturity to Wasting Light that is much more evident than previous projects.    Listening to the album in full, it is hard not to draw comparisons to the band that shone light on the talents of Dave Grohl. Sounds akin to Nirvana and lyrics reminiscent of Kurt Cobain are sprinkled generously throughout. But do not be mistaken, Wasting Light is still a unique and very \\"Fooies\\" experience that I would recommend to anyone.    For anyone who not only enjoys, but appreciates, master songwriting and good honest rockers, buy Wasting Light now! You won't be disappointed!!
0307887898|4.0|Eric Ries presents a radical, innovative way to assess and manage businesses. Do the strategies work? I implemented three different strategies described in the book in my own companies, and I am ecstatically pleased with the results. His ideas provide a highly effective way for any company--large or small--to identify new opportunities through applying the basic components of the scientific method. This allows a company to explore new opportunities in highly scaled ways and then to make reasoned assessments of their value. This is powerful stuff, as I have found out. One of the big secrets is to scale the opportunity, set up hypotheses regarding the change, and (best) develop a means of assessing the value and success of the opportunity. Each of his concepts are accompanied by detailed real-life examples. The book is well organized around Ries's key concepts and provide a very sensible approach that, if implemented accordingly, will result in success. Again, after applying several of the concepts myself, I appreciate the power of these approaches. They work. And I really like the way they work. He definitely is onto something here.    But the reader is left to figure out a lot of the details for implementing the concepts. The \\"how\\" of the approach is all but missing. As a result, the book has more the feeling perhaps of a series of general overview lectures that provide occasional nuggets that an attendee takes home. I want to see many more details (and perhaps fewer examples) of how a business person can set these ideas into motion. More, for example, like the approach used in \\"The Entrepreneurial Mindset.\\"     So I am left highly jazzed about the concepts presented here, but hungry for more detail as an actual user of the concepts. Regardless, the general approach he is advocating is square on the mark. They work and they are powerful.
1250004349|5.0|Sarah's Key is a story that will stay with the reader for a long time. In 1942 the French Police rounded up the Jews in Paris for deportation to camps where they were later put to death.  This horrifying true event is the basis for the story of two women, Sarah who escapes from certain death, and Julia who is determined to write about truth about what happened in France in 1942. Unforgettable.
B004S7VSES|5.0|This is a real good book - well worth the time and money. I don't like to give details, but you won't be disappointed. I highly recommend it.
B001JV5BIA|1.0|Oh, where to begin....    Well ok, the rating. Considering you can't go lower than one star (I would have gone -9001 stars), I give it one. I mean, to consider that this was a Wes Craven film is both horrifying and sickening both at the same time. I mean, you could try to rationalize it in your mind that this was his first and that not all firsts are great. But there's no exceptions with this one!    And please do not get me wrong. I love his other work, I am a major gore-fan, and I've seen my fair share of really gruesome films in my time. However, this takes the cake of worst film I've ever seen in my entire life! And I never thought something could be worse than Brüno.    For such an old film, and the budget it was given to be made, it sure could have turned out better than this. I mean this is absolute rubbish. The music DOES NOT fit in well with this film. I mean really? Did the developers know what kind of horrible fecal matter they were making that they tried to make some kind of light of it by adding the most opposite and hokey music that could EVER be chosen for such a film?    And the acting. Oh my good God! The actor's couldn't have done worse of jobs if they even tried. There's one scene where a main character is being chased by two of the bad guys, and it cuts, and when it comes back to the bad guys they're just sitting there! I mean it looked as though it was between takes and all of a sudden they realized the camera was rolling again and jumped up to continue!    Another scene includes the mother and father of a teenage daughter criticizing the way she's dressed. I won't go into details, however in a nutshell, in no way would a normal father get at a specific detail of how his daughter is about to go out into public. If anything, most typical american fathers usually leave this kind of business to the mother.    And the police in this film! There would NEVER be such stupidity, in not investigating a suspicious looking vehicle, obviously unrecognizedas being local, instead declaring that they're too busy for such matter! I mean, HELLO? There's reports of escaped convicts all over the radio and any form of news, and there's a suspicious looking car sitting right outside of this family's home in the middle of nowhere??    This is such a bad film. I mean this is almost like if you took the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and added carnival music and a bunch of clowns as the local police force jumping through flaming hoops while Leatherface is bashing the first character in the head with his mallet!    And the name of it. Last House On The Left. Really? I mean, the ONLY frigging house even in this film is situated in the middle of frigging nowhere!! How the flipping hell is it the last one, let alone on ANY side of what??    It's as bad as if you took Saw, and made something out of Hello Kitty dance and run all around with a huge grin saying \\"HI!!\\" to everyone in the film!    Really just do yourself a favor, and avoid this at all costs if you EVER come across this piece of garbage! I found my copy at Wal Mart for $5. That's five dollars that I took a match to and burned. I mean, even if you get so curious that you think it wouldn't hurt just to see it once.... Do NOT! If you must, go to wikipedia and read the plot, or go to imdb. Using your imagination is not recommended, however if the temptation is so bad that you want to see or read this, please for the love of all that is divine, do NOT watch this pile of goat vomit!    If you really need the best horror flick for your annual Halloween film night, or just for the hell of it want something to scare the hell out of you, please do NOT even consider this one! I know that this won't be ready by every person in the world, however those that do come to amazon and read reviews, spread the word that this is a HORRIBLE film!!

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Sorry George. We finally have to part ways. And it's not me. It's you. You've gone one unnecessary change too far for me, and seemingly for a lot of others. So no, I'm not buying this or any other release of these films until you release the original unaltered versions in an acceptable format. And a 4:3 letterbox transfer is NOT an acceptable format. So until that happens, I'm done. Goodbye.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Erasing cinematic history?  No thank you.  There are enough reviews stating similar points of view, but until the original versions get proper treatment, no thanks.
B003GYEGNO|5.0|Tom Wolfe's books always impress me, and The Bonfire of the Vanities is definitely one of his best works, studying American culture and human behavior through the lens of a criminal trial in New York City.    Sherman McCoy is the main character of the book, but the book also follows the Bronx assistant District Attorney and a newspaper reporter, whose fates intertwine with Sherman's after he is entrenched in the court case. Interestingly, the only true protagonists in the book, the Lamb family, are the only ones who do not get much time on the page beyond the initial accident. They become mere pawns in a much bigger game of egos, where justice is served (or not served) only based on personal gain or loss. The true fate of the Lamb family is hardly relevant to anyone.    Wolfe brilliantly weaves an engaging story, and his prose are crystal clear and entertaining. The plot is enjoyable on the surface level, but the ramifications of everyone's actions will leave a reader thinking for days following the conclusion of this book. I definitely recommend this to anyone.

I don't watch the original trilogy too often, maybe once a year. And I usually get bored with it after Jabba's palace and turn it off. But ya know what? The sound may be a little scratchy, and sometimes the tracking has to be tweaked a bit, but at least Han shoots first. And there is no horrid CGI Jabba in the hangar bay. And all those wonderful memories of my childhood are still intact. Sorry old friend, but ya did it to yourself. Consider this a divorce.
B005COO1X6|3.0|\\"Mile 81\\" is the first original short story Stephen King has written for the Kindle, and it's also a return to the kind of horror story that he used to write before he got famous.  The story has very pulpy roots, and the action is something that - along with the short length - that encourages reading it in a single sitting.<br /><br />Pete, the main protagonist of the story, stands out as one of those kids that Stephen King likes to write about:  the very worldly and innocent at the same time kind of kid.  Probably very much like the kind of pre-teen that King himself was.<br /><br />Pete comes alive on the pages and that's pretty enjoyable, but those initial pages eat up a lot of story space.  The narrative tension led me to expect that something in the abandoned Burger King would leap out and get him, and that isn't what happens at all.  Then Pete kind goes MIA throughout the rest of the story till the very end, popping back on stage just in time to save the day and preventing more adult death.<br /><br />The other scenes with less fortunate characters are well done the way King always renders those people, but they are an investment that is quickly in actual story time.<br /><br />By the time Pete reappears and saves the day, I was actually hoping to see more of the station wagon/monster.  At least enough to figure out what it really was and how it was so easily vanquished.  King does really well with things that are spooky and mysterious, but this scenario felt like it just sort of played out at the end.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Mile 81\\" kept my attention, but the story was like a snack that didn't quite fill me up before it was gone.  I'm viewing the story more as a fungo (a baseball practice term for hitting high, easy ones for outfielders to practice on) and that King will return later with something with more meat on the bone.  And something ferocious to gnaw it off.
B0034G4OXQ|1.0|I was stunned to learn after the fact that this ponderous, insipid, clunky, disjointed, irrelevant, ill-conceived, and tepid film was directed by Clint Eastwood. WHAT WAS HE THINKING!!!! Not only will you completely waste an evening trying to watch this, but there is absolutely NO PAYOFF here. No answers, no final revelation, no deep insight. 60% of this should've been left on the cutting room floor. The rest should've been thrown out. Then we would've arrived at the real meaning of it all: Deep Peace.
1463514581|5.0|Wow what a completly swoon-worthy book!! I haven't read a book that made me swoon as much as this book since Anna and and the French Kiss by Stephanie Perkins. Both books kept me up til the wee hours of the morning, simply because I was so enthralled in the story that I couldn't put it down. The main character Rose Gardner is a completly sheltered 24 year old girl, so when her over-bearing mother is mysteriously murdered, she decides that it's time she lives her life, but not until she see's a vision that she's going to do in less than a week does she really push to live her last 28 and a half wishes, that she wrote on the back of a Walmart reciept.<br /><br />Her mysteriously handsome next door neighbor Joe helps her fufill this dreams she has, but also have some secrets of his own, which might lead to what really happened to Rose's momma. This book is full of twists and turns, and OMG I didn't see THAT happening moments and I loved it!! Rose is such a loveable character, and her nieve and shelteredness makes her unique and a quite powerful character. She grows dramatically within the pages of this book and Denise Grover Swank takes you along for the ride. This book has it all mystery, intrique, and a lot of swoon-worthy romance. I loved it, this book def. topped my favorite books of 2011 list, and Denise Grover Swank is now an autobuy author for me, meaning whatever she writes, I will buy! You def. need to get your hands on this book, I promise you won't be disappointed.

0061784788|5.0|The Devil Colony is another entry in James Rollins's adrenaline-charged Sigma Force series that combines derring-do and historic conspiracy theory platforms.  This book comes after the first short story about a one-time villainess of the books came out earlier this year and ties into that tale.<br /><br />For the first time, Rollins opens his Pandora's Box of trouble and twisted history here in the United States, and it's pretty amazing to see what he can do with the legacy of the Founding Fathers and the Fourteenth Colony.  As a history major, I love the details he winds into the tale, but I also know that the author is having a good time bending and twisting things to suit his story ever so slightly.<br /><br />Interestingly enough, Sigma Force's Director, Painter Crowe (many of the members tend to have unusual names, but that makes them distinctive) takes center stage in this adventure.  Grayson Pierce backs up the investigative efforts while struggling with his own personal family problems.  Crowe embraces his Native American roots and long-time readers get to see a different side of him than has been presented so far.<br /><br />Kowalski, another team favorite, ends up working directly with Crowe, and it's fun to watch how they get along.  But the real team that everyone has been waiting on is Gray and Seichan, the female assassin and terrorist that has been on the other side of the table from Sigma Force during earlier books.<br /><br />Rollins treats all of these characters like family, and readers get the chance to see them grow and go through harsh changes.  Like the addition of Monk's baby in this novel.  The books are a lot like sitting down and listening to the stories of friends and family, getting to catch up on all the news as the pages turn.<br /><br />The villain this time out is pretty fascinating as well, and he turns out to be more of a James Bond villain than ever before due to his strange medical condition - as well as the relationship he has with his second-in-command.  The ending of this novel presents that villain - as well as the ones that have come before - in a new light.  The twist/revelation at the end is going to have fans anxiously awaiting the next book in the series.<br /><br />The Devil Colony starts out with a bang and rushes through to a climax with clues, twists, historical facts, and bone-crunching action.  Rollins continues to mimic the back-and-forth chapter progression of the old pulp writers like Edgar Rice Burroughs, swinging wildly between three or four different plot lines, constantly ending the scenes on cliffhangers that force the reader on at an all-or-nothing pace.<br /><br />Don't start this one unless you have the time to sit down and read it from cover to cover.f this novel presents that villain - as well as the ones that have come before - in a new light.

B0053Q9DHW|4.0|That's what I have after watching this dvd twice: a decidedly mixed reaction. Like many other reviewers, I'm a die-hard Jane Eyre fan, having read the book too many times to count and seen at least 6 film adaptations (I think there have been at least 8). This dvd is the 5th I've added to my collection, which my children find absolutely hilarious. But anyway, I wanted to see this one at the theater but it was only in my hometown for about a week, so I ordered it as soon as Amazon had it. I guess I should just lay out my pros and cons and let the chips fall where they may.<br /><br />Pros: The casting is possibly the best of any version I've seen. Mia Whatchamacallit (sorry, can't remember her name right now) was 21 when the film was shot, making her about the right age to play Jane. All the other versions I've seen cast actresses who were well past their teen years, so it was good to see a more-age-approriate Jane. She also did a nice job with the role, expressing shades of emotion in her face since her lines are frankly rather limited. Michael Fassbender is honestly too young (34) and too good-looking (he was the smokin' hot warrior Stelios in 300) but does a very good job inhabiting the character of Rochester. He's very gruff with just the right hint of humor to make Rochester the irritating but somehow intriguing guy he is. The other roles were also well-cast. Judi Dench is always amazing, and Jamie Bell (though not as handsome as St.John should be, imho) was appropriately stern. The cinematography of the movie is just lovely. I really liked the lighting. Everything at Gateshead is sunlit and colorful, belying the hellish existence Jane endures there. Lowood school is spare and colorless, and Thornfield is mostly lighted from underneath with the only light falling on the characters seeming to come from candles and fireplaces. This creates an air of mystery and confusion as the viewer can never really get a good enough view of the place to even be sure of its layout. I liked the notion of starting the story with Jane's escape from Thornfield and the rest being told in flashback, but I can't say if that would be confusing to someone unfamiliar with the story or not.<br /><br />Cons: I suppose nobody could condense this huge novel into a 2 hour movie and not leave out something I thought was important, but I felt too many details were omitted. Jane's character development as well as that of the relationship between Jane and Rochester were dealt with so quickly that they lost some of the depth of emotion they should have had. The conclusion of the film occurs so abruptly that I got a bit angry. It was sort of a \\"You've got to be kidding!\\" reaction that it just suddenly ended without what I thought was adequate closure. Some scenes, such as Jane's flight over the moors, were lovely but rather long, and I found myself wishing some of those scenes had been cut to give more scenes that \\"fleshed out\\" the story.<br /><br />So my mixed reaction still allows me to recommend the movie. I think it is a good and respectful adaptation of one of my favorite novels as well as a visually lovely film with a solid cast.ed the notion of starting the story with Jane's escape from Thornfield and the rest being told in flashback, but I can't say if that would be confusing to someone unfamiliar with the story or not.

B004EPYZQM|2.0|Spoiler!        So just like in any other fast and the furious movies they have stunts and what not that you know a car wouldn't hold up, and wouldn't be drivable after it happen. But the were on the border line believable which made it awesome. Just did some of that movie magic stuff just like in any other movie. In this furious movie it was different. it was good from the start wasn't great just good. Had the normal stunts type stuff cool story line, and seem to have a twist to it different from the other movies, but then there was the last seen. The last stunt. It just totally ruined the whole movie or me.     In the movie the say it's a 10 ton safe or some outrageous number. That's 20,000lbs. Also it's concreted into the wall of a building so it might as well be 100 tons. A peterbuilt semi might be able to get it to move, maybe just maybe, but 2 dodge chargers with hemis are not even going to budge it. I doubt the differential would even hold up, also you would need something a lot heavier then a 2 ton car, a couple of muscle cars doesn't even come close to having enough torque/horsepower/weight to move it. No matter what engine mods you did to it, even if they were four wheel drive it still wouldn't have enough grip, power, strength to move it. A dodge truck with the 5.9 cummins in it wouldn't even have enough, and that makes more torque then the chargers could ever even think about.       I understood it was a movie also the other movie had \\"fake\\" stuff in it just like any movie does, but they made it seem like it could possibly happen, but when they had those 10 ton safes were whipping around on the road like they were ten cans that was just stupid. Defies all laws of physics period. I probably won't even buy the movie even though I own all the other ones.     Now saying the stunt could happen. Say they did pull the safes out of the wall with a couple of dodge chargers.     For anyone who has towed anything that weighs more then what the vehicle towing it weighs. The trailer normally ends up controlling your car and you not controlling your vehicle. It'll pull you all over the road and everything else. Unless you just got like five miles an hour to your destination. Now these cars are just whipping these 20 ton safes around like they are tin cans, and it doesn't even come close to pulling their car in a direction they don't want it to.    The whole thing was just bogus and ruined the whole fast and the furious movie for me...      Now if you can get over the fact of simple physics, and don't look too much into that then you would probably like the movie.

0375842209|5.0|I gotta say, it's quite the read. I was initially caught off guard by the narrator as it's, (y'all ready for this!) DEATH. Yup, that's right. And it's awesome!<br /><br />Narration aside, The Book Thief is the story of a girl, her foster family and the Jewish boxer they have hidden in the basement as they struggle to survive in Nazi Germany. Zusak's writing is AMAZING! Can this guy turn a phrase inside out! Yet, his meanings are clear and concise. Not easy to do. But Markus Zusak pulls it off beautifully. This would be a great book club selection.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|No matter what kind of outcry George Lucas hears regarding changes he makes to the Star Wars films, his defense is that these films are his property to alter as he sees fit and is under no obligation to preserve the original releases. I'm writing this review to argue that this isn't the case. Before there was ever the ability to digitally alter any of the Star Wars films, George Lucas became a very rich man. Where did all this wealth come from? It came from the audience. As the audience we are the unofficial shareholders in LucasFilm LTD. As children we bought tickets to the films and bought toys to re-live the adventures we had seen. As adults we purchased many copies of the films for each format as it became avalible. With every dollar we told George Lucas that we loved these films and would continue to love them. At some point George Lucas turned on us. He stopped caring about what audience wanted and only paid attention to the money we gave him. He used the money to slowly destroy the films we all have loved since we were children. Enough is enough. I won't purchase another altered version of these beloved films just so that the money can fund the next version of the film that Lucas releases. Those original films weren't created in a bubble. They showcased the talents of hundreds of artists and film makers that set out to change the way science fiction films were made. George Lucas would be nothing without these people. I will no longer support the destruction of their contribution to one of the greatest film series of all time. Enough is enough.

1932907009|5.0|\\"Story\\" by Robert McKee takes the car apart down to the last nut and bolt and lays out all the parts on the warehouse floor. \\"Screenplay\\" by Syd Field shows how the thing runs. Save The Cat raises my hopes of actually taking a road trip.     I actually believe that Save the Cat is \\"Story for Dummies.\\" Snyder attended McKee's seminar and digested his encyclopedia, then came up with more practical, humorous names for the technical terms in Story. He even dares to disagree with Robert on at least one key point, but since Blake Snyder has written and sold dozens of screenplays I'm okay with that.     My only reservation is Snyder's assumption that the reader wants to move to Hollywood and make a lot of money. If you would be just as happy paying the crew and actors and making a modest return on your very own independent film, then buy it and read it through the indie filmmaker grid.      Of course, if you are the kind of screenwriter who sings in the choir Blake is preaching to, then just buy the book and read it.     Either way, \\"Save the Cat\\" will steer you in the right direction.

B003UD7JEE|5.0|Let me start by saying that I love this show. The acting is great for the most part. Resistance, Coup De Grace, Covenants, Betrayals and Pandora are the best episodes in my opinion. The writing is good. The plot twists revealed throughout the season had me giddy for the next revalation. The action sequences are well choreographed and look good. Xander Berkeley is great in his role as Percy. He plays it with a cool, calm demeanor perfectly. Maggie Q was born to play this type of role. She is great in the intense sequences. Shane West is great as well. Every actor is good in their own right. Those are just my personal picks. The show is great, and I look forward to the second season. The only problem I have is with the number of features, and a problem with disc 5. There is no gag reel for the DVD version. That is what I would have most wanted to see. I can live with that though as the show is amazing. A major problem though is that my 5th disc came with scratches already on it. I have had it for only three days now, and just used it on the second day and out of the box there were scratches. Another thing is the finale has a section that skips. In about the middle of the episode playback will just stop, and a few seconds later skip to further in the eppisode. This same thing happened on the first making of documentary. I just thought I would warn other customers about this. It could be due to the scratches, but I did not cause them so it could be on all of the 5th discs in this set. Thanks for reading. I hope that I helped in your decision making.

0307454541|1.0|I don't even know where to begin with this book. I was told by numerous people that this is an \\"amazing series\\" and that I just need to get past the first 4 chapters that are very boring, dry background information. It literally took me all summer to get past the first 4 chapters and.... IT NEVER GOT BETTER! I made it about 3/4 of the way through and was so bored that I just quit reading. I typically read 1 to 3 books a week and I spent an entire summer trying to force myself to read this book. I have only read one book since I gave up on this one!

B000006TRV|5.0|I've been reading all of the reviews. And personally, I think I've gained just one thing. MUSIC IS A TOUCHY SUBJECT. Almost everyone can relate to music in some way, and because of that, that is why there are so many types of music. Personally, I couldn't care less for Bob Marley and all the reggae. But some of my friends worship that music. Diversity is the key.     Pink Floyd is one of those bands that isn't, simply, just a band. Pink Floyd is a band that is also an inspiration. Now on here, you have reviews, which are ultimately opinions. Of course you're going to get your handful of  `This Sucks' or `This Bites' or `Don't waste your money on this trash.' But to be honest? If that's all you are going to write, then don't waste your finger strength typing a review.     This album is a very good example of diversity. It's pure rock. It's like when you heard your first Eagles song, or your first Beatles song. It's just like that. Once you hear it, you are addicted. You may grow out of it, it may be a phase.. But it also might not be.  `The Wall' was like that, for me. I actually listened to the title track first. `The Wall' was such a weird song, I thought at first. I had downloaded it unknowingly, thinking it was a different song by a different artist. But I took the time and listened past the odd, flowing, and yet kind of unexplainable lyrics and sounds at the beginning. Then I realized that it wasn't just weird words. It was BEAUTIFUL<3.    If you have ever heard an Electronica song  (you know, the fast beats and repetitive, yet kind of cool noises with barely any words?) you know how it feels to be listening to sounds--and the few words that Electronica songs have-- and kind of be overwhelmed. I think one Amazonian said it best when he/she said `One listen just isn't enough'. Well, it's true. One listen isn't enough. My love for the band Pink Floyd started with `Against The Wall, Part 2'. I asked my dad, who of course, knows more about Classic Rock than anyone Iknow, told me it was `The Wall'. And of course, now that I know the real title, I'd say it's an easy mistake to make. But I searched for `The Wall' and ended up getting `The Wall', or, the title track. I love this album. As it would be old, and tiring, and repetitive to do paragraph after paragraph about the likes and dislikes of each song, like some people did in their reviews, I am not doing it. If you want to see what they are like, and see what you think of them, go right ahead, you'll see the nice little song list up farther on the page. It would be judgmental and selfish of me to give MY opinions of each song, and even more annoying if you'd listen to them. So since you are the one buying, listen to them yourself.    I am [...], and I am a girl. So go ahead right now, tell me I don't know anything about music, tell me I'm SOOOO wrong. But really? It isn't what one thinks of the music that makes the review. It's what everyone thinks, compiled, and sorted so you can really make your own decision.
B0055CJ8T2|2.0|I swear i listened to it three times, knowing id start to like this record. But no, i was really disapointed.    Mostly because some of her recent singles, like \\"Grown Woman\\", \\"Rose Colored Glasses\\", \\"Forever and a Day\\", which were all beatifully written, AMAZING songs, werent featured on here...  I mean, why have \\"Motivation\\" and \\"Commander\\" on here if you wont include the other songs? it made the album feel a little empty...    Anyways, that aside, I wasnt pleased with the variety.  With a voice like Ms. Rowland's, the producers had the chance to combine all different styles onto this album, like dance (commander) hip hop (im that chick) and soul (feelin me right now) but these genres turned into one or two select tracks. This album gets really boring after a while, practically every song sounds the same: whited out, bubblegum, simple sex-driven cuts.    Oh yeah, whats with all the annoying collaborations?! only three songs out of the WHOLE album (ten tracks) are solo. Sure, David Guetta, Lil Wayne, and the Wavs made nice cameos that spiced up the tunes, but seriously? all these rappers (that sound so damn similar) keep the tracks sounding even more similar. C'mon! give Kelly the spotlight! She has a great talent and voice that could fire big hits, she doesnt need all these guest appearances!!!    Overall, the album was...boring. Please dont hate me, im really open minded about music, and all the songs here were worthy on some level. But, this CD will collect dust on my shelf. Its good for a few gems (Motivation, All of the Night, Keep It Between Us, Commander, Down For Whatever). But listening through the whole thing is somewhat of a generic experince. (Grade: C+)

I fell to the pressures of conformity and gave up my long held dreams and goals because others felt I needed to \\"be real.\\"     I'm grateful for this book.  It's awakened in myself the old me, the one who dreamed as a kid of limitless possibilities, who thought nothing was impossible, who thought I could have and could do whatever I set out to do, who thought the cubicle life was for drones and unhappy people.     I\\"m a grown man who has been moved to tears by the author's warm, sensible comments.    I think he's given me the final push, permission to be the person I used to be and the person I've always wanted to be.  My life is changing!      My new favorite book.
0553801473|3.0|I was glued to every word of the first 3 books in the series. With Feast and Dance, I found myself rarely captivated.<br /><br />In fact, to make it through both of these books, I had to do the following in each chapter:<br /><br />1. Read the first few pages, until the author starts rambling. The rambling usually consists of<br />  painfully meticulous descriptions of places and food, long internal reveries of scenes from<br />  the prior books or lengthy introductions of new characters both minor and boring.<br /><br />2. Skip to the last paragraph in the chapter and capture what I need, as the plot inches sluggishly forward.<br /><br />I'm not accustomed to suffering through books in this way, especially when it comes to pleasure reading.<br />If I find myself doing the same in the next book, I'm giving up the series sooner rather than later...
B003ZSJ212|1.0|***EDIT***  Ok, fine I bought the 6 movie set (used). The things that looked awful on YouTube still are. Star Wars (A New Hope) and Jedi suffer the most.  The new HD transfer really reveals how badly done Jar Jar is in the Phantom Menace. He looks like an \\"in-progress\\" shot of an effect that will be added later. It's especially bad on Naboo. None of the bizarre \\"there's an entire city under this medium sized lake\\" stuff was fixed. Yoda looks MUCH better.  Attack of the Clones is still terrible.  Revenge of the Sith looks amazing. The acting still lets the movie down until the last half.  For all the movies the sound and picture quality is really very good. A New Hope seems most improved in that regard. Jedi and Revenge of the Sith have the best picture quality of the 6. All the movies have sound the was reworked considerably. Most of the changes are for the better.  Having Said all of that. The needless and poorly executed changes to the movie really spoil what would have been an amazing set. Why waste so much time and effort looping in bad dialog or adding rocks that vanish for no reason? Most of the simple FX changes/upgrades work, and have since Lucas first started all this \\"tinkering\\". None of the story changes have worked. Han shot first because he was a pirate and a smuggler. That's why his transformation into a hero was so powerful. He wasn't mean, but he wasn't above shooting a guy either. The Jabba the Hutt we meet in Jedi is a \\"Vile Gangster\\". The Jabba Lucas shoehorned into that unused scene in A new Hope is a guy you can literally step on. Now Darth Vader has been diminished just a bit because Lucas didn't trust the power of the original scene.  *** End of EDIT***  Tinker with the films all you want George, just don't make them worse. Also, why not allow people to watch the unaltered versions -- they are classic pieces of cinematic history. After seeing the previews I'm not interested in seeing the new alterations to the film. They seem to range from pointless to terrible. Adding new space ships or correcting old compositing issues or color timing is one thing -- weakening pivotal character moments is another.

0061914177|5.0|I read Crush It! shortly after leaving a 17 year career in finance to focus on several entrepreneurial pursuits.  The timing of reading Gary V.'s book could not have been better.  In this short book, he paints a vivid picture of the new economy and the opportunities that abound.  He then provides some very specific strategies on how to build a social media presence, and eventually how to monetize it.  Putting many of Gary V.'s ideas into action, our business has been expanding at 30% a year in a stagnant economy.<br /><br />I am such a fan of this book that I recommend it it to many of my clients and friends who have not yet taken the plunge into the new economy.<br /><br />While some critics of the book have claimed that Gary V. is too opinionated or merely self-promoting, I entirely disagree.  I enjoyed his candid discussion, and thank Gary V. for compressing high-quality content into just 100 pages of hard-hitting, actionable content!

B0051MKNV8|5.0|My expectations were low for this, and so maybe I am over-rating it, but I was very pleasantly surprised. I was glued to my seat the entire time, and appreciated the unique storyline, in a sea of predictable alien/robot/superhero action films. Bradley Cooper plays a down-and-out writer, actually a bit of a loser that can't quite get it together, who stumbles upon a new off-the-market drug that maximizes brain potential to such a degree that he (and other who have possession of it) can completely transform their lives. He becomes a 'master of the universe' - first writing his long-delayed book in 4 days, and then turning his sights to the financial markets. The action involves his battles with others trying to steal his stash of drugs, his attempts to understand the side-effects, and to figure out how to extend his limited supply. In the meantime, he is attempting to impress Robert DeNiro who plays a financial king, as part of his path to wealth and power.<br /><br />This is really the first time I have taken any real notice of Bradley Cooper, and I think he does a great job here. He is better suited for quirky, somewhat twisted roles like this one than standard leading man roles I think. Robert DeNiro is always fun to watch, and the supporting cast does what they need to do.<br /><br />There were minor weaknesses in the plot - how did Cooper's loser writer character ever get a book contract? Why isn't there some kind of adjustment period to achieving maximum brain potential? How is this drug kept secret except to a very few? etc. But overall, it delivers action, is not predictable, and Bradley Cooper gives it his all, so I think it deserves a 5-star rating.
B0018QOIXU|3.0|I was pleased with the shipping. The cd was purchased new and came packaged so. It was definitely worth it. The cd itself left me a little disappointed. I enjoyed \\"21\\" better. However, there are a few good songs so it was still worth the purchase!

B004O7EVLY|5.0|Upon walking in to a record store a couple of years ago, I couldn't help but think that the music they were playing on the PA was refreshingly awesome and in the simplest terms what rock should be. After two songs I asked who it was and bought Graveyard's first album.     I was extremely excited to hear about the release of their second album and it exceeded my expectations. One is instantly hit by various influences such as Deep Purple, Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin. It is undeniable that this is a revival of classic British metal sounds, with heavy riffs coupled with the clear influence of blues, while also drawing on the sounds of more contemporary bands and an eclectic spectrum of influence, such as old spaghetti westerns in 'Longing' and the obvious homage to Pink Floyd in the title 'Uncomfortably Numb'.    'Hisingen Blues' has shown a maturing of the band and once you play it once through, you won't be able to stop. One can only think that the next album will be even better.    It's best to listen to this very very loud.
B004EPYZP8|3.0|I found this overall to be just so-so. On the plus side, the story is interesting, a justice system whodunit with a fair number of unexpected twists. Matthew McConaughey plays a hustling defense attorney who at first seems to possess no scruples, but who soon emerges as much more complex. Ryan Phillipe is his rich playboy client, who initially proclaims his innocence, but of course doubt prevails. Marisa Tomei co-stars as McConaughey's ex-wife who is also a prosecutor, and William Macy as his investigator.<br /><br />The main problem with the movie for me was the writing, particularly the dialogues. Most of the conversations feel very artificial, and rushed - the story is at pains to fit in all the twists I think, and so each scene revolves around the information it is meant to convey, as opposed to being driven by character or realism. In that it felt a bit like an extended Law and Order episode, rather than a high- level feature film. The characters felt thin for the same reason, particularly the Marisa Tomei and William Macy characters - both fine actors who are completely under/mis- used here. Matthew McConaughey and Ryan Phillipe both felt a bit wooden to me, even when they were angry, also probably partly due to the writing.<br /><br />So story is OK, writing and acting so-so, just a 3-star film for me.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|Born This Way is an album that seems to speak directly to my soul. Within every song I recognize a part of myself, a part of my generation. Gaga did an amazing job writing songs that speak to youth today, addressing the problems we face, the insecurities we have to deal with and the struggle of self discovery that each of us must go through. This album reminds us that it's okay to stand out and that if we're not happy with who we are in this moment, that we can continue to grow and change until we become the person we've always wanted to be. Fantastic album from start to finish, thank you Gaga.
B0043GXYBO|3.0|My Rating: 3.5 / 5    What I thought about it:  Marked takes a few YA clichés and combines them in a fast-paced and cute read. We get some of the usual and some new vampire aspects, a boarding school and some surprises, which results in a story that is easy to read and leaves room for the need to read more.    Ever since Twilight, vampires have been everywhere in literature, which was nice at first but could get tiring after a while. After having read many vampire stories it takes a lot to surprise me and to get me hooked on a story like that. While Marked has some of the typical YA boarding school clichés like the nice roommate, the pretty but mean blonde girl and the hot guy who - surprisingly - is the ex-boyfriend of said mean girl.    But overall the new approach of vampires could cancel out those clichés and made it more special. When you become a vampire, you aren't bitten but marked with a crescent moon on your forehead. To change into a vampire, you have to visit a school (House of Night) and the scariest thing is: Your body might reject the change and you might die.    I have to admit that the story started out a little bit slow, so in the end this novel really looks more like an introduction into this series. Most of the secondary characters are lacking some depth and are reduced to a few character traits, but I hope that this will change in the future novels.    Actually I have a similar \\"problem\\" with the love interest. While Erik is an incredibly hot guy and at first he appears like someone very likeable, I'm still not quite sure what to think about him. His interest in Zoey came quite fast and I couldn't really detect any development in their attraction. Therefore I'm curious to find out what will happen to them.    All in all, Marked was an enjoyable read and I'm looking forward to see how the storyline will develop. A lot of questions still need to be answered and I'm sure it could get even more interesting. Zoey is a likeable main character and I'm sure that I will like the next story told from her point of view as well.

0553801473|5.0|Don't be discouraged by the negative reviews.  It's just a bunch of fans who have waited so anxiously that anything less than perfection would be worth 0 stars.  Is this a great book?  Yes.  It fits perfectly with the others and is a much more complete edition to the story than the last book.  Does the plot line advance?  Absolutely.  Does it resolve all of the numerous issues that these fans want resolved?  No.  That will have to wait until the next book, but does not mean you should not read it!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|With a pack consisting of 6 movies one should expect that we actually get 6 movies.. However.. considering the changes that has been made since 1977 to the original 3 movies they can hardly be considered included in this release..    Absolutely not recommended.
0545259088|5.0|My Rating: 5.0 / 5    What I thought about it:  I rarely cry when I'm reading a book, but Forever put tears in my eyes and made me feel every single emotion it wanted to convey. It was tragic and then it was beautiful and I'm so sad to see this series come to an end. Maggie Stiefvater's writing was simply amazing and I wish there were a 1000 pages more for me to read. It's one of those books that stays with you and doesn't want you to pick up another one immediately afterwards.    What I loved most about Forever was to watch those lovely characters develop while they also stayed true to themselves. Often characters change completely with nothing of their old selves left behind, but it's different here. They face their problems and their fears, learn new things and become grown-up versions of themselves. The same goes for all the unresolved issues with their parents that are somehow resolved.    Again, this story is told from four different points of view: Sam and Grace, Cole and Isabel. And while all of these characters are so completely different, it's still great to see how they feel, what they think and it's easy to follow the story. I don't want to leave them behind.    I have heard of people who didn't like the ending, because it was too open for them. And to be honest, I usually despise open endings, but with Forever it somehow worked for me. Don't ask me why, because I normally I need closure, something definite that doesn't leave me hanging, but I don't think that there could be a better ending for Forever. It leaves a certain aspect to the reader's imagination although it's not hard to guess what almost everyone will be imagining.    And maybe, just maybe, it might give Maggie Stiefvater an excuse to return to this world one day. But that could be only my hopeful imagination, because I'm really sad to watch this series come to an end.    All in all, Forever was a wonderful conclusion to an incredible series. If you liked the first two books, don't hesitateand pick this up. And if you haven't even started this series yet, please do so. It's fantastic and I'm happy I read it. I can't wait to read more novels by Maggie Stiefvater like The Scorpio Races, which will be released on October 18th.

B0056BMK6K|5.0|This book is short enough to get through in a couple of hours and gain several years worth of knowledge if you had to learn it the hard way. The info is all there but that doesn't mean everyone who reads the book will have the ability to make use of it. You will have to be a fairly clever writer to implement the stratagies but they do make perfect sense. Even if I don't shoot to the top of the best seller lists I will count the information in this book to be the best I've seen and will have only my own work to blame if it doesn't work.

B004V8W54Q|4.0|The film Brazil itself is one of my favorites, and easily deserves five stars: If you haven't seen the movie, go read some of those glowing and well-deserved five-star reviews to learn why you really ought to. I'm docking a star exclusively from the Universal BluRay edition. (Incidentally, Amazon: It would be nice if we had the option of star-rating the work and the release separately.)<br /><br />The audio and visual quality are generally quite good, though there's visible dirt and grain in a surprising number of frames. What's especially striking, though, is the absence of any special features--in sharp contrast to the abundance of bonus material available on the Criterion releases, above all Terry Gilliam's audio commentary and the \\"making of\\" documentary. Moreover, while I actually prefer this original U.S. theatrical version (with the proper ending--not that \\"Love Conquers All\\" travesty) to Gilliam's longer director's cut, I was surprised that the missing scenes (about ten minutes' worth of additional material) from that version were not available on this release in any form. Maybe I've just been spoiled by Criterion, but since nothing on the disk itself hints at which of the many versions you're getting, I had wrongly assumed the viewer would have at least the option of seeing the longer version.<br /><br />That said, this release does substantially improve upon the audio and visual quality of the DVD edition, and serious fans of the movie will certainly want to pick it up. The quality difference is enough that I'd probably still recommend BluRay player owners opt for this over the more feature-rich DVD releases, all things considered, if it's going to be one or the other. But a really definitive edition--with the film imperfections cleaned up and some of the added features that modern movie buyers have come to expect with a home video release--has yet to be produced, alas.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|I knew nothing about this movie before I bought it.  All I knew is that it came highly regarded, was based on a Roald Dahl children's book, featured George Clooney, and was a creation of Wes Anderson.  With that combination, anything can happen.  So, I gave it a whirl.<br /><br />When people talk about art, what makes good art is something that affects you in a way that nothing else ever has.  That is what this movie is.  Like mismatching wallpaper, or sacarine tastes, this movie will make you taste something that you have never tasted before, and see color and object combinations that your eyes have never seen together.  So, like excellent bitter coffee, at first you'll wince, and then you'll ask for more.<br /><br />Now, I have to say, I'm not exactly sure that this movie, despite being an animated movie, is for young children.  There are some scenes of questionable nature that I would wait until my child was at least in their tweens before I let them watch it.  But that's just me.<br /><br />Just so that you know what it is about, the first 1/3 of the movie is about the main character, Mr. Fox - a daredevil, wise-cracking, and stubborn local fox, who used to live a life of stealing chickens - settling down with his adorable mate - once she announces that she is pregnant with their first child.  It fast-forwards a couple years, to show him plotting a way to get back into the chicken-stealing business without his mate finding out.  Sort of like living the old days.<br /><br />The second 2/3 of the movie is all about those repercussions - as he takes on three vicious and vengeful farmers all at the same time.  They (all the main characters of adorable local fauna) spend the last hour trying to outsmart the farmers in a tit-for-tat game of one-up-manship.<br /><br />The story is good.  The animation, visuals, and sound are excellent.  The interaction and character play is awesome.  All trademarks of a Wes Anderson movie done with the best of the best talent in actors and techinical people that we have.<br /><br />About what I said above about it might not be suitable to younger ages, if you saw \\"Chicken Run\\" from the early 2000s, then this movie is very much like it.  You have a fox who is trying to kill chickens, turkey, and other prey, while the farmers are trying to kill him.  So, while there is slaughter, it happens off-screen, but it still happens.  Just sayin'.About what I said above about it might not be suitable to younger ages, if you saw \\"Chicken Run\\" from the early 2000s, then this movie is very much like it.

B004Y1USJE|1.0|This sad effort to defy the inevitable and bow out gracefully at the top of your game seems to find Yes needing more money or something like that because they are turning out subpar compositions that are well very mediocre at best.I don't think you can find a more loyal fan who has followed them since the begining of their careers and loves their music as much as I do so for me these comments are a realization that the time to retire is now. If you have any doubt just listen to a live video of this album on You Tube if you are like me you will be surprised by the passionless and lackluster performance by the members and especially the new lead singer whose range live leaves a lot to be desired. I don't ever remember Jon Anderson struggling to hit any notes in fact he was often better than his studio counterpart as I have seen them many times over several different tours.The new tour is different totally they all looked like they escaped from a nusing home and they had to leave their walkers and wheelchairs behind. The best part of this album is the cover by Roger Dean which is in his trademark brillance as usual.It is undeniable that Jon Anderson was the creative energy and force behind the bands most accommplished works he virtually created the Yes sound single handedly and by that I mean at the peak of their musical evolution as musicians and artists.The difference between then and now genius and pioneering musical boundaries has been replaced by complacency and mediocrity and its quite hard to look at and stomach.A final word to ALL TRUE YES FANS is the final slap in the face that was given to Jon Anderson in 2008 when he was too sick to tour with them so instead of rallying behind their members they took off on the road with a karaoke singer and rick wakemans son Oliver On keys. Little do most fans know that Jon almost died during that sickness and according to an interview he gave on You Tube (Yes leaves Anderson close to the edge)they never kept in touch neverbothering to find out how their band mate was doing. Pretty sleazy if you ask me and very dissappointing in fact enough for me to send back this piece of trash \\"Fly away from here\\" and if any of the members came across this review you should be ashamed of yourselves!

B000001ELP|3.0|It's not surprising that this album was such a huge bomb.  Fans just weren't going to let Kiss be Pink Floyd, which is who they seemed to be trying to be with this one.  Having said that, it's not a bad record at all, and if you're the kind of fan who likes to cycle through a band's back catalog, this one is a nice diversion from their traditional \\"big dumb rock\\" (and I mean that in the best possible way) output.  The Bob Ezrin production is crisp and clean, particularly on the acoustic and orchestral material. The opening strums of \\"Just A Boy\\" still make my speakers sing nicely.    \\"A World Without Heroes\\" was the would-be hit single from this record, co-written by the great Lou Reed, and it should've been a bigger hit than it was.  A Gene Simmmons ballad that may have been a hit had it been given to Floyd or any of a number of more \\"respectable\\" bands, but just wasn't going to make a dent on the chart with the name \\"Kiss\\" attached to it. Elsewhere you find hard-rocking tunes like \\"The Oath\\", \\"I\\" (with the Gary Glitter backbeat that has served so many 80's hard rock acts well), and the instrumental \\"Escape From The Island\\".  The rest of the songs don't really stand on their own...they're connecting pieces for a nebulous storyline that's hard to make sense of through the lyrics, but then what great concept album isn't?  Mostly it's just hard to make sense of why a band like Kiss wanted to do an album like this, but I for one think they proved that they could do so beautifully.  It just will never be perceived that way, which is unfortunate.  Gene Simmons, in reviewing his band's records, said \\"As a Kiss album, I'd give it one star.  As a bad Genesis record, I'd give it two stars.\\"  It's actually much better than either of those, but he's got a point.  If they had written this piece and given it as a whole to a completely different band, maybe an up-and-coming Queensryche or Dream Theater, they might've made a very big name for themselves with it.  But Kiss is Kiss,and their fans weren't going to let them be anything else.  Simple as that. Maybe they should've done like what U2 did with \\"Passengers\\" and recorded it under a completely different name.   No one's gonna confuse \\"The Elder\\" (and for the record, putting that pretentious \\"Music From...\\" on the title didn't help matters any) with \\"Quadrophenia\\", but when you think of how many absolutely horrific concept albums have been attempted by bands over the years...I'm certainly not gonna lump this one in with those simply because it's got a KISS logo on the cover.  You could argue that it's a bit hackneyed, a bit contrived, a bit overdone (Paul could've definitely stood to dial back the \\"emoting\\" on the vocals on \\"Odyssey\\" - let's not tread on Meat Loaf's territory here, okay?), but the fact remains...it's a darn good record, no matter what Gene and Paul tell you.

American works of art belong to the American public; they are part of our cultural history.<br /><br />People who alter or destroy works of art and our cultural heritage for profit or as an exercise of power are barbarians, and if the laws of the United States continue to condone this behavior, history will surely classify us as a barbaric society. The preservation of our cultural heritage may not seem to be as politically sensitive an issue as \\"when life begins\\" or \\"when it should be appropriately terminated,\\" but it is important because it goes to the heart of what sets mankind apart. Creative expression is at the core of our humanness. Art is a distinctly human endeavor. We must have respect for it if we are to have any respect for the human race.<br /><br />These current defacements are just the beginning. Today, engineers with their computers can add color to black-and-white movies, change the soundtrack, speed up the pace, and add or subtract material to the philosophical tastes of the copyright holder. Tomorrow, more advanced technology will be able to replace actors with \\"fresher faces,\\" or alter dialogue and change the movement of the actor's lips to match. It will soon be possible to create a new \\"original\\" negative with whatever changes or alterations the copyright holder of the moment desires. The copyright holders, so far, have not been completely diligent in preserving the original negatives of films they control. In order to reconstruct old negatives, many archivists have had to go to Eastern bloc countries where American films have been better preserved.<br /><br />In the future it will become even easier for old negatives to become lost and be \\"replaced\\" by new altered negatives. This would be a great loss to our society. Our cultural history must not be allowed to be rewritten.<br /><br />There is nothing to stop American films, records, books, and paintings from being sold to a foreign entity or egotistical gangsters and having them change our cultural heritage to suit their personal taste.<br /><br />I accuse the companies and groups, who say that American law is sufficient, of misleading the Congress and the People for their own economic self-interest.<br /><br />I accuse the corporations, who oppose the moral rights of the artist, of being dishonest and insensitive to American cultural heritage and of being interested only in their quarterly bottom line, and not in the long-term interest of the Nation.<br /><br />The public's interest is ultimately dominant over all other interests. And the proof of that is that even a copyright law only permits the creators and their estate a limited amount of time to enjoy the economic fruitsof that work.<br /><br />There are those who say American law is sufficient. That's an outrage! It's not sufficient! If it were sufficient, why would I be here? Why would John Houston have been so studiously ignored when he protested the colorization of \\"The Maltese Falcon?\\" Why are films cut up and butchered?<br /><br />Attention should be paid to this question of our soul, and not simply to accounting procedures. Attention should be paid to the interest of those who are yet unborn, who should be able to see this generation as it saw itself, and the past generation as it saw itself.<br /><br />I hope you have the courage to lead America in acknowledging the importance of American art to the human race, and accord the proper protection for the creators of that art--as it is accorded them in much of the rest of the world communities.\\"rage!

B0002DB0FO|3.0|I adore everwood and could say a million good things about this show. However, I was not happy with this seasons packaging. It is a typical package for a dvd set...but mine fell apart when I opened it. All of the plastic sleeves for the dvds detached from the cardboard cover. It is as if the glue dried out. Also, I am a few disks in and one of my disks has been skipping a lot...to the point where one of the episode was hard to watch and I just turned it off. Great show and I prob just got a bad box. 3 stars due to the box and bad disk. I'd give the show alone 5 stars
B004EN9WCQ|5.0|Wasn't sure what I was hearing the first couple times through, but it didn't take long for it to click.  I'm absolutely in love and obsessed with this album now, so far my favorite release of 2011.

B0000009S3|4.0|This almost-wholly instrumental album, released in 1969, is generally seen as the late Frank Zappa's magnum opus. `Hot Rats' marks the point where Zappa became serious about the music and left behind the quirky-spoken-narrative-embedded-in-the-song, the clowning and the theatrics. The result has survived the years well and still sounds good.<br /><br />Often the words `jazz' and `fusion' are used when discussing HR, but at heart it's rock music, with tight 4/4 rhythms broken by occasional syncopation and pauses to add interest. Extended complex instrumental pieces employ a range of instrumentation (like heavy use of saxophones for example, and the masterful violin of Jean-Luc Ponty) and the music makes the hips want to dance as much as it engages the cerebellum.<br /><br />Notable highlights for most listeners are the opener `Peaches en Regalia' with its immediately recognisable full-on melody dominated by brass over a heavy rhythm section, much sampled over the years and the ideal theme music; followed by `Willie the Pimp' with the incomparable Captain Beefheart growling out raucous, hilarious lyrics for a couple of verses followed by a 7-minute guitar solo by Frank over a heavy, insistent medium-tempo rhythm.<br /><br />The production was somewhat groundbreaking, in that Zappa used custom-built 16-track recording equipment and experimented a lot with overdubbing and tape speed changes. The finished product is a joy: musically very accomplished with tight compositions, masterly arrangements and definitely great driving music. However, serene and relaxing it ain't; so if it's ambient mood music you need, look elsewhere.<br /><br />Some disgruntlement exists amongst hardcore fans about the currently available CD version as against the original vinyl release. Zappa did the remix himself in the late 1980s, being a more than competent engineer, arranger and producer. The remixed CD is a different listening experience, no doubt about that: Frank considered it an improvement, whereas some fans don't. The ideal solution, of course, would be a two-CD offering in one package so the listener could compare, then choose. Are the original 1969 16-track masters still available? If so, how about it? This, for me, would earn five stars.The ideal solution, of course, would be a two-CD offering in one package so the listener could compare, then choose.

0205606288|5.0|This book weighs a ton, but I can easily understand why that is unavoidable.  It is, however, exactly what the professor specified, and at considerably less cost than at the campus bookstore.  I attend an urban university, and consequently must park more than a mile from campus.  I suppose lugging this behemoth of a book back and forth all that distance, not to mention carrying it around to additional classes, is good exercise.  That is of course assuming you don't hurt yourself by the addition of other books for other courses.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Not to even try to discuss the book itself at length, other than if you are a Sci-Fi fanatic, you will love this book. Being former military with over 20 years, this story about Ender, was very interesting. Both from a military training perspective, and the issue of putting yourself and others to include the \\"enemy\\" in harms way. How one can ever overcome the self-doubt of causing the deaths of sentient beings and friends (do we ever get over it?). How do you train a military leader to be successful? All put to great literary effort here by the author. I now have to get all the rest of Orson Card's books. Very good read, highly recommended.
B0050PYNO4|5.0|Don't believe the trailers; this movie really isn't about the alien (brilliantly performed by Seth Rogen).  It's a huge nerd High-Five Whiff to American sci-fi geeks!  If you've ever been to a Con; if you know which Star Trek series is which; if you know Han shot first ... you will cringe while you howl with laughter!  Get the unrated version, which features the most hilarious mis-performed cursing I've ever seen via Kristen Wiig.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I rate this book 6 stars (don't you wish you knew the secret code to bump a review to 6 stars?).  There are certain books that, when I read them, I know they are books that will become books I treasure, that will be at my fingertips when someone asks me... what are some of the best books you've read.  Ready Player One is one of those handful of books for me.    What makes the book so special?  The way this book captures the culture of the 80s and meshes it with the world of the 2040's is genius.  The mix of future tech with retro tech is done seamlessly and hooked me from the start.  One of the neat things the book portrays is how something can (due to monetary incentive) provide a common goal to the entire world and create an entire subculture of its own, bordering on religion.  And woven through it all... a story that grabbed me from the beginning and didn't let go.  What is just so brilliant to me is that this book captures the sense of wonder and newness I remember having when playing those 'ancient' games (I was a big Joust fan), messing with computers for the first time, and figuring out how to beat a level or discover a secret or cheat (still wondering about the code for 6th review star?).  But the book isn't just about games... the book incorporates the music and movies and overall culture of the times.  Takes that era and meshes it with a bleak bleak world of 2045 and where those in the world went to found hope or escape... so that's the backdrop for the story.  The story starts out normally, picks up pace, and then rockets forward, never looking back.  I am eagerly looking forward to future books from this author.  PS: Handful of books...  This book reminds me of Neal Stephenson's [[ASIN:344245302X Snow Crash.]] for how it stands out from other books... it isn't that these books are literary masterpieces that sing to my soul, but the story for each of these books packs a big hit when combining the universes they are set in and then intertwines a good, strong story... easy to say, hard to do.  They both hit my buttons well enough to trigger a sense of wonder and joy while reading through them... absolutely keepers.  If you haven't read Snow Crash... well, read that after this book!  If you have, and you loved it, get ready for another fun ride.  Overall... clearly I like the book.  Hope you do as well.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|As someone who grew up reading \\"The Mighty Thor\\" as a child, I was really looking forward to this film. I was not disappointed! Awesome from beginning to end. My wife, who knew nothing of Thor before this film, loved it! Grab your significant other, the popcorn and feel like a kid again for two hours!
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a great mind exercise.  It can be challenging at later levels but it is rewarding and it has great atmosphere the entire time.
0790742780|5.0|Michael Douglas plays well this role. Like in Taxi Driver played by DeNiro, the main character has relationship problem with a woman. I do not want to give out spoilers. Suffice it to say that I liked the beginning; after that it really degenerates and the spectator wonders on which side to be especially after the surplus store scene. What can he do to not fall down?
B003ZSJ212|1.0|This is not the Star Wars movies I will be showing to my son in a few years. I was hoping for an unchanged version of the films- the films I cherished when I was a child, (the originals, don't really care about the prequels because they were crap) just with better definition and sound.     This is like taking a naturally beautiful woman and dressing her up like a whore.     No thanks.
B000022TSY|5.0|I was too young when it was released to understand and appreciate. Now I took the time to order it and I fully grasp it. It is sad but things have not changed so much in some places in America, tolerance-wise. Saw it after viewing the Wild Angels, with Fonda too.
B0051MKMNC|4.0|I like sci-fi films and 'Limitless' fits into the genre as one that seems plausible or at least presents itself that way. The film features a great performance from Bradley Cooper with some help from resident acting guru Robert DeNiro. Interesting visuals give the film a fresh style and the quick pace makes for a story that is never boring. A unique film that blurs the lines between drug addiction and useful medicine and makes us think if there are reasons to take a chance on such a dangerous gamble.
B0055IU4GM|5.0|I am hugely impressed by this new offering of John Hiatt. He has exceeded last year's album On the road and seems to be getting better than ever. Exceptional songs, excellent support band and great freshness and inventiveness. A pure joy.
B0001YRVN4|5.0|I actually purchased this as a gift for my niece.  She wanted it for her birthday which is in November.  I thought it would be a nice gift saying \\"what a great kid you are\\".  She is pleased and happy.
0061714402|5.0|Dave Mustaine founder, guitarist and front man for the heavy metal band, Megadeth, typically generate a variety of emotions resulting from his stage banter, interviews and music.  Megadeth fans will instantly give the horns sign with one or both hands as they exhibit their sweet air guitar skills.<br /><br />Others who might be fans of a competing bands like, say, Mustaine's first band, Metallica, are likely to pontificate about the finer points of guitar skills between Mustaine and Metallica's Kirk Hammett.  And, still others who are aware of Mustaine's conversion to Christianity are keenly interested in the strength or weakness of his walk of faith.<br /><br />As an avid student of celebrities and personalities as well as a Christian, I was eager to dig into the newly released paperback edition of Dave's autobiography, Mustaine: A Heavy Metal Memoir.  I'll be honest: I wasn't expecting much from the book because, well, I've never read a head banger's autobiography before and really thought I was going to be bored out of my aging mind.  Boy, was I wrong.<br /><br />The book is very heavy in personal introspection and transparency.  The reader will learn very quickly what make Mustaine tick and what ticks him off.  Megadeth and Metallica fans will read lots of inside scoop on the history of both bands and lots of stories behind the songs.  Dave also shares a lot of the interpersonal dynamics between him and the various configurations of his heavy metal enterprise.<br /><br />Christians who pick up the book expecting to read something along the lines of B.J. Thomas's Home Where I Belong will be shocked.  The language in the book is raw.  Very raw.  And, while I'm not one who uses the same kind of language as Mustaine chooses to use, I found his transparency and his simple, level-headed approach to his faith actually quite refreshing.<br /><br />For those of you who run, not walk, from all things Christian, don't be such a wuss.  Mustaine's book isn't \\"churchy\\".  Actually, it's far from it.  He states his faith in a matter-of-fact manner and doesn't try to jam anything down the reader's throat.  He just puts himself out there as he is and you can take him or leave him.  Either way, he's just going to keep on doing what he's doing while devoting more time to his family.<br /><br />The reader will get the very clear impression from Dave that  he knows he's lucky to still be playing guitar after going through his debilitating affliction with his money-making left hand.  He also comes across as one who knows darn well that he shouldn't be alive and is living life as one who is fully enjoying his umpteenth chance at living life to its healthy fullest.<br /><br />If you love reading about talented people - especially those who love a great rags to riches story, you're gonna love Mustaine: A Heavy Metal Memoir.  While you're ordering your copy, why not go ahead and get some Christmas shopping done for that head-banger friend or relative by picking up an extra copy or two?  Just a thought.<br /><br />Randy Patterson<br />[...]aith in a matter-of-fact manner and doesn't try to jam anything down the reader's throat.

0300169787|5.0|After visiting NYC and seeing the Savage Beauty exhibit I was so completely blown away by Alexander Mcqueen's creative genius that I knew I had to have this book. It will be something I enjoy looking at for years to come. I highly recommend it!
B001B2CPH2|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  I laughed and I cried a little.  Whoopi is so funny.  I think all the elements of drama, comedy and romance play nicely together.  I have read some other reviews about how the movie is horrible because they don't believe in ghosts and it is so fake.  I'll tell that you won't like this movie if you lack a sense of imagination.  Forget about whether ghosts are real or not or your version of the laws of physics and time and space.  Use your imagination and let that ability open your mind to this movie.  The thing that gets me is you have someone saying this movie is garbage because ghosts aren't real and it can't happen, but that same person watched Star Wars and Star Trek and thought those were wonderful movies...I don't get it.

B003EV6DBM|5.0|This series is a wonderful piece of storytelling.  Well written and acted.  I can't say enough for Matt Smith and producer Steven Moffat!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I put off reading this book for a long time. From the description, I just didn't think I would like it. Post-apocalyptic stories unnerve me (and not in a good way), so I just ignored it. Finally, I got tired of hearing all my friends and co-workers gush about it and not understanding what they were talking about, so I decided I would start it and see how it went.    I began the book at 7pm last night, and I finished it this morning at 2am. It was THAT good. I literally could not put it down (I even read while I was eating dinner...no easy task when you're eating spaghetti). I very rarely think that a book deserves 5 stars, but this one definitely does.    It is disturbing of course. We're talking about 12-18 year-olds killing each other in mostly hand-to-hand combat. But, the violence is not the center feature here, which keeps it from being too dark. The story, as told through the eyes of 16 year old Katniss, is nothing short of touching and honestly beautiful.    One thing I really liked about the book is that it doesn't read like a period piece. A lot of stories set after the apocalypse or after the fall of America begin to sound like a story that could have just as easily been set in the Dark Ages. It isn't so here. This is truly a unique world where although the nation as we know it today is no more, remnants of it still remain. Although Katniss, as a citizen of the poor District 12, has to hunt for her own food and live in poverty, they own a tv. They occasionally have electricity. The Hunger Games are basically a reality show that every citizen of Panem is required to watch. The citizens of the wealthy Capitol are almost exclusively vain, with crazy fashions and plastic surgery is the norm (sound familiar?). This gives the story such a unique twist that it sets it apart from others.    The story also gives you a lot to think about: the path our own society is taking, the limits of our humanity, the things we take for granted, etc. BUT, Collins finds a way totell this story and make you think about things in such a way that it doesn't come off as preachy or like she has an agenda.    I'm just really impressed and recommend it to anyone. I'm about halfway through the second book now, and it just keeps getting better.
B00005JMFQ|1.0|Is it funny or charming? Well, this film panders to anti-Americanism, the new religion of the world. American girls are portrayed as loose bimbos; the Prime Minister is given kudos for stickin' it to the nasty American President. The plot is shallow and so are the characters. Don't say you weren't warned.<br /><br />Those who absolutely loved this film are encouraged to mindlessly click on Not Helpful :)

B005JN988I|5.0|Wow.  This episode really lived up to all the hype that the BBC was giving it.  It was actually even better than I thought it would be!  I absolutely loved everything about this episode, especially Rory when they go back to the 1930s.  Some of that dialogue is just hilarious and what he does...well it's not exactly what you'd expect Rory to do!<br /><br />Then there was the return of River...not going to say much about that ... SPOILERS!  But trust me, it's pretty interesting when we get to see her again and a lot is revealed about her in this one episode so you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Matt Smith has really grown into the character of the Doctor.  I wasn't sure about him at first when I began watching series 5, but as the series went on I liked him more and more.  David Tennant will always be \\"my Doctor\\", but Matt is wonderful.  He's witty, serious (sometimes a little scary when he yells!) and sometimes just silly.  But that's how the Doctor is supposed to be.  This is a family show after all.<br /><br />Karen Gillan has become such a great companion.  I always liked her, but there was something about her that was missing..  But in series 6, she's been brilliant.  Especially in this episode.  I love how emotional she got when something happened (not going to say...spoilers) between River and the Doctor.<br /><br />Then there's Rory.  You have to love Rory.  I do anyway.  Arthur Darvill is a great actor and I like him so much more than I did when we first met him.  As I said in the first paragraph, he does a few things you just don't expect Rory to do.  He executes it brilliantly.<br /><br />If you're new to Doctor Who, I highly suggest that you don't start with this episode, only because of the history behind the characters.  At least begin at the start of series 6.  And have fun watching!
0634023020|5.0|I just received my copy a few days ago, and I was impressed after listening to all of the recordings first on the accompanying CD. Here is an excerpt from the introduction:<br /><br />\\"On earlier projects, I would write out the entire set of arrangements and then find myself needing to rewrite a lot of the music because I couldn't keep from veering off the roadmap into improvisation-land. So with this project, I just wrote little notes to myself on a lead sheet, did some reharmonization, and tried to improvise as much as possible on the whole thing. Then I went back and transcribed the rest of it. It was a bit grueling and a lot more work, but I've never felt more satisfied with a book project, and I truly feel fortunate to have the opportunity to share it.\\"<br /><br />Even the author said it was a grueling process, and his efforts do show themselves in this body of work. The arrangements do have the improvised feel to them, but there is cohesion between the chord melody work and single line runs. The pieces can get spatial, with a lot of single-line breaks. That might not be what some fingerstyle players want, who are partial to playing consistent syncopation. This is a book of chord-melody arrangments, not Travis-style fingerpicking tunes. For the experienced jazzer, these tunes should be a fun undertaking to learn, with elements you will likely use in your own material.<br /><br />These pieces are for advanced level guitarists. For the newbie to solo jazz guitar arrangements, this will be more challenging without strong technique and feel, and sight-reading skills. There is TAB under the notation, but that only shows you where the fingers go. Of course, the CD can help you a lot with learning how to execute the tunes. Like many jazz arrangements, you don't have to play it exactly how it's written. That all depends on your experience and jazz theory knowledge. The book contains arrangments of tunes that Miles made famous, not just his compositions.<br /><br />Song list:<br /><br />All Blues<br />All of You<br />Blue in Green<br />Bye Bye Blackbird<br />Four<br />Freddie Freeloader<br />I Could Write a Book<br />Milestones<br />Nardis<br />Nefertiti<br />Seven Steps to Heaven<br />Solar<br />So What<br />There is No Greater Love<br />When I Fall in Love<br /><br />Just listen to the CD alone and you will want to make this an addition to your set.

B004EYT932|4.0|A brilliant contribution, and a must read for any very serious students of economics and finance.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because it can be a very dry read for long sections.  Any reader must keep in mind that it's more like a textbook than a casual read.    But it is a good reminder that although we live in tough times, economic calamities have been occurring as long as there has been an economy.  After reading this book, one can't help but to think that the only thing unusual about our current economic turmoil is that it did not occur earlier.

But, upon arrival and taking it out of the box, I immediately got a feel to the sonic, and it was quite all right.  I liked the feel, and it's been durable so far (I take it almost anywhere I go.)    PROS:  - Definitely durable (As long as you don't drop it too much, treat it as you would your phone, for example)  - Definitely fun (I spend all day sonic-ing everything I see... It's embarrassing...well, not really. :P)  - Definitely worth the money (If you're a big Doctor Who fan, this replica is definitely worth your money!)    CONS:  - The sonic sound could be a bit louder (But it's fine.)  - DON'T POINT THE LIGHT AT SOMEONE'S EYES TOO CLOSE (It's okay if you're across the table sonic-ing their face [I wouldn't recommend this either, unless they were a nestein plastic man] the light is UV, and not a LED light, and can damage someone's eyes. Which is why if you're giving it to a smaller child, let them know that the light shouldn't be shone on others/his/her own face.)  - The nib is a bit loose (I super glued the nib on (the Invisible ink one, I can write with a normal pen :P) because it was too loose, and so far, I like the feel of everything, the cap stays on like it should.)    OVERALL:  I'm a big OCD-er, so the Cons are pretty nit-picky, but the product is great, definitely recommend it if you're a big fan!
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|It's a page turner, but only because the writing style creates constant suspense, not because it's actually good.  In fact the story itself was so disappointing that I was actually angry I wasted time reading it.  It continuously alluded to great secrets, mysteries, power, etc that kept you going to see what it was all about.  In the end, after all the mysteries, angst, puzzles, and layers and layers of protection, what was actually being guarded / hidden is something so ordinary and commonplace, it's ridiculous.      So while the book was somewhat fun while reading it, the ending is just so terrible that it eclipses everything good that was in the middle.  I guess it didn't matter, as Dan Brown could have written any garbage and it'd have sold millions of copies.    It was interesting to read about Washington DC though, as far as the architecture and history goes... certainly that has moved the place up my list of places to visit.

B004OBQDHK|5.0|A classic macho action-fest with a heart of gold.     I got the blu-ray and I enjoyed this movie on an emotional level I never have before, since I never saw it in the theaters, only on DVD. This is so much more alive. There's something about movies that were shot on film, with loving attention to cinematography. This dumb action movie is actually one of them. Really fun to watch. It's actually not that dumb. Well, lots of it is dumb, but in a very entertaining way. Anyway, back to the blu ray - It's a well-done transfer that seems true to the film. Clean too. No dirt or crud. No enhancement either, that I can tell. There's some grainy footage but it's mostly low-light out on the water, low ISO film, I believe, so the grain is part of the film, seemingly. Parts of the movie are absolutely creamy. Sometimes it's almost spooky.     as a side note, I have read Video professionals talk about this - most TV's are set too cool and bright out of the box, with gamma and contrast jacked up. Try adjusting your set, setting your TV to a warmer picture will look too warm for a few seconds but pretty soon you will forget that, and it will really look better playing good films. My TV has a \\"movie mode\\" and I never used it because it wasn't bright and contrasty enough and seemed too warm, reddish, but now I'm hooked on it. Looks really good, skin tones are true and lots of world detail comes through, and blacks are very deep and rich.

0553801473|1.0|If you could by this book by the page and only get the last 4 or 5 chapters then it would be worth the money. Nothing really happens in this book and I can't see how the trivial events that do happen really connect to the main plot. As much as I love this series, if the next book does what this one did, then I am done with it. 75% of this book is about the least likable/important characters. I'm honestly not sure I'm going to be interested 5 years from now when \\"The Winds of Winter\\" comes out.

B002VH7P4O|4.0|Given the notable number of comments regarding stem breakage in this Beatles USB, I was perhaps fortunate in finding a used example in like-new condition with intact stem.  The stem certainly seems fragile and I am always slightly nervous each time I handle the USB.  Hence, I quickly copied both the Flac and MP3 files to my PC and repacked the USB carefully in its liner and box.  I am happy that EMI made the copy-and-paste of the music files easy and uncomplicated with no need of music file registration, in stark contrast to Apple iTunes files.  The fragile stem is worrisome, as its breakage renders removal of the USB from its apple-shaped stand/case almost impossible, although another reviewer suggested the clever idea of using super glue-type adhesive to reattach the stem.  Nonetheless, EMI should have made the stem much more robust and resistant to breakage, especially for such a pricey and limited-production item.      In contrast, the apple-shaped stand-case is remarkably heavy, solid, and strong--it could easily serve as a projectile or rock-like weapon.  The engraving of the band's name in the stand-case lends the uSB an elegant aura;    it appears classy and cool sitting on a desk or shelf.  This underscores the impressive 14.9GB capacity of the tiny USB, of which only 9.21GB is occupied, leaving 5.69GB potentially for the buyer to add additional files.    Unfortunately the empty space is not readily accessible for adding files by the buyer and the USB's brief instructions and read-me files do not reveal how to do so, although, based on some reviewer suggestions, I surmise this can be done using somewhat esoteric--at least to a PC-ignorant user like I--algorithms.      However, I certainly agree with those who worry that making the space easily accessible to the lay buyer would create the potential for erasing mishaps; inadvertent erasure of any of the Beatles music files would be tragic,   especially for an expensive and limited-run music USB.  I suggest the considerable unused space would be much better used for additional Beatles recordings, such as the three 2-CD \\"Anthology\\" sets, \\"Let It Be...Naked\\", \\"Live   at the BBC\\", and perhaps even \\"Live at the Hollywood Bowl\\"; the latter has yet to be issued on CD and, despite its debatable musical value, would have been a fitting addition for a limited-edition set such as this USB.  Ideally, this USB should have included the \\"Mono\\" box set in Flac and MP3, but it needs more than the remaining 5.69GB.  However, the apple-shaped stand-case seems large enough to easily accomodate two USBs; the 2nd USB could accomodate the \\"Mono\\" box set.   The addition of the \\"Mono\\" box set, plus the other Beatles recordings I mentioned above (\\"Let It Be...Naked\\", \\"Live at the BBC\\", the three 2-CD \\"Anothology\\" sets, \\"Live at the Hollywood Bowl\\") would have greatly increased the value-for-money quotient of the USB.  As I am writing this, I realize the remaining 5.69GB of the single USB may not have accomodated all of the non-\\"Mono\\" recordings I suggested, but all of the recordings I suggested should fit on 2 USBs.    The Beatles USB is an elegantly compact presentation of the Beatles official stereo recordings that is very user-friendly for both the Flac and MP3 music files, and nicely graces any shelf or desk it sits upon, despite its high price (which may be commensurate with its limited production run).  Its value-for-money--and perhaps desirability and uniqueness, especially with inclusion of \\"Live at the Hollywood Bowl\\"--would have been much higher if the \\"Mono\\" box set and the other recordings cited above had been included with expansion of the set to two USBs.
B002VPE1AW|4.0|The script of Avatar is an obvious re-telling of the 1904 novel *Green Mansions.*  Maybe Freud was right all along:  There is no originality.  All the elements of the movie are in the novel:  the remnants of a mysterious race of people living in a remote forest where they are threatened by scoundrels trying to exploit the resources of the planet by destroying the ecosystem which is represented by a gigantic root system supporting a huge tree which gets destroyed at the end.      Unfortunately, the emotional impact of the novel does not exist in Avatar. The author of *Green Mansions,* William H. Hudson, made use of a highly effective device to convey his passionate love of nature which was represented by a beautiful seventeen-year-old girl who was probably the last surviving member of her race. Here is how Hudson presented that passion through the words of the story's hero:    \\"Why, I began to ask myself, was Rima so much to me?  It was easy to answer that question:    Because nothing so exquisite had ever been created.  All the separate and fragmentary beauty and melody and graceful motion found scattered throughout nature were concentrated and harmoniously combined in her. How various, how luminous, how divine she was! A being for the mind to marvel at, to admire continually, finding some new grace and charm every hour, every moment, to add to the old.  And there was, besides, the fascinating mystery surrounding her origin to arouse and keep my interest in her continually active.    That was the easy answer I returned to the question I had asked myself.  But I knew that there was another answer--a reason more powerful than the first.  And I could no longer thrust it back, or hide its shining face with the dull, leaden mask of mere intellectual curiosity.  Because *I loved her;* loved her as I had never loved before, never could love any other being, with a passion which had caught something of her own brilliance and intensity, making a former passion look dim and commonplace in comparison--a feeling known to everyone, something old and worn out, weariness even to think of. \\"      The love story as presented in Avatar was pretty lame compared to that I think.  I wonder if anyone involved in the film genuinely felt the distress of the original author over the impending loss of the rain forest.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|I love \\"Jane Eyre\\"; I read it about once a year, have seen most of the movie versions, and they all manage to do some things well and Not So Well on other things. Two things that I thought were great about this version were that 1)Mia Wasikowska was the closest screen version of Jane to what I imagined in the book (other actresses either too old and/or too obviously pretty, and 2) there was actually chemistry between Jane and Rochester, despite their clear separation in class, age and expectations. Seriously, they sizzle - this is not a Rainbows, Puppy Dogs and Daisies kind of attraction, and Jane, at least, is not sure how to handle it. The novel was considered scandalous when it was published because of the sexual undertones (now tame by our standards), and in this version the two main characters CLEARLY want each other. St. John Rivers was also handled well in this film (often glossed over in other versions) and Judi Dench, as always, is Amazing.    There are a couple areas where it falls a little short for me; I wish that there had been more time devoted to Jane and Rochester's snappy and sometimes biting repartee, and I would have liked the resolution to have a little more, well, resolution. Michael Fassbender is a bit too purty for my idea of Rochester. Having said that, something is always going to be cut when turning a novel into a two hour movie, and I think this is a fine version that any fan of Jane should at least give a try.    ...and did I mention that incredible sizzle?

Buy the album, you won't be disappointed.   Also, a tip I learned this week, listen to Heavy Metal Lover with the bass up high enough that you can feel it. :)
B003ZSJ212|1.0|No original versions available and the rest is a very mediocre package. Also the additional changes that they made to this is just very unnecessary and often the more and more they change the more it detracts from the movie.     Thing that Lucas doesn't get is that if there were fully restored original theatrical versions of Star Wars (The good Trilogy not the crappy prequels) no one would care about the changes that Lucas could and will make.     Pass on this and demand a print with theatrical versions.

B003L77G2Y|5.0|I'd just like to start off by saying that Fringe is the most unbelievably imaginative show I have ever watched and sadly also one that goes mostly unseen. This season was so wonderful and the acting was just mind blowing. I love the story lines and the cast and all the creative aspects of the show. For a show that may not have the biggest or most expensive budget they really make a little go a long way. I just wish people would be more open minded and give the show a chance but what can you expect with a world run rampant with Jersey Shore and 90210. Anyways I think this season was the most compelling and left me with so many questions I can't wait to see answered in the next season (Where is Peter?). This show is one of the few that has developed characters and the relationships between them really shine on the screen and the emotional depth that is shared between them just make it all the more believable. This show is really in it for their fans and not just for the mainstream which is really rare and something you don't really see at all in other shows. I will be ordering two of season 3 (One for my sister and one for me) I can't wait to re watch this amazing series (and to see the awesome special features)and I hope one day the rest of the world (or the Emmy's) will recognize this show and these actor's and all the great acting and writing and emotion that goes into making this show.
B002HNA95E|4.0|Thirty six tracks is pretty extensive but by no means exhaustive. Celebration comes hot on the heels after Madonna's lowest selling Hard Candy (still a whopping 3.8 million worldwide!)<br /><br />Celebration is calibrated in such a way that you still have to retain or get the older hits collections.<br /><br />The Immaculate Collection. All the hits here are done in Q Sound effectively making them different from the originals. Plus Rescue Me.<br /><br />Something To Remember. Ballads missing on Celebration available here like You'll See and This Used To Be My Playground.<br /><br />GHV2. You'll need this for Deeper And Deeper. Don't Cry For Me Argentina. And more<br /><br />As a plus point, Celebration features her hits in their original formats. Some are full original versions like Holiday and Inro The Groove (finally!). Others are edited such as 4 Minutes. Some have never been on a Madonna hits album ie Dress You Up, Who's That Girl, Burning Up.<br /><br />I really love the cover design which is based on the 80s True Blue era. Many variations of the cover are found n the booklet. It comes bundled with a small poster.<br /><br />The new track Celebration is like her earlier party anthems such as Into The Groove. It probably would have fared better had it been released during the 80s. In contrast, Revolver sounds more current. Celebration is a welcome addition to your existing hits collections. Also recommended for Madonna  virgins!

B002K0WBXW|5.0|This movie has a wonderfully warm cast and excellent script with fine cinematography. I am always impressed by how fragmented the filming/acting locations are, the amount of resets, special effects, and how it all fits seamlessly together to make a part of Massachusetts resemble a believable small town in Alaska to achieve the story line. Sandra Bullock is always a joy to watch work and Ryan Reynolds (a fine actor as well) is welcome eye candy for us women--yes! This is a nice 'feel good' movie. It has some fun plot twists and turns to keep you engaged with all of the characters. And the main characters are supported and made very earthy, funny, real, and relate-able by the choice of actors portraying Andrew's family. Betty White fans will have an especial treat. I bought a single disc copy which I am regretting because I would love to see the special features that the writer/director speak of in the audio commentary. It is a movie to be watched again and again by men and women alike. Even once you know the ending, it remains an interesting and clever journey of a couple getting together amidst family interactions and attempted Immigration intervention. And I confess I am an unabashed romantic for improbable happy endings involving refreshingly believable characters. Sandra and Ryan accomplish this feat in solid style.

0307887960|5.0|This is my first review, ever. I first heard about this diet from Dr. Oz and decided to give it a try.  Please check out the Dukan Diet page on Facebook before listening to people on here who seem to get a hit off criticizing a diet they haven't tried. (Notice that every one of the critics has not been on the diet, they're just 'head tripping.') Please listen to people who know what they're talking about from their own experience. You'll find a community of over 7,000 people on the Dukan Diet Facebook site who are excited about their easy weight loss and the fact they're learning how to keep it off with the same ease. Dr. Dukan has managed to blend the best of what we know about successful weight loss into a manageable program. I'm 70 years old and have lost 30 pounds in 3 1/2 months. My loss has been somewhat slower than many others because my thyroid level is low, but slowly being corrected.  Also, the more you have to lose, the greater the initial loss. I only had 30 lbs to lose. My doctor is delighted and recommending Dukan to his other patients. If you go to wwwdotdukandietdotcom you'll be able to calculate the weight Dr. Dukan says you can maintain for life without a struggle. My best wishes to those of you who need to lose weight.

0061245097|4.0|She gave him up to save his life.<br /><br />He swore he'd find her.<br /><br />She really should have known. Bones always keeps his promises.<br /><br />It's been four years since Cat left Bones to protect him. She's working with a covert government agency, doing what Bones taught her to do best. Kill. When she's not on duty, she's trying to live a normal life. Her best friend is getting married, she's dating a vet, and she still misses Bones so much she aches with it.<br /><br />Coming face to face with him at the wedding is a shock, finding out there's a bounty on her head and he intends to track whomever is responsible and kill them ugly isn't. Cat isn't sure what to feel, though, when he tells her he's not letting her get away from him again.<br /><br />This second installment of the Night Huntress series reminds me of the fourth season of BtVS. I know, I know, I can't stop making the BtVS connections. I'm sorry! Still, you gotta admit, the group Cat works for reads an awful lot like the Initiative, including the vamps in the holding cells and the military-esque tactical teams. Sure, Noah's no Riley Finn (thank hell), and no one shoves a chip into Bones' skull, but the similarities continue.<br /><br />And again, this reread pointed out some issues I didn't notice the first time around. The whole secret agency thing popped up too abruptly at the end of the last book, and in this one, I was never comfortable with it. Cat is supposed to have this camaraderie with her team, but maybe because of the four year gap in story timeline those relationships felt very manufactured to me. Cat's got a new BFF we've never met, Denise, and she's marrying a guy we don't know, then there's the lovesick Tate (yeah, there's a surprise), the horndog Juan, and the reticent Cooper. They all just sort of popped up, weren't really fleshed out, just moved into position as serious secondary characters. It didn't work for me.<br /><br />It wasn't until Bones was back in the picture that this story started to gel for me at all, but when he was, it was lovely. Cat's matured as a character (thankfully), and there was some genuinely refreshing moments of honesty between Cat and Bones that reminded me just how much I prefer romances where characters have the stones to be open and communicative with each other. I love them as a couple, I really do.<br /><br />The external conflict in the storyline is more personal in this one, with Cat's father stirring up trouble and Bones' sire working his own agenda. Despite the fact that I don't like the secret agency bull, I liked those threads very much. There were several nice plot twists and a few real shockers. Oh, and of course, Cat's mother - dependable as ever as the bigoted be-otch from hell. That woman is crazy, I swear.<br /><br />I'd forgotten this is the book where we first meet Mencheres, a favorite character of mine...though perhaps not as favored as Vlad, who shows up in the next book, I think, and Spade is back in a small cameo roll here. Love him. And I have to say, one of my favorite scenes of the whole series is in this book. I tittered and snickered just as hard this time around when Cat and Annette have there not-so-little fracas.<br /><br />QUOTE:<br />\\"I am going to knock the slut out of you, Annette,\\" I gritted between clenched teeth, \\"And that should take some doing, you uppity English tramp!\\"<br /><br />I can't begin to express with suitable emphasis just how much fun I had with that scene.<br /><br />Like the first reread, my enthusiasm for this book was slightly dimmed from the first go. I didn't like it at all pre-Bones, and after he was back, I still had some issues with Cat and with the story. And the surprise development at the end was a combination of frustration at Cat's stupidity and pleasure at the outcome. All in all, Cat is annoying me a lot more on the rereads than she did originally, though I liked her more in this book than in the previous one. And of course, there's Bones...back with Cat and looking, acting, and being fiiiiiiiine. Yum.<br /><br />~*~*~*~<br />Reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another.Deserves Another.
B000002HRE|3.0|In my opinion, Metallica should've done one of these 4 things regarding the songs on this album:<br />A) Exchanged the weaker songs on \\"Load\\" for the really good songs on \\"ReLoad\\"<br />B) Titled it \\"ReLoad: Songs from Load Sessions and a few new ones\\" and I forget if they did this or not but at least put a sticker on the outside saying that<br />C) Originally released \\"Load\\" as a double album so there weren't so many weak songs on this<br />D) Released this as an EP with the strong songs only<br /><br />I'll rate the songs:<br /><br />Fuel: 5/5 Should've been on \\"Load\\"<br />Memory Remains 4/5: I'm pretty sure this was recorded after but again should've been on \\"Load\\"<br />Devil's Dance 2/5: This should've remained scrapped<br />The Unforgiven Two 5/5: It sounds great actually and should've been on Load if possible<br />Better Than You 4/5: Not bad but B-side material at best, should've been one<br />Slither 5/5: Decent song that should've made \\"Load\\"<br />Carpe Diem Baby 4/5: Decent song, should've made it a B-side or scrapped it<br />Bad Seed 3/5: This had potential but missed, should've been scrapped<br />Where The Wild Things Are 4/5: Could've been on \\"Load\\" or could've been a B-side<br />Prince Charming 2/5: Generic and uninteresting, they should've scrapped it<br />Low Man's Lyric 2/5: Good concept that got old and shouldn't have gone on for 7 minutes, definitely should've been scrapped<br />Attitude 5/5: Really good, engaging song. Should've made \\"Load\\" or been a B-side<br />Fixxxer 5/5: Excellent song that should have made \\"Load\\" or at least have been a B-side<br /><br />In essence, these songs should've been shaved down to an EP or they should've been seperated onto B-sides for singles from \\"Load\\". Some of them were just bad and shouldn't have been released. I can't assume Metallica were cashing out when they released this but it raises the question for sure; I don't see how this would benefit their attempt to regain old fans back or keep new fans. Just realize that you're essentially buying a B-sides album when you get this but it does have some extremely good moments that hopefully don't get overlooked as time goes by. I would also advise that you don't buy this for more than an EP would cost seeing that you may be disappointed you didn't get your money's worth.<br />Don't overlook it altogether though.me extremely good moments that hopefully don't get overlooked as time goes by.

I also enjoy being able to share a part of my teenage-hood with my husband. As someone who was quite frequently called Daria, it gave him an insight to where my rather sarcastic wit originated from.

B0054N73EY|4.0|Five years after releasing their Grammy-winning 2006 effort [[ASIN:B000EMGAOY Stadium Arcadium]], the Red Hot Chili Peppers return with their tenth studio effort, [[ASIN:B0054N73EY I'm With You]].  A lot happens during a five year hiatus, most notably the fact that guitarist John Frusciante left the band in 2009. Luckily, the band has been known to have a revolving door of guitarists and guitarist Josh Klinghoffer fits right into the mold.  The question most fans had for the band's new effort aside from their personnel change was what would the sound be after a five-year break. Unfortunate for the band, enjoyable first single \\"The Adventures of Rain Dance Maggie\\" did little to highlight what the new album might sound like.  Overall, the band sounds solid, even if I'm With You is by no means a valedictory effort.<br /><br />The effort opens mysteriously and somewhat off-putting with \\"Monarchy of Roses,\\" most certainly a stark contrast to previous opener \\"Dani California.\\" that said, after the track evolves, it turns out to be quite enjoyable and creative on the band's part.  It doesn't take long for Kiedis to shine vocally or for Flea's mad bass skills to shine through.  Follow up cut \\"Factory of Faith\\" is more down the earth, if slightly less brilliant than it's predecessor.  The cut opens with Flea's distinct bass and finds frontman Kiedis 'talking' through the verse as opposed to singing in a vocal manner. By The refrain finds Kiedis belting and the band as a whole yields some clever musical ideas, particularly newbie Klinghoffer.  \\"Brendan's Death Song\\" may be lengthy clocking in just twenty seconds shy of six minutes, but it may be the album's valedictory moment. The buildup of the cut is notable as is the well-penned refrain which Kiedis sings so passionately: \\"Like I said/you know I'm almost dead/You know I'm almost gone/And when the drummer drums/He's gonna play my song/to carry me alone...\\" Overall, a stunning cut.<br /><br />\\"Ethiopia\\" is another enjoyable cut, most notable for the funky groove and consummate musicianship (Klinghoffer's final chord on guitar is a brilliant musical touch).  The drum mix on \\"Annie Wants a Baby\\" is particularly noteworthy, accentuating Chad Smith's percussive touch and skill.  The unpredictability of the harmonic progression and Klinghoffer's guitar riffs are highlights of this 'A-' cut.  \\"Look Around\\" is solid and finds Kiedis talking through the verses while overtly singing on the refrain.  The instrumental bridge provides a nice change of pace and scope.<br /><br />Single \\"The Adventures of Rain Dance Maggie\\" lays well, even if it is a bit too similar in scope to Stadium Arcadium's better promo single \\"Dani California.\\" The refrain is catchy enough, though it is the bluesy guitar riffs and buttressing bass lines that solidify this cut.  \\"Did I Let You Know\\" is as funky as anything else featuring a great trumpet solo by Mark Bulger.  \\"Goodbye Hooray\\" sounds the slightest bit saturated in sounds as there is 'a lot to take in.' That said, the sounds are appealing despite nearly edging towards the cacophonous. \\"Happiness Loves Company\\" proves to be a welcome change of pace given its pianistic opening and catchy refrain.<br /><br />\\"Police like is enjoyable, particularly because of its easygoing sound, but its expansive five and a half minute length diminishes its likability.  \\"Even You Brutus?\\" atones through its stark contrast to anything else on the LP.  Kiedis's vocal performance is manic and Klinghoffer's guitar parts are killer. Penultimate cut \\"Meet Me At the Corner\\" is superb showcasing the band in a lighter sound.  Closer \\"Dance, Dance, Dance\\" is a bit clumsy, but ok.  At this point, the band have more than presented enough goods.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B0054N73EY I'm With You]] is another solid addition to the band's discography and to the rock catalogue. For the most part it is an enjoyable set, even where it falls short of being revolutionary. No, \\"Dani California\\" or \\"TellMe Baby\\" are hard to come by here, but there are plenty of capable cuts to please hardcore and casual fans alike.but there are plenty of capable cuts to please hardcore and casual fans alike.

I had to play the DVD when my family wasn't home, so I could turn up the volume. He has been giving a great talent and is using it well. I hope to see him in concert one day. I would recommend this DVD to anyone interested in watching a guitar legend in the making.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|Saw this as I was exiting the app store.  Usually I pay little attention to the paid apps.  I guess I'm a typical android user in the fact that I do not pay for apps.  I've never bought a single app and never planned on it.  I was so intrigued by this one though that I couldn't pass it up.  The effects are amazing.  It's well worth every penny.  Best camera app I've ever used, and I've used quite a few.  I love everything that it does, and I'm quite pleased with my purchase.
B001HN6922|1.0|I too was looking forward to watching this movie with my kids. The 1st movie was well written and had a good story line about what happens when you become selfish. The 2nd movies was nothing like the 1st one. The story line was about the evil oil industry and trying to kill cars. I am not adverse to violence, because I grew up with Bugs Bunny and the Warner Brother cartoons. I let me children watch these shows, but the violence is appropriate to what the characters are doing. The Cars 2 movie was covering adult material trying to make young children understand the message. Gas burning cars are bad, and push green energy. They tried to do the same thing in WALL-E with covering adult material. Please keep the social engineering to politics and leave our children alone. It will be a long time before I see a movie in a theater with my children. I will stick to reviewing DVD movies at home before letting them watch the movie. It is a darn shame the movie industry doesn't see the original Cars movie as a template to produce great movies for families to watch together at the theater.
1439102813|5.0|Our family is currently dealing with Alzheimer's in a family member. This book went straight to my heart. The author brings this horrible disease to life and makes you identify with Alice as she progresses through the stages of early-onset Alzheimer's. The reactions of her family members and the way they deal with the grief of watching her deteriorate is very illuminating.
B005BGBPBG|1.0|This film is full of recycled scenes from romantic comedies in TV and film. You may not be able to pin point from where exactly, but so many of the shots are recognizable from actors kissing in the street without any concern of oncoming traffic to running away in the rain after pouring their hearts out. If I had one word to describe this film it would be \\"silly.\\" In order to justify the lead character cheating with her best friend's fiancé, the best friend must become a self-centered cheater herself. Apparently this is supposed to help sway the audience into rooting for the 2 original liar/cheaters? Nice try but not all people are that shallow. We should have left when it started getting ridiculous (about 20 minutes into the film) but in some weird way we wanted to stick around to see if it could get any worse. Well, we weren't disappointed; the film is one of the worst I have ever seen! A shame since I do like some of the actors.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|At what point will people finally stop supporting this crap? It's sickening that in a few generations, they will always think that Darth Vader screamed NOOOOO at the end of Jedi.

0786838655|2.0|I know others have said this, but if you have to write about a misfit yet powerful orphan kid thrust into a world of magic, and you just have to give him two friends, a boy and a girl, please at least make the girl the clumsy, somewhat cowardly one and the boy the brainy, snarky one.  Or give him three friends.  Or two male friends.  Otherwise, Ron and Hermione beat you to the punch.  There are only so many storylines, yes, but this was just TOO similar to the immortal Harry Potter.<br /><br />I also found some of the mythology stuff pedantic.  You can certainly use a novel to teach, but if it FEELS like you're teaching, it's off-putting, at least to me.<br /><br />I'm not a kid anymore, but the \\"hip\\" kid slang felt just slightly off, like it was trying too hard.  And it'll get dated fast, if it isn't already.<br /><br />It disturbed me how everyone from Percy to Poseidon thought Percy's mother so wonderful, yet she stayed for years in an abusive relationship.  Yes, it was to protect Percy, but I think she could have figured out another way, if she was so wonderful.  I'm glad she finally got out of it, though I'm not sure I like how.  It just seems to send all sorts of wrong messages.<br /><br />I felt slightly tricked by the plot.  Not like a good twist ending or a who-on-earth-did-it mystery, but like the author was playing with me.  Maybe because so much of the book was the cross-country trip that [SPOILER ALERT] turned out much in vain, and then the sort of final battle was disappointing.<br /><br />All this said, there were quite a few clever details, some interesting world building, and a number of nice one-liners.  I even laughed aloud several times.<br /><br />And the cover art's nice.
B0007P0LPC|5.0|Margot Fonteyn was the best ballerina EVER! She did things in dancing when she was old that dancers today can not do. There is part in this where she stands on point with one foot and is tapped on the shoulder then she spins in a circle. She does that three times in a row. This is the most remarkable thing I have ever seen in dance.    Rudolph Nureyev epitomizes strength and grace. He and Fonteyn flow as if they were poured from a crystal canister. His lifts are effortless. Incredible to see this performance from a half century ago.

B001E45XT4|4.0|After doing ALOT of research I bought this headset to replace a set I spent an equall amount of money on.The reviews on this particular model were very insightful and were a deciding factor in my purchase. The headset is very comfortable although they are a little tight, this tightness is ver minuscule and i imagine will go away once they become accustomed to the size of my head. The mic still has to be close to my mouth so that I can be heard but these are the first headset that I actually had to turn down once I had them in place and my guild friends said they were very clear. The cords are very thick and tough, which is good cuz I have pets with claws. The craftmanship of this headset is comparable to more expensive headsets I have seen. The speakers when not turned up incredibly loud are pretty clear although the bass can be staticy depending on what u are listening to. I mainly use this headset for gaming and they do a very good job with that. I highly recommend these to gamers who are working with a budget.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Have seen videos of the new alterations on youtube, ever since '97 all these alterations keep making these movies worse.  WE WANT THE OLD ONE'S BACK!!!! THE OOOOOLLLLDDD ONNNEEE'S!!!!  I've never seen a movie this popular, treated so shabbily, all everyone wants is the originals exactly how they were, with only modern cleanup methods used to make it look good.  I've seen low budget 80's horror flicks that were given better treatment than the re-released DVD originals (disk 2 on the separate dvd versions).  Once and for all, I mean I don't care how many horrible new movies you make, people can avoid those if they want, but if we wanna see the movies we grew up with we have to either watch a grainy ugly looking version that doesn't fit properly on modern tv's, or a crappy brightened version (vader has a pink sabre) with new horrible music, fake computer crap & new dialogue crammed in 30 years after it was made.  This is so WEAK!

B001UV4XJ2|3.0|Let me preface this by saying that Deathly Hallows, Part 1 was one of my favorite films last year, and with such giants as the Social Network and the King's Speech, that is high praise. It was character driven and emotional at a point that only Alfonso Cuaron's Prisoner of Azkaban had previously managed.    'Hallows Part 2', however, is an action movie as devoid of soul as its antagonist. It relies quite heavily on the previous seven films - its seven Horcruxes if you will - to create emotion and a sense of impending doom and danger. Sure, we see things explode, we see things crash and bang and boom. But the way David Yates handles the deaths of characters - off-screen with little mention even after the fact - sucks the emotional impact and the sense of danger from the film.    It's a fun ride to be sure; the Battle of Hogwarts is immensely entertaining to watch, with wonderful effects and cinematography that would make Peter Jackson weep. I recommend the movie for that alone - it is a visual treat. The roll call of the British A-list cast is a joy to see, with Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman being standouts in their wonderful portrayals of Professors McGonagall and Snape respectively. Snape's major scene late in the film is the high point of both the film and quite possibly the series, with his acting chops being put to full use and providing a truly moving experience that exceeds the rest of the film's emotional bankruptcy.    Potter fans will certainly be divided with Yates' changes to the source material in some parts, but overall I feel they will be placated. Do not expect the impact of Prisoner of Azkaban or Hallows 1, but prepare to be blown away with some fine, fine action sequences.
0307595579|5.0|To be honest ,the very first chapter of \\"The Girl With the dragon Tattoo \\"was a little slow- I thought what is everyone raving about? Alot of Swedish place names and characters, I perservered and by the second chapter was intrigued- then couldnt put the book down! Mikael the investigative journalist is a fantastic character, but Lisbeth is awesome, so troubled ,but everyone can identify a little with her.  She does what she wants when she wants- go girl !  \\"The Girl who played with fire\\" was my favourite of the series,spent 3 days imersed in this book.  \\"The girl who kicked the hornets nest\\" took me 2 days,its twists and turns kept me glued to the pages, did nothing but read the entire weekend.  Was a little sad at the end as there are no more books to read written by Stieg Larsson due to his untimely death in 2006.
B0034G4P8U|2.0|First off, DIE HARD Transformers fan.    First transformers movie from a character development, plot, story telling and CGI standpoint one of the best movies in last 10 years for the genre.      Second one lacked many of those facets as the first had, but still produced a quality albeit flawed story.  Plus the action was better.    Third one lacked nearly any character development, story was poorly told with huge plot holes within the movie itself (not to mention tying any consistency with the previous two).      The action scene was almost to long while being non-linear and really not very epic.  Basically you sit through an hour and half of some comedic wit, tons of useless cameos, and watch Sam whine about how much his life sucks.  Also Michael Bay fails miserably in replacing Megan Fox.  I am not a huge fan of her as an actress but I found myself rooting for the decepticons to kill her replacement off often but to no avail.      Finally \\"Spoiler alert\\"  We are to believe that this advanced alien race takes over the city of Chicago, and the primary reason they do this is to enslave mankind to rebuild their home world.  Yet in order to do this they go on a killing spree reminiscent of Mars Attacks on the city.  I don't know about you, but if the Egyptians had vaporized their slaves those pyramids would not have been built as quick...  Then we are forced to watch a movie called \\"Transformers\\" show us the epic struggle of mankind for another 30 minutes while a building is falling (physics and common sense aside).  Finally to have mankind's struggle really mean nothing when Optimus just owns everyone with a splash of help from Megatron.  Then the movie just ends...  Thats it, no closure, don't bother to tie any plot strings together let alone insert a plot.      I give the movie 2 stars to be generous because as I said, I am a Die Hard Transformers fan.   But this movie was a greater disappointment then Green Latern and superman returns combined in my humble opinion.
B000005JAB|5.0|Remember The Velvet Underground? You know them as Lou Reed's band. The problem is the average person even if they know who The Velvet Underground IS don't know who John Cale is. Cale was every bit Reed's equal as a songwriter. It's a pity that Reed is better known than Cale because Cale produced a series of stunning albums including THIS one of his finest.<br /><br />Featuring key members of Little Feat--the late Lowell George and the late Richie Hayward on guitar and drums respectively adding a earthy vibe to the recording (neither is credited in the booklet).<br /><br />There are two editions out there and both have their merit although which one you want will depend on how much the sound quality matters to you vs. the bonus tracks.<br /><br />The first earlier edition from 1993 is the first mastering done for CD by the great mastering engineer Lee Herschberg. Herschberg does a brilliant job of capturing the \\"feel\\" of the music for CD. The booklet doesn't have any liner notes on the making of the album but does feature the lyrics of the album. Herschberg's master here is the essence of an audiophile presentation--plenty of dynamic range, a nice, warm presentation of the original analog recording.<br /><br />The remaster, on the other hand, features an outtake \\"Burned Out Affair\\" which is every bit the equal of the other material here even if the performance might not be quite up to the others. The rest of the alternate takes/outtakes DOUBLE the length of the album.<br /><br />Remastered by Dave Schultz the album sounds extremely good but lacks the warmth that Herschberg's mastering brought to the album. There's also excellent liner notes that discuss the album.<br /><br />Both versions are worthwhile and, given that the remaster doubles the length of the album AND has a previously unreleased song recorded for the sessions, gives a slight edge to the remaster however I still like the sound of the first edition more.<br /><br />If you could afford both it would be worthwhile picking up both for their respective merits but either way this is an essential album.<br /><br />Incidentally there's a 21st unlisted bonus track a work out of \\"MacBeth/Birds\\" that runs about 5 minutes. It's pretty cool.this is an essential album.  Incidentally there's a 21st unlisted bonus track a work out of \\"MacBeth/Birds\\" that runs about 5 minutes. It's pretty cool.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|To save you time here are my favorite shows on TV last 3 years to show you what I am interested in.  Big Bang Theory, Chuck, Scrubs, Burn Notice, White Collar, ESPN...    As you can see I do not watch much TV so when I watch a show, it is good.  As my heading said, Community feels like the illegitimate child of Big Bang Theory and scrubs in college.     Synapse:  A group of unlikely community college students find themselves becoming good friends in an attempt to pass senior Changs Spanish class.  Jeff Winger the leader of the group is an ex-lawer trying not to get disbarred and go unnoticed in college while trying to \\"get\\" the girl.  Britta, jeffs object of affection in the beginning, is a feminist who really hasn't fought for anything.  Pierce (chevy Chase) is a retired business man who thinks going to college will make him young again.  Troy was the former star QB in highschool but after a keg stand injury he is trying to make the grade rather then make the team.  Annie is a secrete admirer of Troy who was known as Aderal Annie in Highschool.  Shirley is the mother of 2 and after a messy divorce is looking for a fresh start in college.  Finally Abed the non terrorist muslim film buff who has aspergers.  He knows everything about nearly every film ever made. This unlikely band finds adventure in their lives through their spanish study group and various chaotic community college events like campus wide paint ball games.     Heres the break down:    Characters:  The characters are unique, fun and deep.  Each one has something that makes them tick and adds something to the show.  Each episode builds slowly on previous ones in-terms of character development.  The characters are constantly evolving and coming to terms with their surroundings much like \\"real people\\" do.  Chevy Chases character can be a little annoying but eh, what you going to do its chevy :) 5/5    Comedy:  The episodes are slammed full of comedy.  It gives just the right amount of slap stick, situational and comedic antics throughout. 5/5      Plot:  Each episode albeit slowly, churns through the academic school year.  Plot lines a sewn deeper as the series progresses with each episode building off the last.  4.5/5    Acting:  The acting is very good from most cast.  Their are frequent cameos (much like Scrubs) that doesnt move the story along, but adds to the enjoyment of the experience.  4.5/5    replay value:  In my opinion I could watch episodes multiple times and have done so to show others how funny the show is.  5/5    Conclusion:    If your looking for a funny comedy that if you have ever been to college you might be able to relate to in some way or another.  This is probably the show for you.  If you are truly unsure if you will enjoy it.  Got to NBC.com and watch an episode online.  You wont understand the characters, but will get an idea of how the show will go.
1439148953|5.0|I inhaled this book. It was like reading a fairy tale. I understand why other reviews say the characters were flat, though. They were, but the atmosphere around them of Ireland and Brooklyn, and the transatlantic crossing in the early 50s made up for it for me. And I liked the way Toibin showed the malleability of emotions and memory - I went from dreading Eilis becoming involved with another character to feeling she must marry him. It was fun.    I may be more interested in the story than most readers because my mother came to NYC from Ireland by herself around the same time. The trauma of having to leave your home and go to a huge city was beautifully expressed and shed light on my mothers experience for me. Like Eilis family, she's not very forthcoming about her feelings about that time.     Having Eilis find a job and a fabulous Italian boyfriend was a happy surprise - I feared the whole story would be tragic. And ...  that's all I'll say. No spoilers here.

Words fall short to describe what one feels as she takes you along on a ride that soars, and glides, and swirls you through a sea of emotion, and then gently lands you safely on the ground; leaving you feeling like your not quite sure what just happened.  Only one Barbra.  God blessed her with talent, and longevity.  Thank you Father, for the gift of that voice.  What an instrument!!

B004LWZVZC|5.0|I picked this up at redbox for a buck just because I couldn't find anything else and also because I generally think what Robert Redford is doing with independent film overall is a really good thing.  I really loved this movie, although I almost didn't finish it.  The start is rough, IMHO (sorry Rob).  I actually went to the director's VO and listened to his thoughts after I watched it and he was really on target, again, in my humble opinion.  But, what he was trying to do in those early scenes just did not work for more than one reason, IMHO.  Obviosuly, we all know this is an indpt. film.  But you just cannot say, \\"Excuse me, I didn't have the budget to look big.\\"  The better choice is to choose scenes that don't have to look big.  The battlefiled scene, IMHO, looked small budget.  I know what he was trying to do with that character and he gets kudos for the effort, because most directors don't even get that you have to like or be drawn inextricably for some reason to your main character.  But, I think the better choice would have been to start with Mary and to see her coming to the door and maybe bringing in or offering refreshments to the conspirators.  The big thing is that I did not get a feel for whether these men were in fact \\"the conspirators\\" and that bothered and distracted me whenever I would see them throughout the film.  I don't think this is anything RR could have realized, but if he'd tested it on an audience, he might have heard that and also heard that his scene with the antsy conspirator is REALLY distracting and confusing.  In the VO he says what he was tryign to accomplish, but I don't think he did and he wasted valuable time on that which could have been used to make who these men were more clear and what they intended to do more clear so it could be followed when it happend on the screen.  As it was, it was just a jumble.  Even when they took Abe across the street (good scene) and then the War Sec comes in, he just looks at the boots!  Now thishas some cinematic value AFTER he makes a point to realize it is over with Abe, but he clearly would have looked at more than that at the getgo---so this was distracting.  The barn scene just looked low budget.  And the scene with the fiance is just dull and slow.  I heard what he said on the VO, but I really think testing it would have led to a MUCH better opening.  I also know he wanted to be authentic, hence the beards, but it would have been nice to have said, they all wore beards back then, and to have made it more 2011-viewer-cinematic-friendly without them.  So, why did I give it 5 stars?  It's an excellent movie and well told after those initial scenes.  It's suspeneseful right up to the end---I had no idea what was going to be the outcome and I wanted to know.  I came to care about both of the leads.  And the legal aspect of it was very interesting and enjoyable to me.  He did not put at the end that the sec of war was fired or that the pres was impeached (which you hear in the VO).  I think he should have added that onto the screen with the other outcomes.  Overall, I really liked this film and I learned a lot from it.  I really think this movie will be well-received by an older audience that likes documentaries and history.  I think he did a great job turning history into film!  If you are looking for fluff, this isn't it.  You have to be a \\"thinking\\" person to enjoy it.  I know he saw parallels with the modern day fears we face and the rush we make to judgment.  Everyone condemns the way Japanese-Americans were treated in the war, but then we saw what that fear was after 911 whenever we encountered an Arab-American.  Overall, it's clear to me that judging what people did throughout history often is difficult because we cannot feel their emotions.  RR conveys the emotion of that time and how it played out.
B004J4WKUQ|1.0|I hated this book on so many levels, it was bad in so many ways, that I just can't bring myself to write a review.
B0054N73EY|1.0|Being a long time fan, I got into the band in 1991 and worked backwards through their albums i was hoping for a return to form for the chili peppers. Sadly this new album doesnt return the band to their best days of BSSM or Mothers Milk. Having listened through the album a couple of times I find the whole album bland and has left me cold with no real stand out tracks. Most albums have strong songs, weak songs and a few average tracks, this album is pretty much 14 average songs. It doesnt help the fact that the mixing is flat, something that the peppers moaned about when they first started out.....they were always a live high energy band and struggled to capture that energy on record. This album is dead from a mixing point of view and does show that its about time that the peppers moved on from Rick Rubin. He produced their best album ever when they first used his services however its time for a change as he isnt doing anything for them sound wise anymore.  Every band changes and grows as they get older and their influences change as they listen to different things but the chilis dont sound like they did years ago and it feels like a different band now. Chad and flea used to be the high energy back bone of the band but now Chads drumming is samey and flea once the slap happy groove king tends to be happy playing simple disco basslines. Anthony used to be the man of amazing raps and cool lyrics, now he seems just to want to sing on songs and that was never his strong suit. As for Josh, hes ok and I dont bland him for this weak record as alot of people do. The thing is the chilis were never the same after John had spent many years on drugs, as it killed his guitar playing. Yes he did rejoin them and he did write some good new songs but the years on heroin had killed his ability to play guitar to the level he was able to back in the late 80's. I saw them live on the Californication tour and he couldnt play and did one note solos, it was pretty sad stuff. And so when John left the band they have ended up getting someone in the same vein as John and the way John had played for the last few years. I suppose it was an easy choice rather than pick someone like Dave Navarro who had his own playing style and who would change the bands sound too much. Unfortunately by picking Josh the band havent had the fresh energy the band needed to spark a musical revival for them but have just gone for a safe if bland option. The album is not all bad, tracks like Eythopia, and Brendans Dead song show a new more mature sound but all in all its a dull bland and badly mixed album and although alot of new young chili peppers will support them, most long time fans wont stick with the band for much longer. A missed opportunity and about time the band called it a day.

0670033375|3.0|The first chapter is rather long and thin on details relevant to the thesis of the book. There are some details about the environmental problems from mining and logging in Montana. This seems useful for understanding how societies collapse. But then Diamond spends a lot of pages on droll problems facing residents in a small valley in Montana. There are sanctimonious passages about how new-comers to the state from California are driving up real-estate prices, buying up the land and living isolated in gated communities. These problems are already covered in popular culture to the point of being cliche. The author recalls how he was horrified at  a movie theater placed near some farmland. He blames this on right-wing extremists that are opposed to government zoning laws. He has a point, but this is a bit of a red herring. He never explains how this is relevant to the rest of his book. It seems that this first chapter is a bit of soap-box for Diamond to talk about anecdotes from his vacation town. I was really disappointed to read this chapter as it is a bizarre way to start a book that is supposed to be an anatomy of why societies rise and fall. While the topics he brings up are important and need more awareness, they have little bearing on the overarching theme of the book and I am surprised that the editors allowed him to place this navel-gazing chapter to start the book.        The next few chapters are a bit better. Diamond gives backgrounds to a few remote islands that had societies that collapsed. These are stone-age societies living on the fringes of life and death. There is a good overview of the problems they faced and the likely causes for their demise. In this respect Jared Diamond's writing is superb. Here is an author who is gifted in research and presenting the facts or at least some well-founded speculation. But I found these societies to be outliers on the spectrum of humanity and only marginally instructive on problems faced in modern society.Diamond explores a few other early historic societies then jumps to the age of the Vikings. The omission of covering the collapse of the ancient Greeks or Roman empire is quite surprising. Throughout the book Diamond is using collapses of other societies to teach us about the problems facing our society. Surely at least one chapter covering opinions on the fall of the Roman empire would be material to the ideas of this book. Instead we get a detailed, and at times a bit long and boring, description of the problems facing remote settlements on Greenland.           As I continued reading this book I got the impression that this book is less a study of collapses and more of an opportunity for the author to travel to exotic places around the world. Throughout the book the author goes on tangents that are unrelated to the thesis of his book. There is the chapter of indignant Montana country folks indignant at the rich Californians coming to their quaint little valley, then there is a chapter dedicated to environmental problems in modern China or another about soil erosion in Australia. These are probably pretty important issues in their own right, but they are not important in the context of this book.          Diamond's writing can be really great. I loved Guns Germs & Steel, but this follow-up does not live up to that standard. It seems like Diamond started this book with a different thesis and maybe the editors or publisher changed the title to make it more catchy. I am not going to recommend this book to people who liked Guns, Germs and Steel. This books is pretty lengthy, and I think there are many other books that have more force and cohesion.

0545259088|5.0|How can I even summarize my thoughts? I looked forward to this book for months and months. I pre-ordered a finished copy last week. The ARC came first and I took two full days to read it. I could have read it in a half a day but I drank in the words and allowed the images to be conjured inside my head while enjoying the emotions of each of the characters. I loved every part of this book.     And I hate Minnesota.     *Caveat* I've only been to St. Paul and it was in February so it's an unfair assessment. I'm just saying.     This is the end of a trilogy. This is not the kind of trilogy that is painfully spread out with nothing happening in the second book but three solid books that needed the separation of being different books. However, in order to understand this book, the other two need to be read first. Go read them now. Go ahead. I'll wait.     For those who are still here, here's the summary:     Book 1: Grace finds naked Sam shot in the neck on her porch. She knows he is the wolf that watches her winter after winter. She does not know that Sam is also the book seller boy at The Crooked Shelf in town. The history of logistics of shifting from wolf to human to wolf are described. This sets up the rest of the series. Grace was also attacked as a child but never changed. This is explored extensively. Introduction of Isabel who takes bit** to a new level. Love her. Meet Rachel, the epitome of quirky. Adore her. Meet Shelby, the psychotic werewolf. Fear her.     Book 2: Sam and Grace are enjoying each other's company and all is peachy keen except that Grace is getting sicker and sicker. Beck is in his last human season. He has also introduced new wolves to the pack, including two members of an extremely popular rock group, NARKOTIKA. Cole is the lead in the group and you kind of have to hate him. At first. Then he really grows on you. Turns out, he has a charming personality and an I.Q. that is off the charts. Just like his singles. HA!     Book 3: This is the bookwhere we are seeking equilibrium. The wolf gene (?) is unstable and Cole is working on a cure. He is using himself as the patient which is messy and unpredictable. Isabel's father wants the wolves killed. Another girl is found mutilated. Slight spoiler - remember that psychotic werewolf? She's still psychotic and she's not dead. Who is human enough to problem solve? Is there are cure? Who will die? Who will live? How can Rachel still be so adorably quirky?     Stiefvater has the most amazing writing style. She describes details I often take for granted or includes a non-sequitur that is a game changer.     Quotes from ARC so there may be changes in final copy but I hope not. I really, really hope not.     \\"He looked away from me, as if he didn't expect me to have the answer, and instead looked at his hands, his fingers spread wide. He studied both sides of them, backs and then palms, his eyebrows drawn together. It was such a strange, intimate gesture that I glanced away. It reminded me of our funeral for Victor for some reason.\\"     Each scene, thought, description sets up the next one in a way that seems accidental but clearly is not. Each character is well defined and developed while never deviating from their personality. The book plays in my head like my favorite movie - memories surface and built on the story or the character, explaining why Sam is so quiet or Grace is so independent or Cole is so... Cole.     The end is bittersweet. Assumptions must be made on the part of the reader and I'm bitter that it's not going to be milked into just one more book but feeling deeply satisfied by the three books that are written and a little drunk on the words and imagery.
0345529057|3.0|To me each book gets worse.  Several of the more interesting characters are dead, and by the time u get to book 4 it is apparently divided in half - some characters stories will be told in book 5 rather than in book 4, making me think the overall story is never going to get anywhere or end!  I have read a lot of sci fi and fantasy - but never before skipped whole chapters.  Still, I will probably buy and suffer through book 5.  Or perhaps I'll by the DVDs - I hear they are good.

B0011E9LBI|4.0|Wow...this movie has been around for a few years now.  Where does time go?  I remember watching it when it first came out and must admit to you that I got a kick out of it.  Over the years I have viewed in a couple of more times and finally, the other night, my four dogs and I, in the wee hours of the morning as we were channel surfing (Something the dogs and I love to do as it is the only time we watch T.V., up popped this film yet again!  Well of course we watched it and I was surprised by the fact that I still got a kick out of the thing.  (The dogs were rather noncommittal as they were sound asleep after the first five minutes).<br /><br />Anyway, this is a movie that, for me, is simply fun to watch.  The story by this time is quite well known by anyone interested in watching this sort of movie. Briefly put, it is a tale of a very secret special agency whose entire job is to watch and monitor space aliens from throughout our galaxy who have come here to live for various reasons.<br /><br />Overall the movie is a grand parody, but unlike so many other films of this nature, it is done with a touch of tongue in cheek class and if the viewer does not take the film (and I might add, themselves) too seriously, then is a wonderful bit of escapism which is simply fun to watch.  We have all kinds of space critters inhabiting our world and our two Men in Black have a full time job monitoring their shenanigans while at the same time saving our galaxy from total destruction.<br /><br />The visual gags are quite good in this film as his the dialog.  While both may appear at first to be a bit hokey, they were actually meant to be.  Remember, this is a fun parody that does not take itself all that serious.  I loved the special effects in this film and there was enough bizarre action to hold my attention from start to finish.<br /><br />Not every movie is destined to neither play in art houses nor glean academy awards, nor should they; thank goodness!  Some movies are simply fun to watch for their entertainment value and escapist themes.<br /><br />For me, there was not much not to like about this film.  While it may not rise (or fall) to every person's taste, it certainly fulfilled the purpose to which I used if for.  Will I watch this thing again?  Probably so as I have no doubt it will be making the late night T.V. channels for years to come.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarksnment value and escapist themes.

B0033AI4CK|5.0|\\"I must make my witness.\\" --An important line of dialogue, said by Howard Beale (portrayed by Peter Finch, in an Oscar-winning role) from a film that remains ever prophetic, ever realistic, ever relevant, ever prescient.    I make no bones about it; I love this movie and it is my favourite of all-time. I first saw it in about 1998 or so, and I've been in love and enraptured by the film ever since. It hasn't lost any of its power; as America, and the world, struggle once more with a sluggish economy, feelings of personal and political impotence (related to unnecessary foreign entanglements!), it is important to remember that above all else, we, as citizens of a great nation, need to act. An important part of the famous \\"Mad as Hell\\" monologue from the film:     \\"We know things are bad - worse than bad. They're crazy. It's like everything everywhere is going crazy, so we don't go out anymore. We sit in the house, and slowly the world we are living in is getting smaller, and all we say is, 'Please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms. Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-belted radials and I won't say anything. Just leave us alone.'\\" And that is why action, now more than ever, is important.     It is rather troubling and disturbing to me to me that so many people, who actually were alive during the era that this movie was released, are unaware of it. A very, very culturally and historically significant film. It has been regarded rather highly by many critics, both then and now. The only reason I can find behind this ignorance stems from the fact that this is a largely pessimistic film and an open call to arms --two things that Americans during the bicentennial (and even now) did not want to hear. Thus, it is not surprisingly that the Best Picture winner that year (in a contest that included not just Network, but also Taxi Driver, All the President's Men, and Bound for Glory), that the winner was Rocky. It was also a sign of the times that even though Rocky won --by far the most optimistic bunch of the movies up for the award--it still was fairly a downer (Rocky, after all, did lose the boxing match).     It is a sad commentary that this call to arms has not been heeded; it seems (based on voting numbers and statistics) that Americans gave up on America when it was obvious the Great Society of LBJ had failed them. Again, it may be the method of delivery; nobody wants to be reminded of how bad things are and  that they may (or may not) be complicit.     I speak so much of politics in this review because, for better or for worse, this is a political film, from a highly political era.     The direction is superb and Network is definitely one of the better films from its director, Sidney Lumet, who died earlier this year. Admittedly, there are some fairly weak works in his cannon, but that is bound to happen, as he was active from 1957 to 2007, a remarkable stretch of time; however, if an active artist only produces 1 good work in 50 years, that is enough (some only produce 1 or 2, period!). Luckily, this is not the only masterpiece in Lumet's cannon, which includes 12 Angry Men (1957) and Dog Day Afternoon (1975).    The writing is also top-notch, from the very political and polemical Paddy Chayefsky. His great works include Marty (1955) and The Hospital (1971) --both of which, in addition to Network, yielded awards for Best Screenplay.    And, of course, the acting is also well-regarded. It won 3 of the 4 acting awards (only losing Best Supporting Actor). It is a pity that Peter Finch won posthumously, that Bill Holden died shortly after, and that Faye Dunaway's work slipped in quality thereafter (Mommie Dearest, anyone?). It seems to be one of those great moments in time, when quality actors, a seasoned director, and a well-recognized writer came together to produce a work far greater than the sum of its parts.    There are, however, some glaring flaws.     Among them: the cinematography. I don't think it matters if you actually did see this on the Big Screen or at home; as important as images are, they don't seem to be what matters. No one, that I know of, has ever commented on the quality of the actual images.     And, of course, there are the several, abrupt tonal shifts. The movie has been, and somewhat accurately, noted for slipping into some sort of farcical self-parody at some point. It does start out excellent, drag a bit in the middle, and finish on an absurd sort of note. How much of this was intentional, I do not know.     There are, of course, some dated elements. These sort of things are inescapable in a satire such as this, unfortunately. Fortunately, the film does transcend these shortcomings, for the most part.     This is overall an excellent film, well worth the watch even if it does have some flaws. Network stands proudly as part of America's rich cultural legacy. The themes it touches upon have not gone away; indeed, in the era of the 24 hour news cycle, the film rings even truer.

B001TOD92C|5.0|You normally hear that he who lives by the sword dies by the sword, but as I've said before, WHATEVER you live by, you will also die by.  it seems that no matter what you make your focus in life, that focus eventually kills you.  You become obsessed with it, long after the aid it brings abandons you.  And the Wrestler is certainly not immune to this inevitability.  In fact, he is less immune to it than most people, because of his heart, his persistence, and his intense desire.  The thing he loves most becomes the death of everything else he loves, and when only that one thing is left, it collapses in on itself as well.  Nothing remains.  A tragedy beyond tragedy.  Shakespeare would envy this movie.
