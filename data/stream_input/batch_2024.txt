B007KZY1YY|5.0|Great book, continues where the first one finished without a gap. Same style of the author is noticable. Enjoyed reading it!
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I love this book so much if you ever have the chance to read it read the first two books before you do so you can understand the third one.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|watch this and at the end you discover the tie-in to an older movie was a total surprise to me

B004SD5GZ4|1.0|DOESN'T WORK!! Downloaded it at least 3 times and each time it wouldn't responde so it doesn't work. It downloads but doesn't function.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Truly enjoyable; maintains momentum throughout.  It gets a bit hokey in the romance department, only slightly, but is otherwise outstanding.  I purchased it based on existing reviews, and am happy to have found it.  It definitely leaves one wanting more.  I do!
B00065F86U|5.0|need for the D3 batter i nthe D300 grip works and i never take the battery off of this, no issues and fit in my grip perfect
B001MSMULG|5.0|Like all the Gabriel Allon series books. Always well written with a credible plot and the end is never what you expect.
B002361MLA|5.0|I was looking for a book to guide me while I'm trying to be more present. I think I found it! I like how it has you stop at certain points and ponder what you've read. It's sinking in and hopefully I'll be living in the Now soon!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love it highly reccomend for horse lovers the graphics are great in my opinion but honestly i think ull luv it
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love Facebook!  There I find wonderful pictures and notes from Family, Friends and 'long-lost' folks that it is fun to renew our friendships!!
B007KZY1YY|5.0|I loved the trilogy! The author is amazing in creating a feeling that you know the characters! I loved the 3rd and 2nd book the best and am super sad that its finishd
B0007VZ91C|2.0|Another disappointing CD. Deva Premal had one great great CD and that was THE ESSENCE. She needs to recapture the spirit of spirituality again in her next CD as she really has lost it in her two recent CDs.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|I loved this book. This author is AMAZING! Loved using my new kindle app on my phone to read it because i was 2 impatient to wait till i had the book
B003CNQPNS|4.0|K.I.T.T. had a mute cousin, its name was Street Hawk. Why was this cancelled? Why isnt it on reruns? Tv Land exists for this reason.
0671042858|5.0|This novel is one of Stephen King's lesser known works but like all his books the quality is extremely high.I would personally rate this relatively short novel up there with his bigger and better known titles. The story is itself fairly simple, a girl gets lost in the woods with only her radio walkman connecting her to civilization while she struggles to find her way out of the woods. She listens to the radio broadcasts of the Boston Red Sox baseball games and her hero Tommy Gordon. Meanwhile there is something stalking her in the darkness of the woods. The genius of King is that he takes a simple premise like that and builds it into an absorbing story that addicts the reader until the very last page. Like all of King's novels you will enjoy this book.
B004HO6HWA|4.0|Awesome remake, better ending, more action, Statham is the new Stallone. They should offer this with the original as a 2 pack.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Not as graphic as I thought.  I enjoyed the story line but hated the ending. Leaves you ready for the next book.
B0042AEOG0|4.0|good cd but a few repeats and the new years song?. but how can anything she do be wrong, it cant.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|I really enjoy this series and recomend it for anyone.  Its for all ages and kids love the magical theme
B000009ED0|5.0|Before he sold out kid rock destoyed with this album. The answereing machine interlude is hilarious, it should be listed and available as its own track.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have been looking for a horse app like this on and have finally found one I like!! This app works great on my kindle fire. I love this app so much!!(:
B009O07NBQ|5.0|It arrived quickly and the music is absolutely amazing! It says a lot when a 16 year old teenager wants to put this on his ipod and listen to it over and over and over!
B00633W614|4.0|The suspense builds.  Will Harry and Emma ever get together?  What will be the decision of the court as to who gets the Barrington title?
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I downloaded this book while staying in the hospital with my mother. It's an easy read and takes a surprising twist in middle that I did not see coming. A good book for a quick read.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|To know there are those willing and able to do what Marcus did for our country is beyond inspiring. Proud to be an American and fellow Texan
B004T5R2HQ|4.0|I have a Droid Incredible. It takes a bit of getting used to aligning docs and pics for the best shot, as well as proper back lighting. Glossy photos are tricky because the flash may end up as a spot on the scanned photo. Navigating the app is a bit clunky. I think they could simplify it some.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this game. Solitaire delivers hours of enjoyment for people of all ages. Great way to pass the time w h enjoyment travelling or wait in the airport or anywhere else.
B0052ZYYD2|5.0|This is a great compilation of Iron Maiden's songs for 20 years.  Unless you have all the albums for this period, it is an excellent value and well worth adding to the collection.
B000PGNDYO|3.0|Good book, I already had one and wanted to get a copy for my significant other. I rated it a three because the shipper took over a month to deliver. Ridiculous to have to wait that long.
B00138CYD4|4.0|This album is a treasure trove of memorable Santana hits.  Add to that a low price and it is definitely worth buying.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|I didn't think this book was as great as the other reviews made it out to be. It was a little suspenseful, but you know the answer of &#34;who did it&#34; from the very beginning, so it makes the rest of the book seem forced and not very interesting and didn't really keep me interested in it the whole time. There were several parts where I had to read it one or two times over because I couldn't focus on what was going on and kept drifting off.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|How can any company feel good about advertising an item that has a hd camera and then after you purchase the kindle tell you that you have to purchase a special app for the camera to work. Rip off that is what I feel about that.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The premise of this novel was unique.  The plot twists kept you guessing and reading to discover the next turn of events. The main characters, both deeply flawed, were nonetheless interesting. It was the ending that bothered me most.  Plot holes were evident and it was as if the author just stopped because there was no plausible way to fill them in.
B009GED3HS|5.0|Couldn't wait for reruns for season 8, so I bought the first eight shows...that should tell you what I think of this show :)
0141335734|5.0|In US usually in new books they start putting on the market just the hardcopy version which is expensive however sometimes the paperback copy is issued ahead of time in UK. Through amazon it is possible to get these books, save some money and in my case continue your collection of paperback copies. In the case of Heroes of Olympus the UK edition is a little more taller than the paperback editions of Peter Jackson other books in US (as it is different printer house) but I like much better the covers and the paper is of good similar quality. I will continue buying UK books as convinient like in this case.
B007FZ7R7W|5.0|What is there not to love? I love all the cd's I have by him! I love his style and voice. He is the next MJ! It's just wonderful!
B00425S1H8|5.0|Normally I don't review the products, but this is the best usb to serial adapter ever! Plug-n-play in Windows 7 x64
B005LAJ16I|5.0|After hearing so many people say what a great series this was I thought I would buy it for my husband for Christmas.  We watched the first season then went to our On Demand with FIOS and watched the second season (all within a week.)  Now we are ready for the third season.  So many twists and turns!  Great!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I find this game challenging, yet relaxing.  The lower levels are fun and as one progresses to the more difficult levels it causes a person to focus on the game and forget everyday stress.  I have a 12 year old granddaughter who likes to help and show me the solutions at times, which makes me feels good to see that she also likes challenges and has the ability to solve problems.  I whole heartedly recommend this game for people of all ages.
B00A2FSSHK|4.0|Good acting and great story line. Would totally re-watch it again and recommend it to others. Filling in the word requirement...
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|real good graphics are good can battle other players build your military from scratch vehicles that pass through the base helps with money
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|I think this is a good game to have.  I am not too good with it yet but that doesn't make it a bad game.<br />The only thing I don't like is I can't see the whole picture.
0762434279|1.0|The book I received was tiny, almost joke like. I would have never ordered this book if I knew the actual size of it. It was actually quite ludacris. Do not order the miniature version, you’ll be extremely disappointed. The seller didn’t make it clear that the book was a miniature. Very disappointed!<br /><br />I would not recommend!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|The more I get used to this from the kindle - the better it is.<br />I like being able to &#34;check in&#34; and see if anything is happening.
0593070631|5.0|the product arrived as scheduled.  Great quality.  recommend to anybody who is interested in buying.  Thank you for the good service.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I really enjoy being able to check the weather anytime I want from my Kindle.  Great - good thing to have at my fingertips.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|It is very easy to use and protects your Kindle Fire.  The strap on it can be put out of the way for use and does not interfere with your reading.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|Pictures are somewhat fuzzy looking. We will have to use it more and get more familiar with it and hopefully the picture quality might improve.
B006X5L6VS|4.0|The Night Sky is a nice tool for the amateur astronomer or star gazer just becoming familiar with the celestial &#34;neighborhood.&#34;
B0090O07RS|5.0|It's about time the Doors got it right with one of their releases.  This show sounds really nice off my Sony sound bar & the extras on the blue ray are pretty cool too! Happy customer, now they need to clean up some of their audio releases.
B004Q7CIFI|1.0|Interesting concept but it that is about it.  Goes out with a wimper rather than a bang. A waste of time.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|When you've finished reading it you still don't know what was the right thing to do..Lesson is everyone  comes into our life for a reason and we have to take away  what we have learned from that person.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I LOVED this book series and unlike some others, I LOVED the unexpected ending! Life is not perfect and I love how this book ended in a not perfect, perfect ending!
B006KX3GXO|4.0|I really like this application. It has a lot of different options and choices to do with your photos. It is very easy to understand and work.
B00005N6KG|5.0|These headphones were purchased as a Christmas gift.  The person who received this headphone set is very happy with them.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I chose this season because I have the other four seasons and I love the show....not too fond of Iron Gates but she had some pretty big shoes to fill after Montegomery. It's fun and witty and the banter between all the characters is wonderful.
B005VPRDAY|5.0|Cute stuff.  My daughter liked the car, and played with the house for a long time after we put it together.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Not only does it have a large and really great selection of sounds but you can mix them. You just choose which ones you want together but you can also set the volume on each individual sound as well as the master volume. Best sound machine app EVER!!!!!
B007N8RULO|5.0|App is good, no problems at all.  It is a fun way to relax. I would recommend for anyone of any age.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie is so funny, it's ridiculous.  Fat Amy is easily the best thing about this movie, and I would love to see more of her.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Was looking for a quick read for the holiday weekend and this one didn't disappoint.  This is the first Nick Sparks novel I've read, though I've seen a few of his movies, with the Notebook being one of my all time favorite movies.  Alex and Katie's characters weren't as well developed as I would've hoped, but they were likable enough for the quick read I was looking for.  Although the main storyline was fairly predictable, the &#34;Jo&#34; twist kept me guessing almost to the end.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I think that, of the trilogy, this was my favorite book.  It's well written and the plot is exciting without going overboard (which isn't saying much given the plot).
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Things I love about a book....well developed characters, surprising twists, scenes that can bring my emotions to the surface (crying, laughing out loud, making my heart beat fast), and a great love story, and a desire to read it again when I'm done.<br /><br />This book had it ALL!
B0071DJZZA|5.0|Why wouldn't you buy the movie tie in version of the book?  It's significantly cheaper than the regular version.  It's also a very good book, better than the movie, which lacked character development.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Rian Johnson creates a lived-in dystopia with a time travel a secret of the criminal underground.  Then he fills the world with strong characters and makes you consider and reconsider why you feel the way you do about them.  Do you want them to succeed or change history?  He also makes you reconsider your reactions and expectations; do you want that violent revenge on terrible people?  Would you do something terrible for a good reason?
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|holds my interest; just a little bit coincidental in spots, otherwise a good tom clancy.  i can't help but wonder just how much cyber stuff he describes is actually possible.  i'll read it again in a little while.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I was hesitant to read these books. I mean vampires that sparkle?! Not any that I had ever read about or seen on tv. These books are absolutely wonderful. It's more a love story than a vampires story. I wish I could find my own Edward but since I can't I will just have to read them all over again. So sad it is the end of the series but it was well worth it!
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Recommend to everyone everywhere<br />.<br />Really like this game. In depth detailed enjoyable<br />Must have game of the century.<br />No joke. Ps download it now
0425238091|5.0|My psychiatrist recommended this and it is very good. Humorous, sad, lots of insight into the world of medicine. great!
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I love this movie and I love that I was also sent an instant download for my Kindle Fire HE!!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I am so glad my husbad overheard a conversation while getting his hair cut about this author. The man next to him was talking about the movie Jack Reacher, that it was an awsome movie and that the writer had a series of books with this character. I was looking for another series to read and this knocked my socks off. I could not put the book down. Lee Child is an exceptional author who takes you on a ride through his words. I highly recommed this book and am on the second Jack Reacher book right now and am looking forward to reading them all. You won't be dissappointed. Just Do It.
B00AHSINKO|4.0|Makes you stop and think &#34;it is worth saving&#34;.. watch the movie and you will find out.<br />Movie leans more towards being a chick flick but I really liked it.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Every book of his i read I cry. The ending was perfect and one that was unexpected. A must read
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|best mouse I could ever use to play games! it has a bunch of awesome things you can modify is just awesome with a good price!!! best moue you will ever use
B00A0NOF7G|5.0|I liked the title and cover initially. It was just a quick read to get me through a flight. I enjoyed reading it, and recommend it.
B000FC0V3E|5.0|Great Book To Start With When It Pertains To Hemingway. Captivates You From The Beginning And Doesn'T Till The End.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|very fun game..puzzles in a puzzle...many different ways to play and change it up..hours of fun and entertainment..when you finish you want to start over again.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Bought this for my son for Christmas. He loved it. got it at a good price and came by Christmas Eve.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|It suits my travelling style and gives me better information than my cell phone.  It's Simple and easy to use
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Anyone interested in the air war of WWII, or human nature will enjoy this book. It's vivid account of German fighter ops, over North Africa and Europe and American bomber ops over Europe makes for a great read. It's also a sobering account of human nature at it's worst and at it's best.
B009G78EE2|5.0|This is an amazing album.  I would say Maclemore is a mix of Eminem and Calle 13.  It's the first English language rap album that I know of that has a social justice message and maintains true to life grit.  It contains some heavy, traumatic songs (like Neon Cathedral and Starting Over), uplifting and encouraging songs (like Make the Money and Can't Hold Us), and downright hilarious songs (like Thrift Shop).  Macklemore and Ryan Lewis are a refreshing duo that help bring artistry back to the music charts.
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|This movie is good........I honestly need to watch it a couple more times to get te &#34;full effect&#34; of it.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|the sheer space that it took up amazed me. the ends of the tubes got in the way of my plexi glass cutout, but i just solved that problem by simply moving it to the outside. it works really well. it keeps my processor between 62 - 64 degrees Fahrenheit. pretty chilly for a cpu.
B000008LL2|5.0|I bought this CD for one song, and like usual I enjoy the entire CD,,, who would of guessed?  Thunder is an awesome band
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Couldn't put it down! Best book I've read in a long time. No extensive drawn out wordy descriptions, just great story line filed with twists and turns.
B0032SMR1W|5.0|I enjoy the psych-thrillers..... this one was very interesting, andI have watched it multiple times, and always see something I missed the last time I watched it
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was amazing. It's a little slow at first, but it gets amazing. I've of the best books I've ever read.
B0055PMURG|5.0|I got this movie as a &#34;family&#34; movie, what a great choice.  All seven of us have watched this a couple of times and have enjoyed it
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I watched the movie first but was very please with the details to make me understand everything better. I will recommend reading this trilogy to everybody.
B0086700CM|5.0|I\\" here to say temple run is wonderful (hallelujah noises)  I loge it because it so  addicting and fun.  If you like games that are a little graphic and face pace and thinking what to do next I recommend temple run.  Also try temple run 2 on iTunes I don\\"t think Amazon has it you can try if anyone finds it reply to this message.  Coconut G. Out!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is so very well written. Everyone should read this book! Kids all ages are going to love this book. I don't recommend it for kids ages 5-8.
0525478817|5.0|I absolutely LOVED the book. i've read so many books over the years andthis is my favorite and I cried through out the book and it just helped me understand so many concepts of world. I loved it. There isn't just a book that tells you a story and shows how people went through something...it goes beyond the meaning of just a book. It creates a whole new perspective and it just exceeds the definition of a \\"book\\" I wish there were more books out there. The way the story stars and the non-chalant way the story continues but with so much depth at the same time is just so amazing to me. John Green really out did himself this time and I wish his work was more recognized. I wish I could just read it all over again. Sometimes you come across books that you want to quote out of, because those quotes speak to you but this book..this is the first time I've felt like I could quote the entire book. Its beautiful. Its versatile. Its..close to perfection. For me, its perfection. I love love love LOVED it.
B005FHXB0O|5.0|I've watched this movie many times and finally decided to own it.  I can't wait to watch it again. Tonight.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|You should get this app because it helps you but it doesn't charge it it just shows you what it's at it has no viruses
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|Ms. Wilhelmina \\"Minnie\\" Pursling is hiding a scandalous secret. One that she will do everything she can from ever coming out, but a chance meeting with Duke Robert Blaisdell threatens to expose her. The more she retreats as a wall flower, the more intrigued he becomes. He pursues her relentlessly and surprises her with a marriage proposal, but Robert has his own secret. He's the author of handbills that incite the poor working in the factories to strike. When an innocent man is accused of writing the handbills, Robert must decide how far he'll go to save him from a life in prison. Will he be willing to do the honorable thing? Will he be willing to expose another's secret in the process?<br /><br />This historical romance was quite enjoyable, especially the dialogue between Minnie and Robert and Minnie and the Duchess. It was smart and witty, but there were a few things that didn't quite add up for me. The build up of Minnie's secret was intriguing, but when it was finally revealed, it was anticlimactic for me.  I am willing to suspend belief for most things, but Robert's secret was even harder to swallow. Why wouldn't he use his power and considerable means to help make the factory workers' lives more bearable instead of inciting them to strike especially since it was a crime to do so. Finally, I wanted to learn what became of Minnie's friend, Lydia. The one sentence in the epilogue didn't seem to do the character justice especially since she was so important to Minnie.<br /><br />Despite these criticisms, THE DUCHESS WAR, kept my interest until the very end. Fans of historical romance will enjoy this book.<br /><br />I received a copy of this book in exchange for a fair and honest review.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Believable unreality. Possible streams of alternate scenarios. Something everybody can and will be drawn into , a masterpiece of what if.
B00ATU5JRA|1.0|tried to use app on my kindle fire said it needed another app tried that wont load 2nd app so no use for it
B00A6PD8RQ|2.0|Brave takes CG animation to a new level and is a visual feast, however, the story line is weak and the movie loses steam and focus just when it should crescendo.  The title is a misnomer.  The heroine isn't as brave as she is a self-centered narcissist, but that will appeal to the teenage and 20 something set for whom this mindset is normative.  But perhaps mother-daughter conflicts are just not as appealing to me as other plot devices. I was expecting something along the lines of  &#34;How to Train Your Dragon&#34;, but it falls way short.
0062082353|5.0|was a great read about the front lines that our military snipers deal with, very informative and interesting of the world most of us will never see!
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|If you would let Tarantino do an episode of Boardwalk Empire, the result might look approximately like this. Thrilling, violent, sometimes surprising, sometimes actually beautiful, and with great acting.<br />I liked it a lot. It suffers a little from the claim to 'reality' and the narrative concept of letting one of the brothers Bondurant tell the story from the off. It could have been much more compact and on a higher suspense level if it had been a straight story script.<br />A prohibition story. Three brothers run a successful still in the woods. The law is both with them, via corrupt cops, and against them, via other corrupt cops. The brothers are cultivating a legend of immortality. They seem to believe their own legend themselves.<br />Tom Hardy in a role like specially written for him. The grouchy super macho, the one who takes no prisoners and accepts no compromises. The one who ogles the girl and hesitates. As Jessica Chastain's character says: you let a girl wait an awfully long time. Chastain is a true miracle to me. 2 years ago I had never heard of her and now she is the queen of the screen. She is really very good.<br />Best supporting actor: Gary Oldman as a gangster called Floyd Banner. If that man didn't exist, he should be invented. Oldman, I mean.
B00A6SZS2Q|2.0|Let me start out by saying that I was a big fan of We Stitch These Wounds, Set the World on Fire, & the Rebels EP, but this release is such a major let down.  The only word that comes to mind is underwhelming.  BVB seem to have lost their edge completely and have turned out an entire album of sub-par arena rock style anthems.  Gone are the great melodies, hooks, lyrical content, and aggressive nature of the music.  They used to be a metal band.  Now they sound like they are trying to gain mainstream acceptance by changing into a pop rock band.  I thought their message was supposed to be stay true to yourself?  Seems like they need to listen to their own advice.  I am all for a natural evolution of a band and I never expect bands to sound the same from album to album, but this release is such a departure from their previous work that it seems like a major sell out for a bigger fan base and more $$$.  BVB devotees will like whatever they put out, but I doubt I will ever listen to this again.  Here's hoping that on the next release they find their spark again.  This is just bland.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|They tell you is free and after you play once can't play unless you upgrade the game and pay to it.

B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I have been ready Clancy since Red October Threat Vector was every bit as good as all.I didn't want it to end.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Really enjoyed watching it!  Easy to access and watch on Amazon.  More economicable than purchasing the DVD.  Instant availabity made it convenient for me.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Attention! Anyone who loves horses will love this app!<br />The graphics and sound effects are realistic!<br />Being a horsewoman, I especially enjoy this game!<br />Great experience for those, of whom someday would like to have a real horse of their own, focusing on the care that really goes into caring for this amazing animal!<br />Great job developing!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The Kitchen House is a great book that is difficult to put down. The historical period of time was extremely interesting.
B004I744AS|5.0|I cannot say enough great things about this app!<br />You can use it online, or download the offline version. Both are free!<br />I like how you can customize your homepage with horoscope &amp; games like spelling and hangman, dates in history, etc.<br />Having the Thesaurus within this Dictionary app is very convenient for a writer, such as myself!<br />Truly fantastic and highly recommended to everyone, especially students!<br /><br />Thank You!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was a real page turner. You thought you had it figured out and  it would change again. Highly recommend it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this app is very fun and I enjoy playing it! however it is very slow when I am using it<br />you have your own horse and it is amusing and cool.
B00A6SZRJ0|5.0|This album is a masterpiece in every aspect. The compositions are complex, dramatic, emotive and spiritual. All themes stunned me. Compared with TSFH previous works, this one is far improved. &#34;SkyWorld&#34; is a must in a refined music collection!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is loads of fun.<br />You compete feed clean and much more.<br />At the begging it is annoying but at level three it gets very fun.<br />I'm sure you will love this app
B00A6PD9I4|2.0|Usually I enjoy Disney/Pixar works.  That being said, this has got to be the poorest attempt at a decent story line I've seen in a while.  The characters are enjoyable and the overblown cultural stereotypes will bring out laughs.  After the movie is over, however, you'll probably be left wondering exactly what you just experienced.  The moral component of this story is humility over pride and love over control.  Some of the ideas were really good and the graphics were incredible, but the story is so disjointed and incomplete that it brings the movie down - way down. Some of the bear scenes as well as the witch scene will probably be a little too much for younger kids.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its great. the horses are done wonderfully. and it is great for all ages. my three year old loves it too
1455523550|5.0|Love Nicholas Sparks...every book is great reading!  Have to see the movie now! Waiting for his next one! I'm never disappointed
B000B5MI3Q|1.0|While I initially liked the idea of an automatic watch, I quickly realized that no amount of arm movement kept the watching running at the correct time.  I put up with it because I really liked the style and the fact that I could dive with it without ever opening up the case to replace a battery.  Unfortunately, over time, after resetting the time virtually every day, I needed to replace the o-ring in the crown. While I don't see this problem listed in other reviews, I'm curious if my watch has always been defective, or if others have failed to mention this issue.
0316067598|5.0|Very interesting to read what the Navy Seals have to go through.  This is a book that's hard to put down.  I am having a little trouble with the profanity, but I realize that's how it is.. Have to overlook it.Just finished reading this. Hard to put down, but had to get away for a while because I was in tears trying to read it. What an ordeal Marcus had to go through. I imagine this will be hard for him to overcome.God bless our service men(and women) for what they do for us!
B0017UOUEY|3.0|I do not remember buying this.  Must have been my son so you can not go by rating of It's Okay, sorry.
B003G4W49C|5.0|A very interesting book and was written perfectly. It always kept me on my toes to see what happened next.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|My grandson and I love this series and have watched all four seasons.  So of course, I had to buy this one for us to watch together.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|A fun game, good puzzles, and engaging storyline.  A bit more money then I like to spend on a game, but it was fun.
0440236738|5.0|I read one Harlan Coben book and fell in love with him.  So I went on Amazon and bought all that you had.  thank you
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I rate this book a four because it's very entertaining and I enjoyed it. It may not start off interesting the first few letters but don't stop reading trust me, it will get better.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Very interesting characters coming together to deal with a random, real life situation.  Take a moment to think about your &#34;right to die&#34; and should you have that choice??
B001I8A76A|4.0|We loved Funhouse it was just as good as her new album The Truth About Love, way to go Pink. I liked the hot picture on the album too!
B002WN35DC|3.0|I'm learning Spanish as a second language, so good children's literature is about what I can handle.  I found the text delightful, and the translation clear and easy for me.  I had forgotten some details of the story and enjoyed reading it again.<br /><br />The big downside is that the kindle version does not have the illustrations, and I think they are a big part of the charm.  If it had all the illustrations, I'd give it a 5.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Got a new Kindle Fire and could not wait to download Angry Birds. I had heard from tons of people how much fun it was. I really don't see what all the fuss is about. You slingshot birds (different sizes, shapes, colors etc) into different objects attempting to clear the other &#34;critters&#34; on the screen and obtain 3 stars.  Was tired of game after about 15 minutes. Not fast paced enough for my taste. Apparently, Angry Birds is not for me. I would much rather play Jewel Quest or something faster paced. Its free so definately worth a try to see if you like it.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I was extremely pleased at how diverse and mesmerizing this album is! If you're expecting all of the tracks on this album to sound similar to their latest single \\"It's Time\\" then you're in for a surprise. It has been a long time since I've listened to an album all the way through without skipping any songs... Each song is unique in its lyrics & melody. My favorites include \\"Tip Toe\\", \\"Demons\\" and \\"Hear Me\\" but every song is definitely worth listening to! \\"Night Visions\\" is absolutely wonderful.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|The game is fun until it starts sending your drawings out into the black hole. Once it showed a drawing in replay that never even got to my opponent but it showed the guess from a different drawing!! You can't get out of the ads without going completely out of the game.  If not for these problems it would rate a 5.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|One of the best shows on tv, I love that every season is completely different. And it is always full of surprises and lots of twists
0152067043|5.0|The story was cute and made me smile.  The illustrations are adorable.  Great addition to any child's library. Well done.
B0081FO2Q4|5.0|Love hearing this song. I think Ed wrote this song in respect and honor of a broken soul at the homeless shelter. It's tender, raw and great use of his creative energy.<br />I look forward to more of his work.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|Hardly remember what the story was about, but as I was reading it was mildly distracting enough to keep me going. Don't recommend.
B000PEX1IE|2.0|the picture quality was blurry some time for paying 5 bucks but the over all movie was great love bill murry
B00AQMSJI2|5.0|This game is so much fun.  I find my self checking on my workers every 2 or 3 hours to see if they've finished breaking this boulder or chopping down that tree so that I came expand my town.  Never before have I wanted to spend $100 on a game, and a childs game at that!!??
B00008VGL6|5.0|I was expecting to hear something that remain me of Depeche Mode. It is great, audio is incredible, price really inexpensive and a hard to get. Love it
0920668372|5.0|I as a lil girl i loved this book when it was read to me in school. I saw it on here and hadn't read it in so many years. I bought it for my two year old and put a message in it... I think she will love it when she understands it... I recieved it today read it to myself and cried ... I sure do love this book
B001NLKT60|5.0|It's a good thriller, but very different from the first book. I got hooked and finished it very very fast.
B00AHSINKO|3.0|The movie itself was fine. The problem was the last few minutes of movie did not download. I hope this problem does not occur on my next purchase
160774273X|4.0|Good for those who are interested in the &#34;science geek factor&#34; of breadmaking.  Nice photos and good text, etc.  It is too detailed to get all of what you might want from it by borrowing it from the library (which is what I did at first).
B000002O7C|5.0|I've been wanting this album for a long time. As soon as I got it, I uploaded it onto my iPod. When I listened to it, it sounded so beautiful. Basil Poledouris did a great job with this. I recommend this for silver screen music lovers.
B00AHSMDQY|2.0|I wouldnt recommend renting this. It has about 1 hour of extra dialogue and is pretty uneventful in my opinion. You should wait for it to come out on cable and sleep through it then.
B0072OFM28|5.0|Have recieved this one, only! Payed for all of them and have only gotten Vengeance. Why could you not mail them out together?
1400067820|4.0|but... you are not a relaxed reader when taking on this.  It requires that you read and reread certain pieces, it is well done but you must be in a wide awake, and searching mode to take it in.  You almost have to stop to conciously pack it into the right crevices of your brain, ha!  I am but half way thru now, and will take my time reading it all.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is one of the best games ever!!! I can't wait to see what you come up with next!  I can't wait!!!
030759565X|4.0|Beautiful pictures and clear, funny directions made me stay up late reading it cover to cover the day it arrived.
0765325950|5.0|A very good ending to the series.  Basically a whole book dedicated to the last battle.  The previous two books were awesome and written by Sanderson, this one was written by Jordan so if you didn't like it, blame him.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Just adorable.  It is one of those slow paced games, my seven year old daughter spends a lot of time on this one.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|A real app for facebook on the Fire. The other way just wasn't cutting it. This app works just like what I'm used to on my phone.
B00A757EFW|5.0|Pac-man has always been a hit. Was very pleased to have the option to put it on my kindle fire.
B0084U0IEG|5.0|It is another great novel by Ian Mcewan.  He slowly leads you into a world of suspense and mystery.  I would say it is great
B00973DDN2|3.0|I don't know. Some songs are good, and some are meh. I got really sick of the songs quickly, because they all kind of sound the same. It's an ok album, but I guess I was expecting great after their hiatus.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|Loved the book.  Written well.  Wonderful descriptions of life in India and the intermarriage of caucasian woman to Indian man.
B007MU85D0|5.0|I know I'm behind the masses here, but I just purchased this album not long ago. I love it. I can listen to all of the songs without wanting to skip any. They are similar to The Head and the Heart (which I highly recommend). Very good album!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|The complexity of the mother-daughter relationship was told in way that had warmth, humor, and tension all wrapped up with adventure and celtic music.  Lots of fun!
0784011680|5.0|Love Robert Downey, Jr. in this.  He was authentic in his portrayal in every stage of Chaplin's life, and I'm a big Chaplin fan from way back.  Loved this movie.
B003TSEL7S|4.0|The Lost Hero starts where The Last Olympian left off.  The world is safe from the Titans and the demigods still exist.  However, Rick Riordan throws a wrench into the series, Romans.  It seems that the God we were introduced to in the first series actually are both the Greek and Roman gods of the Myths.  Not only that, but if their Roman counterpart has a child, they are considered a Roman demigod.  EVEN MORE, there is ANOTHER camp of demigods on the other side of the country, because the Romans and the Greeks do not like each other.  The new series definitely differs from the first, because it is written in third person and follows one of the three new main characters for chapters at a time.  If you loved The Olympians series, you will love the Heroes of Olympus series as well.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Took a couple of days, but nice to be brought up to date before viewing the 3 series. Two more words required? Why?
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book and The Battle of the Labyrinth are my favorite two of this series.  Both are action packed, set the stage for the end war between the demigods and the Titans, and wraps up the series perfectly.  The twist ending of the prophecy is definitely worth the read as well!  What are you waiting for, pick this series up from the start!
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Loved the concept and lesson taught in this throwback movie. We watched it with our 3 kids -6,8,10 years old. They all loved it
B008K9UZY4|5.0|I never played Sonic CD growing up, but I have watched many a playthrough and review of the game.  This is probably one of the best ports of the game, which is weird saying that a tablet version is better.  I can't wait to play through the game myself and enjoy it for the first time.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Absolutely beautiful DVD.  One I will watch repeatedly.  The entire DVD is outstanding.  Well created and well performed.  I recommend it to anyone who loves musicals and/or the original story.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|For some reason, the Facebook app on my Kindle Fire is horrible.  It doesn't load my full news feed, instead cuts it off and doesn't even format each news story right.  It's wonky and shaky and overall sucks.  If you want Facebook on your Kindle, the better option is the mobile site on Silk.
B004ZA9HB4|4.0|Connects very easy to my samsung smart tv. the hd looks great and with some great content keep up the great work
B00280LYIM|5.0|I love fantasy/science fiction the best out of any genre.  Percy Jackson takes it a step further by making me want to learn more about Greek Mythology.  The Battle of the Labyrinth is probably the best if not second to the next book in the series, The Last Olympian.  Must read!
B005EWDA3I|4.0|I'm more of a Lee Childs, Jonathon Kellerman fan i.e action crime so when i started reading the IQ84 books by Haruki Murakami i did it more out of curiosity as all the Sydney book shops have it on display stands. I can say that i enjoyed it, the storey line was good and the characters also...but i did'nt love it. It wasnt a page turner. The first 2 books were better andi was a bit dissapointed with the finish...i could almost guess what was going to happen. Some of the scene and character descriptions were somewhat long winded. But overall i would recommend them
B004FP1WX0|5.0|My fiance started me on the Catfish TV Series.  Since we started watching, I felt that I had to watch the movie where it all began.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that the series differs for the better from the movie, but the formula for the series was definitely started in this movie.  If you are a fan of the series, watch the movie!  If not, still watch it, it was a good time.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Reading this book, I felt that I got to know Adam Brown and his family. This was such an awesome book.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|While I am not a huge fan of &#34;chick flicks&#34; I was shocked to find that once I started watching this movie, it wasn't a chick flick at all!  It was vulgar, funny, and, of course, a cappella singing, which amazes me every time I hear it.  If you like vulgar comedies, definitely pick this up.  It isn't all vulgar, just you might be shocked that this movie produced quite a bit of it.
B004BRQYJ4|5.0|If you like music ala Liza Minnelli's Cabaret and typical Burlesque, this is a great buy.  I actually received this through credits by purchasing school text books.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Includes all the movie Blu-Rays as well as special features on extra Blu-Rays for the second and third movie. I really like the material that the box is made of as well - it's that really nice matte-like finish that makes everything feel high quality. Definitely recommend, especially for the price.
1451695195|1.0|I received this book as a gift and said, ok, why not, this should be funny!  Let me start by exclaiming 'Jesus Christ', all ye suckas!  What a brilliant scam by this 'author' and S&S publishing to exploit the masses, knowing there was a high probability that they could cash in on people believing in some afterlife.  (The S&S Editor is sitting like 'yeah, duh, we can make that work, it should sell a lot')<br /><br />This may be like talking to a wall, but if you are actually considering buying this book because you REALLY are hoping for SOME scientific evidence of some sort of afterlife, let me sum it up for you.  Doctor supposedly has some wild ass thoughts/dreams/memories while he's in a coma.  The coma was SO bad, and the dreams were SO whacked out, that there MUST be an afterlife!  End of story.<br /><br />Assuming that everything our good and entirely scientific doctor experienced was truthful, there are 2 things that any sort of 'proof' in this regard neglects to take into account, and makes the doctor a total charlatan rather than a legit scientist:<br /><br />- Occam's razor:  the simplest explanation is the most likely.  He was simply thinking/dreaming a bunch of wild shit.  His neo-cortex wasn't shut down or effectively dead.  Any aspects of the brain that needed to be operating to form such thoughts/dream was working.  (working enough)  BTW, I think this book is essentially fiction, but that's really besides my point.<br /><br />- Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence:  there is not a shred of verifiable evidence about anything being claimed about his brain state.  For starters, where is the proof that any portions of his brain that would require subconscious thought/dreaming were absolutely, unequivocally shut down?  He made a few statements at the beginning, and moved on.  Actually, given the complexity of the brain, there isn't an accepted way to prove squat in this regard.<br /><br />When a book is rife with statements like 'there aren'teven any words or means for me to possibly describe this aspect of the experience because it was so out of this world', it also immediately gets reduced to literary trash, regardless of the topic.  So, run far away and don't waste your time, unless you really want to read about a crazy mind-trip, and not really all that interesting or creative of one.  Or buy the book and use it as kindling for your next campfire.<br /><br />In the end, people will believe what they really want to regardless of actual evidence.  Me?  I will go back to worshiping the Flying Spaghetti Monster. HE IS REAL!!!
B009T3AE1Y|5.0|I have not yet seen the DVD, Cosmopolis, but it arrived in good shape, quick delivery and good price.  Thanks.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is a very fun game to play. I like playing it. other people should play it too. I like ponies and horses.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|FUN GAME!  Almost like having a real horse, but without the expense.  Or flies.  Or actual sung.  MIGHT even be better than a real horse.  I like it!<br /><br />cfregeau
B000KJT8IG|5.0|BEST Christmas movie...EVER.  Who doesn't love the Griswolds?  Randy Quaid and his sewage dumping RV...the pledge of allegiance prayer... hilarious!!!  That is all.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This is the first book that I have highlighted quotes! It is a classic that stands throughout time! A hundred years from now people will find this book and willl love the journey as much as I did!
B0006213WG|4.0|The CD is good but the product came open, didn't care that much since CD condition was perfect but, so... the hell with it..
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book it was completely unexpected...the ending. Loved the idea of peers returning and katniss returning to 12  ..luv it
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|The CD came in great condition its 100% original, that's for sure...<br />And the CD quality and the album is perfect, what else could I say!?
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|Great discussions of religious ideas. Brings one to envision the effect of religions over the years, and helps in the understanding of our present days conflicts.
B0088XXCZ6|2.0|After reading some reviews and listening to bits and pieces of some of the tracks, I decided to take a chance on The Idler Wheel.  I've really tried to get into it, but so far only have managed to like Every Single Night and Hot Knife. Just for my own personal taste, some of the songs are too chaotic and there are times Fiona sounds like she's singing through clenched teeth. I am assuming some of the lyrics are meant to express pain, anger, rage, but they hit all the wrong chords with me.  I don't mind anger and outrage in a song, but much prefer the building crescendo of anger on Sinead O'Connor's song, Troy, in which she starts out almost apologetic and you can hear the rage building word by word, syllable by syllable by syllable. It's a song I still listen to after all these years. I'm not so sure the same will be true with the songs on Idler.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A very good story. I could really relate to the story. I've been thru a similar situation! I was totally glad to see the way she won and had a great love to help her thru! I was totally glad to see the way she was able to have a great love after all the bad stuff that she overcame.
B004K4AVAG|1.0|Gaga impressed me with poker face , then bad romance, telephone  and paparazzi!  Paparazzis is by dar the Best gaga release!<br />However, this album is like a dejavu. Something I have seen before. She is not innovating and he put way too much effort in trying to send good messages in the lyrics. The result= the songs don't sound good. The only decent song is I was born this way but this album is full of fillers and does not add anything to pop music.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A must read<br />Anyone who loves Nicholas Sparks writings will love rtf his one. I can't wait to see the movie version.
B001P9EQH8|2.0|This product don't do so much as I expected. Of course it's cheap, but is better spend more money and buy an E7 or E9 than this.
0316113077|5.0|This book gives you very detailed and step by step instructions.  You feel like the author is explaining everything right to you - very clear, so even if you have never worked with fondant before, you will feel confident in doing so after reading this book!  Each cake idea has how many people it will serve, lays out how what methods are used & refers to pg #'s that those techniques are explained on. Also contains many recipes for cakes & cookies.<br />Great instruction & pictures!<br />Highly recommend to anyone just starting out!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app you should but sometimes. it has a hard time loading but overall you should get this app
B003IKMR0U|4.0|My kids (8-15) all loved this.  We also got the Zombie Dice 2 expansion - which I strongly recommend to add to this game.  By itself it's fun - but with the expansion there's some variety that the base game needed.
B0006A9FKA|4.0|This is a great comedy. If you have never watched British comedies, let this be your introduction. Again, great movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really l I k e this game and would recommend it to anyone who loves horses but c a by have one of their own. not a great replacement for th e real thing of course:)
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This was a fun book that I enjoyed. Collins developed visuals and action scenes very well.  I can understand why this might be a good movie.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|This isn't bad, especially for a dollar. It is entertaining and fun to play when I have a few minutes to spare. Easy to learn, \\"controls\\" are intuitive, and everything runs smooth on my Galaxy 3. Graphics are decent, as is the sound.
1466216336|5.0|if your into card magic what greater way to start learning all the moves that eventually will help you create great card magic ,if you learn this and you like to perform magic with cards after this will come with ease
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|Downloaded this app for my android tablet, but it wouldn't open. It just changes to a black screen quickly before closing. So I uninstalled and reinstalled, but still had the same issue. I was looking forward to playing this, but I guess it's a no go for me.
B009POCG2C|5.0|I'm a baseball fan and I like Clint. Part of the movie was funny and part was feeling sad for him.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Very user friendly. I download music to my phone in a snap.  I find any music I want very easily.
B007KW5N9Y|5.0|have no clue but this was the first movie my son saw when he was five years old and is now a film critic in LA at age 37
B008IJTFYW|5.0|My daughter and I love this app. We use it every  night. I love sleeping to the rain, and she loves  the music. Thanks for a great app, and making it free.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I couldn't put it down and once I finished it, I couldn't get it out of my mind.  Scariest villain ever.
B00ARF92HK|5.0|I'm glad that this film did the story right, I think that Urban and the Chick did a great job.  Not too real, not too many dumb jokes
B0039UTDA6|5.0|This came through quickly and looked to be brand new.  My grandchildren just LOVE it!  It is very educational and enjoyable to watch.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|General<br /><br />Good Science Fiction action film, with a fair bit of action and a heavy dose of violence.<br />If you don't like lots of killing in your movies, then avoid.  The movie is not gory, ala Kill Bill,  but it is violent.<br /><br />Science Fiction<br /><br />Forget time travel paradoxes, and you'll enjoy this movie.<br />Try to figure out the time paradoxes, and you might become a visceral hater of this film.<br />This is near earth future Science Fiction where people are still people.  The circumstances and tools for being people are just different.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I love this series. Where is the second season though. I want. I need. I love. I'm totally hook and or obsessed if I have enough wine. Lol
B009IQG5LK|4.0|When this film came out on the big screen in 1990 I was blown away by Director Warren Beatty's use of bright colors to give it color comic strip feel. When I saw it years ago on VHS it was just okay. Now Buena Vista Home Entertainment has given it a great BD transfer and it is bright and colorful again.<br /><br />Some of the story doesn't hold up for me any more - and the overdone makeup - which makes nearly all the male characters look really ugly - is a bit over the top but the two other things which made me love this film (besides seeing Beatty's A-list friends Dustin Hoffman and Al Pacino eating up the scenery)are the sexy double-entendres by Madonna and Stephen Sondheim's new songs (including \\"Sooner or Later\\"). When Madonna is on the screen it burns sex and the Sondheim songs are some of his most tuneful (IMHO).<br /><br />Yes, EVERYONE will gripe that there are no extras - not even a trailer! - but as long as you know that going in, at least you have this fun film - in a nice print - to enjoy.<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is so fun you get your own horse and you get to feed &amp; groom your horse. also you can put it in compentions
B005LAII8K|5.0|My favorite film of 2012- unique, intriguing, and exciting story with great acting.  Easily one of those films I will revisit every year for the rest of my life.  Blu-ray has great video and sound quality.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|This product, and all of the supernatual items I've purchased all got here before the estimated delivery dates.  Awesome show too!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|its great but I wish they would create more levels faster so that I can master the games and have more fun with the game
B0086700CM|5.0|All the kids love playing this ---I myself have yet to master it :-) which is pretty sad in itsself since even the YOUNGEST of the kids can play it ---I do HIGHLY recommend it --keeps 'em busy for a while :-)
B00AQ71FLK|3.0|i keep trying to join games then it stops and says 'internal service error' then logs me out... annoying as hell...
B0097C8XL0|5.0|My Granddaughter who is 5 LOVES this game !! Her 11 year old brother oddley enough (who told her its for little kids) will ALWAYS want to play if he sees her playing :-)ok so Im 57 and wanted to give it a try :-) HA! it IS a fun Game!!
B004EPZ00C|4.0|I had no idea there was a second movie, it was even better than the first one. My family enjoyed it too!
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|ALL the kids Like to do this ---From my 5 year old granddaughter to my 15 year old grandson,to my 32 year old daughter to my 76 year old mother its just really cool and the 5 year old likes to draw----Highly recommend
B00005JM20|5.0|Rowan Atkinson is so funny. I love this movie and all his other stuff. This was such a good buy and for a great price too!
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|This game is just ok, it is like some other games I have played in the past.  But it is ok.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wow! I really enjoyed this book.  I have a hard time finding a book that is more or less as unpredictable as the first two books in Suzanne Collins' series. I can't wait to see how the Capitol is destroyed in the end.
B009O2XY12|4.0|I like playing this game.  It can become very addictive and hard to stop, where you want to continue playing until you win.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|A great read, which, I had been meaning to read for so long. After seeing the Muppets Christmas Carol of all things : ) I finally made the short leap. I was just as charmed by the book as the movie itself! I would recommend it to all readers!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it a cool game.  you shood get this game. I give it five stars dvrbtntntn dbfntntnrh grhrgegey rhrhrntktgeg dhrhrhegrhr fnrhrgehrh rhrhh

B004JK4M9M|5.0|Before the making of this, their second album (RCA Victor LPM/LSP 3766), original Jefferson Airplane drummer Alexander \\"Skip\\" Spence had departed sometime in 1966, replaced by Spencer Dryden, and former vocalist with San Francisco's The Great Society, Grace Slick, had joined that same fall as their new lead vocalist, thereby giving this quintessential psychedelic rock band a decidedly different sound.<br /><br />Released in February 1967, and quickly finding favour in California's counter-culture movement, it soon reached # 3 on Billboard's album Top 200 and by July had gained gold status. It also produced two Billboard Pop Hot 100 singles - their first on those charts - and one near-miss. The results of their initial single, My Best Friend, were not exactly encouraging as the best it could do early in 1967 was a # 103 on the Hot 100 Bubble Under charts b/w How Do You Feel? on RCA Victor 9063.<br /><br />But then came one Grace had cut with The Great Society in 1966 on North Beach 1001 called Someone To Love, penned by her brother-in-law Darby Slick. Changing the title to Somebody To Love, it became their best hit ever in their guise as Jefferson Airplane as it peaked at # 3 Hot 100 in April/May 1967 on RCA Victor 9140 b/w She Has Funny Cars. That was followed in July by the # 8 Hot 100 White Rabbit on RCA Victor 9248 b/w Plastic Fantastic Lover. These would be the only two times they'd crack the Top 10 as Jefferson Airplane, although they'd do it six more times as Jefferson Starship/Starship, including two # 1s in the 1980s.<br /><br />Lingering controversy over whether or not Grateful Dead guitarist Jerry Garcia had a hand in the album continues unabated, but on the reverse cover RCA prints \\"Jerry Garcia, musical and spiritual adviser\\" among the credits - something always denied by album producer Rick Jarrard. In any event, Rolling Stone magazine lists Surrealistic Pillow at # 146 on their \\"500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\\"<br /><br />At the time the band consisted of: lead guitarist/vocalist Jorma Kaukonen; vocalist/guitarist Marty Balin; lead vocalist/pianist Grace Slick (also organ and recorder); rhythm guitarist/vocalist Paul Kantner; Jack Casady on bass, fuzz bass and rhythm guitar; and drummer/percussionist Spender Dryden.<br /><br />The tracks, with writers shown in brackets, are:<br />Side 1<br />1.

B003ZVJFFM|4.0|The movie was in great condition except one small section in the movie where it blanked out.  It didn't take away from the enjoyment of the movie and I'm satisfied with my purchase.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I quite enjoyed this book.  The characters were well developed and it was well written.  I am in the older age group and I believe this book would be enjoyed moore by mature teenagers.
0345803507|3.0|This proved to be not much to sink your teeth into.  Not much of a story line and too many repeated chapters.
B00A31UXLW|5.0|All Michael's fans will enjoy this book I'm sure. Harry Bosch and the characters around him are as usual believable and the story is gripping and suspensful.
0345803493|3.0|I was glad to finish this trilogy and will not be telling anyone about these books.  I read them all hoping  one was better than the other.  Silly me.
030758836X|5.0|My book club choose this book and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the writing.  The characters are well developed through first person accounts while the action has many twists.  Just when you think you have solved the mystery, the author tweaks the plot.  Interesting- will keep you thinking as you read.
B004FOA84A|4.0|I am not that great at these games...so it did take me much longer than an hour. It's still a bit short but was fun and worth a dollar to me.
B000I186FW|5.0|Film is loosely based on comic, but is more like a happy-ended version of 1984 crossed with phantom of the opera with a lot of modern political references.
1611761565|5.0|From prior exposer to this community, I see why this book was a concern about government secrets. I believe the writer should have omitted mentioning a few things to keep himself out of hot water and it would not have hurt the books appeal to the community as they would have been none the wiser and it doesn't change any of the story to do so.<br /><br />That being said, the book is an excellent rendition of what military life is like! Personalities clash and when you deal with the elite of the elite, it becomes how you perform that speaks volumes! This book shows that and I just wish it was the same in our political structures. Sadly, our politicians get away with murder and are not held accountable. In the military, there's no place for that and your work and results is what speaks loudest! I'm a proud supporter of our military and I wish some of our military leaders were actually our political leaders as they live by a higher standard than the plebs in office today.<br /><br />One thing I do love is the way he conveys his observation of Bin Ladens corps. Many believe him to have been a fake; that the real Bin Laden died years ago. In the book, the writer doesn't distinguish him either way! This is a real boon as there are too many unanswered questions and too much propaganda surrounding this issue to say firmly one way or another.<br /><br />Would definately recommend for anyone to read who loves the military or who is wanting to honor what our boys do day in and day out to keep our nation safe!

8866130931|5.0|Decided I needed a paper solution for keeping tack of all my work tasks and to-dos.  This is an excellent solution.<br /><br />Good quality, nice paper stock, leather cover, good elastic band -- all standard moleskine features.  Includes some extraneous pages (conversions, stickers, etc.), also standard molskine stuff.  The planner itself is pretty awesome though.  It has days of the week on the left and a lined page on the right.  I've found it is the perfect way to keep my weekly tasks organized and use the right to capture notes about specific things.<br /><br />If you're looing for something to keep track of meetings and all that, this is probably not it.  But it's perfect for work items.  Only complaint, would've liked a hardcover version not the softcover.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book has been getting rave reviews. I have not been able to read it yet. I got this for my daughter to be able to read.
B0015DROBO|3.0|I'm a little on the fence about this one.<br /><br />The good: if you're into detailed, intricate plot lines, this one is for you. There's a number of running story lines which are integrated very well with one another. There's a great building of character and individuality that made the characters very real. The cookie crumbs that are laid out and how the main mystery comes together are all very well done. As for the reading, it was both easy to get caught up in, but pretty easy to put down and come back to. Because of the almost episodic nature of the breaks in the book, it's easy to find stopping places as well.<br /><br />The hiccups:<br /><br />And I call them hiccups because they're not things that are innately wrong, just things that didn't work so well for me. The writing is a little awkward, which I attribute to translation more than anything, but it was noticeable, especially at the beginning. Once I got used to it, it didn't bother me so much, and the writing isn't particularly flowery so overall it reads pretty smoothly. But it was still dense so while smooth, it wasn't fast. I was driven nuts by the use of Kronor, because I just had no frame of reference for how much money anything really was (and since money and expense is a big deal throughout the book, it's annoying). I wasn't agitated enough to look it up, but it was still irritating.<br /><br />But my biggest hang up with this book was my indifference and borderline dislike of Mikael Blomkvist, the main character. I wanted to like him. I actually liked him quite a bit when portrayed by Daniel Craig, but I just couldn't quite root for the base character. I loved Lisbeth, but while she is a main character, she's not the main character, and the end of the book kind of broke my heart a little bit (and not in the good way).<br /><br />So, overall, a worthwhile read for both Lisbeth and the pure intricacy in the mystery. It's worth it to see what all the fuss is about from the source, but the end broke my heart in the wrong way and didn't really encourage me to pick up the next one.my heart in the wrong way and didn't really encourage me to pick up the next one.

B0013IKUIK|5.0|I first found Bon Iver on the tv show Chuck. Skinny Love turned out to be one of the best things ive ever heard in my life. Listening to the rest of the cd I was confused. It is nothing like mainstream music. He has big intros and some of his songs don't have many lyrics. I kept listening to the cd and slowly he grew on me. This cd is one big moment that isnt really broken up by songs. The songs are more like chapters in a big story. He has become one of the greatest artists to me. I definitely reccomend.

Always be Postive and your life will go in the direction that it's suppose to go. God is always in control of everything.<br />Do his will and everything will come to pass no matter what. Don't just read it one time read it over and over again until you are living the life that you want to live.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Author Jamie McGuire's descriptive narration brings you to the brink of love and hate as the tortured love affair of Travis and Abby reveal their innermost passion for each other and the different circumstances that test the strength and endurance of their relationship. Chapters that are peppered with variances in family dynamics, college life relationships and self inflicted conflicts, all of which tear and mend a destined relationship from their first encounter. Page turner and awesome read!
B001DJLCRC|5.0|The first season was SO breathtaking I decided to purchase the DVD set. I know some of the episodes were repeated later before the start of the second season but my son and I now own all the seasons on DVD so we can enjoy it all over again in a few years. I also loaned this out to friends who never saw it so they could get hooked and watch the remaining seasons. This is the only show on tv I have ever made sure not to miss each week. LOVE IT!

Not at all what I thought it would be. To me it was very much a let down.

B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I really like this clock but it would be nice if it could be dimmed more.  Many nice features and options.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|I really wanted to like this book because everyone else seemed to be raving about it. There's so much fluff in the writing and the language the characters used just didn't seem to fit. To portray the characters as \\"outcasts\\" they cursed a bunch and called each other names, really?? I forced myself to finish it but not without so many eye rolls that I might have damaged a cornea. I'm giving it two stars because as the title states, the bones of the story are good but the execution deserves much less than two stars. Anyway, I'm not sure what all the fuss is about with this book.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|If you love a good romance then this book is for you but it goes by it in a different way. I laughed out loud while reading, and also cried. I'll definitely read it again!!
0812982622|3.0|I would actually give this book 3.5 stars. I enjoyed it and thought it was a good story. So I'll list the pros first:<br /><br />Even though a lot of other reviewers did not like the writing style, I found the writing very appealing. I loved the way the author mixed the first person, the third person and a narrative over a radio program to tell the story. It made the book a lot more interesting and was one of the big reasons I stuck to the book and kept reading. Very unique and refreshing writing style. I loved it.<br /><br />Another thing that I really liked about the book is that it almost seemed like there was some magical realism in there. I don't mean a Marquez, \\"A hundred years of solitude\\" magical realism, but a masterful manipulation if you will, where you suspend disbelief but don't even really know that you're doing it. At first, I thought some of the storyline quite unbelievable, but then I found myself suspending disbelief, not because the author explained anything, but just because of the way the story was told and moved along. It's very hard to explain, but it was very enjoyable to read.<br /><br />Finally, it's an interesting story that certainly holds your attention.<br /><br />Now to the cons:<br /><br />I thought some aspects of the book were so over the top that it detracted from the story.<br /><br />For example, the torture scenes. I understand that the author wanted to get across the notion that torture and inhumane treatment are common in North Korea. So he describes one torture/inhumane treatment scene, then another, and then another and then another and it goes on and on and on throughout the entire book. You don't have to hit the reader over the head again and again with the same concept for us to get it.  The result of doing that and the fact that basically all main characters in the book are at some point exposed to torture, leaves the reader with the impression that the entire population of North Korea, at one point or another, will be tortured. Common sense and statistics alone tell you that this cannot be the case, yet the book certainly leaves that impression.  I have lived in a third world country, under an extremely oppressive regime (not North Korea but another of the \\"axis of evil\\" countries) and know first hand the fear of torture and mistreatment running through certain cultures. It is, however, not as this book makes it out to be. The entire population doesn't walk around fearing torture 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Does it happen?  Absolutely.  Does it happen to everyone, constantly?  Of course not.<br /><br />Another big problem I found is that this book, in trying to put a human face on the North Koreans, actually ends up dehumanizing them to a great extent. This book leaves the impression that this is a nation of 25,000,000 zombies who work morning, noon and night, who are always starving, who have zero joy in their lives and in the end are either drained of all their blood, or have their organs harvested. As a result, they have lost all humanity. There is scene after scene of incredible cruelty amongst the citizens and I don't mean only the torture scenes. For example, the old man in the prison who is confused about why he's there and is crying out for help and the response from one of the other prisoners is: \\"why don't you die already!\\" Or when one of the characters is lying in his own feces and filth and has just been told that his entire family has been killed and someone pries the prisoner's wedding ring off of his finger while the prisoner begs to have that last remnant of his family left with him, to no avail. Or the girl who turns on her colleague for no apparent reason and suddenly convinces others to start physically torturing the colleague.  There is countless examples of this that make you think that ALL North Koreans collectively have lost ALL of their humanity.  The author's only attempt to balance this is when one of the characters who is so deep in trouble that he knows exactly what is going to happen to him, makes a few small gestures of kindness to others and in the end does one big act because he has fallen in love.  For me, this does not offset 500 pages of everyone acting like savages.<br /><br />I understand trying to get a point across, but when you go to either extremes, it takes away from the story. One extreme is the story that the Dear Leader wants you to believe about how North Korea is the greatest nation on earth and the other extreme is frankly, this book. Neither one is, or can ever be, an accurate protrayal of an entire nation.<br /><br />Even though it's flawed, it's still a good read and that's why I give it 3.5 stars.rouble that he knows exactly what is going to happen to him, makes a few small gestures of kindness to others and in the end does one big act because he has fallen in love.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|After the first book, it gets a little boring.  It is the same, over and over.  I think the shock value on the first book makes everyone read it and after that-----it's a let down.  Fifty Shades of Grey is the best of the trilogy.  I am in the mist of #3 but will be glad when I am finished.  Recommend book 1 only.

B007NVJ7NU|5.0|Enter The Void grabbed me by complete surprise, I had seen short trailers for the film advertised on my local VOD channel but it was packaged as a fun psychey romp and very little of the story was elaborated on. I finally decided to sit down and watch the film at the insistence of a friend but had failed to actually look up anything about the film, this turned out to be a terrific decision as I had no idea what I was in for. I had never seen a Gaspar Noe film before (a mistake I quickly corrected after finishing Enter The Void) and although his other films give a glimpse into some of his artistic qualities none of them compare to the other worldly exuberance of Enter The Void. The film is shot entirely in a point of view fashion from the mind of Oscar, an American expatriate living in Tokyo who seems to fill his days by gulping down hallucinogens and staring at his sultry sister (Paz De La Huerta). However the film takes a hard left turn when Oscar is shot dead by Tokyo police while dealing drugs in a local bar (The Void) we see Oscar's spirit ascend from his body and the rest of the movie is filled with complex crane shots looking down at Oscar's friends and family as they deal witht he aftermath of his death while he relives times from his past both tragic and sentimental. I wish I had more to say about this film but truly, you have to see it for yourself. This movie is definitely not for everyone but if you want to see a truly powerful film, a brazen experiment in film art, a true cinematic masterpiece then you must ENTER THE VOID.

B0062HS03O|4.0|The concert was cool, but the Born this way tour was so much better i saw it live in Puerto Rico
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Played this on my Kindle Fire with no problems.  Wonderful graphics and detailed storyline.  Lots of different locations to explore and figure out.  I have played tons of hidden object games and this is the first one that actually had my my heart pounding a couple of times!  Mini games are creative and the hidden object areas are more than just the typical straightforward location of every item.  Hints are helpful and a strategy guide is also included.  Several different characters to interact with add to the game's detail.  You never know what might be around the corner!  The game's creators did a great job in making a good story that's interesting, thought provoking, visually captivating and provides hours of gameplay.  I definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys some depth in a hidden object game.  It is worth the $2.99 to unlock the full game.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|There's nothing to say except the album speaks for itself! I'm very pleased with his music and look forward to hearing more from him!
0307341577|5.0|Dark, twisted and extremely disturbing in so many ways!  I have recommended it to several friends.  Especially fun for this Kansas City girl to read due to the area the story takes place in.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The story was well thought out through the planning and time it would take for someone to prepare to leave an abusive home. It's not practical to leave with no money so that part panned out nicely. I loved that the ending had a nice twist/ surprise that I personally never saw coming. Hope everyone enjoys this read as much as I did!
B007704HO6|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much. I was drawn up in James even before he found Bob. I have known several people dealing with addictions and know how difficult that is. I love animals and know that they can change your mood and even your mind set. This book is awesome and because I loved it so much, I looked up the pictures and videos that people had sent into utube and I am friends with James Bowan And Bob on facebook!!!!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is an . Amazing game especially for horse lovers this game has great graphics. I would recommend this game to anyone who loves animals good grasp phone and likes having a good time
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game has very good graphics and is not slow. This is a great game and would give it five stars but some times it takes quite a wile to move up in the game.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It feels like I'm really caring for a horse. No smell, of course, but it still really feels like it...
0439023521|5.0|I love that they book came extremley quickly in the mail and that for a used book it was in excellent condtion.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was an unexpected surprise. It is a touching tale of Loving and Dying through the eyes of 2 modern day heroes. John Green wrote a masterpiece!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Because I like facebook and now that it is on my Kindle I can Take it with me where ever I go.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|This is one of the best series I have watched in years....I would  recommend this series for all ages...I have purchased the whole series so I can see it over again.
B000KX0IOA|3.0|Having watched \\"Gandhi\\" at least a dozen times since it was first released, I am always impressed by the quality of the film itself.  However, \\"Gandhi\\" the film inspired me to do research on Gandhi the actual man...and the film, as it turns out, presents a highly edited and sanitised version of the Mahatma...to put it charitably.  The film omits quite a few pertinent details that would detract from Gandhi's saintly status.  There is no mention made of his horrific and naive advice to the British and the Jews in the face of the Nazi nightmare; there is little or no mention of his very dysfunctional family relations...and one certainly doesn't see or hear anything about how the Great Soul would sleep with his naked nubile nieces to \\"test\\" his vow of celibacy.  There's more, but I invite the reader to do the research that will place Mr. Gandhi into proper perspective, as I did. Still...so long as one is aware that the film \\"Gandhi\\" is a work of art, fiction, not history, it is worthy.
0307887448|1.0|My 12 year old son began to read this today based on a recommendation of a friend who has boys his age. He reads a lot of adult science fiction. About 30 minutes later he came out of his room upset.  He said it was homophobic and mean.  I asked him to show me the passages that he felt were this way.  He said there were too many passages and he wasn't going to go near the book and that, if it were up to him, he would burn the \\"$%^&* out of the #$%^& book.\\" Strong words were then expressed about its unsuitability for humans.<br /><br />Perhaps if he were thicker skinned, the writing would not have affected him.  I began to read it to try to understand more but the writing was really bad. Others mentioned the references out of context and the lack of character development. I must agree with these opinions.  My friend LOVED it and so did her boys.  We did not.
B009RWRIZ2|5.0|The other reviews are not talking about the official Criterion blu ray release, so I am putting in a review because I preordered this and have the Criterion release of the 3D and regular blu rays.<br /><br />The 3D transfer is stunning, I have a number of other 3D releases, but this is one of the best I have seen.  I also saw this in the theater and I almost feel I get the 3D effect better from a home theater system than what I saw in the theater.<br /><br />In addition to the film, there is a 45 Making of Pina documentary, for once available in 3D also. There are some deleted segments of dances that are not in the film that run I believe about 30 minutes that you will want to see if you were a fan of the film or Bausch's work.  They are also included as 3D and regular versions.<br /><br />Another supplement is a promotional interview by Wim Wenders, which is 22 minutes long.  If you want background of the making of this film, it is a good look into his mindset and motivations for what he put on screen.<br /><br />Criterion has done itself proud in it's first 3D release because once again, they have pushed the bar so high that probably only they will be able to compete with this title.
B0002MB7QW|5.0|Awesome movie!!!! never got a chance to watch it all on t.v. so i bought it. a must see movie.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I really like it. The story and the cast are fine;<br />Nicely directed; and it flows wonderfully.<br />I am looking forward to watch it;
B000UPGQQW|5.0|Great movie! and a must have for the horror collection! corey feldman and corey haim two of my favorite actors in it.
B0086700CM|5.0|Simply amazing it's very addicting I couldn't put it down although some features require money. A must have for kindle fire users
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I like to play these games to unwind after work. This game fit the bill perfectly. It wasn't to hard nor to easy. I liked the fact that if you got stuck, you could hit the hint button and it would get you back on track. So, it wasn't frustrating, played well on my kindle fire and fit the bill for a nice unwind of the day.
0670026603|5.0|This was the best book i have read in a long time.  It was sad it was funny ,  I fell in love with the characters from the beginng .  It is the kind of book you can not put down .  I read this while on vacation so i had time to read it every day.  As much as i wanted to know what happens i hated to see the book end.  It was such a powerful ending i was haunted by it and it stayed with me for days.  This would be a great book club selection .  I told all my friends that are readers not to miss reading this book.
B00A1EOBJQ|4.0|Almost all songs from first season are included. No complaints. It arrived quickly and was undamaged. I cannot honestly say anything bad about the experience.
B005I4JG80|5.0|Very insightful and helps new mothers to realize that more is not necessarily better!! Less may in fact be a little more! Relax and allow your child to grow and develop into the individual they are meant to be without overwhelming them with the stuff!
B0086700CM|5.0|It's a very fun and very addictive game everyone loves.  I love it,my kids love it,and my friends love it.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|I am 35 years old and found the humor in this to be quite humorous.  Funny movie.  Watch it.  That is all.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Maybe it could be rated between a 3.5 and 4.0.  The book was fairly enjoyable but I think it is more of an adolescent or at least a younger than me fan base.  I read books like this more in my late teens and early 20's.  Not that is was a bad book, it was not, but just not my type of read at this point in my life. Of course the main characters are teenagers which may be why I felt this way.  I think it was worth the money for someone who likes this type of book.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Great book - It confirms what you have always thought-you will never look at your dog in the same way!
B0095R76EW|1.0|Didn't enjoy the movie. It was slow for what we saw. The streaming was messed up a lot through out so we gave up watching it and was not sad at all.
0062101897|5.0|Truly a treasury of information for the Potter fanatic and the casual mom watching the episodes. Very interesting history behind the creation of the movies.
B000SE0OYA|5.0|With an item like this, it becomes difficult to rate with anything other than it works, it fit and the printer goes on functioning.  Delivery was fast and the item well-packed.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|First show that I really look forward to watching in a long time. Just wish Amazon provided captioning since it is hard to understand some words with the British accents.
B000ZMCVRI|3.0|Will not download to my I phone from amazon cloud player I was forced to install the down loader when everything I have is I tunes. From now on its iTunes only
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Loved this story. Held my attention throughout each book. Already finished 6 & 7; just waiting for book 8 now.
159420411X|3.0|Mr Silver's book is wide ranging indeed and I admit that I haven't read all of it. I skipped the section on baseball because I have no interest whatever in baseball. I did read the rest of the book although not all of that with great care.<br />The book reads as if it were dictated and then not very well edited. My copy is the eleventh printing and even after ten printings a number of obvious errors in figures and prose remain. This is simply slovenly work.<br />The book covers the prediction of flu epidemics, terror strikes, global warming, earth quakes, poker hands...and that isn't an exhaustive list. Mr. Silver leavens his prose with reports of his many interviews with the famous such as Donald Rumsfield and other more prosaic scientists such as Dr.Susan Hough a noted seismologist.<br />As the title implies, Mr. Silver is quite taken with Bayes theorem. Indeed Bayes theorem, or Bayesian statistics are mentioned on at least fifty of the book's ~450 pages. Mr. Silver gives short shrift to frequentist statistics of the sort pioneered by R.A. Fisher. It appears Fisher, a heavy smoker, continued to insist that there was no causal link between lung cancer and smoking. Mr. Silver does not make clear just what this error has to do with Fisher's commonly used model of hypothesis testing but it is clear he doesn't like it. Most statisticians are familiar with the \\"file drawer effect\\" which simply put means that if results that don't reach significance don't get published and wind up in the researcher's file drawer it will increase Type One Errors. Ioannidis has claimed that \\"most published research findings are false\\" and this likely reflects that same file drawer effect. Mr. Silver sites Bayer as claiming that they could only replicate about a third of the positive findings in medical journals when they tried to reproduce them.<br />Science is self correcting. If there is an important finding and if the results are in fact due to a Type One Error, then another researcherwill try to replicate the finding and will be unable to do so. I'm not sure Mr. Silver undersands exactly how this works.<br />Never mind; it's an interesting read for all that.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter loves it!!!!!! She plays on it on my kindle and she is going to get it on Herr's soon.
B004I2K4E8|2.0|I thought the performances were going to be more realistic. What does Jonas has to do singing with all those actors-singers????. It is hard to believe!!!. When I go to a live play or musical the least thing I expect is to see credible performances and let me ask: who is going to believe that Salonga is the mother of a blonde child?, besides she still has her strong accent even when singing that I thought I was hearing to Pacquiao. Samantha Barks should be Fantine, period. Other point I want to said, most of the performances were just to step on the front and sing like when you go to a high school festival and listen to the students. The majority of the protagonists didn't act at all.<br />Honestly, I don't recommend it.
B006YTTVHO|3.0|A small but fairly informative book where on can glean at least one or two hints that aren't so obvious. The price is right too...
B006BG7RI0|5.0|This is a very great copy of the movie.  Several different formats make it  available to almost everyone's viewing. Such clarity. Has a book and a playbill about the movie.
B00637HXNG|4.0|I have enjoyed the Scorpions live in concert, and although it is not live, it ain't too bad. Lots of good songs.
B009MF5BXK|4.0|Enjoy seeing the older action stars do their thing. Some funny moments. Loud. High body count. Expect there will be a third one.
B007GFDVEE|5.0|My husband enjoyed this little set. It doesn't take long to build but it's a great add-on for an avid Lego collector.
B009POCG2C|4.0|Liked the three main stars and thought the storyline was pretty good. has some good humor. Timberlake was especially good.
0757302661|5.0|If you're looking for a natural approach to childbirth you definitely need to read this book. It gave me so much hope and encouragement as I prepared for the birth of my daughter and truly made all the difference in bringing her here safely and happily.
1423134206|4.0|This is a great coffee table book to keep fans of Disney and illustration enthusiasts entertained for a while. Each page is filled with illustrations from throughout the decades. Though, but a book entitled &#34;Design&#34;, the layout and presentation is lacking.
B0095R64AO|2.0|Despite it being a &#34;romantic comedy,&#34; this movie was really quite depressing (I would estimate that about 75% of it was way depressing, and 20% of it was just okay, perhaps only 5% was enjoyable).  Not quite up to snuff in my opinion.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I enjoyed every minute of it. It was so clear and the sound was good.  I am so happy I got it
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The sex is great, the self-talk is Okay although she uses &#34;Oh my!&#34; a bit too much. But even in the most concentrated relationship 90% of the time is spent doing things other than having sex.  This book would be much improved if the characters had lives outside the bedroom or painroom as the case may be.
0307959856|3.0|I want to make this review short.<br /><br />Pride and Prejudice six years later. A murder happens at Pemberley. I don't want to go too much into the who-done it, it was not too difficult to figure out. But like most Jane Austen Fans I did not primarily read it for that reason.<br /><br />A lot of the lovable characters are back; a few new ones are introduced, and at moments P.D. James captures some of the Jane Austen wit and language.<br /><br />My biggest disappointment was that while the plot line involved many female characters, unlike Jane Austen, P.D James barely allows the female characters to speak and act.<br /><br />The book was easy enough to read, but I am unlikely to read it again.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Awsome book hope she writes tons more couldn't put it down!!!!! Love christian grey and Anna's characters!!! Can't Waite to read book 3!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is one of the absolute funnest games I've ever played. I tried it first on the XBOX 360 and was hooked within 15 mins and HAD to get it on my kindle. Was not disappointed in the pocket edition.

B00AA7O6QC|5.0|Saw exp.1. I love how they incorporated lots of action filled/fighting scenes through almost the whole movie. I'm glad to see all the old dinosaurs/actors in this film. They are great actors. Second installment was just as same as exp.1. Action packed, some jokes. Love it.

1594487154|5.0|One of the earliest memories I have of my grandfather is going to a meeting at Pappadeux in Houston. We enjoyed a good meal, and I remember him telling me afterwards that sales was great because he just helped someone sign on the bottom line to buy a home, enjoyed a great meal, and made some money at the same time. I think that was the first time he said, \\"Nothing happens until somebody sells something\\", but I heard it many other times. Someone else probably said it first, maybe Carnegie, but my Grandad was preaching it years ago . . . and this book shows he was on the right track.<br /><br />Selling is really about moving people, and Pink does a masterful job of presenting it in this book. I have been in sales my entire life, and learned a long time ago that the product was not what I was really selling. There is always some other avenue they can use to find the product . . . you are selling yourself as the provider of that product more often than not. For the first three chapters in his book, Pink sets out to prove that virtually everyone is in sales these days. In my opinion he makes the case compellingly, and there is little room for another interpretation of the data.<br /><br />The remaining six chapters provide insight and tools into \\"moving\\" people. I have read a lot of sales books . . . and this is one of my absolute favorites. I love the mix of anecdotes, easy to memorize principles, and practical tools. At the end of each of the six chapters, he offers a variety of tools you can use to implement the main ideas. This is a great addition to the book, and really makes it an invaluable resource in my opinion.<br /><br />Here are some of the practical tools he offers:<br /><br />Best question to ask someone new:  \\"Where are you from?\\"<br /><br />Using the Pixar Pitch to tell your story<br /><br />The five best books to read on influencing (Love all of his recommendations, though [[ASIN:B002BD2UUC Influence]] is my favorite by a longshot)<br /><br />Assessment tools and links on the companion website<br /><br />Pitch practice worksheets<br /><br />The five Why's<br /><br />The best way to get your daughter to do her homework (this is almost a throwaway because it is such a small part of the book, but it is brilliant - be sure and follow up with the book he recommends here - [[ASIN:B004ZZOCS2 Instant Influence]]<br /><br />All in all, one of the best books I have read in a long time.

B002DKF54Q|5.0|The first thing I did after opening the box was head to the airport to listen in its intended environment. A great way to relax while waiting for your plane. I also began using this and the others in the series as music to fall asleep to. Soothing, mysterious, and downright mesmerizing!

B00AMBLXP8|1.0|i did not like this movie there was nothing funny about this movie mark wahlberg can do better then this. yes th previews to this movie were funny but after i watch it. the movie was just down right stupid.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|I did not like this book.. I felt misled- not knowing that it was about highschool kids. I am 23 years old and I read the entire thing- it was just not a good book. I bought it because of all the 5 star reviews and it was cheap, but I got a cheesy romance novel with many scenes that made me feel more than uncomfortable.. yes there were 'interesting' twists in it- but after the first one came out ..all of the rest were so obvious that it wasn't fun/good to read. Especially when it comes right down to the child abuse in it and all of the scenes between, bottom line, I did not enjoy it- it was not a good read for me.
B001V5CIFI|5.0|this movie was very funny my son lovd it and with this one also my son leraned something from this movie i would highly recomend this movie for ur kids to watch.

B009X00E18|5.0|This is a good product that wraps you kindle. It has a nice feel that is nonslip and generous elastic strap to keep it closed. It also has wholes where speaker's and plugs go for easy access and usability. Very good item.
B003XTYDMQ|5.0|this season of veronica mars was thriling it always keept me on edge and always wonting to watch the next episode there is only one thing that i did not like and that was the the season ended and there is no season 4 to go on that is the only thing that i did not like.
B005LAIIPS|3.0|While Bourne Legacy was not a bad movie, it just isn't in the same catagory as the other Bourne movies.  I kept waiting to see &#34;Jason Bourne&#34; and some sort of viable link to the new batton holder...Jeremy Renner.  It just didn't do it for me.  I'm such a &#34;Jason Bourne&#34; fan, that nothing less will do.  I thought the way the writer tried this movie and the plot to the past Bourne movie was pathetic to say the least.  It had so many holes in the tie in that it lost me right off the bat!  I only rated this movie a three stars because it had entertainment value, but for a true &#34;Jason Bourne&#34; lover, it was disappointing.
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|This is not as poor a novel as some made it out to be, but it did drag in part and take too long to tell in certain parts. Things such as Ky's nd Cassia's finding eCh other was way too draw out to the poin of tedium. But overall it does lay an interesting foundation for what the Rsing cojld really be all about. I look forward to a much better third book.
B004N66XYE|5.0|I watched this series non-stop and just loved it.  I was fascinated by everything about this series.  It has been well cast and written.  I enjoyed it so much that I ordered the second series, and I enjoyed it every bit as much as the first series.  I recommend you buy both series.  You won't regret it!
B0098G7AWS|4.0|A very good description of the Titantic and the events that went on, but, too much cussing. I would not buy it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Good suspense, foreshadowing, more twist and turns than I could count...a page turner, and well crafted. Kept me up at night!!
038572179X|5.0|Wow. I had to read this for English class, and as soon as I was finished it, I decided it was one of the best books I've ever read. My teacher said that the ending made the book, and that knowing it would spoil the entire thing and she was definitely right.<br /><br />Although there were some parts of Atonement that seemed to drag on, I loved the writing style and the interesting way in which everything was addressed. That still kept my interest, even when my attention was starting to drift. I loved the little twists of the plot, and how everything wasn't spelled out in simple terms. By reading between the lines, the reader gets a full grip of the story, its characters, and what exactly is happening to everyone.<br /><br />Briony annoyed me from the start, and though it's hard to read a novel in which the main character isn't very likeable, everything else helped me to forget about that. The settings, all of them, were wonderfully described. I could picture everything perfectly in my mind, from the odd Tallis house, to the evacuation of English troops, to the giant birthday party. This made me want to watch the movie even more, because I've heard great things about it. That'll definitely be one of my next priorities.
B008EEHRAU|5.0|Juliette Binoche's, Vianne, dispenses chocolate confections with a sensitive heart that hears the pains of others.  She quietly transforms the rigid people of this old-fashioned 1959 French town with calm offerings of kindness and sensory thrills.  Chocolat is a charming, heart warming, thoroughly entertaining and beautifully acted film by wonderful actors--Judi Dench, Alfred Molina, Johnny Depp, and Jena Olin, whose beaten character tears your heart.  This is a light but dimensional film that is simply joyful.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have had this DVD for over a week and finally opened it up and attempted day 1 of workout. I am 5'3 and 208 lbs after having my second baby. He is now 3 months old. I stopped a few times during the workout but probably would have stopped all together if it weren't for Jillian. She did an AMAZING job of encouraging me to keep going. I am sweating and close to throwing up but feeling great for changing my body. The workout was over before I knew it. If it were any other trainer, I don't think I would have kept going. Jillian was the difference!

B004YXE438|5.0|Not a typical jigsaw puzzle, more of rearrange/properly arrange squares.  All the same it's fun and works very well.  Lots of options for increasing difficulty.  A very nice app.
0345803485|3.0|Hard to understand some things.  Really held my interest and I finished the book.  Maybe Iwill order the rest of the series sometime.
1449410243|4.0|I'm an Oatmeal reader and fan and really enjoyed his book. This makes a great gift but make sure the recipient has a similar sense of humor.<br /><br />Looking forward to his future books.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Rick Riordan delivers another stunning story.  Beautifully woven characters and brilliant intricacies.  I'm only sadden by the time it takes between books to come out.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|I love spoken word n the poems just didnt come across as powerful as i would have liked, the story line however was pretty good.
0689877692|5.0|I chose this rating because when our 2-year old granddaughter opened the first page/pop-up, her eyes lit up and she was fascinated.  Worth every penny.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|Awesome movie! a good family movie and I enjoy shows based on true events and I think alot of the issues in this movie still happen to this day!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Great book, was not a continuous story, but rather a collection of smaller stories that take place during the zombie outbrreak.  Couldnt put it down.
B007PKDW44|4.0|Im glad the Cd came. it came earlier then i thought. though the case was cracked slightly. The songs on the cd are great so it made up for the crack
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I have read most of John Grisham's books and have enjoyed reading all.  The Racketeer is keeping me guessing and is making for very interesting reading.
B000Q76K1A|4.0|Excellent movie - great action and storyline. I rated it this high because I didn't want the movie to suffer at the expense of the downloading. Im not sure why it kept pausing to download. That has never happened before - especially since I was directly linked to the internet via ethernet. I can only imagine what a wifi connection might have been like.
B00A9X7X6C|1.0|I could not hear the dialog with headphones, absolutely no way with tv, but when there's an explosion it busts your ear drum. Tried to watch three times and too difficult.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|What's not to love?  Delivery was made as promised.  Movie quality good.  Did not disappoint.  Very happy with this purchase.
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|It's a great movie for the whole family with the unequal touch of Tim Burton. I like the black and white format.
B000FBFMZ2|5.0|The author takes &#34;consciousness as software&#34; idea to new depths. Excellent blend of detective fiction and hard science fiction. I found especially enjoyable the philosophical elaborations on the phenomena of connected mind(s) and virtual reality on aspects of individuality and society, ranging from crime, torture, pleasure, addiction, etc etc etc.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|I found this work just a tiny bit tedious. It was almost like &#34;Groundhog Day.&#34; Despite that, I did feel there was a great deal to like about the book, but I would have liked it better if there was less repetition. It proves that nobody is perfect--not even (the) King.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Purchased along with my new KindleFire HD.  It really does pay to have an &#34;extra&#34; charging cord handy when you travel a great deal.
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|I paid $3.99 to see The Dark Knight Rises--If I had it to do over, I would not pay 39 cents. This flick is two hrs. 44 min long and if you ask me it is two hrs. 44 min TOO long. I had to stop it 1/2 way through because I could not find a sharp pencil with which to stab myself in the eyeballs to relieve the tedium. If you have not seen this waste of time count your blessings. If you have and paid $8 at the theater, I think there is a government program that might get your bucks back. However, I eventually  did find a knitting needle with which to inflict damage to my brown orbs and did indeed finish watching The Dark Knight through a bloody veil. If forced between watching this movie a second time or death on the rack, I would cheerfully choose the latter.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|Love this protection case, and glad I picked this particular color.  Only suggestion for &#34;improvement&#34; would be to add a pocket to the inside cover.

B007XNAQL0|5.0|With confidence and self-assuredness seldom seen in today's era of singers, Peter Gabriel owns the stage throughout this superbly performed show.  Yet, he gladly shares the spotlight with his exemplary band and outstanding backing/co-vocalist, Paula Cole.<br /><br />For musicians, this video is a textbook, featuring marvelous yet understated mastery of their instruments by Gabriel's live entourage, particularly bassist Tony Levin.<br /><br />Simply a must-have for even the most casual fan.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I can't put it down! Great game! Love the challenges and objectives. I had to put it down for a night so I could get more money to accomplish the goals.
B009PJ1Q82|4.0|Keep The Lights On is an interesting movie, but it is flawed and slow paced. The actors are all attractive, especially Zachary Booth, who plays Paul. Zachary Booth has a great body and we get to see every inch of it, including a brief view of his low hanging testicles! Even though Paul is hot, he behaves like an a-hole for most of the movie so I don't understand why Eric put up with him for so long. I guess love really does conquer all. This movie is recommended to fans of gay drama that is dark.
B004QX07G4|5.0|Ellen makes my day - everytime I read a chapter!  She is funny, witty, down to earth and fabulous! It is a great I-phone book
B007N8RULO|4.0|Good ,a little awkward with the menu... but works very better than other ones I have tried. Overall a good app
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This is a remarable book. I would recommend it to anyone interested in American<br /> history. It is amazing how DK Goodwin asseses the attitudes and understandings<br /> of the men she is portraying. It indicates the depth of research she completed, and so<br /> we are all beneficiaries of that.
B005LAII80|5.0|Karl Urban was perfect as Dredd.  This movie is intense, gritty and violent and looks amazing.  This movie is so good it banished the bad memories of the Stallone s***fest called Judge Dredd.  A stunning view of a dysfunctional near future and a barely human street Judge.  A real gem that was overlooked when it came out in the theaters last year.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Amazing book! This book reminded me of how blessed I truly am. I was so proud that Katie/Erin found her happy ending!

B005XBKXV2|5.0|Just bought this on Amazon Instant Video for our grandkids to watch at our house.  Over the years, I have watched The Lion King multiple times, but it's been a few years since I really paid attention to it while it was playing.  I underestimated what its impact could be on me now--  I was amazed at how GRIPPING a movie experience it still is for me, and even better, for my grandkids (2 and 5) who have watched it many times at their house.  5 stars just isn't a high enough rating for this great movie.  I am so glad we were &#34;forced&#34; to buy it on Amazon, since it isn't available on Netflix.  Next time I'm weary or discouraged, think I'll snuggle down on the sofa for a Lion King retreat.  Signed, cool grandma
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book...I had a really hard time putting it down and would &#34;sneak&#34; reading it when ever I could.  I had it on my phone and tablet app so it was always at my fingertips.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|This is not a piece of literature, but I am glad I read it. I do believe that it is the author's intent to give an &#34;eyewitness account &#34;<br />All the detail about equipment was a little much for me, but learning about the night vision technology was very interesting.<br />How brave and committed to their duty these warriors are ! &#34; Their last ounce of courage shall not be in vain&#34; to quote<br />A. Lincoln in his Getteysburg Address
B008XBCJ34|5.0|A favorite show for the whole family even after watching many times. Love the beautiful effects and the great story line.
B001NEK2GE|3.0|This is a decent quality product. I liked almost every aspect of it: including the software, the function buttons, and the rather useful screen. My main complaint, however, was my only reason for buying it: the joystick. I wanted an analog joystick that I could use with my keyboard buttons and mouse. This was almost what I wanted, except that the analog function of the joystick doesn't work with most of my games. They either support digital WASD movement or a traditional gamepad. I was able to map WASD to the joystick, but there was no reason to since my keyboard is much faster with simple button presses. This device cannot magically make WASD into analog instead of digital. Another note about the joystick is that it has a very weird and uncomfortable shape. As for the quality of the entire device, it was a bit slow. My keyboard has a better response time. I am returning this device.
B004K4IZ54|5.0|Great movie with nice effects. Engaging storyline. Digital version does not seem to apply in singapore which is a pity.

B004APVI1G|5.0|A well loved movie by my children, watching the dvd again and again. Its definitely good for keeps and will continue to entertain in the years to come. Great dvd quality with beautiful images.
B004GXZ69W|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone spending a large amount of time on the computer, especially doing typing/formatting work. It is easy to adjust to, takes strain off of wrist and hand, and is easy to program.<br /><br />The only question I have is, why aren't vertical mouses more common?!
B005IGDW24|5.0|Its a great movie and well loved by the young and old. Growing up watching smurfs on tv every weekend. Great movie to share with my children.
B009NH9IMM|5.0|It was awesome Thankyou very munch I don't know what say but Thankyou this  is awesome now it time to say good bye
B00447G29S|5.0|Heart warming show good for the young and old in the family. My children loves it and watches it again and again. Good for keeps.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I liked the ending and the feeling of realism the writer managed to create despite the scifi/fantasy genre. This is not a fairytale with everything sweet and pink and I wasn't looking for that so I was quite happy reding it. But somehow the book is a little dull and it won't get you hooked like books I and II.<br /><br />Recommend it anyway.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Good movie with nice effects. An engaging storyline. Great delivery, arrived nicely packaged in brand new condition. Digital copy doesnt seem to apply in Singapore.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|I LOVE THE BOOK! And Greg will probably not get a special date with his crush Holly Hills and THE END
0670023329|3.0|To say the least, this is one hell of a scary and depressing story.  If this story is remotely true - and based on my readings on North Korea, it likely is - the world basically has another smaller Nazi Germany situation on its hands and it is doing nothing to stop it.  It is deeply disturbing that forced labor camps like this exist and even more troubling that an entire generation of people are literally being born and raised (and tortured) in them.<br /><br />The story is very, very important and I am glad it was written.<br /><br />That said, in terms of a quality non fiction book, it is severely lacking.  The author doesn't really do a good job of explaining why these camps exist, other than that they exist because the leaders of North Korea are basically lunatics.  This is true but there must be some reason these camps exist other than for simply sadistic reasons, and the author never really explains it.  The author also never fully explains what kind of information the main character learned in the camps.  There are several discussions about how he would go to class but it was never adequately explained what was covered in educational settings in a prison camp.<br /><br />The book also doesn't really give a rich and vivid picture of the main character.  This very well may be because the guy is so screwed up, there isn't much there but still, I felt some depth was lacking.  I also wish there was more information about the couple from Ohio that helped fly this guy to the States - why did they do it?  What was their motivation?  How much did it cost, etc?  Very big omission to not discuss this more.<br /><br />I commend the author for writing this but I wish it was more detailed and nuanced.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Great book. Easy to read. Fluid. Touched your heart, your mind, your soul. Reminded you of the lives of others and to be grateful.
B00A8KJN14|5.0|Our family loved the movie, so many similarities to the real Frankenstein movie. Took some explaining to the smaller kids but very enjoyable. Good buy to add to family collection.
B008PWUT9M|5.0|Before buying this case, I spent a lot of time reviewing other cases. The price was great, but that wasn't my reason for choosing this one. Some cases are made to fit Kindle like a glove and can remain in the case during use ( of course it could be removed, but the majority of reviews agreed that it did take some effort & care). After much consideration, I knew that wasn't for me. I wanted to be able to take it in and out easily & quickly. And I like holding the Kindle in my hands. Other cases were too flimsy, not padded enough in case of an accidental fall. Some had a button type closure with large enough gaps that I feared may be enough for my KIndle to slip out. I felt this case was best for me, and I love it. It's very sturdy, the velcro closure is super strong. It will not come open. The seam construction will protect my Kindle if dropped. And I love the design.
B00993FEUK|5.0|Bought this to add to our collection for our grandkids. It was enjoyable for the whole family. Would recommend if you collect this genre for your family.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|This was a great adult comedy that had me laughing the whole way through the movie. Would no recomment for this movie for kids as this is definitely an adult movie.
B005LAII80|5.0|Phenomenal.  This movie is so different from Judge Dredd 1995 as to make a comparison pointless.<br /><br />Both 2d and 3d versions are on the blu ray.  nmollo said everying I was thinking so I'll just paraphrase:<br /><br />\\"Excellent movie.\\"  Everything about it was convincing.  The actors, the acting, the city, the scenery, the action.  Very well done.<br /><br />\\"The camera work is fantastic. This is really a film to see in 3D.\\"  This was fantastic in theatres in 3D.  I have a 2D television and love the 2D version, too.<br /><br />\\"Pete Travis' direction is solid and Alex Garland's script is informed and (clever).\\"<br /><br />\\"Karl Urban is Dredd. He needs to be warmed too but he plays the part very well.\\"  It is hard to relate with someone when you can't see their face, but you will have formed a real bond with Dredd by the movie's end.<br /><br />\\"Olivia Thirlby is also excellent as Anderson. Lena Headey is very convincing in her Motherly role. \\"<br /><br />\\"I do hope this becomes a franchise. \\"  Me too!  It is a sleeper of a hit and I wish it was in theatres longer.  Solid movie and hope the blu-ray sales fly out the door so they make a sequel.<br /><br />Brilliant!!!!!
B008D1LVRY|5.0|Great all the way through. In my opinion this is the best record yet. If you are on the edge, just click buy!
B006ID6NDQ|4.0|Depressing...heartbreaking...as all Holocasust books are.<br />So sad.  Thought it would be based more on her being the wife of an officer.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|My son told me about this game and I have been hooked for 3 days!! It is an extremely smart game. The ones that make you think and use your brain and common sense are the best.
B0091WAN3C|5.0|One of the longer movies that you'll actually enjoy.  Nolan's version of gotham and this world of Batman, is much darker than previous versions of Batman, but the pacing will keep you into the movie.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I love horses and have always wanted one so I think that this game is cool. I do have a problenlm with it freezing though
B000MRAAJM|5.0|If you enjoy the beauty of Nature, This bluray will not disappoint.  Amazing cinematography mixed with the sharpness and color of bluary gives this a must have in your bluray collection.
B00A6SZS2Q|5.0|I think Black Veil Brides did a great job with this album. If you like Black Veil Brides it is definitely worth getting. If you have never heard them, check them out they are very good. I am happy that I bought this album. Enjoy!
B0040JHWKS|4.0|Thought that would get your attention but seriously while Darkness is a great album there are few tunes that don't do it for me.  I was on board from the beginning before Greetings (yep I'm gettin old) but after Born to Run I drifted away.  The River never took hold for me and the whole born in the usa thing struck me as a pepsi commercial - that being said if that's what you liked - more power to you and I'm not here to dissuade any of you we all have personal taste - and the Promise is right in my wheel house.  When I first heard this I thought WOW Bruce is back - and then I realized what this disc is all about.  (See I'm not an obsessive fan).  I will add that those that think these are fourth tier songs after 18 Tracks (which I like and own as well) I would add not so fast.  Obviously these were bare bone tracks that Bruce & Co. wanted to go back in and tweak.  Rough cuts that maybe he planned on re-recording a long time ago - and didn't get around to doing it until now.  The other more complete tracks released in the meantime.  I have no way of knowing.  But I really do think this batch of songs are accessible and track after track I think top Darkness - keep in mind that I think Adam Raised a Cain is a tour de-force and one of my all time favorite efforts ever by Bruce but while Promise doesn't contain any throat grabbing tracks like Adam/Cain or Candy's Room it is more consistent from the first to last track - I can't say that about Darkness.  Again just my opinion but maybe useful for others out there - Promise is a strong consistently good album from beginning to end.  In any event I took the opportunity to reacquaint myself with Bruce's huge catalog and threw together a Bruce Best of Volume II - cherry picking off his massive collection after Born to Run.  Here are the songs and sequence - turned out real well thought I would share.<br /><br />Adam Raised a Cain<br />Badlands<br />Prove it all Night<br />Lucky Town<br />Your own worst enemy<br />Girls in there summer clothes :)<br />Brilliant disguise<br />Tunnel of Love<br />Candy's Room<br />One Step Up<br />Old Dan Tucker<br />Cadillac Ranch<br />Long Walk Home<br />The Promised Land<br />Radio Nowhere<br />The river<br />My Beautiful Reward<br />Worlds Apart<br /><br />That all fits onto one 80 minute disc largely taken from Darkness on The Edge-Magic also lucky town, the rising, the river, tunnel of love and seeger sessions. Impossible to stay current on Bruce's career unless you are all in devoted - and his releases after Born to Run have been spotty for me.  But now that he has so many discs out you can pull gems off of everything and make yourself a really nice disc. Bruce is still kicking out some great music - it might not be wall to wall on one album but the man keeps working and this disc and Promise are a proud addition to my collection.here summer clothes :)<br />Brilliant disguise<br />Tunnel of Love<br />Candy's Room<br />One Step Up<br />Old Dan Tucker<br />Cadillac Ranch<br />Long Walk Home<br />The Promised Land<br />Radio Nowhere<br />The river<br />My Beautiful Reward<br />Worlds Apart<br /><br />That all fits onto one 80 minute disc largely taken from Darkness on The Edge-Magic also lucky town, the rising, the river, tunnel of love and seeger sessions.

B009CGYO0K|2.0|I liked this book up until \\"The Bobs\\" \\"comic\\" portion. The humor there was mediocre and a bit too crude.<br />Then it seemed to have a bit of a hard time picking back up the level of funny through to the end.<br />Not a horrible book, just could have been funnier.<br />And I have to agree with some of the other reviews that mentioned the Kindle version is not so reader friendly with such small fonts at times (and no way to zoom).
B003JJA59K|5.0|... This is your joint. Raw, but not too over the top. I highly recommend this film to said fans.
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|Easy read, changes your way of thinking about life and how we are trained to think/feel and being aware that we cannot push our thoughts on to anyone else.
B000IJ79V6|4.0|This 2-disc special edition is great for Superman lovers what want more than just the movie.  It includes a lot of entertaining extras such as:  The original theatrical cut of the film<br />Theatrical trailer<br />Vintage TV specials &#34;The Making of Superman II&#34; and &#34;Superman 50th Anniversary&#34;<br />I would recommend this item.

B00003CXBK|5.0|Great movie, has to be one of my all time favorites! Love the story line and the art. My only regret is not finding it and buying it sooner :) I highly recommend this to anyone who loves Hayao Miyazaki stories and films. A must have in any collection!
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|My wife and I initially rented this movie expecting a crappy remake of a crappy movie about a crappy comic book. We could not have been any further from the truth. For all out action, this movie can't be beat. THANK YOU for making this rated R, and not a PG-13 disappointment. This movie embodies violence done properly. The slow-motion scenes are the best thing since the Matrix. If you have the capabilities, get this movie in 3D. It was made specifically for 3D viewing, but the 2D version is still excellent.
B00355L2TU|4.0|I love the work outs, just wish that I wouldn't have bought them on my kindle, and instead had got the actual video... makes it had to watch on a tiny screen.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Great series start to finish just as remember.Glad to have the complete series so I don't have to try and remember things,now I can just play it again.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This Shotwtime Series is beyond compelling.  I am obsessed with it.  The acting is superb.  Claire Danes is incredible and so are Damien Lewis and Mandy Patinkin.  I have seen every episode at least twice.  When I decided to re-activate my Showtime channel, Season 1 had already ended and Season 2 was beginning.  Showtime didn't offer the first season ondemand until after I purchased the DVD and I had to know how it all began.  Again, did I say I am obsessed?!  this is a must-see series that is scarily true-to-life with it's terrorist plots and twists, it will keep you at the edge of your seat from beginning to end.  I can't wait for Season 3.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|The bag came with my D3200 and is so convenient to pack all the camera gear for a photoshoot.  Lightweight, durable, and quite nice.
B008NR8YXC|5.0|The only thing better than this recording of Andras Schiff is seeing it in person.  I'm glad I was able to get this and be able to listen to it over and over.  I have the same work by Barenboim, Richter and Gould and this holds up well against them.  I'd have a hard time picking any as my favorite.
B008BM9L72|3.0|I quite enjoyed the first book in the trilogy, Shades of Grey, but by the end of the third book it became quite yawnworthy.  Don't really know what all the hype was about!  Found the content very predictable by the middle of the first book.
B009GEAPYW|3.0|I know its based on the original graphic novel.  I am more used to the current trend in batman and dc animation.  Not a bad showing, but not great.
B005IULERU|5.0|Very funny book, and just like the website. It is nice to have 300 in one place, unlike the app that only updates every few days.
B00701QVVY|5.0|I bought this cd as a christmas gift for my husband since this is his favorite band and we both love it. Overkill does not disappoint with the jams on this one. I already loved the electric rattlesnake song but the rest are equally as good. I would recommend this to anyone who wants great thrash from a band that has stayed true to its roots.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I was addicted to this show! It was awesome!! I can't wait for the next show. I loved the service from Amazon!
B008TRUDAS|1.0|UGH! I could not even finish this book. It was so unrealistic and rushed. I swear they fell in love after page two! Impossible!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book held my attention throughout.  I'm not a fan of the back-and-forth storytelling, but in this case it wasn't a bother.  I liked the way they transitioned from lovers to psychotics.  I thought the ending was a little anti-climatic. I would have liked to see them as parents, psychosis and all.  Overall, a very enjoyable read.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Slow to get into, then it had me hooked with the twist. But then it twisted the other way, then back again until finally just leaving me hanging at the end. I always feel like an author gives up and takes the easy way out when he/she does that.

B0091LS07E|2.0|Keys is a talented musician and a wonderful role models.  I loved half of her Diaries album and considered the other half rubbish.  This album has none of the amazing songs she is capable of producing and I am sad to say it is mostly rubbish. I love mostly jazz music and singers so most likely my taste will not be similar to yours.
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|Great little application for entertaining children.  Lots of drawing tools; intuitive layout and controls.  Very good value for the small cost.
B00966TN1Q|2.0|Great story, great Harry Bosch in his usual defiant self, until about 2/3 into the story where he goes off on his own to investigate the crime more fully, as usual without the necessary approval & authority and more importantly, back-up.  and this is where the story morphs  into the unbelievable realm of the movies , almost like a DC comic book hero who you just know is actually invincible so no matter that he gets Into all kinds of s*** , it's gonna be O.K. and lucky for Bosch he has the  internal affairs detective ( whose name escapes me, further proof that she is merely an appendage to Boschs' shenanigans ) to actually save the day, and Bosch as it turns out - ho hum, yea right, pull the other one. Disappointing, in the end - literally  & figuratively
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it was very great. I love how you can get more horses! ;)<br /><br />still was awesome. I want more ways to get gems though I just did this for 3 gems.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I have read all 4 of Kate Morton's books and anxiously await more fabulous work from her.  I felt a connection with all of her characters and when I finished reading, I felt like I was leaving friends behind.  Highly recommend all of her works.
B00127RAJY|2.0|I did this program exactly as directed and lost zero weight. Level One is perfect for someone massively out of shape because it gets easier every few days. I moved to Level Two after a week but Three was too much for me as it wore on my spine. Jillian is motivating and not boring, and the idea that you are moving towards your goal is energizing. Until you reach the end with zero weight loss, zero sizes smaller, and just a temporarily higher endurance as the only change.<br />Other reviews show just how dangerous this is for your knees and spine. I had no idea! You may not care now, but trust me, when you can't work out AT ALL and can't work either and are home on the couch... you will gain more weight than you could imagine.<br />Jillian should know better.
B003LL3LHO|5.0|I am not someone who generally enjoys books based on games, but a friend of mine recommended this book very highly and I promised to give it a shot. I was unable to put it down once I started. The characters pull you in to their world immediately and you find yourself laughing and then holding your breath for these characters. I recommended this to anyone who enjoys a good adventure.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Not since falling in love with The Notebook has a Nicholas Sparks book pulled me in so completely. This book had a wonderful unexpected twist that was refreshing considering what I have come to expect from Sparks. A very enjoyable book. I am looking forward to seeing how this relates on the big screen.
B0024RIMBG|5.0|I think this disc captures about the very best of the Celtic Woman troupe. All artists are at their prime in this DVD. With the exception of Chloe, who should have been a lot slimmer to be in the midst of those pretty girls. But more damaging was her ever constant holding-up of her dress, indicating she was not at ease wearing those beautiful feminine dresses.<br /><br />Here, Hayley deserves a special mention. Despite her youth and being a new member of the troupe, she performed exceptionally well. She had the voice, look and style to make up for whatever shortcomings there were in this DVD. Hayley's soft femininity supplemented the regal Meav. As Lisa's sweetness complemented Orla. As for their singing voices, what more can one ask for. Except perhaps if Celtic Woman could persuade Suzan Erens (Holland) to join them.<br /><br />Overall this DVD earns the full five stars.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I couldn't tell when my kindle was charging. This app tells me how much time for video, browsing, and reading. It also tells me how long for slow and fast charge,but times are estimates not completely accurate. This app helps a lot. Thanks!

B004XWMXX8|5.0|My 13 year old daughter is a big fan, and she just loves the CD! Good price for good quality.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved the whole series, but this book I especially enjoyed. It was shipped as promised.  I would use this company again
030758836X|5.0|Love the plot, the characters and the ending. This book is so well written and offers so much insight into both its main female and male characters.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|The amount of truth in this book make it one I would recommend to anyone - not just Stephen King fans.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the easiest version I have found.  I had previously purchased the NIV version and it is NOT user friendly at all.  This app is fantastic!  Easy to navigate and love that it reads to you when needed.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it!  I especially loved having it on my Kindle!  This was a very interesting story, although the characters and story lines could have been more developed.
B00APUYN0I|3.0|Good, clean fun. Movie is just okay, music is really good. I'll never watch it again, but I don't regret seeing it.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Couldn't stop laughing. Love movies with singing so this was up my alley!! Enjoyed Fat Amy's humor and my favorite character.
B0084I9QI2|5.0|I'm old enough to remember Michael Jackson just becoming Michael Jackson.  My wife and I followed his career to the unfortunate end.  This album, as well as Thriller, is an absolute must.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son really enjoyed the game.  It has some features that the PC and Xbox games do not have, like nether reactors and mob attack animinations.  He can't wait until it is updated.
B009K72G8I|5.0|It's fun entertainment and it keep the door open to the imagination of the Star War saga. And for anyone new to the Star Wars, it would bring them back for the next showing, just to see what is going to happen next.
B008XG1X18|3.0|Like the title says, I love Pinterest, but the app isn't great. There isn't a good flow to it. I have the apple version on both my iPhone and iPad, and I like those better. They're more intuitive, where this one I still have to search around to find what I want.
B0037VNX44|1.0|the country allow a person to run around causing trouble for everyone, when he should been put away after the second incident. It was a waste of time and effort, this man life could been wrote in six pages or less, for he did the same thing over and over again, going to jail.
B003M696QS|5.0|This book is for skeptics who doubt the veracity of the near-death experience.  This author is grounded in the field of consciousness studies and is willing to confront the closed minds of his skeptical colleagues on their own ground--an exploration founded in a rigorous scientific method.  Van Lommel is also rigorously honest about what can be known and what may never be known.
0805092447|5.0|This was in excellent condition and its a very fun story for kids. It has no rips , marks, and all the pages were there. It was a hard cover copy and we are enjoying it, we are pleased with the date it arrived on and the packaging it came in was good. Thanks for making sure that quality counts we appreciate it .
B005LAIGQ4|5.0|This is a great family movie! I love Drew Barrymore and she doesn't disappoint in this movie. This is a feel good film for all ages to enjoy!
0887431453|3.0|This book was used and did have some writing in it but not on every page. I still can use this to our advantage and glad we ordered it. It was packaged properly and its education value is everything I expected and more.
B001CDZZI6|4.0|I purchased this in order to learn more about myself.  While I really did, it made me want more information.  What's past the 5 strengths?  What are the next 5?  They have options online to do more, but they are cost prohibitive.
B005COO1X6|3.0|It started out strong then fizzled. I don't have fourteen more words to offer. I won't bother to review again
0765334798|5.0|This is one of the funniest science fiction stories I have ever read.<br /><br />It's a space opera set on the Universal Union Capital Ship Intrepid. Andrew Dahl, Andy to his friends, has just been assigned to the ship and strangeness occurs right from the start.<br /><br />One of the senior members of the crew has caught an alien virus that will liquefy him in 6 hours if an antivirus isn't found. Andy is tasked with finding the anti virus. No problem his fellow crew mates say ; just put the blood sample in \\"the box\\" and the answer will be generated. Funny thing though is that the box just looks like a small microwave oven!  Andy pops the sample in, pushes the button and as promised comes up with an antivirus within the 6 hours saving the crew member.<br /><br />With that introduction the author takes us on a wonderful journey through a \\"wonderland\\" type environment that exists on the Intrepid.<br /><br />Eventually, Andy starts to figure out what is happening and soon there is time travel and possibly a solution. It's all written in a tongue in cheek style that keeps you reading to see how crazy it's going to get.<br /><br />The author develops the story line at a good pace, has relatable characters and a wicked sense of dark humour.<br /><br />As a bonus there are 3 Codas at the end of the book that link and expand on the theme in the main story. Again very funny.<br /><br />This is a book you will not be able to put down as who knows what could be on the next page !!!<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|After watching the first movie, I decided to read all the books so glad I did. I loved the ending.
B009DP9D6A|5.0|grandson loved this. I ordered it for him and I can't think of 12 more words to write so might have to quit doing reviews
B003F3NE1Q|5.0|yes it can be overly dramatic but thats what makes it good. this is my favorite season! but you have to know and love the characters to get into the drama.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This was a very good game.  Graphics and story and sound affects were great.  Well worth the money.  You will really enjoy it. Hoping for a sequel.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The streaming is a little bit slow. I would also prefer an EASY TO FIND download option button available for future purchases, as well as an ETA for future release dates with a pre-paid option. Including a reminder set up through email and/or text would be absolutley splendid! Attending to these details would make me a regular customer until watching these episodes is no longer possible(if we all lose internet in the face of global empidemics, for example:)
B0053O89WY|5.0|Already had Seasons 1-4 and had to add to my collection. This is one of the funniest shows on television today and will continue to live on through re-runs and DVD collections for many years. The plot gets more complicated this season, naturally, but the same funny things remain the same (Sheldon dressing up as a train conductor, for example.) Love season 5!
B00785P2QC|5.0|So addictive you can play for hours! I highly recommended that you have this<br /><br />game it is free to play and so much fun

B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Read the book in a matter of hours, couldn't  put it down.<br />Would make a good movie. I imagined Liam Hemsworth as Holder!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I rated this book a five. It was very helpful to my need of words. I would recommend it to others. Anyone I could find (friend wise). Anyways it was very helpful with my report. Thank you.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|The game has very cute graphics and has simple game play. The rewards button is very helpful in getting kitty points without paying and extra money. The Facebook button lets you get an instant cake maker which makes life way easier for your cafe and for you. I really liked this game, it is addictive and fun, just what I would expect from Hello Kitty.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|Very moving and although very sad, I found myself reviewing my own life and 're-evaluating what is most important  Insightful. Beautifully written and easy to read.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This is a wonderful series and I am looking forward to Season 3.  I have bought several more for friends.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I absolutely loved this book so much that I am now reading it over again. It was amazing and there were times when I could hardly put it down. I definitely recommend it.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Well written and good characters.  The ending and the twists will surprise.  Steamy, steamy sex scenes.  It all worked :)
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is an AWESOME GAME!!!!seriously I Love the Graphics. when I first saw the game I wondered how much fun it would be,then I figured that my sister had it on her kindle fire. Then she told all about it!so you should get this perfectly Awesome game,plus it's FREE to DOWNLOAD just do it then you'll have so much fun!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|One of the best little time-wasters around!  One game melts into two ... two into three ... three into 139!  Yikes!  Giggle ... just one more?  Please?
B000FBFN1U|2.0|I am getting so tired of this series; too much war and killing and machismo. The narrator does a good job with his differing voices, singing and emoting that it keeps it interesting. But even if he were the greatest narrator, I have already decided the series will rate no more than 3 stars at best with the lack of Text-to-Speech and loan-ability. Just the Audible version alone is costly, the book, just an e-book, is costly too. That is the most insulting thing an author or publisher could do. I doubt it is the author. By the way, I do think the author can weave a great story, Just not my kind of story. I will continue to read/listen to the rest of this series if only to be able to hold my own when my adult children or others discuss it.
B0044WSF5M|4.0|\\"George Lucas' least sci-fi influenced work happens to be better than the widely successful yet overrated Star Wars franchise. While seeing it 16-18 minutes in, the film grabs you with the central concept of seniors having the night of their life before they reach adulthood. It manages to be both a bittersweet and quirky dose of how things were idealistically and the kind of concerns that would spiral into an 18 year old's mind. By far, it is the perfect teen film or comedy there is under a critic's viewpoint but under mine too with its moments of emotional gravity, humour, believable yet corny performances (esp. from a younger Ron Howard, Mackenzie Philips, and Harrison Ford), goofball scenarios, 50s motifs and cues (one thing you will notice is a THX 1138 reference on one of the youth's cars), and true-form blues rock-and-roll. It is a simple film with nothing overtly topical or zany about it but somewhat like a naturalistic exercise in filmmaking that so happens to be filmed across 28 days even when the setting is nighttime. While it may seem outdated and a bit too cliche, it serves its point and shows what Lucas can do without having Jedis and Darth Vaders ruling the galaxy.\\"
B008S80P38|5.0|As always Deadmau5 provides a consistent array of beats and rhythms to keep you moving. This does not disappoint. Highly recommended.
B00AYDC5HY|4.0|\\"Treat yourself to one of the finest constructed and animated films in 2012. When you have a year of coincidentally gothic animated films like ParaNorman and Hotel Transylvania, the master behidn this sub-genre artform has kicked in to his 'comfort zone' with probably his best work in recent years along with Corpse Bride. What brings its rather grand scope of excellence is its willingness to pay homage to the 50s B-movie horror classics especially works like The Blob and Invasion of the Body Snatchers but through a child's perspective. The treatment of its rather grim subjects at PG (death/rebirth, bereavement, scientific tinkering) is all handled without seeming preachy or overtly sick/disturbing but as a matter of fact and integral to where the story was going in its own self. It has elements of humor, black-and-white effects work, and very fluid and archaic animation style that reminds us of how Rankin & Bass and Ray Harryhausen never fled the minds off our most brilliant filmmakers. While a short film exists, I preferred viewing this well-done work on its own seeing the recent one before the old 80s version. Even amidst its pluses, a few negatives exist with the rather fast-paced story, character development, focus time, and overall timing of things making it seem like it brushes past you (at less than 90 minutes) and a rather weak ending does make the film slightly suffer. Nevertheless, give Tim Burton a chance from a dud like Alice in Wonderland and see what he can with his own work, like Vincent, before seeing the original.\\"
B00AYDC5HY|4.0|Good for a rental, but probably would not buy. Typical Burton/Elfman style, plot, etc. If you like this style, you will like the movie.
B004YRSBTW|4.0|\\"The first time watching it felt more confusing in the long run as the many seeing it were inattentive and willing to talk over silly quibs. The second time, it was more focused and geared toward the plot and ideas, felt more in synchronisation with this rather bold and complex storyline. For starters, the Nolan fandom (popularity rose after The Dark Knight) has not been a part differing myself from the friend who had a copy of this DVD (who says this is his favourite film). First off, the idea that it is a favourite is nothing to be ashamed of. Memento has something elusive and cryptic about its ideas and thoughts and leaves for multiple discussion and dissecting of particular scenes (in addition, the cinematography, performances, Hans Zimmer-esque soundtrack, indie feel/credibility, and Hitchcockian/Fincher-esque vibes that ring true in this film are prevalent!, esp. in the case of films like Se7en, Blackmail, and Vertigo). Guy Pearce, who plays Leonard/Lenny, steps in the jacket of a James Stewart-type figure arguing for interpretations and perspective of the murder of his wife which sounds about as paranoid/schizophrenic as his short-term memory loss character Leonard as in Vertigo where he idolises a dead body. Trippy, enigmatic, and quite disturbing at moments- this is uncompromising, complex, and without clear elaboration, inventive all the way especially considering it has no source material from a book but through a brotherly bond through Jonathan (Chris' brother) Nolan too in the form of a short story. In all respect, this film is surprisingly more superior than Inception and The Dark Knight Rises given its source material, its foundation, and credentials. While difficult on many corners, it feels more closely knit and compact in scope with many discussion-heavy elements than his more commercial features.\\"
B006LSZECO|5.0|Excellent read! I would love to see this made into a movie. Lots of twists and turns. I could not put it down!!!
B0034G4OYA|4.0|\\"Genndy Tartakovsky's first motion picture is at best his most interesting and vibrant work since Dexter's Laboratory and other collaborative efforts with The Powerpuff Girls. With a year of three \\"horror-themed\\" animated films, Hotel Transylvania is moreover the funniest and quirky out of the bunch. Not entirely meant to be taken seriously but it is still interesting to know what Tartakovsky and the folks from Sony Pictures Animation (which have brought only one good film in their roster, not in cooperation with Aardman, Open Season) can do with popular ghoulish figures and the way they animate themselves. As Dr. Mark Kermode (British film critic) pointed out, it is in many ways similar to Monsters, Inc. where an outsider/non-monster encounter intrudes the place. This is surprisingly good feature for the B-movie horror cliches and motifs are more prevalent but the film does suffer from lagging character development on some characters, occasional fast pacing, and a lackluster ending that will surely make the folks at Pixar be scratching their heads.\\"
B001VFTYWI|5.0|A wonderful web of creative characters and situations. Not to mention the master strokes of forensic analysis amd thrilling sequences that makes impossible to live the book until the very end of it.
B004GYY714|5.0|CBS decided Seattle needed another sports radio station more than progressive talk.  So in a very liberal, Democratic region, we no longer have any progressive stations - and 3 sports stations.  But with TuneIn, I've been listening to Chicago on my Kindle Fire over our wireless home network.  Love it!  Great option with lots of choices.  And I can still get my Thom Hartmann fix every afternoon!
B0042QNP2S|5.0|Bought this for my 3 year old Nephew. He loved it! Best Christmas present he received. Later on I purchased the garbage cans & men for his birthday.

B007B6VOG0|5.0|An Irish Folk Rock sound that gives Mumford & Sons a good run for your money.  The &#34;Some NIghts&#34; makes it all worth while and it just gets better.  The music makes a drab winter day feel full of sunshine and joy.  Love it!  Make a play list with it and add the Lumineers and Mumford & Sons a case of Killian's red and it is party time!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I love an adventure that keep you guessing through the story.the monkey a nice touch and cute.I give it 5 stars I totally enjoyed this game.give me more!!!!!
B00AHXIC50|5.0|It continued on with the smooth Mars style established with &#34;just the way you are&#34; and improved it with his rendition of &#34;young girls&#34; and &#34;Locked out of heaven&#34; If that wasn't enough  &#34;money make her smile&#34; put this CD over the top of must haves! It is just plain pure fun and feel good sound.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|I loved this Trilogy. I was intrigued the whole way though. Although it may start off a little slow the details are very important for climax of the boy. Excellent Read, would highly recommend it
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is amazing and the picture and sounds are just great. I love playing this game it keeps me very entertained.
B004DM0UII|4.0|I liked the selection you could choose from but they didn't have local main stations/ Its Not Like  Pandora where you can choose a type of song making it not as useful
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I chose this book to read on a whim, as the movie came out and i have yet to see it. This was the best book I have ever read, giving insights upon survival, physically and mentally.
B005MMYBXI|5.0|Lots of action, very entertaining, and easy to feel like  right there with the actors.  Wonderful casting job. Loved it
B0044DEAUA|5.0|I am using this device and I is good so order one for a friend of my. It's simple in operation and the battery lasts long.

B005LAIIPS|5.0|This movie will or can keep the Bourne series to continue also was glad they did not do way with Jason as well  I found myself liking this movie more than previous critics
B009329Y30|4.0|good movie, great reception from Amazon, easy ordering process. Love the ease of ordering movies right from the comfort of home.
B001CT877Q|4.0|For Arnold of all of his movies I will have to be up front this is the only movie that I out right liked of his past movies
B00A6HHJ9C|5.0|This CD is the best CD Lukather has ever made. The songs are great, production by Luke & CJ Vanston is stellar & there are some of the Worlds greatest musicians on this CD. You can't put a label on this CD because it covers many types of music. There is not a 'skip over' song on it. It is a must have for any music fan.
B000WC39SG|5.0|Updated version of many before this story  It does have funny moments serious and moments This was a good movie to watch more than once
B007VUA7VO|5.0|A fallacy of the Kindle 4G is no indicator light to tell that it's charged. The Battery HD not only shows the battery charge level, it also gives remaining reading time, music time even browsing time.  Another plus, how long it will take to charge and time since last charge. I really like this product!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|A turn page book were u can't stop reading and u just fall in love with everything from katniss to peta to Gale to cinna and the capital

B0048LPRCS|4.0|love the movie, love the director, he is my favorite, i was only discouraged that my movie came in a clear case with the enter the void cover art slid in the case, it looks like the case was put together by someone and doesnt look like the original case, unless thats just how the movie is, I wouldnt know. awesome film though, fantastic condition.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I just wish it showed the date, but I like the other options and so easy to use. So worth the 1.99
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|The story kept me engaged throughout. Living in the DC area, the story was like a scavenger hunt in my backyard. I now want to take a closer look at my city.<br /><br />I think anyone who loves history, with an action twist, will enjoy learning about the mysteries that are right in front of us every day.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I know it's only January but there are two books that I have read this month that I'll probably never forget for the rest of my life. This is one of them. I didn't know what to expect from this book but I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Slammed\\" and \\"Point of Retreat\\" from this author last year. I jumped on this one after the huge amount of reviews that popped up after only a short time of being released. I mean, almost 5 stars from over thousands of people has got to mean something, right? Anyhow, this book sucked me in and I was so not prepared for this story line. Unlike almost anything I had read before, this story touched me. It was well written, developed and just overall a heartwarming story. Keep 'em coming Ms. Hoover!
B0053O89IS|5.0|This tv show is one of my favorite's I love watching this show over and over again.  It is interesting and has a story line and great humor.  It is a must see can't wait for season eight.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This app will be the next angry birds or cut the rope. It is very good on kindle fire, no flaws.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Fun to play, realistic looking horses, natural movement, easy to understand menus. Just don't have enough time to devote to it to get very far and get more stuff.
B0031RS4V6|5.0|For those who have and those who haven't read Jack Reacher, this is a great read; Always fun, and always unpredictable. Reacher's like the Super Hero.<br /><br />Lee Child does it again with the tough mans tough man
B008JGSM6G|5.0|So fun.  Very addictive! Once you unlock new puzzles you seriously won't want to quit until you have finished them all.
B003L0R090|4.0|Very good later work from these guys. One of my favorites. An excellent choice if I may say so myself.
B001NLL93W|3.0|When I started to read the mortal instruments. it proved to be difficult. The characters were flat, the relationships were forced. I kept reading hoping it would get better and to my surprise by the third book city of glass it has. I like a few more characters now then I did in city of bones. I still dont like Clary. It's just sad that I had wait three whole books to get what I wanted.<br /><br />This seemed like a good ending but to my surprise there's another book. I'm sorry but I'm going to stop reading here before it gets to cliche. Clary has everything in the end so you know shes going to lose something.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was hesitant to read this book by Colleen Hoover for silly reasons.  I have read Slammed and Point of Retreat and loved them and I honestly was afraid this one wouldn't measure up to those.  I also had heard that it was \\"racy\\" and although I'm fine with that.....Haha, I knew that the main characters were teenagers and I felt it would be awkward.  I truly loved this book!  You can really see her growth as a writer and Colleen developed wonderfully interesting characters that were so complex,  you could look back and say \\"that's why he said or did that!\\"  I love that and it happened so many times for me.  It's such a pitiful story line but you are hooked because of the twists and turns that you don't expect!  Awesome read that I'll definitely recommend to all of my friends!
B001HBYHFA|5.0|Excellent SciFi! I suggest watching the TV show &#34;Firefly&#34; prior to viewing though to get a better understanding of the characters.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|First, this movie totally flew under the radar. Heard almost nothing about it. Scoped it out on Amazon instant after seeing that it was 77%+ on the tomatometer and 7.2/10 on the IMDB metacritic...the download failed, well, it worked but after an hour it only downloaded to my TiVo to the tune of 12%. Bad news, wife's night out was over and my dad's choice movie night sunk. Customer service was great--refunded me and tossed me a credit for another try for any movie. Ended up getting Dredd on bluray from Redbox and that worked great. This movie is extremely well-done. The mind-reading special effect was a bit played out by the end--enough with the shockwaves, I understand the girl can read minds. The music: techno stuff used extremely well. Villain: very cool and enough back story to make her interesting. Urban as Dredd? Excellent choice...really liked him in Star Trek and he's good here despite never taking the mask off--at least you can see his mouth move when he talks which gives him a leg up on Bane from Batman. Special effects: worked well, especially for slow-mo drug scenes. I then actually just ordered this movie on bluray from Amazon to keep as it's really that good. I'd describe it as Robocop meets Girl With The Dragon Tattoo on Matrix Reloaded EFX. Works for me...and I really hope enough people feel as I do because I really want to see them make more of these. I didn't see the 3D version but I'll never watch a movie with glasses...not playing that game.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|Great read! Was a great end to a great series! Really sucked me in. Had to keep reading til the very last page!
B008B1VYP0|5.0|Such a great album!  The beats, the lyrics, Adam's voice have all been taken in to account on this album.  I listen on my way to the gym and it gets me energized.  LOVE IT!!!
B005EGXTHG|5.0|Great sequel! The twists are unexpected! Never knew what was coming and I loved that! Won't disappoint! Great to read!
B005AERS74|2.0|Not my favorite Maroon 5 album.  The production doesn't do Adam's voice justice.  It does have a couple of popular songs on it, but it's just 'ok' overall.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|At first the &#34;sensual&#34; stuff is a bit exciting but then after a while the writing becomes a bit monotonous.. the writer needs to work on her skills in describing same scenarios in different ways to keep them interesting..
B009JBZH54|5.0|A must-have for those who enjoyed Nolan's take on Batman. Watched each movie at least 3 times (each time with friends who haven't seen it) and everyone has commented on how good the trilogy is.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|The story line had a few twists but it was pretty much the same as the first book.. Not bad
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Thrilling tale of survival and the human spirit along with everlasting courage and love. A MUST read for all ages.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Fantastic! Didn't think it would be so good! Got really sucked it! Was well worth the read! Loved the sequels too
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Now this is what good apps are all about.  Easy to use and direct information without odd frills.  I constantly use it!
B007KOYEOC|5.0|Definitely not the greatest written book. Very predictable but good if you're after something girly to read. Easy reading. A nice way to end the trilogy.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|Not as good as the computer program for google.  The page with all the buttons is confusing.  The simple google is better.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I love this show. It's thrilling, imaginative, and keeps you guessing! The cast is amazing and if you haven't seen this then you must do so immediately.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I really like the way this app works.  It is really better than my laptop computer for ease of operation!
B007U4DIM6|5.0|My daughter just loves the whole series of Beverly Hills Chihuahua movies. It's Disney family fun with adorable talking dogs.
B005FISC52|3.0|I was so happy to be completing my series of One Tree Hill that i love but when i received it i was a disappointed that one of the discs was not in place so it was moving inside. When i opened it one of the discs were scratched which really made me mad since i was looking forward to it. Im so picky about my DVD's and especially One Tree Hill so i guess ill be buying this season dvd again because i refuse to have them scratched. So this is why i put its okay. THE SEASON ITSELF IS GREAT! Saw it all on TV and am a HUGE OTH fan! i recommend the product just not sure about the seller.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|My daughter absolutely loves this movie and looks up to Bethany Hamilton for coming back from her attack to do what she loves to do. Children need good role models and this movie delivers a great inspirational story about Bethany Hamilton.
B005RJ6DUK|5.0|This is a must see movie not just for anyone living in the New York area but anyone. It truly depicts life in the 60's living in The Bronx. Robert De Niro portrays his role well but his debut directing skills truly shine with this movie.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|The game is adorable and fun for kids, the two star rating is because children are given the opportunity to purchase items to get farther in the game........a friend's daughter bought $20 worth of coins/jewels without her mothers knowledge....when I was informed of this I immediately opened the game and was soon asked if I wanted to purchase items, this is ridiculous, there is an option to buy $100 worth of coins/jewels.......this should not be in a game that is designed for young children and I should not have to check each child's game to see if this scam (that is the best description I could come up with since it takes advantage of kids and a parents wallet) is part of a game. There should be some type of warning when the game is purchased or an option to turn this feature off.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Enjoyed the book very much and looking forward to reading the next book  in the trilogy.  Fall of Giants a good read
0307586901|5.0|Didn't know what to get my grandaughter for Xmas, and came upon this book of crafts. She loves anything and everything along this line, and this is a winner. Great ideas, varied and fun!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|This is the first story I have read of Sylvia's and it won't be the last. This story is face paced and definitely kept me glued to the pages. I became quickly engrossed in Gideon and Eva's lives. I've never seen an author take two scorched souls and make them whole by loving one another. It's not an easy feat to accomplish but Sylvia's does it well.<br />Both characters have a cross to bear. Secrets can be terrible things but sometimes they are necessary as Eva comes to learn at the end of the end of this tale which is by no means the end of Gideon and Eva's story. Gideon is a powerful self-made business man. Eva is a daughter of well off parentage. Her extended family that includes Cary a made model is just icing on the cake but leaves you longing to know more of his story which I hope will continue to be revealed along with Eva and Gideon's in the next book.<br />Just when you think you are beginning to figure out the characters Sylvia leads down another unexpected turn in the path to happiness. This erotic tale is most definitely that. This is the 2nd book in the Cross Fire series. It does stand by itself but I will be getting the first book to completely understand why Gideon and Eva's story first started. But I caution you to have tissues handy because Gideon and Eva's story most definitely delves into the heart of some serious real life issues that would be hard for any one person to deal with. Does it have a happy ending? Yes but we're not sure where it leads until it continues on with Entwined With You.<br />What I liked: I loved the way it is so easy to get involved in the main characters life. I love the face pace of the story. I read this book in 2 days.<br />What I didn't like: This story most definitely has a D/s flavor to it and I wish she would have delved a bit more into this aspect of it. This story for me didn't have enough of that concept that she sprinkled into it. I hope it is something we will see more of in her next book of this series.<br /><br />I received a complimentary copy from author/publisher in return for an honest review.br />I received a complimentary copy from author/publisher in return for an honest review.

B005XLN97M|5.0|got this item for a great price during the holiday season. Everything is plastic, but i think that most Barbie houses are now a days. So for 20.00 this was pretty cool.... was easy to put together
B0072GPQNG|5.0|&#34;We enjoyed the movie. it was as good as they said it was going to be. I would recommend it others
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|This is Adobe Reader for Android by Adobe. It does handle Bookmarks, but NOT &#34;indexed files&#34;. Adobe Reader X (for Windows) handles Both. Not bad considering the price (free). How can one go Wrong. BTW Kudos for the Amazon Store to have an<br />Android Amazon StoreApp App. Using a Nook HD+ running CM10, I now have access to the Amazon Store. As of 23JAN13 there is NO Google PlayStore App App at play.google.com. Kudos again to Amazon. They know customer service.
1400052181|5.0|I enjoyed this book that we read for book club. It was interesting and provided for a lot of conversation .
B0083Z3O8Y|3.0|This is the original. Everyone knows the story so well, it is hard to read and keep in mind how many other stories and movies it spawned. If you have read it before, it is worth reading again. If you have not read, you must take time to read.
030758836X|4.0|While the book arrived in good time, I didn't like the story as much or the ending. Too far fetched a story, I think.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Best of Times, Worst of Times<br /><br />Historian Michael Beschloss ranks Lincoln as the best American President and Daniel Day Lewis's magnificent performance as the 16th President seconds that judgement.  Beschloss also ranks Lincoln's predecessor, William Buchanan, as the worst U.S. President and Lincoln, the movie, supplies ample evidence for that judgement too.<br /><br />The film clears up a great deal about Mary Todd Lincoln's role in establishing the tone for the modern White House.  At one point, Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones) threatens to have Mrs. Lincoln investigated for what he thinks is her high spending.  She gives a sharp (and accurate) rebuttal - when the Lincolns moved in after the Buchanans, the White House was \\"a pig sty\\".  Mrs. Lincoln's spending after years of neglect finally made the place habitable.<br /><br />There are searing film sequences that explore other tensions between Mrs. Lincoln and the President, these mostly deal with the status of their son; Mrs. Lincoln literally begging the President to spare him from battle, and in one of their titanic fulminations, she queries the stars more than anything: \\"How will we ever get through this?\\"  and Lincoln's simple logic is revealed.  \\"Somehow\\" he replies.  Working on passage of the 13th Amendment, Daniel Day Lewis gives Lincoln his defining quality - he can see through to the other side of an issue, while most of those around him are so consumed by petty bickering they can't imagine what a solution looks like.  There are places in the film where Daniel Day Lewis gives Lincoln a brutal bluntness to rally his supporters.<br /><br />Just when we think there can't be anything new about the Civil War, the film finds ways to shock us all over again.  For example, few would suspect that New York's House delegation  led the fight (aided and abetted by congressional leaders from Connecticut) to retain slavery!  The moment Tommy Lee Jones, as noted earlier playing Thaddeus Stevens, removes his wig and leaps into bed with his African American mistress has to be one of the most indelible moments in film history.<br /><br /> A dense of doom and imperilment pervades the film, especially  in Lincoln's yellowish skin; even in direct sunlight he appears sallow and unhealthy - mercifully, the film does not give us the assassination, focusing instead on the reaction of others to the tragedy.  In every aspect - story, characterization, cinematography, this is more than a movie, it's the DNA  of America.ig and leaps into bed with his African American mistress has to be one of the most indelible moments in film history.<br /><br /> A dense of doom and imperilment pervades the film, especially  in Lincoln's yellowish skin; even in direct sunlight he appears sallow and unhealthy - mercifully, the film does not give us the assassination, focusing instead on the reaction of others to the tragedy.

030759565X|4.0|I received this as a gift from my boyfriend and I absolutely love it. There are so many creative cooking finds. I made the maple bacon biscuits and I have to say they were so delicious. I've followed her blog for a few years now, but I love having her cookbook in my kitchen for everyday inspiration.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Wonderful detail and imagination.  The twists and turns in the plot keep the pages turning.  I would love to see the last 2 books become movies.
B005USZYDU|5.0|I  have not  finished  this  book as  yet but  so  far  so  good.  I  am  sure  there  will  be  a  twist or  2
B004MPESSY|4.0|At first I was a little reluctant to watch since i am not a fan of rape scenes in movies.  In the end its nice to see a seemingly weak, broken woman take care of business.
B005USZML4|5.0|This  book  is  a  very  nice  read  and  I  enjoyed it  throughly.  I  have  read  a  lot of  John Grisham  books  and  enjoy  all of them
B009NPKTN6|5.0|Love it!  Not a serious musical, think of it like Hairspray of the 80's. If you like the 80's you'll enjoy it.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I use it because I have to. The app is horrible. It seems to have trouble when I'm connected to wifi.
B007MDB548|5.0|Bought this for my 2 girls 3 ad 7 years old.  They loved the movie and the 3d effect was really good.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|very enjoyable, Judi DEnch is superb as always and was nice to have a happy ending! I have recommended it to several people.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|Book was great!! It inspired and motivated me to look forward to something bigger & better than us, especially during these crazy times we are living!!! Not a long, dragged out book....a good read!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was even better than I thought it was going to be. I knew that it would be good but I had no idea it would be this good.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|O M G… What an incredible way to start off my first purchase on my new kindle! I have never heard of Colleen Hoover and gave this author a shot. And man, I'm glad i did!<br /><br />The plot was so brilliantly planned out, with a few unexpected twists that you would NEVER see coming. As it unfolds all the pieces fall together perfectly! The book was a such an easy read and had me hooked from page one all the way to the end.<br /><br />The relationship between Sky and Holder is incredible. Everything about them is so real and definitely made me fall in love with them. From the first time they met, to their first kiss, to their first life altering event, it will keep you rooting for them throughout the the entire time you read. Both of them go through rough times yet find HOPE in each other in a life of darkness. It proves that there's always a light at the end of the tunnel.<br /><br />**This book is a MUST READ. It is a bit dark in nature but great nonetheless.
B003W77SDU|5.0|Great artist, moving music, great stuff. As a Cuban American, Gloria Estefan's CD inspires and calls to an unexplainable part of ourselves within.
B005TBWN0K|4.0|I've only used it a couple times but I like the features it has.  I'd have to play around more with it to give it 5 stars.
B0010SKUYM|4.0|Am SO glad a Good friend of mine,from England,turned me onto Mr. Rothfuss! She knows i'm a Huge Terry Brooks fan,and the rest is history!Amazing story and writing.Put me right beside Kvothe thru out the book!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I found that using FB directly on a web page is better than using this app.  I have it on my phone and it's fine but with my Kindle Fire, I like using the web page better.
B004GHNIRK|2.0|I couldn't read it.  Knocked off trying after chapter 6.  Too  verbose for me.  In saying that, I recognised the author's ability and claim to fame!<br />Stuart Pemberton
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I have to admit, I resisted getting this book for so long because I'm not a fan of poetry or &#34;slamming&#34;, but I was so pleasantly surprised how much I loved this book. The book was so well-written, it just flowed. The storyline was very refreshing compared to a lot of books I have been reading lately. It made me laugh, cry, made my heart ache but recover quickly. Highly recommend this one!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I absolutely love this game!!! It's extremely addicting, and I have trouble putting it down. The only negative thing I could say about it is, accidental purchases are a little too easy. I had a ton of acorns, which are really hard to earn, and I spent them on something I didn't even want. Other than that, this is by far my favorite game on my kindle.
B007WFTFG6|4.0|I like this for the grandkids.  i feel it is more for preschool age.  I liked it because it is easy for the preschoolers to manuver
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|game that challenges you. it gives you very little to help you unless you use the hints, which I try not to use. All in all it's a great game
0062082353|5.0|I was pleased with that the book was in the exact condition described by the seller. And I was pleased with the speed of delivery.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I forced myself to put the book down often so it wouldn't end too soon. I was captivated for all 800-some odd pages. Great job!
B0046ECFRM|5.0|I chose this rating because the book was amazing<br />I love how their Is so much drama and love, their Is nothing to dislike about this book.<br />I recommend this book too people that love drama/love books
B005GSY23M|4.0|The electronica on here harkens back to the 80s, for me. A lot of it has a kind of modern twist on that retro-80s sound, but some of it just sounds... 80s, I guess. Nevertheless, I liked it. I like the instrumentals most of all, I guess. Very rhythmic and hypnotic. See my review of the film itself for further commentary on the soundtrack. Long story short (a first for me!), if you like the soundtracks to movies like Riskey Business (sound track by Tangerine Dream) or The Virgin Suicides (sound track by Air), I think you'll like this one. Listen to clips first, to be sure.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|The cases are top quality and fit great with kindle fire hd only problem is its hard to make the case stand in horizontal position with out eventually almost knocking it down ! But all in all is worth money
1481853805|1.0|They got the title wrong again. ``On the origin of the species\\" should be ``On the origin of species\\".<br />The second `the' is wrong, and is a favorite misrepresentation of creationists. Darwin did not<br />write any book with the title they use.

B002QE3CTY|4.0|I really liked this book. I would recommend to read the prequel to this book, The kill order. I highly recommended it.
0307950654|2.0|I'm a huge fan of P D James' - I read all her books - so when I gave a 2 star rating and a thumbs down to `The Private Patient\\", I was gently chastised by a fellow reader for being overly harsh and reminded that we should be grateful that James is still writing at her age. So when I started on \\"Death Comes To Pemberley\\" I was well prepared to cut her some slack but sadly however, having read this her latest, I have to say that it's possibly her least satisfactory to date. How so ?<br /><br />It is difficult to pick a fault with the prose - Austen fans would no doubt disagree but I found the long flowing sentences as reminiscent of Austen's style as one could possibly expect in the modern context. The problem lies with the plot, which if it exists at all, is as thin as it is static. It goes absolutely nowhere. What we get throughout is the tedious recounting of the events leading up to the discovery of the murder. There is also hardly a back story of any interest to keep the reader turning the pages whilst waiting for the truth to be unveiled and even when that happens, the result is underwhelmingly anticlimactic.<br /><br />Finally, the editing leaves much to be desired. I didn't flag the passage so can't point to it but there was definitely one where it made no sense to me when the name of a third party who had nothing absolutely to do with the proceedings was suddenly referred to.<br /><br />I will continue to read anything P D James publishes but sadly \\"Death Comes To Pemberley\\" comes well short of her usual standard.
B0050X1OQ6|5.0|I was crossing my fingers when I ordered this as nobody had tried it in an Eee Box, and I read about so many compatibility issues with the RAM that is recommended for use with this computer.  The general consensus of the posts I read seemed to say that the CL9 RAM that seems to be recommended by all the specialty sites doesn't play well with many of the Eee Boxes which seem to want to run at CL7.  I tested the existing 2GB stick that was in the box using cpu-z and it said it was running at 7,7,7,20, so I decided to take the chance that this would work and order it.  I installed it tonight alongside the existing stick (which looks identical except for being blue) and it seems to work perfectly.  I haven't seen any of the random flashing lines that I was getting before the upgrade, and the speed increase is amazing.  2 gigs is not nearly enough on this box when it has to share ram with the graphics card leaving only 1.6 gig's available for everything else, the swapping with only running firefox and a few tabs was slowing the system to a crawl.  Now everything is very snappy.  Procexp reports that physical ram used right after a reboot and only starting firefox with my wife's default tabs is1.7 gigs, which explains why the system was so slow before the upgrade considering that cpu-z was only showing 1.6GB available ram.  Oddly enough, now it shows 4096 Mbytes of physical.  Not sure why only having one stick shows less than 2048 Mbytes of physical ram.

B005LAJ1O0|5.0|You have to see this show. It is on its 2nd season and I will be buying that as well. If you love a show that keeps you on your toes with twists and turns this is the one for you!! And some very hot actors ;)
B0045HCIYA|5.0|Demi Moore is a woman with a beautiful body! She is a bright star in an average movie.The script revolves around her because it would not be seen otherwise.
B001EN71HC|5.0|I love all of the Austin Powers movie so this was cheap and worth the buy to have them all on blu ray!! If you love Austin its worth it!
1433502410|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my husband and I seem to use it more than him, I love it so much. The ESV is very similar to the NKJV but it's a little easier to understand. This bible is great if you are wanting to get deeper and study more of God's heart and His infallible word to us!
B0029XFN9O|5.0|They rarely play this movie during the holidays (mostly the first one). It was worth the money and the quality is so much better on blu ray.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I am a big fan of mysterys, but this one has so many twists and turns it keeps you turning the page to find out what is the truth.<br /><br />Very different from the usual thrillers.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Saw this movie in the  theater and I own the other 2 so I had to buy this one. If you have not seen this trilogy yet then you have to see them all!!
B009M588K8|5.0|I am a retired military man and I liked the way the book was written. The information was well covered without revealing any classified material, unlike our politicians who know nothing of information security. The descriptions provided were excellent and the military bearing throughout the book were outstanding. This is one of the best books I have read in a long time.
B005LAII1C|5.0|One of the funniest movies EVER!! If you love Seth McFarlane and Family guy then you will love this. Everyone of age should see this movie... Definitely dont watch around children.
B004IAR4Q6|5.0|I had this suggested to me,and bought without listening to samples or reading reviews first.  I have to admit, I thought the person who recommended it had found something in the old school Allman Brothers sound.  It's not, as the other reviews (I finally read) reveal..  However, it's good. Very, very good. This is a solid blues album that you will listen to over and over, eventually singing along with, if your voice gets that soulful!!<br /><br />However, it Ain't &#34;Eat a Peach&#34;.  If that's what you're looking for, listen to the samples - all the samples before you buy - I bet you will still buy it though.  I'm almost looking forward to sometime I *need* to listen to the blues so I can have this to fall back on.
B005LAIGSC|5.0|If you havent seen this movie then you are missing out. Denzel is great and so is Ryan Reynolds. Definitely worth it!!
B00916TU00|5.0|I am so excited that I can get the UK version of this product in America, because the US release had a different track listing. The UK Import version is absolutely incredible. I listen to this ALL THE TIME. Perfect.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I had heard so much about the book and it was recommened by a friend.  So I finally gave in and purchased it.  I was so disappointed.  Predictable! Juvenile! Written as something the author would like you to believe could happen.  Yeah, right! What a crock of bull.  If you want to read something that is more intense and is written as a story, I would recommend reading Anne Rice &#34;Beauty&#34; series.  Now that is a book that will make you shiver!
B009PLKPMS|5.0|As one of the few hardcore McFly fans in the States, I think this product is exactly what I needed to fulfill all of my Tom, Danny, Harry and Dougie needs. Great range in song selection, and ALL of them are very good. Love it.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|I love Emily Giffin's books.  She writes very well and she keeps your attention and interest through the book.  I will buy another book by her again.  Definitely.
B00A1XOPE8|3.0|Nice story, needed a little padding, the plot was a little thin and the background/backdrop wasn't really there. It needed some substance.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A good book which kept me reading on a long flight but just was far too implausible.  Suspension of disbelief, I guess, is the key.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I loved this book, so good.  I am normally not in to poetry but I really enjoyed it a lot.  I would recommend this book to everyone.
B000001FN3|5.0|The Alan Parsons Project's debut album Tales of Mystery and Imagination was released in May of 1976.<br />The Alan Parsons Project was the namesake band of wunderkind British producer/engineer Alan Parsons whom had made a name for himself being a tape operator when The Beatles recorded Sgt Pepper and The White Album (one of his first sessions) and an engineer when they made Abbey Road and Let it Be and also engineered Pink Floyd's albums Atom Heart Mother (he mixed the album) and Dark Side of the Moon. In addition, produced records for The Hollies, Al Stewart and Pilot among others. Then Alan got together with Scottish songwriter and arranger Eric Woolfson who then decided to record an album together after getting an album deal with 20th Century Records (which was home of disco artists like Barry White and Carl Douglas (whom Woolfson managed)) in the US whilst earning a deal with Charisma Records (home to Genesis and Monty Python) in the UK and went to Abbey Road Studios in London (apart from much of \\"The Raven\\" which was recorded in Los Angeles and bits of the \\"Fall of the House of Esher\\" which was recorded at Kingsway Studios in London) throughout 1975 to record its debut.<br />The album's theme was based on the works of famed writer Edgar Allen Poe. The musicians on the album, in addition to Parsons and collaborator/keyboard player Eric Woolfson, is almost all of Pilot (the same band who had a hit in 1975 with \\"Magic\\") which were bass player David Paton, guitarist Ian Bairston and drummer Stuart Tosh plus members of Ambrosia who play on the track \\"The Raven\\" and too had Alan Parsons produce its debut also on 20th Century Records. Plus orchestrator Andrew Powell and several singers (see below). At the time of this album's release, prog was king and fit right in and sounds excellent today.<br />We start with the instrumental \\"Dream Within a Dream\\" which sees keyboards from Woolfson and Billy Lyall (who also plays recorder) slowly morph into a series of bass guitar thumps by Ambrosia bass player Joe Puerta plus the drums of Tosh, Fender Rhodes from Woolfson, the guitars of Bairnson and Paton and harmony vocals by Paton and then ends with the bass thumps as each instrument fades bit by bit. We segue into the brilliant \\"The Raven\\". This track (featuring British actor Leonard Whiting on lead vocal and vocoder from Alan Parsons) is one great number and the band Ambrosia play the drums (Burleigh Drummond), guitars (David Pack), keyboards (Christopher North) and bass guitar (Joe Burleigh) here (Ian Bairnson adds lead guitar solos on the 1987 mix). \\"The Tell-Tale Heart\\" is next and is a superb rocker. The track features \\"The God of Hell Fire\\" himself Arthur Brown on lead vocals (and singing like he is possessed by Satan himself). Interesting that the 1987 mix has a different lead vocal take to the 1976 mix but still great nevertheless and guitar solos from Bairnson added (the original 1976 mix was excellent as well). Next is the haunting \\"The Cask of Amontillado\\". This is another great song and features John Miles on lead vocals with help from Terry Sylvester and changes dynamic from the quiet verses to the heavy hitting instrumental passage. \\"The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether\\" ends the first half on a great note. This US Top 40 hit rocker is sung passionately by John Miles and is a beautiful song.<br />\\"The Fall Of the House of Usher\\" takes up 16 minutes of the album's second half. It begins with \\"Prelude\\" which is haunting orchestrations and segues into \\"Arrival\\" which begins with a thunderstorm recorded at Abbey Road and segues into keyboards, drums, bass guitar and guitars before it ends and segues into the orchestral induced \\"Intermezzo\\". We segue into \\"Pavane\\" which is highlighted by mandolin, string bass, harpsichord, cimbalon and kantele before the drums kick in at the end (the 1987 mix has new synthesizers added in by Woolfson) before this piece ends with \\"Fall\\" which is synthesizers and projectron by Parsons and orchestrations. The album ends with the sublime \\"To One in Paradise\\" sung by Terry Sylvester with harmonies by Woolfson and Parsons and narration by Leonard Whiting.<br />Tales of Mystery and Imagination peaked at #38 on the Billboard album charts and sold consistently over the years.<br />In 1987, the album was re-released on Mercury/PolyGram with a new mix by Parsons himself which saw him add some new guitars, keyboards and also narration from the late Orson Welles at the beginning of the two halves (\\"Dream Within a Dream\\" and at the intro of \\"The Fall of the House of Usher\\") plus a booklet with lyrics, credits and the original art done by Hipgnosis. Then in 2007, a 2-CD deluxe edition hit where it included the original 1976 mix REMASTERED and the 1987 REMIX with an updated remaster plus bonus tracks and a stellar booklet.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!d orchestrations.

I have enjoyed listening to this album.

B00866JL96|4.0|While no movie can capture all the nuances of the book, this does its author credit! The characters are very likeable, even the nemesis, at his end. The only problem was the suspense the book had as to who  was the survivor was omitted. Otherwise very good.

B000TGCR38|5.0|Over two and hours and fifteen minutes were well rewarded with this Dutch film, Black Book, starring the excellent Carice von Houten as WW2 refugee Rachel Stein who sets out to look for answerrs after her family are killed. Joining the Resistance, Stein secretly charms her way into the German Security Service in order to help her fellow citizens.<br />Black Book is a very good thriller set in September 1944 with not a single minute that was poor in this film.<br />A film definitely worth watching again, if only for the magnificent performance of Carice von Houten. The story is a very gripping tale of what Nazi-occupied Holland would have been like towards the end of the war.<br />The film is mainly in Dutch and some German and English is used. English subtitles are present for all non-English dialogue.<br /><br />A great find!!

B007L3BMGA|5.0|Oh wow!!  Definitely A-rated adult reading! Great story though and I'm looking forward to reading the sequel.  I really need to know the final outcome!
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I loved the first book, the Hunger Games.  In the third book, I was disappointed that the character never developed the depth that was promised in the first book.  She seemed like a puppet with no substance, and kept cheating death (nine lives Catniss?)which was tiresome after the what, the 3rd time?  Even the climax (the payback), which was supposed to be a shock, was rather predictable. The end just babbled on and on.  It was a \\"....and they lived happily ever after,\\" ending, but the reader isn't happy.  The author let us down with poor a poor attempt at resolving all the details. Readers of the saga will want to read it, if only to have closure.  After such an ending, you are definitely not wishing for another book.
B0093X805W|4.0|We read this aloud to our five year old. He loved it. And then we watched the old movie. Tons of fun.
B001EC0OPO|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  I bought this to replace a broken dvd.  If you like parody's of space movies buy this.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|I am involved in a start-up that is bringing a new technology to market...a business model that Ash rightly calls &#34;riddled with technical risk&#34;. I had heard of the Lean Startup concept and found Ash's book to be the answer to a great many of my problems.<br />The Lean Canvas method is simple, elegant, very pertinent and quickly identifies the risks your business will need to overcome in order to survive. It forces you to re-prioritise and strive for a &#34;Product/Market Fit&#34; that delivers a product relevant and desirable to your potential customers - one that they are willing to pay for before your business runs out of resources.<br />This year, there will be 400,000,000 business startups around the globe...and 90% of them will fail in the first five years because they did a Business Plan instead of a Lean Canvas. The traditional business plan suffers from the need to obsess about detail you usually don't have data for, without effectively identifying the vital factors that a business must succeed at to survive.<br />Don't become a business statistic, start Running Lean and become a survivor and a success.
B007XF0X16|4.0|The item arrived quickly and was actually a very decent sequel to the previous title,&#34;Clash of the Titans&#34;, visuals and CGI were very impressive and a total bargain for only $7

B000JMKO0A|5.0|Excellent story by Paulo Coelho- He pulls you right into the action. Amazon makes it extremely easy to purchase and download purchases.
B00ANW2ILY|5.0|On the day that this album was released, I booted up my laptop first thing in the morning, logged into amazon.com, and quickly bought and downloaded this album, and then added it onto my iPod right away. Now that I have listened to it from beginning to end, now is the time for this review to be done.<br /><br />I really have to say that Helloween just WILL NOT let up, just like with a lot of their peers. They just keep cranking out one masterpiece after another, as a result of the fact that they just love what they do, while not caring in the least what anyone else thinks. Right from start to finish, this entitre album fills the listener with tremendously uplifting energy and emotion. Such was definitely the case with me when I listened to it during my commute to work on a very cold New England winter morning, and right after a three-day weekend, no less. For that reason alone, I am very glad that I bought this album as early as I did.<br /><br />Getting more specific, every track is rich, pure, and filled with that uplifting high-level intensity that Helloween are known for, be it from Andi Deris' high-flying, powerful voice, or the fast and complex guitar solos, along with the prominent use of keyboards in some of the songs. I am not going to get track-by-track specific with this review, as I do not wish to spoil the listening experience for anyone looking to get this album. Besides, there are other reviewers who can take care of that just fine without my help.<br /><br />Also, I just want to throw this out there as well: I really have to say that Andi Deris, despite his differing vocal style as compared with Michael Kiske, really has MORE than held his own with Helloween, ever since his introduction in 1994 with the [[ASIN:B001F6LE0S Master Of The Rings]] album. He has been with the band for almost 20 years, and there is a reason for it. He really has contributed A LOT to the band, both vocally and lyrically, and for the better, and he further proves it with this album.<br /><br />Overall, this is an all-around awesome power metal album, and it may yet prove to be one of the best realeases of 2013 for metal as a whole. This amazing band just WILL NOT let up, and they never stop making great music. Right along with Stratovarius and Gamma Ray, Helloween are easily one of the best bands in the last 25 years, no questions asked. Anyone who does not think so has no business calling themselves a power metal fan, or even a rock fan in general for that matter. These guys deserve to be as followed as Iron Maiden, and I am sure a lot of power metal fans will agree.<br /><br />I can't wait until Stratovarius and Gamma Ray release THEIR new albums later this year, the former of which is due for realease next month. As a fan of those bands as well, I have the same expectations for them as I rightfully had for Helloween, concerning this release.<br /><br />Anyways, just stop reading this review and BUY THIS ALBUM!!! HAIL HELLOWEEN!!! HAIL POWER METAL!!! \m/\m/album.<br /><br />Overall, this is an all-around awesome power metal album, and it may yet prove to be one of the best realeases of 2013 for metal as a whole.

B00A8Z6KN8|5.0|Howard Shore masterfully weaves themes together to create an outstanding soundtrack for The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. Misty Mountains is the headline song and creeps in and out of many of the remaining tracks, swelling with grandiosity as the dwarves do heroic deeds. Shore returns to many of the themes written in the Lord of the Rings series as well. A careful listener will notice hobbit, eagle, fellowship, and evil themes returning. The new mixed with the familiar makes this album a must have for the Hobbit/Lord of the Rings fan.
B000FCKC4M|5.0|Another excellent book made available to the public in an extremely quick and efficient manner. Thank you for the story and service.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I absolutely loved it! Within minutes of reading the first few pages I found it extremely hard to put down. The characters and their struggles became so real to me. I was also introduced to a Slam Poetry (which I was not very familiar with) and The Avett Brothers.
B0098460O4|5.0|After viewing their videos from Britian's Got Talent recently, I immediately ordered their CD. These two young, talanted people have produced a beautiful collections of songs on their first album.  I wish them much success, they deserve it!
B006OAB3ME|5.0|I haven't ever been a big McCartney fan and haven't cared that much for his music, or for most of his music. But this album I find to be very relaxing, uplifting and calming. It's really nice and I'm listening to it a lot. Usually I feel he's too sweet and melancholy with a clever twist, but this is straightforward interpretation of these songs which I actually like a lot. The lyrics are simple and sincere, and he sings them very honestly. The accompaniment and arrangements are subtle and beautiful. When I'm listening I sometimes think about my grandmother, who was a pianist and loved these kinds of songs, and now I can see why. This is now a favorite.

B0058Z4NR8|1.0|The inconvenience of reading books on kindle is that we cannot throw the book out of the window, as this one, \\"Why Nations Fail\\", deserves. The general impression is that the authors bit more than they could possibly chew. They set up a narrow framework, the duality of inclusive and extractive political and economic institutions, and try to make everything fit into it, no matter how different they were: Soviet Union, Mayan Civilization, Roman Empire, Spanish colonization, Venice, and so on and so forth. Narrow-mindedly they take England and the Industrial Revolution as the paradigmatic successful story of inclusive economic and political institutions that lead to the development gap seen today between the developed and developing world; they left out a universe of important historical facts. Although anyone could agree that political institutions were and are important for setting in motion the development spiral (or its opposite), the authors do not make any effort to define the concepts of inclusive and extractive institutions, and leave to the reader the task to decide whether they are talking about democracy, social participation, liberal free market, capitalist accumulation, property rights, rule of law, good governance, or all of that and much more. I wonder how they got their PhD and job at Harvard with such carelessness.<br /><br />Creative destruction is a concept they borrow and keep using for convenience sakes of filling gaps in the arguments. It would be better to have a preliminary discussion of the concept before throwing it here and there when something needs additional explanation. This concept is in fact awkwardly hammered into the text in many diverse context including ones where technology is not really the issue. It would be good also to consider that \\"creative destruction\\" could take place in unprecedented scale from the Industrial Revolution onwards due to the particular characteristics of the technologies that were harnessed: the steam engine and later on electrical power. These technological breakthroughs opened gates to countless possibilities. Mankind had never gone through such a portal before. Certainly all the inventions that happened before were brilliant at their time and got their share of associated breakthrough innovations. But those past technologies, by their own nature, could not sustain such acceleration in innovative works, no matter if the political system was \\"inclusive\\" or \\"extractive\\" or whatever. Besides that, how can one believe in creative destruction when only the destruction part of it is visible?  Well, there are many mistakes in their interpretation of history; to talk about them would require many pages.<br /><br />To cut the story short, I would only say that at their own risk of getting a naïve and distorted picture, historians might ignore the Marxist analysis of the role colonialism and imperialism, in their crudest exploitative manifestations, played in sustaining and fostering the accumulation of capital and the development of capitalism. The dynamics of the nascent capitalism was and is far from inclusive; it privileges the owners of capital, no matter how democratic the system is. If capitalism set a virtuous cycle in certain parts of the world, that cycle was fed at large extent by the ongoing exploitation in others. The cheap labor in the Southern US produced cheap food to sustain the industrialization of the North. The exploitation of the colonies by colonial powers and the abuse of under-developed countries by economic interests of large corporations were not accidental or irrelevant facts at the periphery of the capitalist world; they were, and still are, intrinsic part of the accumulation mechanism set in motion. \\"Inclusive\\" institutions seem to need \\"exploitative\\" ones to sustain them; that was a conclusion the authors missed all together. They did not manage to make that comprehensive link and left the reader with a single and simple-minded picture of an idealworld that has never existed.world that has never existed.

B000HIVOI2|1.0|If you're currently looking at the Extended version from 2007, DO NOT purchase this piece of crap! Find the 15th Anniversary Edition. I say because these comment boards are exactly the same for both versions of the film. Something Amazon needs to fix!!!<br /><br />I love this movie and purchased this thinking it was the one everyone was raving about based on the comments below. Thankfully I was given a refund because this. But this piece of wasted blue-ray disc literally looks like you're watching a VHS version of the film. It's super grainy. I have this on DVD and the quality of that is better than this.

B0087JTAKW|4.0|&#34;The Time Keeper&#34; is an easy read. The author reflects that humans are not happy with their alloted time on earth whether it is long or short. I like how the corelation between time, destiny, and happiness is presented. If we would stop trying to control time and live each day as it unfolds with patience, observation, and objectivity we could be happier.
1401937268|5.0|I like the art work and find this a great new addition to my oracle cards collection.  Personally working with becoming more familar with the cards before I begin using with clients.  The challenge: the size of the deck and the number of cards (perhaps the awareness of bulk is more due to the heavy card stock)  These cards clearly need to be &#34;broken in&#34; as shuffling is cumbersome. That being said there are still thumbs up from this intuitive reader.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|Well done! Just what a good sci-fi should be! Great acting, great plot. I was able to escape into the movie

B00AMBLXP8|2.0|Not the funniest movie that everyone said it was. We honestly expected more from this. It was essentially Family Guy Live Action.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I would say this is ok for the price and the quality not too bad will let you know more later
B007FDE4Y8|2.0|I recommend buying a Glidecam (or a Flycam, Glidecam is much better) instead of this stabilizer. I bought this stabilizer thinking that stabilizes well as in the youtube videos. Once you buy it, and if I tried it stabilizes, but not like the youtube videos. It has a couple of problems in the construction of estabilzador. I tried everything possible to stabilize their best, but the result is compared with a Glidecam. The Glidecam is more expensive, but worth every dollar spent rest.<br />And if you resist and still want to buy the Opteka SteadyVid Pro, I recommend buying a Sliding Mounting Plate, you make it much easier to balance the stabilizer and the result will be much better.

B008IGP8QE|5.0|This was a Christmas present from Santa and my daughter loved it.  She listens and dances to it all the time.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It was amazing, it made you think, almost too much, but not... You know, it's like whenever your teacher gives you a hard assignment and you think so much, you begin to get a headache and you can really feel your brain working, and it feels good, but painful; a good hurt. And this book was like a riddle. I felt like there were so many things to get out of it. The name dropping was great, I'm glad he put titles and authors in there. I found myself getting the books he read and looking up the songs he listened to and it unlocked these great feelings. Charlie was right. Asleep by the Smiths is truly an amazing song. ;) The format was good, the story was heart breaking while being phenomenal and I honestly think this is one of the best books I've ever read. Although, maybe that's because it's the last book I've read. :-)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book!!  Looking forward to reading the next one in the series.  Was a little unsure of the story at first, but really enjoyed it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Best game!<br />I would say that it was made for people like me i have horses and I love playing this game
B008R14YBK|5.0|Another Christmas gift from Santa to my daughter.  She loves Bridgit Mendler and listens to this CD all the time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book! I loved how she expressed the feeling of being in the Hunger Games.I would read it again. Now, it's my favorite book!

B003G4W49C|1.0|&#34;I've watched through his eyes, I've listened through his ears, and I tell you he's the one. Or at least as close as we're going to get.&#34;<br /><br />  &#34;That's what you said about the brother.&#34;<br /><br />  &#34;The brother tested impossible. For other reasons. Nothing to do with his ability.&#34;<br /><br />  &#34;If his sister wasn't a girl. And there are doubts about him. He's too malleable. Too willing to submerge himself in someone else's will.&#34;<br /><br />  &#34;Not if the other person is his enemy.&#34;<br /><br />  &#34;So what do we do? Surround him with gays all the time?&#34;<br /><br />  &#34;If we have to.&#34;<br /><br />  &#34;I thought you said you liked this kid.&#34;<br /><br />  &#34;If the buggers get him, they'll make me look like his favourite uncle.&#34;<br /><br />  &#34;All right. We're saving the world, after all. Take him.&#34;<br /><br />Thanks to Ben Peek for showing that changing one word really does change the scene around, and in the process hilariously revealing what this homophobic author really has on his mind.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|It was a good movie and definitely worth seeing. I can't say that it was my favorite Bourne movie but I will probably buy it in Blu-Ray as I rented it this time.  I had trouble deciding if it was a 4 or 5 star as it was really good but not exactly mind blowing, got to have it.
014241493X|5.0|An awesome book that is hard to put down for ANY AGE. Has the life insights one expects from a John Green book, but also has a lot of humor. Great characters and a compelling story.
B002Z8IWMS|5.0|The title would lead you to believe that this book is only about presentations. But the information in this book is immensely valuable for any business owner. I have never highlighted as many passages in my Kindle as I have with this book.<br /><br />I have read tons of copywriting and marketing books and they all pale compared to the density of practical and usable knowledge featured in this book. If you are looking to improve your message, there is no better place to start than here.<br /><br />This book helped me to realize that everything we do in business is a presentation, and the same rules apply to all mediums. Whether it be writing a blog post, shooting a video, or talking to a client, the information in this book applies.<br /><br />I read this to prepare for an upcoming presentation and the structure and outlines in this book made it a breeze to put together. I knew I could skip over creating distracting, content heavy slides and keep it simple and clean. It looks great and saved me so much time.<br /><br />Plus, the information on the importance of using plain english is something I will take with me for the rest of my life. We are trained in school to use complex academic sounding sentences because we think it makes us look smarter. Wrong!<br /><br />Thanks Carmine Gallo, for making it so simple.
B0016BPWNM|2.0|The blu-ray transfer for this film is simply horrible. Story aside, save you money and get the dvd. The picture will have to be better than this. It's frustrating to expect the implied clarity of a bd disc and sit viewing a picture of un-sharp images.Ken
B006LSZECO|4.0|Suspenseful. Intrigue is sustained. Does not end  as a typical 'who dun it' would. A quick read. Some of the characteristics of individuals are consistently irritatinig, however, I assume that is part of the plot. The evilness that seeps inbetween the lines is well done!
B003MXEUYO|3.0|i paused the movie once and after that the movie would stall and then fast forward. the movie kept doing this throughout the movie
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I had to keep reading this story to find out what was going to happen next. There were twists and surprises that kept the story fresh There is also a subplot about whether the tendency to murder can be inherited. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to solve a crime.

B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I gave this four stars because I have already seen Seasons 1 and 2, and those will be difficult to beat. I would give Season 1 and 2 a 5 star rating. I have also seen the first three episodes of Season 3, and it looks like this is going to be a great episode.  Shirley McLaine made an appearance early on and I haven't seen her since, but she adds an interesting new twist to the series.  Mary Dockery plays Lady Mary and is a phenomenal actress.  All of the actors in this series are excellent and create a very believable and realistic story which draws you in from Season 1.  I'm hooked and I love this series.

0525423281|5.0|\\"It's easy to talk about things we hate, but sometimes it's hard to explain exactly why we like something.\\"<br /><br />Those are words straight out of Lola and the Boy Next Door. I loved Anna and the French Kiss, Stephanie Perkins debut book, and I didn't think it would be possible to love this book even more. But oh I did. Lola and the Boy Next Door is so utterly perfect and beautiful.<br /><br />Lola has a sense of style all of her own. Her ambition is to be a costume designer, and she treats everyday style choices as her own living art. She has a good life, being raised by her two Dads, a rockstar boyfriend, Max, and she's about to start high school as a Junior. That is until the boy next door returns to town. The boy next door who she had a huge crush on and who broke her heart.<br /><br />Lola is the furthest thing from me. She is eccentric in her style choices, where as I blend into the crowd more. This doesn't mean I didn't love her outrageous style, because I did. I loved every single description of her awesome clothing, and kept wishing I could pull something like that off! She and her best friend, Lindsay, who nicknames Lola \\"Ned\\" because Lindsay is a aspiring detective, are just awesome.<br /><br />And, Cricket... the boy next door. Yes I do believe I had my first fictional boy crush in a very long time! Oh cricket, you are so adorable and you don't know it!<br /><br />With cameo appearances from Anna and Etienne (from Anna and the French Kiss) this book was as perfect as you can get in the genre of contemporary YA fiction and I can't wait to read the next book Stephanie Perkins publishes. The third book is titled Isla and the Happily Ever After and I can't wait!

B007THA4FI|4.0|I am a great fan of JK Rowling's writing.  She tells a story and she can tell it well.<br /><br />With that said, it took me a very long time to get into this book.  I know at the beginning of every story, there's an introductory period where you're learning who the characters are and understanding their voice.... but there were just so many characters thrown at my face that by the time I finally came around to someone I met before....I could not for the life of me remember who they were or what I was supposed to already know about them.<br /><br />And the description!  She went on and on and on about the most mundane details that my eyes kind of glazed over at some points and I still don't know if I missed something important as I couldn't make myself go back and re-read the passage.<br /><br />Once I finally got into the book, it was so interesting to see how each character overlapped with a different character's story.  It's about a small town so of course everyone knows everybody else but I loved how they interacted with each other.<br /><br />Once I started to near the end, it got so intense I was expecting this huge elaborate climax....and boy did it fall flat.  The book just ended and I'm sure there's a message or learning experience we're supposed to get from this but I still haven't figured it out as I was so disappointed by the ending!<br /><br />I am soooo glad I waited until the price dropped for this book.  If I had bought it when it first came out and paid the full price, boy would I be pissed!  But I guess it was worth the $7-$8 bucks and maybe I'll read it again, but..... ehhh.....
B009K45Y62|5.0|Great movie and great collectors item. I bought it for my son for Christmas and he was very happy with it.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I just love these books! I literally can't get enough. I could have read this in two days if I didn't have Kids and a house to attend to.<br />  Amazing how the book(s)/story can keep you completely on edge the whole time. I have 1 left in this series and I don't want it to end. I don't recommend this book to anyone under 18..... BUT making a movie to follow it would be a great next move!!<br />  ;)  ;)

0547848412|3.0|Martel's book begins with the Author's Note, in which he gives us a definition of fiction posed as a question, \\"Isn't fiction the selective transforming of reality?\\" He then proceeds to spin his story as if it was not fiction. In the last sentence of his Note he tells us, \\"If we, citizens, do not support our artists, then we sacrifice our imagination on the altar of crude reality and we end up believing in nothing and having worthless dreams.\\"<br /><br />\\"Crude reality?\\" Isn't this the same as the \\"awful truth?\\" and aren't they both irrational beliefs, or the very least absurd oxymorons? Isn't a reality check what we all need? What Martel has succeeded in doing is leading his readers away from the truth.<br /><br />A young boy deciding to go along with all three monotheistic religions, is sure to be of interest to all those who already believe that God is their savior. Liking the book for this reason keeps us from seeing the flaws.<br /><br />What the author also shows clearly is the power-hierarchy mentality as expressed in the animal kingdom, and also as it relates to man's baser instincts--the tendency to act as unfeeling animals in times of personal crises.<br /><br />Using this as an example is misleading, as we are social animals having social instincts; for instance a shipwreck that entails large numbers more often than not brings out the best in men. In such situations, allowing women and children to go first is not just a chivalrous gesture; it represents survival of the species.<br /><br />The author also shows the emotional side of human behavior, as displayed by the young boy's attachment to the tiger. While Pi was not the \\"fittest\\" of the two physically, by using his reasoning mind he was able to curb his runaway negative emotions, and come up with reasonable solutions. In this case he acted far above his years, which, in itself, is a stretch of the imagination.<br /><br />In chapter 87, we are told that Pi had been in the habit of placing a \\"dream rag\\"over his face that encouraged \\"gentle asphyxiation\\" by restricting air take. This helped to pass the time away in a highly delightful way. It was upon his being reduced to the helplessness of blindness, and had given up all hope of being saved by either God or man, that he needed relief the most--it became an escape from reality. To him his hallucinations were actual experiences.<br /><br />The reactions of the Japanese investigators to Pi's tall tales, was a bit of humor thrown in. Not being able to hide their own incredulous reactions, they expressed their bewilderment in their own language.<br /><br />Pi knows his story is not being believed. In his young and impressionable mind being reasonable is \\"risking throwing out the universe with the bathwater.\\" He argues with the investigators, by saying, the world isn't just the way it is, but the way we see it, \\"doesn't that make life a story?\\"<br /><br />The thoroughly perplexed investigators laugh, \\"Ha! Ha! Ha! You are very intelligent, Mr. Patel.\\" And one says to the other, in Japanese, \\"What is he talking about? The other replies, \\"I have no idea.\\"<br /><br />They argue back and forth over the credibility of the animals, and then Pi tells them that \\"what they are wanting is a story without animals.\\" They reply \\"Yes,\\" with a sigh of relief, believing that now he understands that all they ever wanted was a credible story that would explain the sinking of the ship.<br /><br />He then goes on to give them an even more incredible story, without the animals, which perplexes them even more. He asks them which story was more credible, and they reply, \\"The story with the animals.\\"<br /><br />Pi replys, \\"Thank you. And so it goes with God,\\" and then begins to cry.<br /><br />They did not conclude that the boy was crazy, but wrote in their report, that as the cause of the sinking was impossible to determine from the available evidence, the insurance was to be paid, and no further action was required. End of story.<br /><br />But the story does not end there for most of us; the questions linger on. Should we believe what the author wants us to believe, that the boy is telling the truth \\" before God,\\" therefore he, the storyteller, is telling the truth? By following his line of thinking we have been both conned and bamboozled--if not by him, then by our own childish rationalizations that serve to verify the unverifiable--our most obvious method of madness being to deny the evidence.<br /><br />It is true that we live in an irrational world where truth is stranger than fiction, but it is also true that if we must believe in a higher power in order to save our sanity, then our only safe harbor is believing in the God of Truth--truth being the reality that comes from reasoning.<br /><br />As it stands now, it is our different interpretations of the idea of God, for and against and everything in between, that not only keep us apart, but also keep us at each other's throats--fighting for our \\"ethical and moral principles\\" like wild tigers, both figuratively and literally.<br /><br />Joan Morrone

B005LAIIJY|5.0|Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, \\"Django Unchained\\" is a mixture of history, moralizing, violence, and parody. The movie is lengthy, at nearly three hours, but moves quickly. The acting,scenery, costuming, and musical score each add a great deal to the film.<br /><br />The movie is set in Texas, Mississippi, and the west in 1858, two years before the Civil War. The overarching theme of the movie, the evil of slavery, is brought home from the opening scenes, in which two slave traders lead a coffle of bound slaves through the woods to be sold. The primary character Django Freeman (Jimmie Foxx) is a slave in the coffle rescued by a flamboyant German bounty hunter, Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), because of his ability to recognize a group of former overseers who are wanted by the law dead or alive. Django and Schultz become companions.  Django quickly becomes highly skilled with firearms.  He agrees to help Schultz with bounty hunting in exchange for Schultz'assistance in finding and freeing his wife, Broomhilda, (Kerry Washington).<br /><br />There are many humorous, violent, and colorful scenes before the pair arrive in Meridian, Missippi to learn that Broomhilda is at a large plantation called Candieland owned by Calvin Candie (Leonard DiCaprio), the mercurial arch-villian of the film. Candie is a patron of a vicious gladiatorial-like combat called mandingo in which slaves wrestle to the death. (There is no historical evidence that mandingo fighting took place in the Old South.) Schultz and Django develop an elaborate scheme to find and free Broomhilda under the ruse that Django is a free black slaveholder (there were some in the South) who seeks to buy a slave for mandingo fighting and to pay top dollar.<br /><br />As the story develops, Tarantino shows a great deal about the brutality of plantation life at Candieland, with characters including the Uncle-Tom slave Stephen (Samuel Jackson) and Candie's widowed sister Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwillie (Laura Cayouette) who displays a great degree of smoldering sexual frustration.  The tension builds gradually through the extended plantation scenes until the film explodes in a large cascade of violence and death and destruction, with the triumph of Django over the slaveholder tormentors.<br /><br />The movie is an eclectic melange of history and echoes of B-grade westerns. Each component of this film, from the depiction of slavery to the language, violence, and use of earlier films, can and has been subjected to extended discussion and reflection. I found that the movie worked well.  \\"Django Unchained\\" held my attention throughout and made me think about what I had seen long after it ended. Tarantino has imaginatively blended his sources together to create a riveting, entertaining movie with superb performances by Waltz, DiCaprio, and Jackson. I lost an initial skepticism about this movie.  The more I thought about it, the better I liked it.<br /><br />Robin FriedmanCayouette) who displays a great degree of smoldering sexual frustration.

It's pretty helpful in explaining what's happening (and the complexities of this wonderful little camera) but comes up rather short in providing recommendations or author preferences (if you own any of Thom Hogan's Nikon reference books you'll know what I'm talking about and what I was hoping to see).<br /><br />It's put together well and comprehensive and I'm glad to have it available for future reference as I dive deeper into this camera's abilities and idiosyncrasies - thank you Mr. White.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Everyone should read this book it is mega super awesome and cool read it and u won't be sorry BOOM
B0095J0AL6|5.0|Great music included photo on cover is glossy unlike the last album but overall a great addition to my music collection and the photos inside are brilliant
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is a fun game for kids. its interesting because the quest they're on. I like it a lot!! :)
0425252868|5.0|Muy satisfecho, estoy disfrutando mucho con la lectura de este libro. Sorprendente y cautivadora, demuestra que la realidad supera la ficción. Gracias al autor, Adam Makos (y Larry Alexander) por este estupendo libro.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book!!! Very Enjoyable! Highly recommended! Excellent! Will not disappoint you! I love reading and I loved thus book. A
B00AYDC5HY|1.0|Not a great movie myself and even the kids were completely bored with it absolutely a waste of money and time.
B004XUMPFQ|5.0|I don't think much needs to be said here, as the 4,000+ reviews really says all you need to know. However, this is probably one of the best television shows ever produced. There are only one or two other contemporary series that are even close to being in the same league. Simply put, this is a show about what it means to be human. The trials and the good times. The wins and the losses. This is the story about every persons life. This is a story about your life... Don't pass this up.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I know this is supposed to be a story for young adults, but this older adult really enjoyed it.  I especially liked how the author made each step a logical consequence of the previous steps, considering the initial premise.
B004M8AL6E|5.0|Lonesome Dove is an incredible novel by Larry McMurtry, and this mini series does a fantastic job of bringing the book to life.  It is a sweeping tale of the old west.  The case headed by Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones is outstanding.  This is one of my favorite movies and has been since it first aired on network television years ago.
B00846REIS|5.0|Coming off my high from Grey's, I was excited to get my hands on this book.  The writing was good and the plot was engaging and interesting.  I got a little bored with the sex because it was the same every time.  But it did the trick.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Well I love this nerdy show. I love that the girls try to get smart to under stand the boys who are super smart but act like 5 yr olds by liking super heros comic books etc.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My family simply loves this game. The graphics is better than what I expected it to be. This keeps my 3 year old occupied for a while also. Worth the download.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|I enjoyed this book thoroughly. Very fascinating and informative.  A fast read and our habits are in our control more than we know.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app it is fun i just got the new york special he is so awesome get it
B0011NVCSO|4.0|The album is a great one, but the vinyl suffers from a defect on the B-side... a low shushhhh at 33 1/3 on the first two tracks--I don't have enough audiophilic knowledge to know the nature of the defect, but it's definitely off. I did a little internet search and this is a known issue with this recording, but it wasn't known by me until it was delivered. I decided I could live with it, but some may not want to. Now that I've told you, you'll hear it every time. Sorry.<br /><br />My copy of the record also has two B-side labels (one on either side). This is obviously not a major issue, but there it is.  Which side has five songs and which has four? OK, that must be side &#34;A.&#34;<br /><br />I would not advise against purchasing the album, but the customer should be aware.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I enjoyed getting into the story deeper with Gideon and Eva. Ilook forward to the final book of the series.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This is a Fun game. It can be Frustrating at times but I love it. Try it. You will like it.
B0051BNRTO|1.0|Juliet, Naked is the most boring book I have ever read--and I have read a lot of books in my 73 years.  Maybe you just have to be British (I'm not) to appreciate Hornby's wry style. At one point Cat, the wife of the moment of former musician Tucker Crowe, says, \\"I think we've reached the end of the road.\\" (in their relationship)Tucker:  \\"I am sorry sweetheart. I think you are probably right.\\" Cat: \\"And that is all you have to say?\\" Tucker: \\"I think so.\\"<br /><br />The story centers around Annie, a middle-aged woman who has been in a dysfunctional  relationship with Duncan, a university teacher who has an obsessive attitude toward the music of Tucker Crowe, who was popular in the late seventies largely on the basis of one album, \\"Juliet.\\"  They live in an obscure town called \\"Gooleness\\" somewhere in the north of Britain (There actually is a town called \\"Goole,\\" but Tucker Crowe is a fictional character. Now some years later another album, called \\"Juliet, Naked\\" appears consisting of demo songs from the original appears, setting off a chain reaction among the characters.  None of the characters are remotely interesting, least of all Tucker who is the stereotypical screwed up musician.  Read it only if you have no other reading material at hand as I had.
B009PJ1S5S|1.0|Why is this movie so completely overpriced? $35 for a bluRay? Really?!?!  That's about $10-$15 more than nearly all other new blurays.  I really wanted to get this, but I can't seem to justify paying that much for a movie.  Too bad.  lower the price under $30 and I might think about it.....lower it under $25 and I definitely will!
B008C20TDG|5.0|I haven't even fininshed reading the book yet and by just putting into practice what I've learned so far, and with moderate exercise,  I was able to lose the weight I put on over the holidays in one week. They make the science behind the nutrition easy to understand. Once you understand the reason why there are certain food we shouldn't eat it makes it easier to want to stop eating them. I was on Weight Watchers for over a year and could not lose any weight and had constant cravings. This book explains why there are constant cravings for the foods you know aren't healthy but still can't stop eating. When you start eatiing only real, whole foods, most of the cravings disappear.  I highly recommend this book!
B00005N6KG|5.0|Great sound for your money !!!  I love these Sony Ultra Lightweight MDR-W08L Vertical In-The-Ear Headphones  ..... the sound is impeccable !!!!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie was AWESOME! You should definitely watch it, I spent the rental fee twice just because I liked it that much.
B009K0P10K|4.0|Engaging drama, like (or despise) the characters and the story lines. Overall, a good way to spend an hour of tv that I don't feel overly guilty about.
B00000J0O2|1.0|I have this printer for 15 years and never had problem with the cartridge before.I could not find it in the store so I bought on amazon.com from this seller.<br />This cartridge suppose to be new. First few pages was very pale after that was nothing. Useless.WASTE OF MONEY.
B008DKBQMK|3.0|I ordered this cover for my wife's Kindle.  Very pretty protective cover and well made.  When we opened up the cover and then realized that we had to take the Kindle out of the protective cover in order to use it, we decided to send it back and get a protective cover that would hold the Kindle while we used it.  No issue with the protective cover if you don't mind extracting the Kindle before using it.
B0015DROBO|5.0|The book was great but it was terribly disturbing. I was surprised by the ending. Adding more words to finish...
B009738XXM|3.0|I like it. Give me more relax when coming home from work. The sound is clear and nice. It OK to me.
B001B6NAGS|3.0|I love the movie, however, the copy sent to me left a little to be desired. I had a copy before this one which was dammages. That first copy provided a two sided version providing wide screen as well as regular tv screen. My tv has the wide screen view which I use whenever I can, the copy that I just received only has the regular screen version, good picture but not wide screen.
B0081BU42O|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It is well written with a good story and likable characters. It was a good read.
B0063IH60K|5.0|RECEIVED A KINDLE FOR CHRISTMAS AND AM DELIGHTED I CAN PLAY THIS GAME ANYWHERE OTHER THEN THE COMPUTER/CHAIR.  JUST HAD BOTH KNEES REPLACED AND SURE HELPS TO PASS SOME TIME.
B005HI4LLY|5.0|Our son insisted that we watch this movie, which we did with great reservation.  My husband and I were both very pleasantly surprised.  I would recommend Tucker & Dale to anyone.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Game is better than all the rest. AND I have bought and gotten many of them. I am beating the clock. Game helps with concentration and thinking processing.
B000VHMF0A|3.0|I like it. Give me more relax when coming home from work. The sound is clear and nice. It OK to me.
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|We already had this movie in DVD, but my father was really wanting it in Blu-Ray. I bought it for him for Christmas, and it's amazing the difference from the DVD! There isn't that much difference visually (although, it is quite noticeable), but the sound quality is TONS better!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book shook me to the core. Our grandson had a knife pulled on him at school this year; which scared us to death! This book stayed with me for days. So well written and the characters seemed so real. Your heart just breaks for the families.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|Lots of other reasons to own a Vita, but this game is simply incredible.  I have nibbled in the JRPG genre over the years, and more frequently recently.  I did not play the original game on the PS2, so I had no idea what I was getting into.<br /><br />I love a good story in a game, and this is maybe the best ever.  Right up there with the zero escape games.<br /><br />And the graphics are just ridiculous.<br /><br />It's fun, funny, engrossing, beautiful.  All of the reviews out there touting this as game of the year material are accurate.
B009K0P10K|3.0|The first season of Revenge was better but the second was pretty good.  A bit &#34;over the top&#34; at times.
B0086700CM|4.0|I ordered this because I thought the grandsons would enjoy playing it.  Since I loaded it, they have been enjoying it!
0061992860|4.0|Im in no way a survivalist, but do like to be prepared. The info in this book is quick and to the point. The book itself is tiny and I was a little disapointed when I got it. After thumbing through it and puting it in my go bag though, I really appreciate the small design. Fits perfect in a little side pocket.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This ia the best read I have had in memory. No wonder it has had the sales it has enjoyed. I find myself smiling and enjoying a great story with the best character  development and diversity I can recall. Wow!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I have read all of John Grisham's books and while this one was good it was not his best! I would recommend it.
B00006IX0R|5.0|I have always liked the Cranberry's and this does in no way leave me wanting. Deloris's voice and the rest (sorry on not knowing by heart the full bands names) always keep me in tune. They always have put me in the moods of there songs. No idea how this sounds but they are playing now so my mind is in the land of the Leprechaun now.
0316017922|5.0|More people should read this book.  Instead of glorifying &#34;get rich quick&#34;, more people should realize that success the the result of not only circumstance but of old fashion HARD WORK.
1451627297|5.0|I have read many of King's books and this is the best one yet, keep in mind I've yet to read The Stand but I'm starting that one soon. I just finished 11/22/63 and though it's a hefty book it's really a fast read because of the story, writing style, and characters. You can't help but be sucked in to their world and wish you were part of it, I don't care if you're a Stephen King fan or not this is a must read for anyone who's a fan of good books. This book is brilliantly written and the characters are so vivid and real I half way expect to meet them some day, it's that good so do yourself a favor and get it and start your journey back to 1958.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|My bookclub is reading this book and it is awesome.  I am going to suggest it for my 14 year old daughter also.  Characters feel real, especially the main teenage characters.
B009G78EE2|5.0|This is such a fun and awesome album! It's a really fun listen and definitely worth every penny. Give it a shot and see for yourself!
B000068TPN|5.0|I really liked this movie. I didn't nitpick the scenery or take fault with MEL GIBSON personally or any of the other issues some reviewers deemed important. I applaud MEL GIBSON and any and all who brought this movie to screen.<br />This movie depicts a battle in 1965 (the VALLEY OF DEATH) where \\"the rubber meets the road\\" in the evolution of the war in VIETNAM (the first big time encounter for American military with the NORTH VIETNAMESE.) A BRUTAL beginning To a PROTRACTED BRUTAL WAR incorporating the effects of war on wives/families and combatants on both sides (which I found entirely appropriate and touching). Illuminating the HORROR, the military BLUNDERS, the BROTHERHOOD/CAMARADERIE, the COURAGE/DEVOTION, and the LOSS of COMBAT/WAR.<br />This movie is not so much about what you see. It is about the VISCERAL (like I said earlier--the essence). Not what you see (as bad as it is), but what you are left to FEEL.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|The sharpener works well with my smaller pocket knives but with a larger hunting style knife I just didn't seem to be able to be able to get a good tip. I would recommend this to anyone that needs to sharpen knives and does not want to spend a small fortune taking it somewhere to be done.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|It really think this game is cool...lots of mysteries and puzzles i would recommend this game to puzzle lovers. Love it...
0060512806|2.0|I don't remember why I put this book on my Amazon want list, perhaps because reviews I read said it jumped back and forth between World War II and the 1990's and I thought that meant it was a time travel story. I love time travel stories.  It's not.  The plot jumps back and forth, but the people don't.<br /><br />My daughter gave it to me for Christmas.  I don't think I would have finished it except that tossing it would have disappointed her.  Its length is its most prominent trait as well as its biggest fault.  How long it is was always on my mind.  The paperback edition of this book is 1,152 pages long.  Not counting an appendix or a sample from a later book, the story itself is 1,130.  People criticized Herman Melville for making Moby Dick too long and the first American edition of that was only 635 pages.  Cryptonomicon really can't be broken in two, but the ending leaves enough loose threads that there could be a sequel; one I certainly wouldn't read.<br /><br />Coming to a high-tech novel fourteen years after it was first published is a little strange because it means some of the tech is out of date.  And I know the book is more or less about cryptography, but come on.  You can make up a code using a solitaire deck as a key, but I don't need anywhere near as much detail as the book provides.  I don't need so much detail on the operation of a water-cooled World War II vintage Vickers machine gun either.<br /><br />Despite its interminable length, I found some of the characters poorly developed.  I wondered why a few of them were in there at all.  And throughout the book I found its length daunting.  As I read through it, I devoted more time to thinking of what I would cut from it than paying attention to its multiple plots.  So much so, that if I had this book as a word processing file, I'm sure I would have edited it as I went along.  If I did, I'm confident it would be less than half as long as it is and I think ruthless editing would make Cryptonomicon a much better story.<br /><br />If Cryptonomicon was half as long, I might have given it twice as many stars.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Keeps me entertained for a few minutes...but don't try to play if you're going to have to move away from it for even a couple seconds, or else you're going to get hit by a bus.  True story.
B00992CF6W|5.0|you can mod minecraft using pocketinveditor(on amazon store)and change skin and texture using pocket tool (not on amazon store but on google play)
B000093FLA|5.0|ANOTHER ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS WILD RIDE FROM GUY RICHIE. AND SO MUCH FUN!! All the actors are really GREAT--ALL OF THEM. BUT SPECIAL KUDOS to BRAD PITT and BENICIO DEL TORO (MAJOR stand out performances).<br />A diamond heist spins out of control and a web of gangsters, wanna' bes, losers and nuts stumble and fumble (very ruthlessly, at times, of course)) to get that massive GEM. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|One of the best space movies ever made. Great actors, great story line.  Very good for the price of it.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Though it had some slow moments, this book made me laugh more often than not.  It's a page turner for its comedic value.
B004ZA9HB4|4.0|This app works really the only problem is when you try to run Youtube HD, it needs to buffer depending on the quality.  However if you put HD videos from Youtube on your Kindle Fire and stream it, it works great.  If they could improve the streaming capability from Youtube HD or add the ability to load the whole video before it plays then I would give it five stars.  Otherwise, it is a great app.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|Definitely a challenge at times, especially if you're a three star getting perfectionist like myself. Not AS adorable as Cut the Rope, but not much is going to beat the epic cuteness of Om Nom. Overall, good game, and ZeptoLab's devs have completely blown my mind with their phenomenal programming and app-writing skills.  I ended up purchasing this game after I played it for three seconds...I will NOT bat an eye at buying any apps from these guys.  They put out great stuff!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Overall this is a good game! It operates just fine on my Kindle Fire HD, and operates just fine on my son's Kindle Fire. The only glitch i have experienced is the inability to add neighbors, hopefully this will be resolved in the next update which i hope is soon since we are now near the end of January and it's still Christmas on the Oregon Trail.
B00A23MYCC|5.0|Ok, if you are easily offended and generally don't appreciate Seth McFarlane's previous works like Family Guy etc then you will not enjoy this movie.  My wife and I however found it to be an excellent, laugh out loud comedy.  Apparently we really enjoy low brow humor.<br /><br />Definitely not something I would share with children as it is very R (or Unrated as the case may be) but if you are between 20-40 you will likely be right in the target audience.  Probably 30-40 to get the references to some of the 80's culture. :)<br /><br />We started out with a rental and decided that this was definitely worth adding to the collection.  On a side note, this version came with redemption codes for both UltraViolet and iTunes... but in the selection process on the site you could opt for an Amazon streaming voucher.  Very nice indeed.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Sad, angry,desperate people bent on hurting or besting each other.  The F word spills over almost every page.  A great disappointment after having enjoyed all the Harry Potter books, loving J.K's imagination.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Season Two was equally as awesome and intense as Season One! It did not disappoint in the least. This series has deserved every award they have received
1401940676|5.0|This is an excellent, well written, well thought out piece. I am grateful that Anita chose to share her story and experience with us. There are so many wonderful lessons to learn from this, with emphasis on the old adage &#34;to thine own self, be true&#34;. The early to mid chapters were a bit sad, so I only listened to those once to gain context; but the later chapters that deeply addressed the take aways were amazing, and I have listened to them repeatedly. It's eye (and mind) opening.<br /><br />I would certainly recommend it.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|Definitely a challenge at times, especially if you're a three star getting perfectionist like myself.  Not AS adorable as Cut the Rope, but not much is going to beat the epic cuteness of Om Nom.  Overall, good game, and ZeptoLab's devs have completely blown my mind with their phenomenal programming and app-writing skills.
B0086700CM|1.0|This game didn't give you a chance to get a feel for it.  Thank goodness it was free and I deleted quickly.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Enchanting, the visuals bleed from the pages and burn brightly in the reader's mind. A tale that has earned a place among those I hold dearest.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Books Three and Four had me literally skipping pages, due to all of the secondary and tertiary characters I just did not care about.  Why he chose to abandon Brandon and Brienne and focus on these characters kind of upset me.<br /><br />But Book Five brings it.  Brings it back to what's important to the fans.  At least this fan.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great game!  Virtual City is my favorite!  This ia a great second!  Love the quests!  I'm happy that I don't have to have neighbors so far!  I love playing G5 Games!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|. i feel very relaxed right now and i only<br /><br />just tried it for the first time for only several minutes
B008673ZAQ|4.0|This series was just ok... I will read the third book but its nothing like 50 Shades. I didn't understand the immediate love between Gideon and Eva. The books would have been much better if the connection between the two was more realistic.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|Kate Morton is a marvelous storyteller.  The bit of dedication required to shift between present day Grace and the the Grace in service at Riverton is skillfully done.  The story unfolds like a flower and secrets long hidden are revealed in the lat pages.  I look forward to reading more Kate Morton stories.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|Dear,readers<br /><br />This book is a very EPIC book.It's my first favorite one.TO VEWERS OUT THERE U SHOULD GET THIS BOOK EMPLOYMENT
B0012PDVQ2|2.0|I have seen the original a couple of times and thought the final cut would improve on the original....wrong.<br />To me the most important scene was when Harrison Fords tries to come to terms with the last moment and death of the replicant Roy. Also , cutting the last scene with Rachel in a &#34;greener&#34; world was a disappointment . It was at least a 4 star in the original. Will not watch this &#34;Final Cut&#34; again.
B003EYVXXW|5.0|After visiting Greece and parts of that country depicted in this movie, I am especially touched by how aptly ancient times are portrayed:  the people, places, and attitudes of that time.  This movie was not a smash box-office hit, and I'm not sure why.  I think the acting and the historical plot (based on real characters) is great.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I freakin' love this movie! I saw it for the first time about 2 weeks ago and have already watched it 4 times! Excellent musical arrangements, funny dialogue and physical comedy, great acting, what more can you ask for? Okay maybe a little less puke, but that's my only complaint! I love all the characters! It's too bad that most of Benji's scenes were cut out. I kinda feel bad for the guy.<br /><br />One night I was finishing watching this and my husband saw the last 25 minutes or so. When it ended he seemed disappointed that it was over and asked if we could watch it from the beginning. Of course I obliged and he liked it too! I think part of it was because he recognized that actor from workaholics who is really funny.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I read the New York Times Book Review on the weekends and this novel's review caught my interest. I downloaded the book to my Kindle and boy was I glad.  It is a real love story.  It doesn't have a storybook ending.  Read it.  You'll be glad you did.
B0011EU0NG|4.0|Good price, delivered quickly, DVD case is a bit flimsy, but other than that. An overall food purchase! Thanks very much
B00000DG1R|5.0|THE CD arrived on time and undamaged. Loved the price. I could listen to this CD every weekend. So much fun :)
B0063GORYU|5.0|This version of the poIpular solitaire game is better than the Windows version, having customizable features Windows does not--especially being able to simply tap a card and it moves to the correct position, no need to drag and drop.  It also has more dealing and undo options.  Bad enough i waste my time on my desktop with this, now i can waste it anywhere!
0316228532|3.0|I love JK Rowling's writing and she does an excellent job in this book.  However, while I knew better than to expect Harry Potter repeats and/or similarities, I did not particularly like the characters in this book, nor did I especially care about what happened to them.  I missed the wry humor, the creativity, and how easily it was to be drawn into Harry Potter's magical world.  I will continue to read anything written by Rowling because I admire and respect her work . . . .just a bit disappointed in this one
B00AQMSJI2|4.0|great game. no big bugs. a little difficult to gain coins though. the brush clearing takes a while too but just be patient. it works in real time.
B00632HWOG|4.0|I like being able to read my e-mail from the Kindle Fire.  I also like sending messages to friends and families which I can now do but only because my daughter figured it out for me!  At first I could receive messages but was unable to send them.  With her help I now can do both.
B000AY74OG|5.0|fast shipping and good packing would order from them again movie was very clear and with good volume.love it keep up the good work
B001GM28HO|5.0|I was super happy with the product..great price! product came on time and not damaged. Love every song on this CD
B003O86FMW|4.0|Once again I'm amazed by the simplicity of the story to bring the reader into the fold.  I was not convinced that I would enjoy this series but I truly do. The cliffhanger at the end is a great way to pull the reader into the third book...which I will read with interest.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|The previews for this movie looked fun and funny; seeing this movie in full-length was an even broader experience.  This is one of those movies like &#34;Finding Nemo&#34; or &#34;Toy Story&#34; that will be timeless because of the content, the humor, and the wise message inherent in the storyline.  I loved it . . . and so did my 29-year-old daughter and my four-year-old grandson.
B009CPES4I|1.0|Ordered on my TIVO but could not view movie but was still charged. Not sure why I was charged since I could not open.
B0090XLDKY|5.0|Great buy! The movie arrived in no time and it also had a very nice picture. I looked for the movie for a while and i found it on here for a very reasonable price!
B0042U94UQ|5.0|fast shipping and good packing would order from them again movie was very clear and .love it keep up the good work
0375842209|5.0|Son needed this book for school. Arrived on time and not damaged. I loved the price..cheaper than anything I could find locally.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I have heard Adele's singles for some time but owning the compilation is worth every penny. A wonderful addition to my collection...music for every mood.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|The latest of multiple books featuring Pendergast, and the final of the most recent trilogy, Two Graves is an imaginative wild ride!  No spoilers here, but readers will be panting for more... I am.
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|This was the first real novel that I ever read - sometime during third grade. It was infinitely better than the boxcar children and the hardy boys. Part of my review might just be nostalgia, but I think this book deserves 4 stars just for the fun characters, and the glimpse into another era. Entertaining, educational, thought provoking. Everything a classic should be.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Pros:<br /><br />- Great variety! 3 minutes of strength is broken up into 2 different movements, so it's not 3 straight minutes of static lunges with bicep curls (for example). Same with cardio...jumping jacks, then jump rope, jumping jacks, jump rope.<br />- 3 levels based on intensity<br />- Each level includes modifications until you've worked up enough strength to do the full movement<br />- No excuse not to do it when each workout is only 30 minutes, including warm up and cool down<br />- Having a trainer tell you what to do and how to do it every time makes it easy to commit to a workout<br />- You can feel a difference in your endurance and strength each time you work out. You know when you're ready for the next level, so there's no guessing &#34;is this working?&#34;<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Each level is a routine--that is, level one is the same every time you do it. So if you're a beginner like me, you'll be insanely sore for the first 3 days and there is no break for those muscles--you do the same routine every day, even if your pecs and quads are killing you.<br /><br />DVD menu: You can't skip past the intro to get to the main menu and start the exercise. Turn on the DVD player a few minutes before you're ready to work out so you don't have to sit and watch the same intro every time.<br /><br />Audio: I wish there was an option for just Jillian's voice instruction without music, but instead, you can choose to hear the music without her instruction. You get tired of the same music every time. I'll blast some club music in the background, but I still need to keep the DVD volume loud enough to know when to switch moves (you're not always staring at the TV) and the DVD music interferes with what I want to listen to.
B0061QD7ZM|5.0|Great price for this product and it works wonderfully.  Another classic for the family, it is an old film and my 3yr old loves it.
1400052181|5.0|The book arrived on time and in great shape. My son needed the book for school class..loved the cheaper price.
160774273X|4.0|I haven't read it yet but it looks like it's going to be great. I would have given it 5 stars but it arrived from here in poor condition and took forever to get here! Its dust cover was all torn up and it looks awful! I only hope that it will make up for it in content.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|easy to use but all not as good as I expected graphics are nice and more realistic than most other similar games
B0012GTZC0|2.0|I got this book for free somehow. I was looking for a thriller, and settled on this one. I guess it could technically be a thriller, and it was a pretty good read, but it felt like it could have been a lot shorter for the amount of actual plot it had. Plus, a number of the character relationships were rather irritating.
B0094WK9EC|1.0|Cannot believe how bad they are. Heard it on y-100 last night(eye hate y100 but my wife here's that crap in her car). Really good dance music (ie Simply Jeff, Rennie Pilgrem, etc, not the Swedish Whackarse Wanne Bees) has a part of the song that climaxes or \\"blows da hell up\\" Here you have a generic \\"housy\\" buildup and then, nothing garbage, just like not climaxing during intimacy. People must be smoking drugs with low iq's to boot. These losers are actually gonna b @ Ultrafest. Wouldn't pay a red cent! I was at the first Ultra when it wasn't mainstream. Rabbit In The Moon, now there's an electronic act that was worth da price of admission
0788859544|5.0|Exciting and fun for the family to watch. I liked it when i was a kid and now my kid loves it. perfect condition. Great Classic. everyone should have a copy of this movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Finished the book in a day. I couldn't put the book down and been telling all my friends to read it.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This movie not only takes off from where the Firefly series was prematurely ended by FOX, but it shows the audience what certain things were actually about and how the series probably would have eventually ended.  Excellent story line, acting, music score, and ending.  If you have any liking whatsoever for any of the episodes in the short-lived Firefly series, then you will absolutely love this movie with its full action and excellent characters!!  If they had used this movie music score instead of the horrible music score in the series, I really think the series would have survived.  Oh well, this DVD is highly recommended for your collection!!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I love this show, it's a guilty pleasure of mine. If you like fantasy or fairy tales, watch this show - it's got really cheesy parts, but the characters are great and it's a really fun show.
B003008RWA|5.0|Showed it to my social problems class.  Thought it was great.  We had discussions about the myths that we are told about the negative aspects of free universal healthcare.  Very poignant and relative stories highlighted.
B006VGGAC4|4.0|Although he had a co-writer, in many of the sections, it reads just as Arnold speaks, which I found amusing and endearing.  The stories of his childhood were especially interesting, and then as he enters politics, he describes the many important people he met.  There are parts about movie making, about his family life, heart surgery, body building competetions and more.  Certainly the book continued to hold my interest although it was probably longer than it needed to be. Although his personal ethics (many extra-marital affairs and fathering a child with the family housekeeper) are not admirable, I have to admire Arnold for his single-mindedness in reaching his many goals. He has accomplished so much in his life, much more than many of us could ever dream of.  So I liked the book and recommend it!
B005LAII80|5.0|The movie captures the dark dystopian future of the Dredd universe, and the premise presented in this story played fantastic with the audio-visual effects. Many of the effects brought very Blade Runner-esque feelings our world and other worldliness. Keith Urban's portrayal fit perfectly with the graphic novel. There are moments where it seems like the movie and the comic could have been one and the same.
B009VB97EY|2.0|i expect alot more. The story line was crappy but i really want to see more of channing tatum .
B005LAIHY0|5.0|A lot of action and suspense which tells you how and why the other &#34;Alien&#34; movies came about and evolved. Good for your collection!!
B007D2XSW0|3.0|It's a good product, I just honestly never use it. It's on my Kindle Fire, and I never edit pictures on there now that I have a good camera on my phone.
0385333846|5.0|I just finished SH5 for our University of Chicago Indianapolis Alumni Book Club.  I read it in college, but had forgotten much of the book and, unfortunately, better remembered the badly scripted 1975 movie.  Most of our club members had read the book in college.  We thoroughly enjoyed the trip back to the late 60's, especially since we are all graduates of Vonnegut's Alma Mater and residents of his home town.<br /><br />It is an anti-war book, which describes the Allied fire bombings of Dresden.  Vonnegut relates that 135,000 were killed in the bombing, but more recent scholarship has shown that the actual death toll was 25,000 to 45,000 people killed. \\"All of this happened, more or less...\\" is the opening line of the book.  The narrator tells us that he is Vonnegut and he was there in Dresden as a POW during the bombing.  Several items of Vonnegut's personal history and war experiences are related int the book.  And he makes it clear that his war experience taught him this lesson about war:  Stop doing it!<br /><br />The protagonist is not the narrator.  Billy Pilgrim is a weak, clownish, anti-hero, who is either insane or a time-traveler who resides (in a way) on another planet.  Members or our club responded to Billy quite differently.  Some found him to be a pathetic imbecile, and others a winsome anti-war prophet and philosopher.<br /><br />The style and substance of the book is mostly light, wry, and satirical with several pearls of wisdom.  Vonnegut is a post-modern in his meta-commenting on the book within the book.  His commentary on American society, politics, and religion are deeply insightful and funny.  He anticipates sociopolitical issues well in advance of their currency.  E.g., this 1969 book references gun control, which was not in the headlines back then, as it is now.<br /><br />The most interesting (to our book club and me) philosophical issue Vonnegut takes on is Time (not the magazine).  Time works for the Trafalmadorians and Billy like memory.  The mind can move forward and backward and land on any moment for a time.  Of course, our memories do not let us move into the future.  But, if existence/life is a never-ending looping circle, then there is no beginning or end.  One could experience any moment within the loop through memory as past and future would just be constructs of convenience.  Billy Pilgrim learns from the Trafalmadorians how to become a \\"timeless being\\" and to transcend death through the ability to continue experiencing his life again and again.<br /><br />Vonnegut, through Billy and the Trafalmadorians, seems to be a fatalist.  That is, it seems to us that we have free will, but we really don't.  The most powerful presentation of fatalism is the coming end of Trafalmadore and the acceptance by the Trafalmadorians that, though they know how it will happen, they will do nothing to change it.  Because, as time is an eternal loop that does not change, the \\"future\\" will not be changed.<br /><br />Vonnegut's narrative style is quirky and loopy and endearing.  However, the repetition of \\"So it goes\\" began to feel like finger nails on a chalk board to me.  That is my one criticism.  Although, I understand that he had a point to make, which is his own fatalism about death.  [[ASIN:B007TAF1JY MONSTERS OF THE MIDWAY The Death, Resurrection, and Redemption of Chicago Football]].

B000N2HBSO|4.0|I have enjoyed every book that I have bought and read regarding Lincoln. I also saw the movie and became interested in reading the book in which it was based.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I'm totally beyond the age group of Katniss but I surely can't put the book down. I can't help but awe at the genius and imagination of Suzanne Collins to come up with this incredible story.
B008HK3XOU|3.0|I ordered this case about two weeks ago for the Kindle Fire HD I received for Christmas.  While it's a good case, there are several factors that keep it from being a truly great case.<br /><br />1.  I know that this is a minor issue and that I took my chances ordering from the internet, but I dislike the red color I ordered.  The colors were not represented well at all in the photos on Amazon, and ranged from an almost pink-like color to a deep burgundy red.  While I had hoped for a deep rich red, the case I received is BRIGHT red.  It's hard to describe just how bright this case is.  The one plus is I'll never overlook it.<br />2.  As others have stated, you need to load your Kindle incorrectly in order to charge it while in its case.  Since I loaded it incorrectly and have mainly read books on it since receiving it, I can't yet verify how frustrating this might be.<br />3.  The quality of this case is just not great.  My husband has had the Eco-Vue case for his regular Kindle Fire for almost 14 months now and it's nearly as nice as the day he bought it, even with daily extended use.  I've had this case for two weeks and already the fake leather is starting to separate from the hard backing.  It's not really noticeable visually, but when you pick up the case you can feel the separation.  I'm not sure how well this case will hold up for a year of use.<br />4.  The smell.  Usually extreme synthetic smells don't bother me much.  They usually dissipate after a day or two.  I even love the smell of gasoline.  However, the smell of this case when I unwrapped it was overwhelming, and it took a full week for it to dissipate enough that I could hold the Kindle less than 2 feet from my face.<br /><br />All in all, this case isn't bad.  It does the job it's supposed to and it's more affordable than other options.  However, there are issues with this case that prohibit me from rating it better than average.
B004K4IZ54|5.0|Great movie not just for kids.  There's a lot of lines made by the actors that I think went right over the heads of most kids for them to understand....more for adults than kids IMO.  I love the movie and glad I have it in my collection, and of course, Olivia Wilde did an excellent job in her role, not just because of her incredible looks, but you'll fall in love with her character (where she comes from and where she's going).  Highly recommended for your collection!
B005KR6NJU|5.0|This is one of the best things to come along in the Star Wars universe in a long time. The animation style is beautiful, the characters are well developed, and the action is great. Includes some of your favorite characters, and new ones too. I'd recommend this series to any Star Wars lover (unless you love JarJar Binks, and then you don't count.)
B007BVT5N4|5.0|Justin Bieber is the best, as a belieber I love hearing his voice through the Tory and getting to know how he felt during these special moments in his life, he is a true legend; better get to know him now because he isn't going anywhere anytime soon!
0446547603|5.0|Reading the book now, it came to me fast and in great condition. I would order again from this company.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is now my favorite book. That may be because of my love of the coming-of-age genre, but even if you don't like coming-of-age stories, this is still a fantastic read. I have read it twice now and am probably going to read it again.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|this is a good book also Clary and crew get into so much . Kept my interest to go on to the next 3 books cant wait for book 6 to see how it is all wrapped up in the end
B009MO57H6|3.0|This was just an ok movie as Milla is a great actress in this, but you can tell that this is probably her last one in the series.  The amount of action is considerably less than her other ones and the feeble attempt at bringing back her previous cohorts as enemies turned out to be lame in MY book.....they were stretching for ideas here and I think they failed.....Milla probably wants to be done with this series.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This is a great move with a lot of special features. If you love superhero movies and you haven't seen this one, I don't know what rock you've been living under, but you need to buy this. It's one of the best comic book/superhero movies I've seen in a long time. Joss Whedon sure knows how to make movies! I saw it five times in theaters and love it.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Franz Stigler's story is incredible.  Mark Twain's quote, “Truth is stranger than fiction, but it is because Fiction is obliged to stick to possibilities; Truth isn't,”  easily applies here.  Adam Makos has done a wonderful job of preserving Stigler's memories in print.  Reading about WWII from a Luftwaffe Ace's point of view was eye opening.  Fantastic book.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Acting and writing is fantastic.  Makes you feel as if you are living it out.  The set's are beautiful and the English country side reminds me of my time there.
B00005JLEU|5.0|My son and I discussed how the story could relate to a real life situation as people are greedy and some take without asking or thinking of the consequences.  Very touching . We recommend it to everyone, after all I am 49 years old. :)
B001NLL93W|4.0|this is a good book also Clary and crew get into so much . Kept my interest to go on to the next 2 books cant wait for book 6 to see how it is all wrapped up in the end
B004EPYZSK|5.0|All the actors here deserve an award. At first I thought, cowboys with aliens, how hokey is this gonna be?  Not at all, great story line with great acting and a great ending!  This is well worth to have in your collection!!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Great quality and I love this show! Love that I can stream it on my TV and not have to worry about putting in a DVD
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book takes you into the life of Adam and you are cheering him on as he struggles in his life.  He is a true role model for all of us because he was able to leave a horrible life of selfish will and learn to go on and put God first.  I thank him and this book has opened my eyes to pray for all our military men and woman, not just my family who are in USAF but all of them.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It was a bit of a dissapointment.  I was expecting to do the same functions that I do on my desktop at home.  I enjoy playing Farmville2 and it would have been nice if I had the access to play it anywhere I travelled.  I don't want to read about what is happening with the game, I want to play the game
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|absolutely amazing effects , wonderful script and story. My 18 year old son and I love it, a favourite of ours.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|this book kept my interest always wondering what Clary is gonna get into next and how Jace will save her
B004EPZ08Y|3.0|I loved the first ones of this series, but I have to say this is probably the worst one of all of them. It's ok to watch, but the story line with the characters falls real short along with the acting (not too good).  Overall, I thought it was ok, but nothing to rave about.
B0002HYFEI|5.0|My daughter got this for Christmas and loves it! She loves to build and make things so this was perfect for her
B0089EHWQE|5.0|An amazingly beautiful love story, that you grow to love and appreciate with each turn of the page. I didn't want it to end.
1933952806|5.0|Being completely new to DSLR's and never having taken any photography classes, I find this book to be essential for guiding me on how to use my D7000. Great for rookies like me!
0694013013|5.0|This is such a fun interactive book.  Both of my daughters (5 and 2) love this book.  They love doing all of the actions that they animals can do.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|i would recommend this book to anyone who has ever loved.  It deals with love on many levels and is spot on.
B0037KMHRY|5.0|I loved the movie and the music score it had so I had no choice but to buy this CD.  Glad I did, it has the full music score of each scene in the movie (which as you all probably know is usually in pieces in the movies).....this has the complete score for each music piece.  Only the first song has lyrics, the rest is pure electronic music.  Great to listen to while your working on your computer or whatever.  Worth to have and highly recommended for your collection of music.
B005XN31LY|5.0|Great quality and I love this show! Love that I can stream it on my TV and not have to worry about putting in a DVD
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This works great.  I have downloaded several things with this product and they worked out well.  Thank you for this product
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love the the weather channel app , because I live in Michigan and our weather is always changing not knowing what is next.<br />easy to use,and take with on the road.
0805092447|5.0|My 2 year old loves this book.  She asks to read it several times a day.  Which has really helped her learn her colors.
B003JJA59K|3.0|The movie was moving along nicely and very realistic but he just dies at the end.......... lame.  Still ok though
B001EN71CW|5.0|I remember seeing one episode of this series a long time ago before it was prematurely cancelled and loved it, and couldn't wait to see more......oops!!  This disk has 14 great episodes that was slowly leading up to a clarity of what the whole series was about to become.....and then wham, it was cancelled by the FOX network, idiots!!  The last episode will basically leave you hanging for more episodes, but after watching all of these and then purchasing the movie afterwards called &#34;Serenity&#34; it will all come together, which I believe was the purpose of the movie.....to bring Firefly to its sad closure.  The music score of Firefly is IMO horrible, which is what probably brought the series to its demise.  I firmly believe if the Firefly music score was the same as the Serenity movie music score, the series would have survived.  Oh well, you will love all the episodes here, but the sad part is you will want more.....  Highly recommend this series for your collection!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Just love &#34;Downton Abbey&#34;.  It is fun to see the changes these people are all going through because of the times.  It has some much wove into the story.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I thought this book was amazing. Very well written. I didn't want to put it down and I read it in a matter of hours.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love this being on my kindle. I can read a kindle book and then go on facebook and check out what new on facebook
B005R2PDL2|5.0|Great Meditation Music. I Listen to It now after I heard this in a Soul Journey To Abadiania Brasil. Heard it once there, and hope to hear it many more times there. Great Music. Was A Song Created Back For God. Worth It!
0307383415|5.0|I purchased the audio book version and listened to it as I drove to and from work.  I was surprised that it was President Obama's telling his story.  It all makes sense. I loved everything about this book.  It opens your mind on what he was like as he grew up.  No one is purchase but he focused on where he wanted to be and he make it.  What an inspiration to our boys of all races.  Thanks President Obama for showing the world that you are not perfect but is full of happiness, respect, and love.  keep up the excellent work.  God bless you and your family.  I can't wait to be able to purchase more of your books and listening to you tell the story.  Thanks. Char
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Yeah it didn't follow 1season . But that made it better . They brought the same actor and actress for most key parts .
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this game...and so do my kids (ages 6 and 9). More than just a fun game, it helps them actually use those noggins...gotta love that!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Like this game it makes you think of different patterns on how to solve it.<br /><br />Between myself and my youngest son we conquer the different levels together.
B008BM9L72|1.0|maybe for our woman folk who does not read adult books it was very good in south africa all the woman<br />wants to read the books ,whitch is a surprise but for me as man i find it a bit unreal.i dont think our ladies<br />would allow us to do to them what is done in book ,but  bondage equipment etc was well sold here after<br />the book was sold so if there are blue blooded woman in my town contact me
B007IXWKUK|4.0|If you liked the first one, you will enjoy the second one,  The story line the second half of the book moved a little fast, like a half hour TV show. There would be a great story started, but that story would be concluded by the end of the chapter. Then on to the next major thing on the next chapter.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I enjoyed the wonderful weaving of the story and the with it was written.  The reglious part was tenderly handle while showing how religions can work together in harmony.
0385474547|4.0|The last book I read set in Africa was Ben Okri's The Famished Road, published 35 years after this Achebe classic, and I liked the Okri novel better. Not to say I didn't enjoy Things Fall Apart because I did, but I thought Okri's story was more complete and I preferred his writing of mysticism over Achebe's.<br /><br />To me, the central theme in Things Fall Apart is the question of whether our lives are controlled by our dedication to a higher power of if we have free will. Achebe mentions a deity multiple times who, to paraphrase, \\"strikes down a man when he loves himself most.\\" Is this the cause of protagonist Okonkwo's troubles, or are his own actions to blame?<br /><br />The introduction of Christianity to Okonkwo's village and surrounding villages makes for an interesting juxtaposition. Achebe highlights illogical and self-contradicting practices within Christianity and also within the polytheistic religion of the native Africans. While it became clear by the book's end which religion would hold power over the other, I didn't discern any real resolution, and I assume Achebe did not intend to present one.<br /><br />The two reasons I'm not giving this book 5 stars are:<br /><br />1) I didn't think Ikemefuma's role in the story went deep enough; I expected his character, alive or dead, to have some involvement throughout the narrative.<br /><br />2) The end came too suddenly for me.<br /><br />The above having been stated, I really enjoyed reading this novel, very thought provoking and an easy read.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Characters are two nut-cases. A little slow starting, but fast reading to see what happens next. It has a surprise ending.
B00860YICC|5.0|Product was better than advertised, arrived right on time and in pristine condition, being this isn't easy t find, you can't beat the price to stay at home for a great movie!
