B002BU0DPE|4.0|Let me start of by saying whoever is having problems with this headset on an xbox 360 must have had some bad luck b/c these headphones are the best purchase i have ever made gaming related besides my actual xbox 360. When my factory microsoft headset got murdered by the bottom of my shoe it was a blessing in disguise because after i put these bad boys on it changed my gaming life. I can now actually hear everything going on in the game......as in Bad Company 2 Battlefield (Modern Warfare 2 is soooooo yesterday) you know where people are shooting you from due to the stereo amplifier and when buildings fall down the bass boom makes you feel like you are under the rubble. I love the convenience of having all the control settings at the tip of your finger so you can customize away during the game. The only 2 negatives is the slight hissing noise which does go away when sound starts and the headset itself does not feel as sturdy as one would think it should be, on that note if you take care of it i know it will take care of you. If you spend some chunks of free time on the xbox like me then splurging on something like this is well worth your while......it will only enchance your experience.  P.S. - and my wife does not complain about the T.V. bieng too loud anymore.....BOOM HEADSHOT!!!

B000003BZ4|4.0|Gov't Mule - Gov't Mule (1995) 12 Tracks **** (69:55)<br /><br />Warren Haynes (guitar) and Allen Woody (bass) were both members of the reincarnated Allman Brothers Band that toured in the early 90's. Haynes and Woody got together with Matt Abts (drums) and created Gov't Mule as a side project when not touring with the Allman Bros. Band. They released their debut album Gov't Mule in 1995. Out of a dozen studio and Live albums put out by the Mule, this debut remains the most popular by Amazon reviewers. I don't think it's some kind of masterpiece, but there certainly are no weak songs on here. My favorite is the slow, bluesy second track Mother Earth. It's also a good long song (which I like) at over 8 minutes.<br /><br />There is a good bit of variety on here and some notable guest appearances by the likes of John Popper and Hook Herrera. John Popper (Blues Traveler) provides his unmistakable harmonica playing to Mule, and Hook Herrera plays harmonica on Left Coast Groovies. You've got a couple of instrumentals and an acoustic song too. In fact, this album starts off with an \\"acappella\\" track called \\"Grinnin' in Your Face\\" which eventually segues into Mother Earth. On Monkey Hill, Warren tries out some \\"vocal effects\\" that I don't particularly like, but his guitar playing far and away makes up for that little short-coming.<br /><br />On track six, Trane, which is an instrumental, you can really hear pieces of that Allman Bros/Duane Allman sound coming thru with a distinct and beautiful tone and fingering style. The last track is also another slower, bluesy, almost atmospheric song.<br /><br />Obviously Warren Haynes and Co. were on a slightly tight budget on this debut, as the cd booklet is a simple opening bi-fold with some photos and liner notes, but no lyrics.<br /><br />Over-all this is very good debut album. Although there are not a lot of really outstanding tracks, just about every one earned 4 to 4 ½ stars on my personal rating system. Recommended.
0061537969|5.0|Dog lovers!  Listen up!  Move over Marley.  Here comes Enzo.  Enzo melted my heart on page one.<br /><br />The Art of Racing in the Rain is told through the eyes of Enzo, the mixed breed mutt loved by Denny Swift.  He was loved by Eve, Denny's wife and again by Zoe their daughter when she arrived on the scene.  Denny loved cars and racing.  He and Enzo would watch races on TV.  Enzo had quite the repertoire of television shows since Denny left the TV on for him during the day.  He observed and made notes of all his human's actions and emotions.<br /><br />He tries to comfort Eve through her illness and play gently with Zoe.  He hates Eve's parents, the Evil Twins.  Enzo knew exactly how to get under their skin at just the right moment.  The night he ate a pepper just to aggravate Maxwell was priceless.  They tried to rip Denny's family apart.<br /><br />I cried the night Eve dressed up in a ball gown to celebrate her final day of life.  I felt joy for Enzo and Denny as they raced at full speed around an empty track.  I hated Trish and Maxwell for their selfish acts against Denny.  Whatever Enzo felt, I felt.<br /><br />This is a wonderful story and expertly written through the eyes of a dog.  For all of us with dogs who wonder what they're thinking, this book explains it.  I rate this book 5 out of 5.<br /><br />Linda C. Wright<br />Author<br />[[ASIN:1439249563 One Clown Short]]

B002ZG9788|4.0|Clash of the Titans is really good.  The only problem I had with it was the 3D.  The movie was made for 2D and they should have kept it that way.  I am really looking forward to the Blu-Ray so I can see it on my home theater in 2D.  I really hope this 3D fad blows over quick.<br />  The movie is a modern update of a great 1980's Ray Harryhausen flick.  I found the battle with the Giant Scorpions to be most exhilerating.  The pegasus was dead-on.  Medusae was mean as hell and the Kraken was HUGE.  Great acting and set pieces.  Story could have been a little better but overall a great time!  Bring on Clash 2!
B001U0HBPG|4.0|The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a collection of interesting vignettes about a guy aging backwards. Some are touching like the clockmaker's heartache and Benjamin's relationship with Queenie, his adopted mom. Some are beautiful like the love affair in Murmansk and his lifelong relationship with Daisy. Some are thrilling like the episode of U-boat warfare on the high seas. And some are relatively humdrum. But in the end, it just doesn't come together as whole cloth. Good entertainment? Yes, for the most part. The core of the movie is a love story between Benjamin and Daisy. But it's hard to draw any deep inspiration or significant meaning from something so whimsical, so deliberately random. I'm giving it 4 stars, 3 stars overall plus 1 star extra credit for acting, set design, and special effects. (For some additional observations, read my rant in the comments section of this review.)

B003IPY4SI|5.0|While listening to this CD this afternoon, at times I had to remind myself that Nikki is only 16 years old. Occasionally, her voice betrays her in that it sometimes lacks the timbre or range that will come naturally in the next few years. However, her musicianship is superb and she brings a unique touch to this great collection of jazz standards. Her orchestra and band are top notch. This is one of those rare debut albums that 20 years from now will be the foundation of what I expect will be a stellar discography. I really look forward to listening to her voice mature and musicianship develop in the coming years, we're all in for a real treat.
B00337KM2S|5.0|I must admit when this film started I thought I might be in store for just another romantic comedy, but my apprehension was soon thwarted as I found myself truly engrossed in this little film. Clooney who is a likable guy has almost always come off smarmy to me, but in this film he seems so right for the part and delivers a very solid performance. The rest of the cast is put together well with each tiny part adding a necessary piece to the puzzle. Of course I was expecting a very predictable ending and they through me a little curve which is always appreciated for film buffs like me who have seen way too many \\"Hollywood\\" movies. 'Up In The Air may not appeal to everyone, but it is an engaging film that feels very fresh!<br /><br />Thanks Queen B for recommending this one to me, although it was a while ago, I finally got around to it...and was well worth the wait!

0307592839|5.0|After reading a few chapters of Jennifer Egan's latest novel, A Visit from the Goon Squad, I'd determined it was really a collection of linked stories more than a novel.  Reading further, however, I saw the larger themes and the cohesiveness of the whole.  It is, indeed, a novel, and an excellent one at that!<br /><br />The book opens sometime in the recent past, and kleptomaniac Sasha is recounting a story to her therapist.  Her former boss, record producer Benny Salazar, is mentioned in passing.  The next chapter takes place several years earlier.  Here Sasha is still Benny's assistant, and now it is he that is the first person narrator.  Benny's just trying to get through a visit with his pre-teen son while mentally stifling a lifetime's worth of shame.  He reflects, in passing, on his old high school gang, and in the next chapter we're back in San Francisco, circa 1980, with them.  Benny wants Alice, but Alice wants Scotty.  Scotty wants Jocelyn, but teenage Jocelyn is seeing Lou, a record producer more than twice her age.  Don't worry, he'll get his chapter.<br /><br />They all get a chapter or two or three.  The story skips back and forth in time and place.  The voice moves from first person to third person and even to second.  Asides or characters that seemed tangential become central.  And eventually several themes become apparent.  The main one is not even subtle, as the traversing between points A and B is referenced several times in various ways.  Scotty at one point asks, \\"I want to know what happened between A and B.\\"  An aging rock star's comeback album is entitled A to B.  Even the two sections of this book, which might have been labeled \\"Part I\\" and \\"Part II\\" in another book, are here \\"A\\" and \\"B.\\"<br /><br />Another theme is the passage of time.  The novel, as I mentioned earlier, moves back and forth freely along the timeline of characters' lives.  Ranging from around 1980 to some point in the 2020's, we see the (often ravaging) effects of time.<br /><br />One character states, \\"Time's a goon, right?  Isn't that the expression?\\"<br />Another responds, \\"I've never heard that.  'Time's a goon?'\\"<br />\\"Would you disagree?\\"<br />\\"No.\\"<br /><br />The episodes that Egan spotlights are all, in some way, transformative for her characters.  And let's talk about those characters.  Reviewers like me will often extol \\"richly-drawn characters.\\"  It isn't until I read a novel like this--with insight so deep that you feel you know everything it's possible to know about these people based on brief snippets of their lives--that it really hits home what characterization is all about.  Egan is THAT good.<br /><br />Plus, there's the language.  Her prose is truly a pleasure to read, no matter how absurd or at times unpleasant the subject matter.  Egan's pointillistic novel roams from the New York music scene to an African safari; from the affluent suburbs to life on the edge in Naples, Italy; from a dictator's palace to our collective future.  And in careening from place to place, time to time, and character to character in these linked lives, Jennifer Egan takes us from point A to point B., \\"Time's a goon, right?

B001QOGYFO|1.0|Kate Beckinsale, Tom Skerritt - cool setting but it adds up to near nothing. Even the basic script was decent but the execution took care of that. A lot of poorly and overdone CGI didn't help much either nor did the actual cause of everything add up. Or the storyline - which in parts was silly.     In total a really bad movie in a nice package. Kate and Tom could do nothing to salvage what was or wasn't there.

B000005XKO|5.0|This past winter (2010), after losing a job and having very little money, I was driven to watch my VHS of To Kill a Mockingbird over and over again.  Yesterday (5/5/10) I finished the novel, and I wrote a separate review of that.  Here in this review of the film, I want to concentrate on two things: the images of fathers, and the music.<br /><br />As I kept viewing the film, I noticed that except for Atticus Finch, practically every father in the film is either absent or abusive.  Boo Radley's father cuts him off from the world; Bob Ewell gets drunk and beats his child, and doesn't stop there; Dill Harris' father has apparently abandoned him: after saying he \\"hasn't got a father\\" but he's \\"not dead\\", Dill then says his dad let him drive a railroad and one day will swoop him away on an airplane.  Even Tom Robinson, a hard-working Black man with a wife and children, is forced to abandon his family.  Probably Walter Cunningham Sr. does is best, but he is dirt-poor, and can't rise above the prejudices of his society without help.<br /><br />In contrast, Atticus Finch (played by Gregory Peck), is kind, patient, analytical, discreet, approachable, humble, and courageous, providing an excellent example for his children.  Because he's not a macho man--he refuses to play football for the Methodists because he's too old--his children at first don't think he's much to be proud of, but boy do they learn!<br /><br />The other thing I want to mention is the music, written by Elmer Bernstein (no relation to Leonard Bernstein, though they were friends).  The main theme, played on flute, violins, then piano, is a haunting melody which probably speaks to the innocence of childhood and nostalgia for that innocence.  The theme plays over and over again in my mind, speaking things to the emotions that words just cannot say.  Elmer Bernstein won the Golden Globe for Best Original Score, and was nominated for an Oscar.<br /><br />This film has a great story, great characters, great performances, and a great mood.  See it (again)!it (again)!
0553381687|2.0|I am reviewing the book as an individual book, not the series.  Just FYI as you read my review.<br /><br />Martin does some things very well.  He creates a medieval world that is harsh and believable.  He puts characters into that world that are believable:  conniving and capable of choosing to be either bad or good (though Martin does not seem to have a position on what it means to be bad or good).  His ability to describe natural landscapes is particularly powerful.  Having said the things that Martin is very good at, it must be said that Martin's penache is for political intrigue.  The wheels of power constantly turn as his characters scheme for power, peace, and revenge.  Out of 800 pages, close to 700 pages are devoted to the many intrigues.  If you enjoy constant political intrigue in a beautiful medieval setting, this book is for you.<br /><br />If you expect more, then this book offers little.  There is a huge number of characters whose points of view are used to tell the \\"story\\" but there is no real story arc that is being told--only a cascading and never ending series of intrigues.  At the end, I was left feeling the same way I do after I watch a season of a television drama-series.  I was entertained while it lasted but there was no deeper satisfaction.  I had no better or more complex understanding of the nature of the human condition.  Martin's world was fantastically dark, but there was nothing that ever lifted my spirit out of the grime and grit that Martin's characters scramble around in as they play their games.  I was just left to vaguely wonder what would happen next, and you will too because the end of the book in no way resolves anything.  It would be a classic cliff-hanger ending if Martin had bothered to bring the story-lines he started together and then shoot off in a different direction.  Instead, it's a serial cliff-hanger ending because every story line stays independent from one another as they shoot off in a new (and seemingly unrelated) direction.  There is nothing to bind the 800 pages of events into a cohesive story except that the events happen in the same general time-frame in the same world.<br /><br />I would probably go to the library to read the second book in this series, but the simple fact is that the series is unfinished and may never be finished.  Therefore, my dissatisfaction at the end of the first book (all the most interesting ideas are only hinted at by the end of book 1) is unlikely to ever be amended.  My personal preference is for my junk reads to deal more with fantasy than political intrigue so my time will be better spent reading other books.<br /><br />A Game of Thrones is a good junk read, but I think his point is that there isn't any point to the games of power that men play.  Noone needs to read 800 pages to get that message, so the only value of the book lies in its ability to entertain you with intrigue for the time that you're reading it.  Anyone that picked up the book because they have heard that Martin is the American Tolkien (as I did) will be sorely disappointed.here is nothing to bind the 800 pages of events into a cohesive story except that the events happen in the same general time-frame in the same world.

0061120081|5.0|This past winter (2010), after I'd lost a job and had virtually no money, I was driven to watch my video of the film To Kill a Mockingbird over and over again.  Then in April, I went to a tribute to the novel at Symphony Space in Manhattan, NY on the author's 84th birthday.  The next day I took the book out of the library, and last night (5/5/10) I finished it.  WOW!<br /><br />You know the story: in 1930s Alabama, young Jean Louise \\"Scout\\" Finch, her older brother Jem, and visitor Dill Harris connive to make their reclusive neighbor \\"Boo\\" Radley come out of his house.  Later, their principled father, lawyer Atticus Finch, defends Tom Robinson, a hard-working Black man accused of raping 19-year-old Mayella Ewell, daughter of Bob Ewell, the trashiest white man in town.<br /><br />If you've only seen the film, you missed some of Scout, Jem, and Dill's adventures, such as their plays based upon the Radley \\"legend\\".  You've missed Uncle Jack and Finch's Landing, and Aunt Alexandra and the ladies' Missionary Circle.  You've missed the secret of the old lady in the rocking chair.  Scout and Jem's visit to their nursemaid Calpurnia's church.  Alexandra forbidding Scout to invite Walter Cunningham Jr. to the Finch house again because he's \\"trash\\"--not because of his behavior, but because of his family's social station.  You missed a quasi-romantic scene between Scout and Dill.<br /><br />To Kill a Mockingbird, at its heart, contrasts the all-people-are-worth-something approach that Atticus Finch tries to teach his children, and the some-people-are-worth-more-than-others code undergirding Maycomb County society.  Scout's third-grade teacher may deride Hitler and glory in America's DEMOCRACY, but thinks the blacks are \\"gettin' way above themselves\\".  The strict shadow caste system consists of whites of \\"background\\", money, or education (the Finches and their nearest neighbors), dirt-poor but hard-working white farmers (the Cunninghams), the dirt-poor and shiftless whites (the Ewells), and below them, the \\"coloreds\\".  The laziest, dirtiest white is \\"better\\" than the most hard-working or well-mannered black.  No white Maycomb citizen expects Atticus truly to defend a Negro against white accusers--and when Atticus does, someone tries to make him pay.<br /><br />The \\"shooting a mockingbird\\" motif symbolizes how this unjust system destroys the innocent and the harmless.

Sam Raimi has found the right balance of humor, action, and seriousness and really put things together right.  The series is based on the Sword of Truth books and while it does not follow them 100% word for word it really does bring them to life with fun characters that make you can't wait for the next adventure.  I just happened upon an episode one weekend and ordered this season set the next day.  Since then I have watched every episode out and just love this series.  It reminds me of the old Hercules and Zena series (by Sam Raimi also) but with a more series plot and story.  If you were a fan of those old favorites, or of the fantasy genre at all, this is definitely a series to check out.

030726999X|4.0|Anyone familiar with the tattooed and pieced renegade, Lisbeth Salander of Stiev Larsson's Millennium Trilogy and now a Swedish-speaking film directed by Niels Arden Oplev ([[ASIN:B003FBNJ4U The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo]], cannot help but crave more adventures of which she, hacker extraordinaire and victim of a clandestine faction of the Swedish secret police is featured.<br /><br />As sullen and filled with pent-up rage as Larsson depicts her, Salander scintillated readers (and viewers) with her sense of survival, and in this \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest,\\" the last of the trilogy written by the now late Larsson (he died of a heart attack right after the first novel \\"[[ASIN:0307454541 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Vintage)]]\\" hit the European scene with an impact that is now reverberating in the United States) fans will be thrilled as this plucky and in-your-face damsel not only fights for her actual physical life, but finally gets the retribution she and millions of admirers deem her just desserts.<br /><br />As in \\"[[ASIN:030745455X The Girl Who Played with Fire (Vintage)]]\\", Salander and her secret love interest/friend, crusading journalist Mikael Blomkvist---barely connect on a real plane as Salander for the most of this installment is recovering from near fatal injuries inflicted on her at the end of the second novel.  However when these two do get together on a cyber level, the synergy between them--their genius, their vibe, and intensity--drives the plotline with quick revelations that marvel and completely satisfy the reader.<br /><br />Of a secondary interest for this reviewer is the interrelationships and labyrinthine infrastructure behind the story of Salander's need for survival.  Ever the journalist, Larsson's prose during meetings between spies, secret service men and women on the meandering trail to the truth, private conversations between befuddled police officers and their staff, borders on almost the kiss of death of \\"too much information.\\"  Nonetheless, he redeems himself with a side story involving Erika Berger, former editor-in-chief of Millennium Magazine, which again rides his seemingly favorite theme of women dealing in a sophisticated society that runs like clockwork, yet spikes with an undercurrent of misogyny so heinous, it would seem obligatory for any member of the second sex to arm themselves with mace, brass knuckles or a switchblade when traversing the streets.<br /><br />As the background story of the Zalachenko Club and the interrelationships of officials all the way up the bureaucratic ladder that reaches the Prime Minister unfolds and the cyber action begins, the reader understands with the retrieval speed of a flash drive just why Larsson has become a global sensation.<br /><br />Obviously, Larsson--who apparently approached these stories as a form of relaxation--intended his characters to live long lives with many adventures that would crusade, as he himself did, for the truth in a world filled with ambiguity and a desire for wealth that exceeds ethical behavior.  He seeds \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest,\\" with continuing story ideas that fertilize the already tilled ground and guarantees a climate and environs for Salander, Blomkvist, Berger and a raft of others of insured literary longevity.<br /><br />Hopefully, someone--perhaps the \\"Berger\\" to Larsson's \\"Blomkvist\\" will pick up the loose threads and weave the next (and the next . . .) \\"Girl\\" story for fans around the world who not only mourn Larsson's loss, but the forever absence of such vibrant personalities.<br /><br />Bottom line?  Stiev Larsson's \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" presents the next chapter in hacker Salander and journalist Blomkvist's synergistic yet, at times, reluctant alliance.  A bit verbose in parts, the main storyline revolving around Salander's fight for her life provides the retribution fans have sought for her from the first book in the series.  This reviewer hopes that someoneon Larsson's wavelength will pick up the multitude of stories yet to be written--Lisbeth's sister has not yet made her debut--and keeps not only these fascinating characters alive, but resuscitates Larsson's own crusading desire to expose injustice within the world's seemingly sophisticated infrastructures.  Highly recommended, minus 5 stars only due to some confusing details with regard to descriptions of police interrelationships.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />\\"reneofc\\"stories yet to be written--Lisbeth's sister has not yet made her debut--and keeps not only these fascinating characters alive, but resuscitates Larsson's own crusading desire to expose injustice within the world's seemingly sophisticated infrastructures.

B001992NUQ|1.0|This rating is for the \\"BLU-RAY\\" version only. I've gone through 5 blu-ray copies and every one of them was defected. The menu starts up as the menu start up for \\"Never been kissed\\" with Drew Berrymore, then it switches to the Fight Club menu.. weird yes and then after you play the movie it glitchs n statics through out the whole movie. Every \\"10th year anniversary blu-ray edition i pick up seems to have this problem.
0439023483|3.0|Somebody suggested I read this book.  They said that if I like sci-fi I should enjoy this book.  So I started to read this book.  After the first page I was thinking, oh my, this is a rip off of [[ASIN:0765318857 Make Room! Make Room!]].  But by the end of the first chapter I realized it was more of a dystopia, but I did not know if it was a self-made one like [[ASIN:0385732554 The Giver]] or one forced on mankind from the outside, like [[ASIN:0020425716 Tripods Trilogy (The White Mountains / The City of Gold and Lead / The Pool of Fire)]].  By the time I was a hundred or so pages into the book, it was reminding me of [[ASIN:0451230620 The Running Man]] and [[ASIN:1421527723 Battle Royale: The Novel]].<br />There is really no other way to say this - if you are a writer you need to READ.  That way, when you have an idea you know how to present it in a way that has not been done before.  Or has not been done too many times before.  On top of that, this isn't really Sci-Fi, more like Sci-fantasy.  OK, let us talk about the good points of the book now that the complaints are done.<br />This is a great starting book for a teen who wants to start reading.  If they can get through the first hundred or so pages, they are hooked.  But only if they don't read a lot of Sci-Fi or books to begin with.  Otherwise they are going to notice all the themes and ideas are as old as dirt and not well presented.  If I had been a teen and just starting to read, this may have gotten five stars.<br />And when I mean teens, I really mean teen girls.  It has a touch of romance.  Realistic romance.  But also realistic death scenes.  A weird, interesting mixture of dark fantasy and  blood stained dystopia.  I don't know if I will be getting the other books.  I likely will do so, but I fear that, like many other book series, the stories that follow will just not be as good as the first.
B002VPE1B6|2.0|Most Blu Ray movies I will rent unless the movie or concert is something extrodinary enough that I will watch it more than 3-times.  I bought this Avatar disk as a \\"Pre-Order\\" through Amazon, not being aware that it came without any special features.  And to rub salt in the wound, an updated release is coming shortly with the complete package.  I actually was more interested in the making of the movie than watching it again; how aggravating.  Shame on Amazon & the Studio for deceiving it's loyal customers.      Either the studio should make the updated version available at a substantial discount or the Amazon should have a trade in scenario for us early buy-in SUCKERS!  I have a large home theater system and I will pay the price for quality entertainment, but this is over the top.  And the studios complain about the public ripping them off..........    I want a refund Amazon!
0393057658|5.0|It's hard to believe a book about baseball statistics could be so good.  Michael Lewis' excellent humor and journalism really goes a long way.  Very informative about baseball operations as well.  This would probably be appealing to non-baseball enthusiasts even due to the study of the people and the many laughs throughout the book.
0425166805|5.0|Chariots of the Gods is an amazing book.  The author goes into great detail when he explains the possibilities of other beings influencing primitive people.  It really opened my mind up to the possibility of other beings in the universe and I was a huge skeptic of aliens being real before reading this book.  If somebody reads this book and it doesn't change their opinions on the universe a little, like it did for me, I would be completely surprised.  Every corner of this book has some type of mystery that makes the reader wonder \\"what if.\\"  When I read the book, I felt the passion the author had for the subject.  He never tries to push his ideas on the reader and I think that makes this book unique.  Of course from time to time I think the author jumps to conclusions quickly, but don't we all?  Some of the theories prseneted by the author are very well thought out and researched.  The book also uses simple language and is very well written.  It is a great read for anybody looking to open their mind.
0061537969|3.0|Very gimmicky. The protagonist was extremely passive. The other characters never came to life - overly melodramatic - not a work of literature. Good airplane book or beach book.
0553382152|5.0|I was over at a friend's house several weeks ago and while she was in the kitchen, I was rummaging her living room looking for a good spiritual book. This one happened to be placed smack in the middle of her coffee table, I thought, \\"Ehh, cute enough title. Hmm, never been that interested in Near Death Experiences (NDE). Let's crack open a few pages.\\" And then BAM! I was hooked, I carried the little book with me everywhere I went for the next 2 days. What most impressed me about the author's experience is that it was eloquently written with many levels of understanding and interpretation. My job is that of a Pranic Healer and student of esoteric studies. Her experience inspired me and helped me realize, on a much deeper level, that we are NOT alone, we have so much love, help, and blessings to receive and to give. Death is only a transition. My practice as a Pranic Healer and Arhatic Yogi is to master my non-physical bodies before I leave this world...rather than waiting for the inevitable. Call it, Being in a hurry to serve all sentient beings throughout eternity. I highly recommend this book and its beautiful message of hope. Please get it.

B002ZG977Y|5.0|People really need to stop comparing this film to the original becuase you can't...it is a re-imagining of a classic movie with better special effects and a new more attractive hero character(Sam Worthington, Avatar). Sure this movie doesn't come up to par to the original but that doesn't mean it's a bad movie. The new designs I thought were out of this world and the story was equal if not better than the original. Plus Sam Worthington did a hell of a job as Perseus!

1569242739|5.0|It would almost seem this book hardly needs another 5 star review, but it more than deserves it!    I have never had a recipe from this book turn out poorly.      The basic vanilla and chocolate cupcakes taste MILES better than my earlier attempts at (non-vegan) cake from scratch, and are easier to make too!  No going out of my way to buy unsalted butter, no separating eggs, no specialty cake flour needed, just all purpose flour and stuff I already have in the house!    In my opinion they are also better tasting than boxed cake mix, which I used to love.  I will never need another vanilla or chocolate cake recipe, and that is saying something as I love to bake, try new recipes, and tinker!    Oh I have also made them with any random non-dairy milk I have lying around and they come out perfectly no matter what I use!  Soy, rice, almond, different brands... they are invincible!      There are a few recipes I haven't tried yet because I'm still tracking down a couple of specialty ingredients (soymilk powder, agar, fancy extracts) but there are plenty of recipes you can make with regular pantry staples, which is awesome!!    The Gluten Freedom cupcakes are also totally amazing.  I had only made gluten free cupcakes once before, from a boxed GF mix, which were tasty but had the texture of cornbread.   The Gluten Freedom cupcakes in this book are light, just the right level of moistness, with a lovely crumb.  I made them for a work potluck (my boss is GF) - the vanilla with raspberry buttercream and the chocolate as chocolate mint.  I got a lot of skeptical, suspicious looks from co-workers when I announced the cupcakes were GF and vegan - until they tasted them!    (The cupcakes do have a quinoa smell about them when baking, but it goes away once they're 100% cooled, and I couldn't taste the quinoa flavor in the finished cupcakes.  If it bothers you, try a bit of sorghum flour.  I have also had great success substituting sorghum flour for half of the quinoa, and keepingall other flours the same.)      My ABSOLUTE FAVORITE are the coconut lime cupcakes.  The cake is really moist and almost creamy (in a good way!) with a lovely coconut flavor.  The lime frosting is hands down my favorite thing in the entire book.  It's so wonderfully tart!             It's the *KAPOW!!* of frostings.  :)    I have tried and loved: the chai, chocolate mint, tiramisu, red velvet, s'mores, pineapple upside down cupcakes.      All of them are WONDERFUL, and have convinced my family, friends, and co-workers that I'm some sort of cupcake artist genius, when I all do is follow Isa & Terry's excellent recipes.      The tiramisu cupcakes win first place for Thing That Was Ridiculously Easy To Make Yet Made People Rave As If I Were Some Sort Of Culinary God.  It's almost embarrassing.

B000BYRCGU|5.0|The story is hacked up, it is similar to a chopped up soap opera. Jessica is all over this movie, nonstop close ups of her TnA.

061891868X|5.0|I read \\"Not Even Wrong\\" a while back and thought that this would be a rehash of the same complaints.  I'm always interested in views that are contrary to the current fashions.    I was wrong.      This is a deeper version of the same history of physics where the author is actually participating on both sides of the argument.  He covers the whole history of physics in just enough detail to keep the story moving.  His description of mechanics moving from Classical to Relativity, Special and General, is simpler, more fundemental, than I have ever read.       He is always kind/professional and never overly critical of the state the string theorists find themselves in.  The latter parts of the book cover real details of how science in and out of academia used to be done and how things are now.  Eventually ending with What We (You) should be doing, or at least encouraging where we can.  Its style is engaging enough for me to actually finish, even when I knew what the end was about. (I often skip through popular science books once I've got the picture they're selling).      The treatment of academia may strike some as somwhat simplistic in the current political atmosphere, but is still valid notwithstanding.    I highly reccomend this book.
B003BZXI6E|5.0|My name is Kathrin and I come from germany. In the year 2007 I can listen to live sing Ms. Streisand in the concert in Berlin. And now I play the new Blu-ray-disc \\"One Night Only\\" and its amazing for me!!    Sorry, now in my language:    Vielen Dank für die sehr,sehr gute Bild und Tonqualität der Konzertproduktion und auch die Specials kann ich unbedingt empfehlen! Eine wirklich gelungene Blu-ray-disc,die allerhöchsten Ansprüchen gerecht wird.     Ein einmaliges Konzert und ich als langjähriger Fan finde es nun wunderbar, das ich in den letzten Jahren immer wieder mit so unglaublichen Werken von Barbara Streisand wahrlich überhäuft werde und sie voller Energie sprudelt  und ihre Liebe zu Jazz und Brodwaystücken neu entdeckt hat. Das Konzert in New York ein wahrlich unvergleichlicher Abend, für Sie als Künstlerin, für alle anwesenden Gäste und mich als sehr großer Fan!  Dank meiner Blu-ray kann ich mich immer wieder in den Jazzclub einladen, nur den Player anstellen und es beginnt eine \\"One Night Only\\" mit Barbra Streisand!   Thank you so much for the gift!
0446691437|5.0|Good Luck! in trying to find this title in your library or bookstore.  You will be deluged with people helpfully interfering/volunteering with titles beginning with \\"The Art of War...\\"    This is about the very true reality of war, struggle and hard times that precede and continue to hound one in their efforts to try to do Their Work, that is, create art (any output) that only they can create.      The author is a succesful novelist and so, can be believed as he relates the tale of difficulties.  It is a short read but quite vital to the artist in anyone who thinks they can perhaps create.  You really can, you just have to get through all the excuses and resistance.      Worth owning just to keep reminding and refreshing.
B0016OOS16|5.0|I just have to say I love this thing!   It's very well made in every way but one though.   the wire they chose to use for the USB cable is to stiff and long for a portable laptop device...  should have been a mini USB port to give us options on what cord to use and how long.  I feel like this it going to get damaged right at the base rather quickly...   thats my only complaint! No wait, the case is not solid enough to truly protect it much either.
B002WY65VU|3.0|I'm not into the zombie genre but one of my favorite movies is Bubba Hotep.  It's got some similarities to Zombie spoof movies.  Since Zombieland looked like a spoof with Harrelson in it, there were two good things going for it and I decided to rent it.    If you're a zombie genre fan you will probably enjoy watching the zombie heads get driven over and the bodies go splat when they fall many stories onto the pavement.  But if you are not then this is more of a film that is just OK.  It has got a few very good one liners.  Harrelson creates a good character.  Eisenberg is a bit over the top as the neurotic nerd.  His character is also the narrator but his tone is too annoying in spots.    Also, some of the blatant inconsistencies are funny as a genre spoof.  For example throughout the movie we see our heroes draw zombies out of a building by making loud noises or whatever else it takes to get noticed.  They do this for the sole purpose of killing the zombies.  Then at one point the two heroines decide to turn on a million kilowatts of flashing, moving light along with some loud carnival music.  Why?  Because they want a ride and apparently haven't given much thought to the idea that it might attract some hungry zombies.  Well that is just funny as a commentary on all those \\"Don't open that door!\\" moments in zombie/horror films.    Yet except for the Bill Murray portion and a couple other brief parts, the movie doesn't have a lot of creative twists in the plot.  It seemed to me that someone devised a premise for the movie, \\"Wouldn't it be cool if we could shoot zombies in a theme park?\\" and then built a fairly predictable plot to lead up to that.    So for non zombie fans this is worth a rental if you can't find something really compelling.  (Or if Bubba Hotep is not available.)  For zombie fans though, you probably don't want to miss it.  Yet even for zombie genre fans, is this film really so good that it ranks in the highest rating catagory?  Can you really think of no other films that deserve to be ranked higher than this one?

B0021L8V1Q|5.0|I will admit that I was a tad worried about Iron Man 2, because, well let's face it, the first movie was so fantastic that it was almost untouchable. I mean, with the first movie, you had the extraordinary talents of Downey, Howard, Paltrow, Bridges and plenty more anchoring what was an incredible must-see summer slam of a movie. However, seeing the trailers for the second movie made me think \\"Uh oh, Spider Man 3 all over again.\\" Sequels, especially superhero ones, seem to think that since they bring tons of random crap and characters into the frame, that they are always better, and as excited as I was for this movie, I felt it was going to be another one of those movies. So upon going into the theater, I kept those worries in mind.<br /><br />Well, I can now officially say that those worries didn't prevent me from loving the movie.<br /><br />Remember when Michael Bay tried to accomplish something epic with Transformers 2 with all these new characters and stuff? Well, Jon Faverau has managed to accomplish what Michael Bay never did- make a near-perfect sequel that manages to be just as great as the first. Now like the first, there's not a ton of action, but those scenes where action is absent, Faverau manages to make the most out of them. Complete with great action, laughs and characters, Iron Man 2 is the first big summer movie, and a must see on the big screen for sure, especially if you see it in digital!<br /><br />***SPOILERS***<br />Iron Man 2 picks up half a year from when the first movie left off. The Stark Expo has just begun in Flushing, New York, and is to last all year. Tony, in a televised hearing, privatizes world peace. Life seems to be great, except for the fact that the reactor keeping him alive is killing him. This doesn't stop him from being Iron Man though- he continues to go on as Iron Man for the moment. He even considers replacing Pepper Potts with Natalie Rushman, appointing Potts a CEO to Stark Industries. However, in Russia, Ivan Vanko, the son of physicist Anton Vanko, having just lost his father and jealous of Stark's success, creates his own arc reactor, and becomes Whiplash, a badass villain with two electrified whips that can split anything in half with enough force.<br /><br />His first appearance is at a race in Monaco, and after a brief (and failed) attempt to kill Tony, he meets up with Justin Hammer, Stark's rival, and they both collaborate to build a new technology that will hopefully overthrow Tony. However, with a stint at Tony's house appointing James Rhodes as War Machine, and several other plots, Tony Stark, suffering through personal problems, doesn't know if he really can be Iron Man and resolve all this.<br /><br />Now the plot may not sound that great, but when you see it in the movie, you will be impressed with how complex it is. To not spoil too much, I left some stuff out, because the movie is that great. Aside from the plot, everything else is great. The acting here is fantastic! Robert Downey Jr. has his usual charm here, playing the lovable jerk that is Tony Stark. Replacing Terrence Howard is Don Cheadle, and he does it well! I can't believe I am saying this but I actually preferred him to Howard. Howard was great but wooden in places, whereas Cheadle was great the whole way. And Scarlett Johannson... whoa. When is she NEVER eye candy? As for her performance- this movie proves she is not just another pretty face. Her fight scene is just... mind blowingly amazing! Mickey Rourke gives a a fantastic performance as well, and manages to shine as the villain,<br /><br />Of course, halfway through, the movie takes a break from the action and focuses on some character development- I was worried about it at first hearing but as I was watching the movie, I realized that sometimes, in superhero movies, character development does more than whiz-bang action. Don't worry guys, the scenes where action is absent are just as great as the scenes with action. But the action scenes are INCREDIBLE!!!! People are exaggerating the lack of action- the last 20 minutes alone has more action than the first, and is certainly more thrilling than the first too. The climax certainly is a thrill, and I gotta say I had a blast seeing it on the big screen.<br /><br />So in short, Iron Man 2 is a success. I had tons of fun seeing it on the big screen. A great sequel and a great standalone movie, Iron Man 2 is a sequel that truly kicks ass. Whatever worries you may have, I recommend you cast them aside, because you're in for a 2 hour fun ride. So if you wanna see a sequel that truly kicks ass, this movie is it!- the last 20 minutes alone has more action than the first, and is certainly more thrilling than the first too. The climax certainly is a thrill, and I gotta say I had a blast seeing it on the big screen.    So in short, Iron Man 2 is a success. I had tons of fun seeing it on the big screen.

The compression artifacts are really bad on some parts. It's obvious that the manufacture was not interested in putting out a quality product. It's actually a disgrace to the DVD format.

B0035KGWR2|2.0|Sophomore efforts are often the most difficult recordings any artist will ever put out.  Particularly if your debut was a stellar success.  Such is the case with the second CD from Amy Macdonald.  A Curious Thing is not a bad recording.  But if this were in fact her debut, few people would have paid too much attention.  Not because it is flawed or otherwise unpleasant.   Quite the opposite, it's too listenable.  The production is clean and tidy, and sounds pretty much like other pop diva arrangements you'll hear on any given radio.  The lyrics sing of 20 something angst, with overly simplistic rhyming laced throughout the 12 tunes.  Well, 13 if you could the hidden \\"Dancing in the Dark\\" live track.      If A Curious Thing were on in the background, you'd probably tap your feet at points, and think the sound was pleasant enough.  But there isn't anything here to pull you in, to make you want to stop and listen.   No real stories here, no real emotions, and no new ideas musically or lyrically, either in content or presentation.   It's not a curious thing, it's just how it goes when a person tries to follow up an effort that was very close to perfection.      Luckily for us, Amy is a young artist with what I hope will be many more releases for us to enjoy.  I for one, look forward to her third effort.
B001BMXFX0|5.0|These days it is hard to come across a novel anything close to enjoyable. Alice Sebold's Lovely Bones truly surpasses most everyday novels. The story revolves around a grieving family and how through the long years after their teenage daughter is raped and murdered, by no other than her next door neighbor, seek comfort and solace while recovering from there loss.  It also concentrates on her experiences as she watches down from \\"her heaven\\" in a sense to reconnect with her family. The story is from her point of view, and distinguishes how karma has its way of getting around, even when the sciences fails. This novel captures a reader with sadness as well as joy, as we follow Suzie Salmon and her family through the span well over a decade. If you're looking a touching novel, and a most daunting way of writ, I suggest you read ''The Lovely Bones''
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|The first one was visually stunning when you remember when it came out, and this director's cut, a) explains the plot holes, and b) wraps up a lot of the COMPLETE Final Fantasy 7 story much better. You get more the characters you love, well most of them, and then you get a summary of what's happened in the prequels, which again, helps to explain the story better.
0060853972|4.0|Neil Gaiman is one of my favourite writers..I have read and now own his complete Sandman Comics run.I have not read anything by Terry Pratchet  This book was a fast paced read with a lot of references to obscure religious and pop stuff.This is a British book so if you don't like or get British humour this may not be for you.Also if you are offended by people taking a light-hearted  approach to religon this book should be avoided.  Overall I thought this book was very good and had characters I liked.I would have liked to see The Four Horseman to be more fleshed out and the scenes with The Them to be a little funnier.   If after you read this you want more Neil Gaiman check out Ansai Boys.

While the characters don't exactly die off like a George Martin book, I don't get the feeling they are invincible and I believe later novels will proove this to be true.<br /><br />The only downfall of this book is that there is only one released at the moment and the author is slow to get the sequels pumped out.<br /><br />That said you should definitely plan to read this book. A gem for your bookshelf.
0786868724|5.0|\\"Have a Little Faith\\" is a book I was so intrigued by that I couldn't put it down. It is such a heart breaking story, something you don't come accross everyday.    This book made me laugh and cry. There were times I didn't even realize the number of pages I had read. I was stirred by the sudden slam of a door, truthfully this book made me realize things I could relate to, as the author, Mitch Albom, pointed out so many things in life we know, but don't actually sit down and read.    I can't believe the amazing journey Mitch Albom went through, it captured my heart and I am sure going to pick up another one of his books. I don't want to give anything away, you have to read the book yourself!!
0375413405|5.0|So far I've only made a few things from this cookbook but everything I've made has turned out delicious! I love how Julia Child wrote many ideas for variations for a lot of her dishes.  The only thing is that I kind of wish that nutritional info was included for each dish.. (or maybe I don't...considering all the fat involved.. ha)   But it's a really good cookbook that will teach you basic techniques with freedom (and ideas) to tweak a dish and make it your own.

0307454541|5.0|I saw the movie and then read the book.  There are some differences!  The movie might have a tauter story line and the book, unfortunately, just didn't capture the horror as well once the bad guy was exposed; after that the book's story sagged a little.  For the second book, I'll be reading that soon and I am not aware of a movie (yet).  The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo is highly recommended!

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I was browsing the time website when I came across the name Suzanne Collins in the list on 100 most infulencial people of 2010 so I thought I would give it a read.  I have to say that I was not disappointed with the book.  Collins is one of those authors who writes in metphors, meaning that her novel is comparing these hunger games to the lack of humanity we possess in time of war.  Collins focuses on the youth and how the lack of humanity effects them and the world it has created for them.  This is the kind of book you must look beneath the surface to see the message of what is trying to be convayed.  Katniss is a likable girl with the courage and strength we all wish we possess.  Her ablitiy to see the world for what it is stands out amoung those who see it with rose colored glasses adds depth to her character.  Katniss's inablity to trust anything out of her control is reflection of the mistrust that grows between evolving cultures and society.  Don't take this book at face value there is more substance and meaning that lies beneath the typed wording.

B002JWD6AS|2.0|I have to say that I was glad to be done with this book.  I love the twilight saga so when this book came up with notation that said if you love twilight you might also like....  So I thought I would give it a try.  I don't know if it was because I'm not a teen but I felt like the book was extremely young.  I mean I'm not that old only in my early 20's so I thought I'm still young enough that the book my still be enjoyable, I found that I was wrong.  The whole thing was a drag, nothing happened the whole entire time.  Its cold I shiver, its cold i shiver, its cold i shiver, that was basically the whole book now you don't have to waste your time reading it.  There is just no better way to say it the book was BORING.

0307476154|5.0|I read \\"The girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" first and couldn't wait to get \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\".  I don't usually enjoy books with violence against women, but this writer has an intriguing way of hooking you in.  I read each of these books in a couple of days, and I'm not a particularly fast reader!  Highly recommended.  In fact, I'm anxiously awaiting the release of his last book in the trilogy \\"The Girl Who Kicked ....\\" I've already ordered it from Amazon.

B000002MZ6|5.0|Based loosely on Arthur C. Clarke's book of the same title, what Mr. Oldfield does here is to step further from his \\"Tubular Bells\\" opus. You hear his name, and you immediately think \\"Tubular Bells,\\" or an even more remembered memory, the opening scene of \\"The Exorcist.\\" What many people don't realize is that there's a lot more to just that opening theme.  \\"Songs of Distant Earth,\\" however, finds Mr. Oldfield experimenting with different sounds: the almost PERFECT guitar sound that resembles a Stratocaster manipulated in a hundred different ways, the background voices chanting, speaking, or simply being ambient, all these little things have been woven into a grand tapestry of musical genius. Reading Mr. Clarke's book would be a great help as then you would know what the \\"Magellan\\" was, what a \\"Hybernaculum\\" is, etc. This is probably Mr. Oldfield's attempt in introducing the public at large to Mr. Clarke's wonderful tale.  The disc is clearly studio work put into overtime and placed through a lot of careful listening. If one would think \\"Tubular Bells\\" was Mr. Oldfield's magnum opus, a listen to this fantastic and magnificent work would quickly make one switch his allegiance. The music can be listened to ANYTIME, no matter what mood you're in; it's what I believe anyway, as I have listened to this CD innumerable times.

006621131X|2.0|I'm really wondering why I disliked this book so much when so many people, here and in the general media, love it. Maybe it was the shallow writing; often Smith left out important details about how and why things happened, such as who her husband was, why they moved to Detroit, and most importantly, why wasn't she in touch with Mapplethorpe during those years? Or maybe it was the endless name-dropping; I admit I was too square during those years to now recognize many of those names, but I really got tired of the march of the famous, not-so-famous, and hangers-on-to-the-famous that parade through the text. Or maybe it was the repeated allusions to religious and mystical ideas that seem more a mishmash of every trendy belief system of the time than any coherent understanding of spiritual values. Basically I thought this book a big mess in almost every way.

0143038419|4.0|I had very mixed feelings about this book.... Half the time I was really enjoying the book, the other half I was pissed off at the author.   I think this author has a witty, cleaver way of looking at life that translates well into writing. She is funny and charming with her antidotes, and vividly recalls stories of her travels and of life. However, as I am reading (especially while she is in Italy) I get the \\"poor little rich girl\\" vibe. She is bitching about her life, her divorce, and her failed rebound relationship. She lays out all the drama that she is going through, and all the heart ache and damn near suicidal thoughts she has. Then she up and leaves her life and goes on an exotic year long journey that is essentially paid for by her publisher with the promise of this book. While she is in Italy she continues to bitch whine and moan about her troubles... And here is where I get pissed. Millions of women go through bad divorces, millions of women go through bad break ups, millions of people have hardships in their life, but only a damn few can get over it by running away to Italy, India, and Indonesia on a yearlong self discovery vacation.  Instead of feeling so depressed about what she didn't have any more (dysfunctional relationships), she should have feel incredibly blessed and lucky that she lived a life where she was privileged enough to have this incredible adventure.  She does move out of the depression for the most part as the book progresses and I found myself not so pissed and enjoying the book more.
B000002L9B|5.0|glad to see many good reviews here on Amazon.  I have loved this album for many years.

Who knows whether that is true....    Great album, infectious and psychedelic in the best sense of the word.
B0021L8V1G|4.0|I didn't read a lot of comics when I was a kid, but I'm willing to bet Iron Man director Jon Favreau did. He has an affinity for adding just the right touch of reality to back up the color and action for a superhero movie. A lot of sequels make the mistake of just reiterating the first movie, happily Iron Man 2 doesn't try to mirror what they think are the successful elements of the first movie and move the storyline along.<br /><br />Iron Man 2 picks up six months after the end of the first movie. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) is the fast talking industrialist who has outed himself as Iron Man. In that six months Iron Man has created world peace, although, the Iron Man suit is slowly poisoning him. As other nations scramble to create the technology of Iron Man for their own purposes, a hawkish Senator (Garry Shandling) wants Stark to turn over the Iron Man \\"weapon\\" to the Government. In Russia, Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) labors away in a grimy workshop trying to regain his place in the world that he thinks Tony Stark's father stole from him. Working from his father's plans he creates an ARC reactor (the reactor that also powers Iron Man) of his own and tries to kill Tony Stark with the supercharged whiplash. I'd give a fuller synopsis but the rest of the action of the movie derives from these events and I think you'll enjoy discovering for yourself what happens next when you see the movie.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr is excellent as the bon vivant, Tony Stark/Iron Man, who for all his best intentions, his drinking problem is catching up with him and starts affecting the integrity of Iron Man. Don Cheadle does a turn as Lt. Col. James Rhodes (replacing Terrence Howard) as Stark's military liaison and best friend. Mickey Rourke continues his string of strong performances as Ivan Vanko/Whiplash, and although the part could have been pushed over the top, Rourke plays it gritty and realistic. Favreau and screenwriter Justin Theroux are smart enough to build a strong story to carry and provide a reason for the action instead of having action drive the story.<br /><br />The few minor criticisms of the movie, Sam Rockwell's Justin Hammer seems a little too much a caricature, I couldn't tell if he was trying to play the character straight or was trying to be a little campy with it. Scarlett Johansson as Natalie Rushman/Natasha Romanoff in her fight scene it looks lifted from the Matrix and even seems to resemble Matrix \\"bullet time\\" filming which is different than any other part of the movie. The studio seems to be trying to plant too many seeds of upcoming movies, a Captain America reference, and the post credit coda sequence. In the movie we're given a reason to suspend our disbelief and believe in a world that can have an Iron Man (or a Batman) but if you start having super-heros pop up all over the place it starts to seem unreal and cartoony.<br /><br />Iron Man 2 is a strong follow-up to the first movie and you shouldn't miss a chance to see it.provide a reason for the action instead of having action drive the story.

B001SGEUNI|5.0|Most of us rockers can't wait for something new to come along. This cd is a slick recording, well played/sung with a variety of tempos not everyone can appreciate but will after a couple listens (and you will listen to it again...and again...  One can only appreciate the talent Lizzy Hale possesses by seeing her and her musicians live. Saw them in Burlington VT last night and it was one of the best shows I've seen in a long time. They are professionals and it shows. I'm sure they may outgrow the smaller venues but that's the best place to see them. Up close and personal.
B002Q9MZHE|1.0|If you, like me, are enticed by the names of Netrebko and Villazon, listen to their beautiful CD of Puccini's work and avoid at any cost looking at the images of this film. The director, who stated in his interview that he is new to opera, should dismiss the invitation to direct this film. He knows nothing of film opera - and let's face it, I doubt there is a more difficult art form than filming an opera. Just tell me of how many outstanding examples you know that surpass theater productions. This specific production is a sequence of disappointments. Villazon during Act 1 seems to be portraying Nemorino, the funny guy in the village, a character not expected from somenone who describes his life singing \\"Che gelida manina\\". The purposeful visit of Mimi to his apartment destroys the innocence we have grown to indentify the sick girl with. And if the fims intends to bring a more realistic approach than we are used to in the theater, who would be kneeling in heavy snow for more than 5 minutes, as Mimi and Marcello do in their exchange in Act III? And why so much snow throughout the act? Why the tacky close-up shot of Musetta and Marcello with Rodolfo and Mimi at the background in the middle? Thank God these kind of things do not happen in the theater. Avoid it. Better yet, listen to the CD and imagine your own staging in your mind. I am sure the satisfaction will be greater.
0393072231|4.0|Fascinating examination of the very few investment strategists who profited richly from the US housing bust of 2007-09 and these strategists' dealings with Wall Street (which led to the massive bailout of financial firms deemed \\"too big to fail\\"). Lewis tells powerful mini-biographies of these individuals which illustrate how their analysis, independent thought and courage to formulate and stick by contrarian conclusions were wildly profitable. While I'd call this a \\"must read\\" from a micro standpoint -- it reinforces one's courage to be rigorous in deeply thinking through business situuations and being independently courageous in sticking to one's conclusions.  From a macro standpoint the book is fascinating though flawed in that it fails to detail the government's role in fanning this fire via loose monetary policy, governmental bias encouraging home ownership via sloppy management of Fanny & Freddy, and regulations condoning massive conflict of interest within the financial industry.
B001TOD92C|4.0|\\"The Wrestler\\" is a complicated, balanced, but ultimately sympathetic examination of the wrestling profession and one man who makes his living in it.  Regarding the profession, one thing especially struck me: although in scene after scene we're shown that most aspects of professional wrestling are fake, the injuries certainly aren't.  In fact, I started thinking that there would likely be a lot less injuries if there was less choreography and showmanship in the matches and more actual wrestling.  Another memorable scene showed a sad assemblage of broken-down wrestlers (some in wheelchairs) at a sparsely attended autograph-signing event.  I really felt bad for those guys during that scene, and clearly, so did the movie.<br /><br />Mickey Rourke's character is flawed but mostly likable, a man who loves his profession even though it really hasn't taken care of him as much as it should have over the years.  However, his misplaced devotion to wrestling is likely responsible for his hurts and failures outside the ring, especially his longtime estrangement from his daughter. In his view, of course, wrestling is the only thing that hasn't hurt or disappointed him, and the only thing that's given him consistent joy.<br /><br />The movie is raw, adult, and often hard to watch.  But it's also intimate and sweet.  You certainly don't have to be a wrestling fan to get something out of this simple yet surprisingly involving film.<br /><br />\\"The Wrestler\\" looks and sounds fine on standard DVD.  The image is a little dark and slightly grainy, but I'm sure those are intentional contributions to the mood of the piece.  There are no extras on the DVD I watched.

B0021L8V1G|4.0|Had the good fortune to see this while in Asia. Ha ha!<br /><br />I was worried because the first review I read panned it for many issues, foremost of which was having too many disparate plot threads and a low-stakes tussle (over who wins an arms deal). I'm happy to say this is not the case at all.<br /><br />IM2 picks up where 1 left off. Tony Stark is a one-man peacekeeping (and peacemaking) machine, but he's gradually being poisoned by the palladium in his power source. This is turning him to drink and general recklessness, which puts his friends and others at risk, in a few exciting set pieces throughout, one of which is an amazing attack during an F1 race.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Mickey Rourke plays Vanko, the son of his father's ex-partner who is hatching plans for what he considers revenge, having access to similar technical knowledge. I will not divulge further details, so you can guess at what is true and what is not.<br /><br />Sam Rockwell is a rival arms manufacturer, Hammer, who tries to use Vanko to further his arms race against Stark. As usual, the exchanges between him and Vanko are the most boring and predictable of the movie, because we all know what bad guys are going to say, well ahead of time, because, well, they're bad. (As one writer has put it, it is the saints (in this case, Tony and friends) who are the real characters; they're more believable and unpredictable because of their internal struggles.) But they do their best with the material they're given. He does his dancing cameo here, never fear.<br /><br />So, as the negative review I first read says, the stakes seem to be really low - it's about who wins the arms deal. But it really isn't, and I think you'll see that. The deal is only the surface of a greater threat.<br /><br />Another thread is Tony's interest in Johannson's character versus Paltrow's. But this is also part of the overall scheme of things, not a throwaway. I didn't see at first how Tony could get sidetracked from Pepper, but I guess it's part of his deterioration, and of course makes for some romantic tension. As seen in the previews, Johannson will get into some matrix-like action, interspersed with some other (fighting) action involving Tony's driver to humorous effect.<br /><br />Yet another thread is resolving Tony's relationship with his father. Was his father, whom he felt always held him at arm's length, a cheat, or something worse? Did his father hold the key to Tony's salvation? A little far-fetched, but this is a comic, right?<br /><br />Don Cheadle is the foil to Tony's self-destructive downslide, and their friendship is strained by competing interests besides, one of whom is Gary Shandling's oily, bloated politician who is insisting that Stark turns over the suit to the US - actually an interesting point, since the question is, do we want to put all our eggs in Tony's basket? Shandling is cast as the \\"bad\\" guy of sorts, but it's a grey area and he gets a surprising dig in the end.<br /><br />The effects are well done. There is mundo action and destruction, also touched with humor in the midst of terrifying threats. I felt some aspects of the pre-final battle were a little too easy, but it makes sense in terms of the major players (Hammer vs. Stark) and their companies as \\"characters\\", which is built up throughout the movie.<br /><br />We have hints of the Avenger initiative, but not much - stay for the after-credits teaser, thin though it is.<br /><br />Everything comes together and every part makes for a great time at the movies.f course makes for some romantic tension.

If you are Ninja or want learn secret about path on Ninja, this is good pick. If you  just love TMNT but  gymnastic task are horrible perhaps this movie is good to check first on movie rental.   ***    If this review was odd and you did not found path about Ninja from this movie your inner soul aren't so dark then.

B0036XN2L2|4.0|When I heard the Scorpions were retiring, I thought \\"This truly is the end of an era.\\"  Most hard rock groups from the 80s were just so much filler and band-wagon jumping.  Any one of them sounded like any other-- kind of like emo bands these days.  Ho hum.  But I always respected Scorpions for having a distinctly original approach to the genre.  It was all them, their own patent and you could always tell them apart from the other corporate-made \\"hair bands\\" around them.  Maybe that's because they really have their roots in the 70s, when they were a pioneering hard rock group who stood out from all of the Deep Purples and Uriah Heeps.  Heck, their second album, Fly to the Rainbow, is often credited with being the first recording to display what is now known as \\"shredding\\"-- long before the 80's guys made it standard practice.  That said, it seemed their magic ability to turn out consistent, focused albums was starting to dry up a bit through the 90s and into the early 21st century.  Either they were too ballad-heavy, experimenting with silly pop experiments like Eye II Eye, or just parodying themselves.  Humanity: Hour 1 was a nice foray into a more updated sound, but then again it's nu-metal influences are a bit cliche and that album just keeps making me say \\"Haven't I heard this before?  Creed?  Adema...?\\"  And so, it is with bitter-sweet pleasure that I find this final album to be among the Scorpions' very finest-- if not the finest.  A couple of ballads (actually really great ones), but all-in-all Sting in the Tail puts the heavy rockers to the fore.  The opening track opens with a nostalgic, \\"Rock You Like a Hurricane\\"-type riff, yet without being a cheesy carbon-copy.  (Hey, the last album has to have SOME self-reference for old-time's sake!)  The rest rip along in a heads-first, metallic crunch that celebrates what good hard rock (and the Scorpions) is all about, without sounding recycled in the least.  In fact, this is very fresh-sounding, exciting music.  Also nice is the tracks don't all sound the same, the result of great arrangements and song-writing.  This is the album Face the Heat could have been if it had been given more attention to detail.  To sum up, hard rock fans may mourn the retirement of the Scorpions, but they can at least rejoice in the fact that their final album is a tremendous one.  Hats off to Germany's finest hard rockers for going out with a bang!

B002VPE1B6|4.0|I've seen this in the Theaters and there are deleted scenes in this Blu-Ray version. There is a sex scene that is gone for starters. Been awhile since i've seen the Theater version but that I do remember. And i'm sure there is more missing that I don't recall as I've heard the 15-20 minutes are missing. I'm sorry but people are buying this movie because they loved it so much in the Theater. How fair is that that they are not getting what they viewed the first time? Plus people that have not seen it yet are not getting the full experience. I don't rate it lower than 4 stars because it is a good movie and i'm not going to blame the movie for what they did to the Blu-Ray. Quality of the picture is A+ though. Wait til they release the extended version to buy it on Blu-Ray. If I knew, I would have never pre-ordered this version.

B0002XMF5S|4.0|To some Black Sabbath was Ozzy's old band, to some it was the band that had 3 albums with Dio but to real followers of the band who stuck long after either of those singers left Black Sabbath. Those are people who don't understand that Iommi IS Black Sabbath, he continued the band once the success was a thing of the past because Sabbath is his baby and just couldn't watch it die. Iommi kept Sabbath alive because he was the only one who never left and he has seen many musicians come in and out of the band over the years. \\"Seventh Star\\" was released in 1986 and was supposed to be Iommi's solo album, that's the way it turned out because it doesn't sound so much like Sabbath but the record company wanted to label it as a Black Sabbath album. The album was credited as Black Sabbath Featuring Tony Iommi\\" to please everyone; it's ironic because by this point Iommi was the only original and real member of the band by this point!<br /><br />In my opinion the singer for the album Glen Huges (former Deep Purple) is a much better singer than he is given credit for; he is simply underrated because of the legendary singers that were in Black Sabbath before him: Ozzy Osbourne, Ronnie James Dio and Ian Gillian. For some Black Sabbath fans there is nothing good at all after Ozzy or Dio, that is understandable but those fans choose to overlook \\"Seventh Star\\" and the rest of the albums the band released and may miss out on some great music. Huges sounds great on songs like \\"In For The Kill\\" and the title track, I remembered him from early Deep Purple albums and thought he sounded great on those as well, he's an excellent singer.<br /><br />Seventh Star has some great songs: \\"In For The Kill\\" is without a doubt the heaviest song here with a Sabbath sounding riff, I think it's one of the best songs on the whole album. \\"No Stranger To Love\\" is an attempt to do a ballad and it sounds lighter than anything Sabbath has done before, a great song, it's very rooted in the sound of the era but it remains a good one. \\"Seventh Star\\" is an epic song, I consider either this or \\"In For The Kill\\" as the best song on the album. \\"Heart Like A Wheel\\" is very melodic and has more great singing from Huges. The rest is good as well, no real filler except perhaps the instrumental \\"Sphinx (The Guardian)\\" (which is not really an instrumental it's sounds put together to make the following song more epic I guess)and they sound like they all belong on the same album.<br /><br />\\"Seventh Star\\" might deceive someone expecting a Black Sabbath album because while it features excellent music it's not Black Sabbath. It sounds like what it was supposed to be and what it should be looked at: a Tony Iommi solo album. As I said it doesn't sound much like Sabbath, it's a poppier album in many ways minus cheesy lyrics that many bands used in 1986. SS has some very good songs, great singing, riffs but it's not the Black Sabbath sound it's very different.

B002BSHXJA|5.0|I went back and forth on purchasing the Mono box set. Until I read Cheapskate's review. See. Back in my callow youth, I was 10 1/2 Christmas week 1963 when the Beatles first hit the air waves. I guess for other generations it was like first hearing \\"Anarchy in the U.K.\\" or \\"Radio Free Europe\\" or \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\". It was Apache war music amid girl groups and Motown and pablum pop. Nothing on earth sounded like \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" Christmas week 1963. The New Wave was born then - guitars, drums, harmonies, new lyrics.     I would walk 10 blocks up to Sol's Records on Greenpoint Avenue in Woodside, Queens, NY to see the bobbing head Beatles Capitol Records window display. I tried to get ole Sol to give it to me. Asked  him what price he'd sell it for. No win.  Back then there was a difference between Mono and Stereo. It was $1.00 per album. Everything I owned was Mono.     It was how I first heard all music until very late into the '60's. Sgt. Pepper's may have started it all. It didn't matter. My turntable was portable. There was no audio geek universe. No audio snobs for rock & roll. There is no need for audio snobs today. Rock is, was, ever shall be, about blood pumping through synaps and the entire circulatory system. It's in the head. The ears. The mind. The vision.    The Beatles Mono Box gave me a jolt back to my childhood. The songs leap out of the speakers. Out of the ear phones. There's a crispeness and clarity I never imagined possible. Jumpin' Joe jamhiminami! Whoa!    Even though  buying these collections are close to a down payment for a home, they are worth the money. I was flumoxxed to see that some albums - like Abbey Road, Let It Be, were missing in the Mono box, but no real loss, Yellow Submarine was not included - I bought anyway. It was money well spent.     I elected to buy the remastered aforementioned. I may buy Sgt. Peppers. Maybe Revolver. It's about filling in the blanks. In the early days of Beatlemania it was all about the Mono. But for now, there is no - I mean none, Nada, Nunca, No way - you should buy the Stereo version vs. the Mono.     Cheapskate speaks the truth. Thanks, dude!
0156027321|5.0|Somehow I missed this book when it first came out, but everyone I've spoken to about it since has told me it changed their life.  It is not often one hears more than one or two people say such a thing about a particular book, unless perhaps it's an old classic, like the Bible.  So when I heard this claim yet again a few weeks ago, I finally decided I had to do something about it.  I had to read the book.    As the title claims, the book is about the life of a character named Pi.  (It's not about Pi's entire life, but still.)  Pi's real name is Piscine Molitor Patel, but he changes his name to Pi in school after being called a nickname after the bodily function one is reminded of when they hear the name Piscine.  He is an Indian boy from town named Pondicherry.  His father is a zookeeper and teaches Pi about the nature of animals from an early age.  (Most explicitly when he feeds a goat to a tiger in front of his sons.  Be warned, there is LOTS of animal violence in this book.)  Pi is a curious boy and absorbs all the information he can.  Eventually his interests move from the natural world onto the spiritual plane.  Born a Hindu, he becomes a Christian and a Muslim after coming across a Church and a Muslim baker.  (There's a hysterical scene where Pi is walking with his parents, who have no idea he's practicing three faiths, and they bump into Pi's priest, imam, and pandit all at the same time.)  He learns as much of these faiths as he can and appreciates the benefits of each.  When his cross-denominational penchant is discovered, he's surprised to find everyone insists he pick one.       Pi's world receives a jolt when his father decides to sell the zoo and move the family to Canada.  Since they have to transport some of the animals to sell in the States, they catch a ride on a cargo ship.  It sinks in the Pacific.  As his family and everyone else on-board drowns, Pi ends up in a small lifeboat with a hyena, a zebra, an orangutan, and a Bengal tiger.  Soon, naturetakes its course- the hyena eats the zebra and orangutuan only to be eaten by the tiger- and Pi is left alone on the boat with the tiger.  At first, Pi is terrified he too will be eaten.  But soon he realizes he would be alone without the animal and comes to the conclusion he must not just keep himself alive, but also an animal that could kill Pi in an instant.  Pi must use all the knowledge of spirituality and zoo keeping he has garnered to survive.    I thought Life of Pi was brilliant for many reasons.  The prose is conversational (the pretext is that Pi is telling the story to the author in a series of interviews.) and witty.  Pi is a character we can like right away for his boundless curiosity.  But it is the larger themes that make this book hum.  Spirituality and science take center stage.  Pi's needs to draw upon both to survive.  Is Martel telling us we need to do the same?   There is an element of storytelling too.  Pi is drawn to religion because he likes the stories.  (Another great part- there were so many- when Pi compares and contrasts the core stories of Christianity and Hinduism)  And a twist at the end suggests perhaps Pi needed storytelling to survive as well.  Is it all just an allegory?  As Pi says to close his interview with representatives of the cargo company after his ordeal, \\"And so it goes with God.\\"    Okay, I won't say the book changed my life.  But it addresses some themes and ideas that sure could change the way we see life; the way we accept or reject religion in our lives- or even refuse to decide.  It is up to us to do the rest.

B002N5KVDG|4.0|Got to love the cover art for starters. A perfect send-up of Shepard Fairey's celebrated Obama Hope poster. I want it on a t-shirt.<br />Everybody says this latest album by Biafra and company sounds a lot like Dead Kennedys and it does. Since one of my favorite bands of all time is Dead Kennedys and Dead Kennedys is great music I'm happy I bought this cd.<br />So if you like DK you will like Jello Biafra & the Guantanamo School of Medicine's album, \\"Audacity of Hype\\". Which is also a perfect title to parody that public relations political slogan. Also, great name for the band. Great name for the band, great cover art for the cd and great music to play while in your car going to work, hanging out at your place or maybe taking a walk.<br />Thumbs-up. Good job Jello and everybody.<br /><br />*******<br />Also, don't know about you but I've gotten beyond FED-UP with musicians', artists', celebrities' pro-liberal, pro- Democrat, myopic blabber.<br />And their easy, fashionable, predictable and boring bashing of Republicans.<br />Yeah man, as if the Democrats are so much better...<br />The stuff I have heard come out these peoples' mouths. Just one ex. I recently saw a clip of Fat Mike from NOFX say Bill Clinton had a good domestic policy. ??? Maybe for him; he's rich. Bill Clinton is a moderate Republican in terms of policy. Krist Novoselic was a big Obama supporter, like everybody, and he said \\"we need a multicultural president\\". Dumb. Obama being black wont help working class black folks when he's busy working for Wall Street.<br />This kind of naive, misguided nonsense has helped destroy the left in America. So kids think \\"rockin' against Bush\\" and voting for a brown man that seems \\"nice\\" (I have heard people say that he is a nice man.) will save us.<br />I voted for O'bummer myself and mostly without illusions. Mostly. I was not expecting much and took the lesser of two evils stance. Not ever again will I do that. He's sucked even more than I didn't Hope for and Changed even less. Sure it is great having a black guy in the White house and it is historically important. But man... shoulda just voted for Cynthia McKinney. No more Democrats.<br />If only more people were as sensible as a Jello Biafra!ck guy in the White house and it is historically important. But man... shoulda just voted for Cynthia McKinney. No more Democrats.  If only more people were as sensible as a Jello Biafra!
B0007WPJBQ|4.0|We all know that this movie, One Eyed Jacks is a brilliant movie with Marlon Brando. And it is directed by the man himself. The entire movie, storyline and acting is still way ahead of many a today's movie. I have seen many a version of this dvd and the quality has been terrible,unwatchable. However, the DIGIVIEW version of ''One Eyed Jacks'' is the best I have ever seen. The standard of the ''natural''colour is very high. Even on my 46'' Toshiba LCD TV, the quality is still very high.     It is still lacking sharpness to detail compared to the best digitally re-mastered movies. This version is DEFINITELY WIDESCREEN with a 16:9 ratio (1:78:1) the same ratio as today's widescreen TV'S. (others have commented on this fact and it's quality, and their comments of the DIGIVIEW version are accurate). I have given it four stars because:- (1)a fantastic Marlon Brando Movie, still superior to many of today's movies (2) The high standard of ''natural''colour. (3) DIGIVIEW WIDESCREEN  16:9 RATIO.      I cannot give it five stars because it is still lacking in sharpness of detail viewed on a 46'' Toshiba LCD TV. I am looking forward to a first class re-mastering version of this dvd. Surely with Marlon Brando's popularity, someone should do it soon.

B0009A1AS2|2.0|2 1/2      DT continued to deteriorate through the 00's, often lapsing into recycled metal guitar cliches or just flat out embarrassing balladry, but with an obligatory epic providing the undeniable kick-butt climax they flaunt full amounts of filler in fans faces.
B002GZQYMK|3.0|I once read a review where the lead singer of the band said that he didn't care for American music-listeners because we \\"wanted to hear the same thing over and over\\". Well, I guess that's probably his knee-jerk defense to this album.    I've enjoyed Muse thoroughly, up until The Resistance. Quite frankly, I blame Twilight. Things were going well....not too much crooning to be had...., then *BAM* eternal love and yearning start bleeding out of their purpley-haired, 13-year-old-girl lyrics.    The only Resistance to be found in this album is my resistance to letting my gag reflex let fly. I give it 3 stars because MK Ultra and the second part to Exogenesis were alright.
B001C4AFOY|4.0|As a fan of period dramas, I was looking forward to watching \\"The Young Victoria\\", and for the most part, the movie does not disappoint. Emily Blunt credibly portrays the angst of a young woman destined for great things,yet is raised in virtual isolation by her domineering mother, the Duchess of Kent (Miranda Richardson) who is in turn controlled by the politically ambitious and conniving Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong). The pair make Victoria's childhood and early teens absolutely unbearable as every aspect of Victoria's life is controlled - she is forbidden novels, has to be accompanied whilst walking up and down stairs, and is basically at the beck and call of her mother and Conroy. But, Victoria finds subtle ways to rebel, and through Emily Blunt's luminous portrayal, viewers get to see the fire burning within this young soon-to-be monarch.<br /><br />In essence, this is a coming-of-age tale. The political battles are there - but they are portrayed in an almost mild manner.There's some shouting and yelling, but for the most part, the battle of wills by parties who wish to manipulate Victoria for their own gains is subtly portrayed. Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany) is one such manipulator, but he oozes such charm and good humor that Victoria cannot help but like him, to the extent that she entrusts major decisions to him, which turns out to be catastrophic for her early days as Queen. The only other person whom Victoria trusts as her ally and confidante is Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg (a suitably gallant Rupert Friend) and the simmering romance between the pair is one of the movie's highlights. This is a relationship that develops slowly, and the strong chemistry shared by the lead actors lends authenticity to the romance. Victoria and Albert are truly soul mates - her inexperience and initial naivete is nicely offset by Albert's maturity, tenderness, and perpetual patience. His patience is definitely a virtue that Victoria comes to appreciate over time, and the couple's deep and affectionate bond is compellingly portrayed in the movie.<br /><br />Emily Blunt truly does carry this movie, a far cry from her roles in movies like [[ASIN:B000J103PC The Devil Wears Prada (Widescreen Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B001UV4XGU Sunshine Cleaning]]. She has truly made the role of the young Victoria her own and credibly so. I look forward to seeing Ms. Blunt in more challenging roles, and as for The Young Victoria - it will delight fans of period dramas, and for those who have an interest in seeing the 'lighter' side of the woman who would go on to become the undisputed matriarch of the Victorian Age.e's deep and affectionate bond is compellingly portrayed in the movie.<br /><br />Emily Blunt truly does carry this movie, a far cry from her roles in movies like [[ASIN:B000J103PC The Devil Wears Prada (Widescreen Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B001UV4XGU Sunshine Cleaning]].

B0039TD7PY|3.0|I am a big fan of James Taylor. Bought all the albums up until One Man Band and the covers deal. I've seen him live, and I think he's great live -- with his usual backing band. I would rather see new material. October Road was pretty good. James should push himself to write more. I have several Carole King albums as well, and it's fair to say I love much of her early solo work. Together, there is obvious mutual respect, admiration, and friendship between them.     James and Carole are both in good voice, Carole even better than I've heard her lately. For one reason or another I wasn't excited by these performances. Kootch sounded a bit rusty to me. Not bad, but like he was still getting re-acquainted with the songs and hadn't found the exact groove yet. Sklar was solid, and Kunkel solid as always. The band was together but not Steely Dan tight, if you know what I mean. I wonder if the performances might not have had more zip if they'd been done at the end of the tour when they'd played together a lot more.     So the verdict is pretty good but not great, unless you are grading purely on feeling. If you want the warm feeling of old friends and mutual admirers getting together and playing again in a relatively intimate setting, you'll get spades of that. If you're looking for something that really adds a new angle or a newfound power to these old songs, I don't think you'll feel that way about it. It's a nostalgia trip. And there's nothing wrong with that. I doubt I am going to watch this more than once, though.
B003E48AYC|3.0|I don't know what to say except that the movie was just okay. Nothing that blew my mind even thought the graphics and picture was beautiful. The story lacked depth that it ended just plain weak. I expected more from Tim Burton after watching Sweeny Tod. I had a lot of problems a couple of parts were just plain on awkard that I didn't understand why they were in the movie. Johnny depth and Alice dancing I don't have anywords to describe but ridculus it just made the story line even more dumb. I use the word loosley because whe all knew who was going to win towards the of the story. I was actually suprised that Johnny Depp didn't have as big of a role in the movie the red queen dominated it with \\"off with his head\\" it was funny at first but throughout the movie it became annoying. I found myself yawning throughtout the movie. I mean I had a couple of chuckles now and again but not enought for me to actually like it more. I just wish the story line was better it could have been a good movie.

B003BZXI6E|5.0|Given her inarguably legendary status and all the celebrities in attendance, Barbra Streisand can never really go home again, but that didn't stop me from being thoroughly entranced by this burnished record of her intimate performance at the Village Vanguard from last September. In the famous Greenwich Village jazz club that actually turned her down for a singing job nearly a half-century prior, she appears more relaxed than ever with her mellifluous voice intact. Directed quite unobtrusively by Scott Lochmus, the one-night event was timed with the release of her last album, her 63rd, [[ASIN:B002DYJAIO Love is the Answer]], a stunning studio-polished return to form  filled with jazz standards and show ballads.<br /><br />Backed only by a sharp yet accommodating four-piece band, the 67-year-old songstress still displays the melisma and dramatic conviction in a singular voice that remains barely diminished after all these years. Granted her high notes are gone, but her phrasing and interpretative skills remain unparalleled in her leisurely paced ninety-minute set. Selections from \\"Love Is the Answer\\" dominate the program, but freed from the disc's immaculate production values, Streisand's vocals feel much more alive and dynamic in the capture of her live performance here. She vividly expresses wistful regret in \\"Spring Can Really Hang You Up the Most\\" and answers the gentle wake-up call of the Sinatra chestnut, \\"In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning\\".<br /><br />The gentle bossa nova sway to \\"Gentle Rain\\" remains intoxicating, while the signature cleverness of Betty Comden and Adolph Green informs the heartfelt words of Jules Styne's yearning \\"Make Someone Happy\\". The lyricists' handiwork is also present in a lovely version of Leonard Bernstein's \\"Some Other Time\\" from \\"On the Town\\", a song Streisand admits to forgetting to sing at the end of her set. The singer's good friends, Alan and Marilyn Bergman, also in the audience, provide the sad-eyed break-up lyrics to Johnny Mandel's \\"Where Do You Start?\\" which the singer handles with dramatic aplomb. Streisand seamlessly adds a trio of Richard Rodgers classics from her recording youth to the program - the plaintive \\"Nobody's Heart\\" (which she apparently sang to Marlon Brando over the phone), the familiar \\"My Funny Valentine\\", and the love-besotted \\"Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered\\".<br /><br />Same as in her album, two of her more impressive performances are distinctly Gallic in flavor with melodramatic flourishes - the bittersweet opener, Artie Butler's \\"Here's to Life\\" and Jacques Brel's masochistic \\"Ne me quitte pas\\" which was later popularly translated by Rod McKuen into \\"If You Go Away\\". Unsurprisingly, Streisand inserts two of her signature songs, the self-penned \\"Evergreen\\" in tribute to Bill Clinton who is in the audience, and \\"The Way We Were\\", which causes Sarah Jessica Parker to wipe away a tear. A heavy sense of nostalgia permeates the program with a series of introductions provided by old colleagues, including Lorraine Gordon, who inherited the Village Vanguard after her husband died in 1989. She is the centerpiece of a featurette spotlighting the club's history. The quality of the high-definition video on the Blu-Ray edition is outstanding with Roger Grange's camerawork quite flattering to Streisand.here Do You Start?\\" which the singer handles with dramatic aplomb.

0307276902|1.0|I was disappointed in the book A Million Little Pieces. Once I found out that the book was a lie I wasn't really in the mood to read it. I found out about this after purchasing the book but before I started reading it. Trying to read the book, knowing that a lot of it was false was really hard. I just couldn't get \\"into it\\". I kept wondering, \\"oh, did he lie about this? Or is this true?\\" It just really bummed me out. I couldn't even continue reading after the first 150 pages of the book. It still currently sits on my shelf in my dorm room and I will probably never pick it up again, except for when I move out. The sad part is that it probably would have been a magnificent book if he would have made it a fiction book or \\"based on a true story\\". I guess it's a disappointment not only me but others, that someone would call this book an autobiography. I also feel bad for Oprah and how he and the book got famous at first because of her having him on the show. This book made Oprah's book club and after it came out that he lied, it just turned into a frenzy.  I would recommend reading this book if and only if you can handle the fact that it's not all truthful. I almost feel like James Frey was making fun of drug and alcohol addicts. People really do need rehab and what's the point of fabricating stories about it? This book would make people not want to attend rehab and that disgusts me. I wish that James would have told his real story and I'm sure it would've have gotten just as much recognition, but this time it would be good recognition.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|This cooler is very good for the budget minded folks who want a different cooling solution other than stock for their cpus.  I put this on my mobo in about 10 mins, taking my time and just paying attention.  Once I finished, I'm more than positive I could do it again in much less time.  I went from ~28 idle to ~19, I haven't given it a good test on Prime 95 yet but I'll definitely be doing it soon.  I played a little BFBC2 with it installed last night and temps never got passed 50C so I'm sure it's doing it's job.    Pros:  Comes with everything you need to install onto your mobo and an extra set of clips for an optional fan for push-pull config.  Seems to be very well built and not the push-pin style that came stock with my i5 750. It also comes with some thermal grease, but I'm kinda old school and used AS5.  Not sure how well the stock stuff is.  Cost is absolutely worth it.  Got it for $28 shipped.  Not too bad considering I almost sprung $30 for a cheaper, push pin styled cooler just so I could have it sooner.  I'm glad I waited a few extra days.    Cons:  Only thing I could think of is how massive this thing is.  It's huge sitting in my Antec 300 case.  Definitely take some measurements if you've got large components in a small case.  I wouldn't recommend it in micros but if it measures and fits more power to you.  I'd also definitely watch a video on how to install it to familiarize yourself.

So, you cheap asses can't bitch about paying for the extra disc. You virtually get that for free!    The levels are obviously brought up and everything sounds a bit cleaner and even. I felt they did a really good job with the packaging considering the price of the double CD set. If you already have it on CD or vinyl. It's definitely worth it to pick this up for the bonus disc alone. I feel you'll enjoy the reissue of the original album as well.

0307271862|2.0|Strong start.  Weak middle.  Beyond-improbable, unsatisfying finish.<br /><br />There are several major themes embedded in \\"The Man From Beijing.\\"  One is that Swedish district court judge Birgitta Roslin tries to convince investigator Vivi Sundberg that there might be a connection to China in the case of a horrific mass murder in a Swedish hamlet of Hesjovallen.  Birgitta is also investigating for personal reasons, because she has a family connection among the victims. There are several major improbabilities early on--such as the idea that the crime scene would be so loosely guarded that Birgitta could break into one of the houses where the crimes were committed and walk out with one of the victim's diaries--but I forgave this moment because the rest of the opening section was so well drawn.  I was ready for tension. The opening few sections are captivating, although I kept thinking we would go back to Vivi's point of view (never happened).<br /><br />Then events shifted to a much more global theme. I felt like I had entered a Nelson DeMille story--which can be a good thing. Mankell first takes us back to the fate of two poor Chinese peasants who make their way around the world in the mid-19th century, including some colorful and interesting scenes around railroad construction in the Western United States.  But to what end?  It's a long way to go to motivate one character for the events that follow. When the action switches to China, Mankell lost me.  Mankell gives Birgitta a good reason to be from away work and then, remarkably, she and a long-time friend (who were once fixated on Chinese politics) wind up together in China.  From this point forward, events never gelled. The over-the-top coincidences in China didn't help.  The fact that Birgitta didn't tell her friend about being attacked felt completely unnatural.  Birgitta doesn't tell her husband much, either, even though she claims to be trying to revive the relationship.  She's hard to root for.<br /><br />By the time we return to the central issue of who attacked a whole village and left so many bodies behind, the tension has evaporated and \\"The Man From Beijing\\" ends with a fizzle.the time we return to the central issue of who attacked a whole village and left so many bodies behind, the tension has evaporated and \\"The Man From Beijing\\" ends with a fizzle.

As time goes on Andrew has the desire for freedom. \\"Sir\\" gives him his freedom, and Andrew goes off on his own with the goal to become a ordinary man.    \\"Bicentennial Man\\" is a great film. It is very entertaining and has a great plot-line. The acting by Robin Williams is fantastic.  Anyone and everyone will enjoy this film.
B00009RAJH|3.0|I'm embarrassed to admit that I used to like this album.... when I was about 15.  True, there are some catchy hooks in a number of the songs and Landslide has always been a favorite, but c'mon.  The lyrics could've been written by an 8 year old.      Monday Morning:  \\"Monday morning you sure look fine. Friday I've got travelling on my mind... first you love me and then you get on down the line...\\"    Crystal:  \\"Do you always trust your first, initial feeling....\\"    Warm Ways:  \\"Sleep, easy by my side.  Into, gentle slumber you can hide.\\"    Rhiannon is just plain dumb from beginning to end.    Who writes crap like this?    Sorry folks.  It stinks.
1401323820|4.0|This book was well written. Whoever is ghosting for Richard Castle nailed the characters. (I suspect that name(s) of the real author(s) will be found in the list of people in the dedication. I noticed the names of the actors in there.)    The mystery was intriguing. The whole investigation reminds me of the classic mystery books (Agatha Christie, Dorothy Sayer, Ellery Queen, the Lockridges...) that I read way back when.    I also got a laugh out of the reference to the Simpsons TV show.    I'm disappointed that Rook's daughter didn't make an appearance. The family moments are one of the things that make Castle a more sympathetic character.    I also wish that ABC would put out Castle books rather than Nikki Heat books. The Nikki Heat books are a lot of fun, but I like the TV characters better.

B00288KNJU|1.0|So I bought this a little over a month ago for the first time. I have seen the movie and I like the movie. But when I opened the package it did not have the cover that slips around the blue-ray case. It's not that big of a deal right. I returned it and requested a new one specifically telling both of the customer support people I talked to that it was missing the case and the new one I received did not have the cover either.
B0035G5IOE|5.0|This type of film might not be for all everyone,only for those with a great sense of humor. My family absolutely fell in love with this movie the first time we saw it. The art is amazing, just watching it makes you laugh. The movement of the fur is so real and you realize how silly it is to have animals talk and all. Really a great moviw. We got the DVD,BLURAY,D.C set so we can enjoy this movie forever. We mighthave watched it a million and 5 times. And the songs are so catchy. My 3 year adopted Kyle's \\"trademark\\".GREAT GREAT.
B00013RC8O|5.0|I thought it was a pretty good movie as well as a pretty good bargain at $8.99.<br /><br />I think you would like it if you like those 70's movies...Especially those with a counterculture theme to it.

1878424505|5.0|Wonderfully insightful book by Don Miguel Ruiz.  This is the first book I've read from Don. If only everyone could be aware that there is a Master and a Victim in their thoughts.  Then we can all be empowered to do our best in every situation.   Two vital themes I will take with me is to learn to stop making assumptions and to not take the hurtful words people say too personally.  Also, sometimes I forget how powerful words are-not just the words I speak to others, but to myself.  Don talks about how words are like magic, which can come from \\"black magic\\" or \\"white magic.\\" This is similar to the Bible, with the belief that \\"death and life are in the power of the tongue (Proverbs 18:21. KJV.) I choose white magic, to uplift, love, and encourage others as well as myself.  I will not succeed all the time, but I will do my best (fourth agreement).  Don also teaches that even if we fail at doing our best, to not fall victim to beating ourselves up over and over about it, but to live in the present and forget the past and to once again...do our best!
0739370642|4.0|I had a little difficulty with identifying the different Swedish names in the CD audiobook and the plot was a little slow to build.  But once it took off, this audiobook had me hooked.  I liked and was interested in Salandar, but the male lead,less so.  He seemed rather shallow of a man aside from his intense desire to solve a mystery and exact revenge on his gangster.  And it disappointed me that he and Salandar end up in bed together and so forth. Gross. Actually all of the sex involving the male lead was rather unpleasant to envision. But the storyline held my attention and I enjoyed the twists at the end. I will definitely read or listen to the next two.
044661758X|5.0|The third in the Harry Bosch series is one of the best of the entire thirteen currently available (yes, I've read them all). This entry has everything. Hard boiled Harry is the defendant in a civil trial, the plaintiff the widow of a suspected serial killer, \\"The Dollmaker\\", whom Harry shot to death four years ago.  The plaintiff's attorney is a star, Honey \\"Money\\" Chandler, whose trial record is legendary and who is characterizing Harry as a coldblooded rogue cop. Harry is stuck with the unimaginative LA hack provided by the city. Just as the trial begins, a note appears in the police station taunting him with the claim that The Dollmaker is alive and well, and to prove it, provides directions to the grave of one of his victims.<br /><br />The harrowing trial itself, along with Harry's attempts to discover the truth - did he shoot the wrong man? - form the plot of this novel, which is tautly organized and full of mis-steps and surprises. Harry's colleagues come under suspicion, and it's likely that someone within the department is acting as a snitch. One of the most suspenseful sequences in the book is the account of an illegal search that he conducts in a suspect's home. Another is the lengthy passage when he fears that his lady friend, whom he is coming to love, has been targeted by the psycho. The outcomes of both trial and investigation are truly unforeseen.<br /><br />Michael Connelly is a master of the genre, and The Concrete Blonde shows what he can do. Highly recommended.

B001PJRAUS|5.0|If you are an Austen fan this is a delightful contemporay take on her \\"Pride and Prejudice\\".  Watched it on TV and just \\"had to have it\\".

B002N57KG2|1.0|After the stunt-filled escapism of &#34;Hooper,&#34; Burt Reynolds and director Hal Needham shift into low gear with a sloppy road-race flick in which no one cares who wins. &#34;The Cannonball Run&#34; was made in a fit of indifference - squandering its eclectic all-star cast (everyone from Dean and Sammy to Farrah and Bianca) and miles of film stock. Not surprisingly, the closing outtakes upstage the entire movie. Encouraged by the upbeat audience reception, Burt and Company would reunite for an appallingly amateurish 1984 sequel. Crash and burn, indeed.

B0035J6TAI|1.0|Man, this is awful stuff. I have no idea what the unusually talented Gabriel was thinking. But, this is one tough listen. If it was his intention to put his personal stamp on the works of artists he has admired, then, at that level, I suppose he has succeeded. There can be no confusing his version with the original. However, his take is invariably dour and enervating, while adding nothing and subtracting much from the power of the original recordings. One, for example, is Paul Simon's astonishing \\"Graceland\\" opener \\"The Boy in the Bubble\\". The song, while tinged with irony, and even, perhaps, anger, at the distressing paradoxes of late 20th century life, nonetheless pulsates with energy and an undeniable beauty. The music contrasts the inherent sadness of the message, but never wallows in it. Gabriel's funereal approach not only destroys this contrast, but pretty much loses the melodic content as well. One could go on song by song, but why bother? Gabriel's covers are consistently monolithic and monolithically consistent. Let's hope that he never again feels impelled to approach the material of others. Unless he's hit a dry spell in his own creativity, he has no need to do so.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I didn't get a chance to see the movie in theatres, but even without the 3D effects, the most gorgeous and realistic CGI world ever in a movie is enough to blow me away.<br />This is the new era of moviemaking - the first movie to truly fool my eyes to make me believe the CGI looked truly real and a part of the movie \\"world\\" was the first \\"Transformers,\\" and although there are some CGI aspects in this movie that could be improved, the setting as a whole and the world of Pandora is so beautiful that it truly deserves to be called its own true location.<br />The storyline is cliche, but hey, that's to be expected of a Hollywood action blockbuster.<br />If you buy this Blu ray, it's because you want to be immersed in the world of Pandora.<br />Probably one of the best top 5 movies ever to watch while under the influence.
B0039OGGVQ|5.0|This album definitely proves Slash still knows how to rock.  If you are a fan of VR and you thought those 2 albums were good, 'Slash' puts them to shame.  I don't think I have ever found a record where I liked every song on it.  Until I listened to this one.  Even the bonus tracks found on the other versions are awesome.  The fact that there are a number of different artists on this album make it so much better than a normal record.  Styles ranging from Levine's Gotten to M. Shadows' Nothing to Say provide a unique contrast of styles on the same CD.  Something to note about those two particular singers, I was never interested in them until I heard them perform on this album, they are excellent.  The entire record is amazing and well worth the wait since I first heard about it in Slash's autobiography.  I can't get enough of 'Slash', and Slash for that matter :D

B00005YU1O|4.0|Not bad - an entertaining little animated flick on philosphy, metaphysics, objective human perception. if you liked 'what the bleep do we know?\\" you'll probably like this movie. it's only about 85 min long, but the animated main characters encounters various people throughout his day and hears their perspectives on life (philosophers, an evolutionary biologist, young intellectuals etc.). the voices are from real interviews it sounds like and they're just placed in the movie to fit the flow...a unique movie that's worth watching. 4.2 stars. written review from a 34 yr old atheist.

B003BZXHX8|4.0|Moments of the old Streisand magic--when the whole world gasps silently at her every phrase--but a bit too chatty for a DVD and the CD makes these interludes even more annoying.  I'm sure if you were there, these distractions might have been part of the evening, but unfortunately they do not transfer well to recording.  While the voice is croaky at times, at others she is simply breathtaking.  Inconsistent, but worth it for her legion of fans.
0684824906|5.0|Team of Rivals is a classic history book. It is well written and illustrates an important time in our contry's history.
B00005RYKU|3.0|Typical and predictable, this is one of those films that is surely entertaining and an unintentionally campy kind of way.  The film, while starting off rather strong, dissolves into ridiculousness, but for some strange reason it never really loses what it initially set out to attain; our attention.<br /><br />When their parents die in a freak car accident, Ruby and her younger brother find themselves in a gigantic (albeit creepy) house with their new guardians.  While they are on the outset charming and generous, Ruby's new family soon becomes anything but.  As the film progresses, Ruby begins to uncover dark secrets and suspicious about her parent's death and the true intentions of her new `daddy'.<br /><br />This film came out right about the time that Leelee Sobieski was becoming famous; you know, that two-year period when she was in movies.  I'm saddened that her career didn't go anywhere.  She had talent.  She had looks.  She had appeal.  I can't explain her disappearance, for it doesn't really make sense (but then again, there are a number of starlets who all but disappeared for no reason).  As a vehicle to show off her rise to fame, this one works well.  She definitely works the camera and knows how to address the melancholy side of the story without overdoing it.<br /><br />For me though, this film rests on Stellan Skarsgard's performance.<br /><br />Without a keen eye and an understanding delivery, this performance could have tanked this entire film.  Instead, Stellan breathes a life into his character that is every ounce of what it should be.  Yes, in the end he kind of veers off into absurdity along with the script (why did they do that) but he maintains a level of honest eeriness that keeps his character chilling, not comical.<br /><br />This is far from a great movie, but it is far from a waste of time.  It's eerie and entertaining and engrossing, and sometimes that is all you need.
0393072231|5.0|This is a book, which explains what \\"a credit default swap on a double-A tranche of a subprime-backed collaterized debit obligation\\" really is in a way that you can not only understand (really, no kidding!), but you can actually enjoy. It explains how they (investment banks, hedge funds) got the rest of us into this mess, how incredibly stupid they all were and how, in spite of that, they still made tons of money. You will enjoy portraits of few people who actually saw it coming early on, managed to bet that the house of cards (i.e. subprime mortgage backed bonds) would eventually collapse and also made money.   It reads better then any thriller.   Most importantly, you will also learn why the current attempts at regulations are so inadequately insufficient so that the next time this happens (and it will), you may get out sooner.
1401211909|5.0|Neil Gaiman has hit one out of the park, or pitch, if you prefer.<br />His 'Fairy Tale for Grownups' has action, intrigue, magic and sex in one fast paced, superbly illustrated package.

B002VECM6S|5.0|Great movie.  Was shipped to me in a good tight package so it wouldn't be damaged.  I will order more movies from Amazon.
B000002I55|5.0|I've owned this cd for five years and have listened to it numerous times.  But on the way to work in the car this morning, I finally 'got' it.      I have always found aspects of Free Jazz to enjoy, but as an entire work it has never had a real emotional impact on me until today.  Part of that was letting go of all my preconceived notions of what it will be like and just listening to what it is.  Unfortunately I do not have the musical vocabulary to describe exactly what that is in any great detail.  What I can say is I simply imagined the eight musicians on the album, four on one side of a room, four on the other, relaxing and playing music and enjoying themselves.  They complement each other, inspire each other, compete against each other, and support each other through a nearly half-hour session.  While listening I pictured them live in the studio and let my imagination create an image of the players as they played.  This gave a more human element to the sounds I was hearing and the music came alive to me for the first time ever, and I can't wait to listen to it again after work.    This being said, Free Jazz is not and probably will never be a recording enjoyed by the masses.  If you have an interest in art that takes time (years in my case) to understand, or an interest in the abnormal, I recommend giving this a try.  Free Jazz is an album that will yield increased enjoyment over time, and I can promise you will notice hundreds of differences and nuances each time you listen to it.  If my example is any indication, it will be a work of art that will continue to grow on you for a lifetime.      If you listen to and like Free Jazz, I also recommend Ascension by John Coltrane, Bitches Brew by Miles Davis, and Compulsion by Andrew Hill.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I read this book out loud to my husband in the car while driving through the Grand Canyon. It starts out a little slow but builds into a compelling and well written story. What could be more frightening for an upper class, educated blonde woman than going to prison after making a stupid mistake ten years before; dropping off a suitcase of cash in Belgium?.<br /><br />I would like to have had more charachter development with her lover, who gets her into this mess.<br /><br />All in all, the book was insightful with just the right amount of tenderness, sensitivity, frustration and finally self actualization. I would like to see a follow up book about her cellies, like yoga Julie, Pop, etc.<br /><br />As a mental health professional, I wish the author well and hope she is able to reframe the more traumatic experiences to a context that heals her, not retraumatizes her. She might consider a level 2 EMDR therapist to assist her with this necessary next step in her recovery.
B000OLGCI4|4.0|Jungle Book is a classic movie that every child should have a chance to watch at least once. This DVD of it insures that I'll be able to watch it myself over and over and perhaps save it for my family.
037571457X|5.0|I was amazed by the power of this graphic novel. I finished it within one afternoon; I was completely hooked after the first page. The style of the illustrations and the storyline surrounding major historical events happening to one family unit reminded me a lot of Art Spiegelman's \\"Maus I\\" and \\"Maus II\\" (also excellent and powerful reads). But this novel has its own message and voice, that are clear and eye-opening. I loved how the author, Marjane Satrapi, presented a view of Iran's Islamic Revolution through the eyes of a young girl, and ably painted a picture of how the girl's perspective changes as she ages and her ideals and feelings shift and grow. The seemingly simple (and beautiful) black and white illustrations convey the story with much more feeling and power than words alone ever could. Though it is gritty and grim at some points, I would absolutely recommend this book for older teens and adults who would like to understand a child's experience of the turmoil in Iranian society during the 1980s.

B000069KGM|5.0|It may be hard to believe today, but Chicago was once on the cutting edge of rock. Its first album, CTA, is a classic that was deservedly chosen by critic Tom Moon as one of the 1000 recordings to hear before you die. Their other albums, up until Chicago 9 (their greatest hits), feature plenty of material to make the case that Chicago should be enshrined in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. As for particular albums, Chicago II and III are nearly as good as this debut.     Each of their first three albums demonstrate that Robert Lamm, and especially James Pankow deserve to be considered among the finest songwriters of the late 1960s and early 1970s; Pankow's (I've Been) Searchin' So Long from Chicago VII is a dramatic moody and soaring ballad with teeth that is arguably his best song, which is to say perhaps Chicago's finest moment. And Terry Kath was nearly their equal, although his material tended to be more abstract and at times meandered.     What's interesting about early Chicago, starting with Chicago II, is that Peter Cetera emerged as a strong songwriter (he had already shown his singing chops to good effect). Unfortunately, Cetera ultimately proved to be Chicago's undoing as his material, which became increasingly syrupy due to the band's unwillingness to check him, was given greater prominence in later albums. So while the hits piled up, Chicago's reputation as rock's best experimental ensemble plummeted. When Cetera departed Chicago, the damage had been done, although the remaining band members deserve blame for continuing in this vein. One can hope there'll someday be a reassessment of their entire output that will lead people to truly appreciate how Chicago expanded the boundaries of rock music in the early part of their career.     In the meantime, their debut is highly recommended as one of the landmark recordings in rock music, while Chicago II and III deserve nearly as much praise (and keep in mind, all three recordings were double-albums in the day, which means they recorded six albums worth of music in about three years. That in itself is an astonishing feat).
B0021L8V1Q|4.0|The first Iron Man was and still is a very strong comic book film. It would have been the best of 2008 by far if not for a little movie called The Dark Knight. Now, a couple of years later we have the two leads back with a number of new big name additions, and some impressive CGI as expected.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. continues to shine as Tony Stark, with an ego the size of the planet, and Gwyneth Paltrow still has great chemistry with him. Add to the mix a neat villain, Whiplash, played by the always excellent Mickey Rourke, the lovely Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, Don Cheadle as Rhodey/War Machine, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, and Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer. You won't find a film in this genre with a cast list this strong. Even though it felt like Samuel L. Jackson and Scarlett Johannson were stuck in here just for a reference towards The Avengers movie of the future, it worked for me, especially Scarlett's fight scene towards the end. Don Cheadle was a great choice for replacing Terrence Howard. I'm still not sure why they got rid of him, but I didn't miss his feminine voice one bit. For me, as great as Robert Downey is in this role, both villains stole the show. The brilliant choice to underplay the part worked wonders for Mickey Rourke. His muscular body, covered head to toe in tattoos, along with his multi-colored hair, gold teeth, Russian accent, toothpick, and complete with a parrot on his shoulder, made him one of the most interesting characters for appearances alone. He could have gone way overboard with this character, but he keeps his cool and is even more believable for it. Sam Rockwell has always been an actor that may not have name recognition to everyone, but from the time I first saw him in The Green Mile until last years Moon, he turns in one solid performance after the next. He is like a darker version of Tony Stark, complete with a large personality and more than his share of funny lines.<br /><br />I have only a few gripes. I didn't care for the pacing. It seemed much longer than two hours and I typically have no problem watching long movies. Compared to the first Iron Man, some scenes were closing in on boring, but thankfully what works here, works really well. The dialogue was pretty strong and often very funny, but the script as a whole could have been thought out a little better. There is almost too much going on and too many people to fit into one story. Like the previous film, there is also a lack of action. The story always comes first, but this sequel could have let loose a whole lot more. When it does, you get some real good stuff, like the scene with Whiplash slicing up the race cars.<br /><br />As far as sequels go, Iron Man 2 is better than most, but it's not everything it could have been, or what most people were hoping for.

1591843162|3.0|Linchpin is one of those career self-help books that are popular airplane reads. I was ready to give it a terrible review, but then I spent an hour skimming it. During that abbreviated read, I ran across a simplified view of the modern workplace and how it differs from a naive and inaccurate view of the workplace of yesteryear, a few run-of-the-mill inspirational stories including one about Richard Branson that's memorable, and some ambiguous descriptive advice about how to stand out in your career. For those of you without an hour, you can literally (no, not figuratively) get the complete message of the book by reading the table of contents. Unfortunately there's no \\"look inside\\" through Amazon or Google Books, so you'll need to make an effort to get that far.     As repetitive, generic, unstructured, uninformative, and absurd as the book may be, I still gave it three stars because I ran across a couple sentences that led to some minor insights. I even wrote them down. They probably wouldn't work for you, but others might. So, consider my experience as an existence proof that reading the book isn't a complete waste of time for everyone.     As a side note, the blurbs on the back cover are rather generic, but one of them may be my favorite of all time. Jacqueline Novogratz offers simply, \\"This book is a gift.\\" I can just imagine her dinner conversations. \\"This food is nourishment. This fork is a tool.\\" Riveting.
0812973992|3.0|I read the news ...oh boy...and basically on some levels, this is a compulsively good read.(I give it 3.5 stars for its juicy prose).     I enjoyed the interconnectedness of these disparate characters on a summer day circa 1974 in NYC. Actually, on the very day the Frenchman, Phillip Petit  tight-roped between the twin towers. So it's a nice idea. There's much to like in the style of the writing--it is bursting with life and bon mots. But to me, great writing does not necessarily mean the story is there. That's -to me--the downside of this work. It's worth a read, though, in the sense that the concept is strong and there are sections and characters that are well-portrayed. It's the overall narrative I had a problem with.      There are other novels out there that are so effective because they contain a driving narrative that resonates with readers.  The writing itself may not be exactly flourishing and florid as it is here, but the overall story is. Right to the very end.   In McCann's work here, I did not get that satisfactory overall arc that I needed to make this effort work--as a complete story. I wish writers (especially the prize-winning, \\"literary\\" ones) would learn this one.
B001FBJULI|4.0|I am not going to comment on the music itself. This is a really solid, solid album. I just want to warn potential buyers out there that mismastered copies are still out and about. I just purchased this 2 disk deluxe not from Amazon.com but through one of the amazon sellers deepdiscountdvd. And I got the one with the slight sonic snafu's on the second disc. I personally don't care that much....but sheesh the corrected version has been out now for ohhh what a good 10 months? I am guessing Rhino didn't issue a recall on these. I can put up with vinyl scratching sounds I suppose. I really enjoy these deluxe editions. If only they would do the same with SKINNY PUPPY then I would be in heaven.
B0039SFKSW|1.0|Unfortunately I was highly disappointed with this cd. This is not Asia. Ok, it is, I mean the original members are there but what happened to the Asia music? At best, this is a solo John Wetton release. It's a pop lover's cd. The lyrics could have been written by a teenager. This release lacks progressive elements and any decent hard edge guitar. I mean c'mon... songs like Emily on an Asia cd?  Now don't get me wrong pleae. I grew up on John wetton. I wore out Asia cassettes. But I was 20 years old then. I freaked when Wetton left, but John Payne was an excellent successor. The songs with Downes were strong both musically and lyrically. In short, they were adult-oriented. Aqua, Aria, and Arena are examples.    It's too bad. we are definitely missing some strong Payne-Downes songs. Unless the current lineup can put a stronger rock edge in the songs, im through with my once favorite band.
B002ZG997M|5.0|No matter what your religious views this is a movie that is a tribute to the human spirit when one rises above themselves and believes in a power greater than their own ego.  Let's not be coy, that is the belief in almighty GOD and the insurmountable odds that can be overcome through this faith.  If youre offended by it's religious overtones then don't watch it and miss out.
B00005JKHP|4.0|I liked tis version done over in 2000 with added scenes and remastered images, i.e. Vejur External scenery. Allso sound and audio remastered as well.  I  am very pleased with this DVD and I owned this movie on VHS, I can see and hear the enhancements.
B0038KHTI0|2.0|Believe me, I am not the guy that is a \\"stick to the band's first few monumental albums\\" type of person. But after saying that, I seriously just don't get these albums and what he's doing. It's kind of like the emperor having no clothing, because for example, the bombastic choruses are not really bombastic choruses; they are just only kind of sort of, etc. And I guess to make this short, maybe that's what I'm going after. I just in my opinion feel that these 2 releases are halfway versions of the talent I KNOW Tobias has. I KNOW he can do better than this.     But anyways, if you like it, that is fine and I'm happy for all of you to enjoy something maybe I cannot. Again, just trying to give some friendly but truthful input on the albums. In my opinion this deserved a 2 stars. I would rarely give something a 5 star or even a 4. So I think yeah, this deserves a 2.       Don't let what I write offend you because as I put with a previous Edguy album review, I still really do love Tobias's works and will continue to buy what he puts out and see his concerts.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|The movie is very good... on Blue-Ray it is great!  The transfer of most digital movies to Blue-ray really makes my expensive home theater system shine!  Nothing upsets me more than spending the extra cash on a Blue-ray version of a movie and then discovering it is the same quality of the basic DVD release  (for those that bought the last Indiana Jones movie should understand!).   I have encountered quite a few BR movies which are not that well transferred, but this movie has excellant visual and audio qualities.  A highly recomended Blue-ray purchase.
B002QEXT4W|4.0|Great packaging and remastering makes purchasing the Salvo edition essential over all previous versions offered on CD. The album kicks off with the footstomping 'Nothing But The Truth' and rarely lets up.     For fans of the more rocking side of Procol Harum, this is a must-have.
B000GKHM2S|1.0|Note that this version is the British or European one.  It won't work on USA dvd players.
B002BSHWUU|4.0|As a Stones fan first, I can't ignore the mastery of the Beatles...this set of remastered Beatles music is classic...any music fan will appreciate this set, which represents one of the most interesting bodies of work of any artist in history (certainly of any artist that lasted less than a decade).<br /><br />However...I don't like the Beatles enough to pay Amazon's \\"discounted\\" $180 price tag, which still seems WAY over the top...so I decided to take my chances with one of the discounted 3rd party sets, and I paid less than $140 for mine.  First off, I'll say that the set I received was not a pirated copy, nor were there any defects in the CDs...the music is great (for the Beatles, my one friendly little dig, lol).  I also enjoy the extensive liner notes and foldout artwork for each album, presented as gatefold CDs...they're not the quality of Japanese gatefold issues, but interesting enough to add extra value to the set.<br /><br />If you're someone who is looking for impeccable packaging, however, buyer beware...you might want to consider the non-3rd party sets, as with these \\"discounted\\" Beatles box sets you might run into minor defects such as the cardboard divider in the interior of the box being ripped, and some scuffing on the interior of the box and on some of the gatefold CDs...that was my experience, which personally didn't bother me, I just wanted to make sure the CDs worked.<br /><br />The mini-docs are a nice addition to add some context and background to the music...however if you want more of that, I'd suggest checking out the Beatles documentary from a few years back.<br /><br />My #1 complaint would be with the meager plastic sleeves the CDs are in to protect them from scuffing inside the gatefold cases.  They're like saran wrap or the plastic your groceries are bagged in at your local market...absolutely weak, and inexcusable for a set at this price.  When I look at this box set, I see what appears to be an effort on the part of the artist/whoever made it to leave a definite Beatles document behind...so why skimp on the plastic protectors?  Don't get it.<br /><br />If you want to protect your Beatles investment, get some real plastic CD protectors at your local record store or order some online (for probably cheaper)...as I start collecting more gatefold CD issues, you can never have a surplus of those plastic sleeves, which are nice to have around.<br /><br />At the end of the day, the music speaks for itself and is the cornerstone of any music collection...and again, this is coming from someone who's more in the Stones camp than in the Beatles camp.atles document behind...so why skimp on the plastic protectors?

B001IAOEXU|5.0|All I can say is that this is a great product and I am thinking about ordering another pair. I played alot of call of duty and my accuracy went up and it is easier to aim especially machine guns and keep it on target.

B003CR9BYE|2.0|This title has long been wanted by fans, yet sadly, this Concord release does not quite live up to that expectation.  My initial thoughts when listening in the car on the way home from the store where I bought the disc was that the disc sounded great and that the mastering sounded pretty good.<br /><br />Later on, at home, with more time and better hardware to critically examine the disc, it became clear that the new disc wasn't all it could be.  Yes, the songs are all there in all their glory; yes, the reverb was toned down from prior releases; but something was not quite right.<br /><br />Digging out the old LPs and CDs of this material, I found the situation getting clearer. One thing that immediately jumped out at me was the narrowing of the stereo on many of the tracks.  To me, the old late '60s style of stereo separation was something to be enjoyed.  Just like on the old Beatles records, certain placements of sounds in the hard right or hard left are simply part of the experience of these tracks.  To now change that to something less removes something from that experience.<br /><br />A good example is on the track \\"Drinking Water (Agua de Beber)\\".  On that track, on both the old LP and CD of SINATRA AND COMPANY, we can hear Antonio Carlos Jobim's vocals in the hard left channel. Here on the new disc, that vocal is now nearly centered, vaguely toward the right of the stereo image.  The other instrumentation on these tracks is also compromised, moving from a hard left or right positioning to nearer the center, basically removing the exciting nature of the old stereo.<br /><br />I can understand *why* this is done - it's a function of the \\"headphone\\" generation.  People all over the world are listening to their music on portable players with headphones, and the fact is that older stereo, with hard left or right panning, becomes a little uncomfortable under those circumstances.  So, the mastering decisions are now made with that audience in mind.  It bothers me that we who are not headphone-bound have to suffer because of those who are.<br /><br />I've since learned from reports on the Internet that some edits to the original material (done to polish up the original recordings) have been missed in this version.  As a result, some \\"wrong notes\\" are leaking through on this edition, like the word \\"day\\" at 1:11 in \\"The Girl From Ipanema\\".  There are a few other examples like that, but this one's probably the worst.<br /><br />The new SINATRA/JOBIM disc may be useful for a lot of people who've never heard the three rarer tracks.  It puts them all in one handy place (albeit with an unfortunately compromised stereo image).d have to suffer because of those who are.

B00005JKNF|5.0|This 2001 release is a typical Robert Altman ensemble film. Atypically it features a number of top British actors in an upstairs/downstairs murder mystery that occurs in a country estate. This is his third from last film. Give it a look. It can be procured from many Amazon vendors for as little as 34 cents.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Got my husband to try this dvd; he was surprised at the good workout. Our 12-year-old daughter doesn't like it when I do this dvd without her. It's nice to do it with someone and push each other to finish. We are still on Level 1 but looking forward to moving on up.
1416550550|3.0|The Forgotten Garden was my book club's \\"read\\" last month, so many of us read it and then discussed it.  Generally, everyone in the club raved about the book...really LOVED it.  I didn't dislike it, but didn't find it to be very intellectually stimulating.  I found it to be a simple, easy read, but a story that didn't really engage me completely.  I didn't feel like I really knew the characters enough to understand why they did the things they did.  However, it kept my attention, had a interesting slew of characters, and would be the kind of book I would refer to as a \\"beach read\\"....

B002HREKCI|3.0|I don't know that I would recommend this story for younger readers. The dual narration is confusing and the topic matter is very serious. So serious that I don't even think that writer gets to the heart of the matter. It's not serious enough. With that being said, read at your own risk. It is an interesting read, and I read it one day.
B00000FCBC|5.0|Garage, Inc. is one of my favorite Metallica albums. These songs just get stuck in my head and I have to hear them. Once I hear them I have to listen to them over and over. No matter what Metallica album you listen to these guys put so much emotion into their music it's incredible. The most amazing thing is that the emotion translates through their music which is something few musicians can do.

Unwilling to let go of his invention, Stark, along with Pepper Potts and James \\"Rhodey\\" Rhodes at his side, must forge new alliances and confront powerful enemies.<br /><br />Downey is actually better than ever in this sequel.  Iron Man 2 knows how to jump the hurdles and have you wanting more. Mickey Rourke is outrageous as a russian killing machine. Iron Man 2 isn't content with one bad guy, there's lots more. Iron Man 2 is very entertaining, But it's the talented Downey who makes Iron Man 2 something to remember.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|After reading a few reviews online just now, I felt I had to weigh in on the discussion taking place.  YES, everyone is right, the current release does not have any extra features or special edition commentary from everyone including the coffee person who worked on set.  But when it's all said and done, I can only think of one question...who cares?  I mean for 20 dollars, you can get both a blu ray AND a regular dvd copy of, in this reviewers opinion, one of the greatest movies ever made.  Period.  I mean who really sits down and watches 8 hours of additional footage showing how they applied makeup and rehearsed each shot?  Speaking for myself and a few others I know, I am THRILLED that the movie was not shipped with all the extras.  I HATE paying an addional 10 dollars for a blu ray with 8 hours of extras that I would never watch in the first place.  I for one want to thank Fox for sending out the movie to stand on it's own and pricing it at an affordable level.  I will most certainly not be paying for an \\"ultimate\\" edition later this year...  If you want to simply see a great movie and add to your collection without breaking the bank, I say buy this one now while you still can.  Because I'm sure once this super-incredible feature packed mega bonus edition comes out, the 20 dollar blu ray/dvd release will be nowhere to be found, and you'll be out an additional 20 bucks for a bunch of extra fluff.  Hope this helps...

B00003CX8Y|3.0|I had been looking forward to seeing the movie again after having just seen the staged version. The DVD arrived earlier than expected. However, the product was defective, which was disappointing (hence, the title of this review). In spite of this, I give high marks to the seller, who issued a prompt refund upon hearing that there was a problem with the DVD. For that reason, I would consider doing business with them again.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|I went to the midnight showing of Iron Man 2 and I left very happy. I will admit that it isn't as good as the first one but that movie was a near pefect super-hero movie. The sequel has a great amount of laughs and some cool little stories. The action is awesome, just wish there was a little more but it was cool that the movie builds the characters more. Definitely looking forward to the 3rd one and as for the build up for the Shield movie...stay til the end of the credits for sure. It will put a smile on your face if you know the characters of Shield. If you liked the first one then you will like this one. Just don't expect it to be better than the first but it is definitely not a dissapointment.

(there are only 2 of us in my home!) the only con i could possibly think of is that i did gain a few pounds trying out the recipes when i first got this book, so use it in moderation! : ) they've made everyone who's tried them unbelievably happy and amazed that they're vegan. great job ladies!

0385732554|5.0|I read the Giver because it was my kids were assigned to read it in school.  I am so happy I did.  While it was written in 1994, it's message that becomes more true by the day.  Sixteen years later we have more people on anti-depressants than ever, as if we can't handle our emotions.  Will we reach a point where we'll do anything to keep from feeling bad?  Trouble is, if we reach that point, we also won't feel anything good.<br /><br />Jonas, the twelve year old hero of the story is shown all the memories that his society has buried in able to bring peace to his world.  He also discovers what happens to the less than perfect children.  Armed with the truth, Jonas can make his own decision about his society and he does.<br /><br />I believe this book is as important as 1984, Brave New World, and any other book that shows us where the road we're currently on is going to take us.  Thank goodness for brilliant authors like Lois Lowry who have the talent, skills and courage to bring these things to our attention.  I hope this book remains on the must-read list for students for many years go come.<br /><br />[...]
0765350386|5.0|Let me start out by saying that I am one very tough reader to please.  Flashing magic and bizarre magical creatures aren't enough to sell me on a fantasy novel.  I think every book should contain a well-developed plot, a believable world, complex and sympathetic characters, bold writing, and a few morals and thought-provoking questions about life.    Mistborn has it all.    As has become his trademark, Sanderson incorporates an ingenious system of magic as an integral part of his story.  This magic, or Allomancy, works when a person gifted with the magic (called Mistborn) ingests various types of metals and \\"burns\\" them to give him or herself different abilities.  The system is controlled by simple rules of action and reaction. Allomancy lends itself very well to high-intensity action scenes.    The story is set in a stark, gloomy, and original world where ash falls from the cloudy sky and swirling mists mysteriously appear each night.  A thousand years have passed since a hero of prophecy was raised up to free the people, but he failed.  Now the serf-like skaa and upper-class nobility are ruled by an evil god-emperor known as the Lord Ruler.  The plot of the first book essentially forms when Kelsier, a powerful Mistborn, devises a scheme to overthrow the Lord Ruler's empire and free the skaa.  However, hints are dropped in this book that there is much more to the story than a simple rebellion against a tyrant.    The main protagonist is a down-trodden street urchin named Vin, who is recruited by Kelsier at the beginning of the book.  I had my doubts as to whether a grown man would be able to write from the perspective of a sixteen-year-old girl, but Sanderson really delivered.  Vin is as believable and sympathetic a character as any I have ever come across.  Her skiddish and slightly paranoid nature, as well as her simple, hidden longing for kindness and acceptance, are results of the abuse she has suffered at the hands of her brother and various other men.  Her development throughout the book is very natural--nothing seems forced or unrealistic.    Okay, to sum up really fast: the other characters are all unique, and make for an entertaining cast in an intriguing plot.  I've heard the book described as a \\"saga of consequences.\\"  The characters are given hard choices and forced to live up to the repercussions. Action and reaction, just like the magic system.  Sanderson also incorporates profound observations about the power of faith and the nature of loyalty and love.  I am difficult to please, but I was instantly hooked when I began Mistborn, and didn't hesitate to finish the series.  I would recommend these books to anyone.  Five stars, two thumbs up, and huge congratulations to Mr. Sanderson on a brilliant novel.

B000002KAG|5.0|Warner Brothers really didn't know what they had gotten themselves into when they signed the Grateful Dead in 1966. RCA had signed the Airplane, the Dead seemed really popular, and Warners didn't want to be left in the dust, so they hastily signed the wierdest group of hipsters, flipsters and tripsters to ever grace their hallowed corporate halls.<br /><br />The band chose Dave Hassinger to produce their debut because he was the engineer on all those great Stones tracks they cut in Hollywood in '65/'66 like \\"Satisfaction,\\" \\"Get Off of My Cloud,\\" etc. Overall, I think he did a decent job of recording them. But capturing the Dead's special brand of magic would prove elusive in the studio, and most Deadheads would agree that the only real Dead was live Dead.<br /><br />Still, there were those studio highlights along the way, and their debut is one of them. It has to be taken on its own terms, though--not unfairly held up to some fondly recalled Dead show decades ago. This was pretty much played live, apparently after the ingestion of a lot of ritalin they had gotten their hands on, which gave the whole thing a speedy, jangly, decidedly un-Deadlike, edge. Except for \\"Viola Lee Blues,\\" as another reviewer noted--that one, to me, captures a brief snippet of the true S.F. jamming spirit. There's a little bit of room for everybody to groove, and the band jells nicely together. A fitting closer to one of '67's overlooked gems.

0143034901|5.0|\\"The Shadow of the Wind\\"  by Carlos Ruiz Zaf&oacute;n<br />Review by Anthony T. Riggio<br /><br />I am sometimes accused of reading too much and perhaps I do, but I came across this book upon a recommendation from a friend, who also reads abundantly.  I ordered it from Amazon and when it arrived I put it down to finish two books ahead of it on my reading list.<br /><br />When I started to read it, I was immediately captured by the exquisite writing style of Zaf&oacute;n in his Gothic tale of The Shadow of the Wind. Even though the book was originally written in Spanish, the translation by Lucia Graves was outstanding and was easily read by an American who only speaks English.<br /><br />Mr. Zaf&oacute;n writes in a style that has been absent for so long in many of the books published today.  The book captures you and draws you in to its complex tale which transcends two generation in Civil War Spain and its aftermath.<br /><br />It is a story of love and identity projections with a memorable cast of character which support this terrific story. Interestingly, it is about books and their devotees.  It is a mature story of love, both romantic and familial, with some violence within relationships and a sinister anti-hero who is extremely violent.  Stephen King described it as \\"one gorgeous read\\" and I could not use a better adjective.  Read this book!  You will not have regrets.

0312427646|5.0|The uncommon reader is the elderly Queen Elizabeth II. While chasing after her corgis, the Queen stumbles upon a bookmobile that regularly stops at Windsor Castle. Other than the librarian, the bookmobile's only occupant is Norman, who works in the Windsor Castle kitchen. Under the tutelage of Norman, the Queen slowly discovers the world of books and the joy of reading. As her enjoyment of reading grows, the Queen's tolerance for state functions decreases, much to the chagrin of her staff. This quick read is recommended for those who just let the dishes pile up as they read one more chapter.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|Now before I say anything about this version of persuasion, I'll acknowledge that there was an earlier version done in 1995 with Ciarán Hinds which I also completely love and is actually a little bit funnier than this version....BUT this version is so beautifully done. Our leading man is gorgeous which of course is a plus and the ending IS SO SATISFYING! The same cannot be said about the ending of the 1995 version; it's weird.     Note, the father is ridiculously cheesy in this movie as if he's acting on stage, but he's not in many scenes so it doesn't take too much away from the movie. :-)     I think anyone who gets this movie will be glad they added it to their collection.
B003JYOEYM|2.0|I wanted SO much to like this. I was so excited to sit down and watch it (even after paying the ridiculous $10 rental fee on Xbox's Zune). I LOVED Dawn and Day of the Dead, liked Land of the Dead and thought Diary of the Dead was...eh...ok. I'm a pretty big Zombie movie fanatic. 2004's Dawn of the Dead Remake by Zack  Snyder is probably at the top of my list, followed very closely by the original Day of the Dead. Shawn of the Dead was fantastic, but in a different way.    I'm not sure what George Romero was thinking here. This movie is just disjointed. It wants to be so many different things, thus detracting from any one theme. The story is really weird, kind of awkward. It's a Zombie movie, but almost as an afterthought. It's almost like Romero wanted to write an entirely different movie but felt obligated to stick to the genre he's known for.     There's this weird Hatfield vs. The McCoys story weaved into the well known end of the world Zombie stuff, but I just kept asking myself what the point was. It's just not interesting. I would much rather have seen a not so unfamiliar story (a band of survivors holes up somewhere to fend of the undead hordes) with more focus on how the characters feel and communicate in response to the zombies and the fact that the world is ending, not some lame, overly complicated back story that no average person can relate to . This approach worked wonderfully in Snyder's DoTD remake, and even in the original Dawn. I mean I really sympathized with those characters, where as in this film I could have cared less and just wanted the weird \\"family feud\\" stuff to be over.     And please, George, just let Zombies be dumb, mindless eating machines. I know you're really into allegory and zombie evolution but stop over-thinking. Zombies are Zombies. That's what makes them scary and why we love 'em. The horse-riding Zombie was just too much. And the ending gave me a stomach  ache.    As far as the production, there are some really disappointing moments. Day of the Dead, which was made 25 years ago looks far more real and gory than this film. I just cannot get used to CG zombie fx. The scene with the zombie heads on the pikes is pathetic. Some of the physical effects look great, but the poorly done shots really take you out of the film. It must have been budgetary. You really get what you pay for. It is shot well, and the music is good. One particular complaint I have (and maybe because I'm a sound designer for TV and Film), is that a lot of the gunshots sound wimpy. Gunshots in films should be loud and jarring, especially during relatively quiet scenes. A lot of the gunshots in this film (and there are a TON) are mixed at conversation volume. WTF?    Overall, very disappointing in my opinion. I'll be interested to see what the consensus turns out to be. I gave it 2 stars because it looks good and is well acted.

0385341008|5.0|At the end of WWII, writer Juliet Ashton has just published a collection of the humorous columns she wrote about London during the war. Now she is at loose ends trying to find her next project. Through a happy accident, a used book with her name in it lands on the Channel Island of Guernsey and into the hands of Dawsey Adams. Through letters to Dawsey and others on Guernsey, Juliet learns about what occupation under the Germans was like and finds the inspiration for her next book.<br /><br />The story is told entirely in letters between Juliet and her many friends and is very charming. Some might feel it is a bit too charming and even sentimental, but anyone willing to enter into the time and place of the book and who enjoys quirky eccentrics will find a satisfying read. The book is reminiscent of Helen Hanff's 84 Charing Cross Road for its depiction of England right after WWII and its discussion of literature through letters from Hanff and the friends she made at a bookshop in England. For another story of the Channel Islands under German occupation, see the British miniseries [[ASIN:B0006Q93F6 Island at War]].
B000784WMW|5.0|The production must have been low budget, and there's practically no music in the scenes to set a tone or mood, and yet the sincerity of the leading actress is so engaging that it makes the entire thing more than wonderful to watch.     I'm not much of a crier and considering I'd seen other versions of this story before it's not like I didn't know what was coming next, and yet I full on cried twice while watching this rendition.    Worth the buy!
0141040378|5.0|I've read four Jane Austen novels in rapid succession, having been rapidly ensnared by Emma (Modern Library Classics), and avidly seeking more of this fabulous writer whose greatness I was amazed to have only just discovered. (The others were Pride And Prejudice, and Persuasion<br />As with all the great classics found on Amazon, many readers have already offered excellent reviews. In these cases, I have felt little need to add my own, unless I feel I have something new to offer. In the case of Sense and Sensibility, I do indeed believe the need to offer my view, to do this book what I believe is better justice! Here's why:<br />Many reviewers (which you may read if you browse other editions here) profess what is apparently the party line on Austen's works-- that while they \\"love this book and give it 5 stars\\", they (feel obliged to) then damn it with faint praise by adding \\"EVEN if it is one of her a. earliest, b. \\"not as poslished\\", c. \\"not as complex\\", or d. \\"not as funny, well-written,... etc. etc.\\"<br />I must take issue!<br />1. Even if any or all of the above are so, (which I could waste many lines on disputing, to no useful purpose), why would any of these attributes of supposed inferiority be relevant to enjoying this book for itself? They themselves belie such relevance by noting their own great pleasure in reading THIS Jane Austen book. If indeed JA is a brilliant master novelist (no contest here), any and all her books is worth reading for its own sake, as each of them, and as no doubt JA herself would hope. The only reason to compare the finer distinctions among them would be to recommend which of her books one should read IF one could only read one or two. Indeed, not a one reviewer would I dare say recommend any such thing! Sense and Sensibility, as does each of the other 3 JAs I've read, has its own unique treasures to yield to the reader, and it is for these that each must be appreciated and each and all read.<br />2. Sense and Sensibility is a great analysis and example of the power of FILIAL love to transform a person for the better, and thereby to enable her to gain happiness. In my view, the interest in placing the two \\"opposing\\" virtues of Sense and Sensibility in each of the two sisters, Elinor and Marianne, is not simply to showcase the benefits and pitfalls the key virtue confers to the holder, but, much more illuminatingly, the value of the love between the two to cause the other to grow into a woman who can have BOTH in proper degree. Indeed, the book's ending will prove this!<br />3. In Sense and Sensibility, there are many themes developed extensively which are not a focus of the three others I read, aside from #2. One is demonstrated in the character and actions of Lucy, initially presented as an almost deceptively minor character. (I wont say more, but this alone is a real gem worth reading the book for.) Another is the evolution of the sisters' regard for a number of important characters in the book. Each of these is developed and explained beautifully--the regard for Willoughby, for Mrs. Jennings, for Captain Brandon, Edward. These changes are effected not only by and within each sister, but by and within several other characters...with most edifying effects for the education not only the protagonists, but for me!<br />4. Finally, Sense and Sensibility features key themes also showcased in the other three books, e.g., the power of real love to change one's character--one's pride and or prejudices for example (in that named book!), or the well-known to all (but beautifully illustrated examples of) wisdom, that how one reacts to love and the obstacles it creates or are created in its way, depends on character, and luck...but the love itself rarely is under one's control! And yet, of course, since each book's treatment of this theme is unique and reveals a host of unique vicissitudes it can involve, S and S and each of the others is well-worth the reward of the unique discoveries it offers the reader.<br />I need say no more, and direct the reader to \\"click\\" all four of the above into his/her cart!der.<br />I need say no more, and direct the reader to \\"click\\" all four of the above into his/her cart!
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|This is a beautiful CD.  Great as a gift for a new mother.  I used music on it to create a movie for my daughter for Mother's Day after the birth of her first son.  There are some very beautiful, tender songs.
B003CR9BYE|5.0|I bought four of these. Two for myself, just in case they go out of print and one deteriorates. I have a vast Sinatra collection. This is one of the top 5 discs. The others being \\"Only the Lonely\\",  \\"Swinging Lovers\\", \\"September of my Years\\" and the \\"Live at the Sands\\" .Being one of the top five of any major artist says a lot. Being in the top five of the greatest singer ever is an eloquent statement indeed.  It is the definitive interpretation of the Jobim sound and the most candle-light dinner elegantly romantic album you will find. Having all these songs in one collection is long long overdue.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|One of the best purchases I've made on Amazon! I won't bother to explain the plot because I'm sure many other's already did, but if you like Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility this movie will be equally as loved!    This movie is unbelievably well done and delicious. Every character is wonderfully casted, and the characters are so well developed by Charles Dickens that you instantly become engrossed in the story and their lives. You will not be able to stop watching and it is HOURS of viewing!
B0001CNRSE|4.0|This movie is the story of a young dancer who always wished to become a dance chereographer. She gets the opportunity of becoming one, however she discovers that it is not as easy and rosy as it sounds. She uses her dance teaching skills for a social purpose, which is to keep kids away from the dangers of the streets.     The movie doesn't really have much plot to tell, however its a nice film on hip hop dancing and music.

B00005N6KG|4.0|The Sony Ultra Lightweight MDR-W08L is much better than the ipod earbuds.  They stay in the ears with only a few adjustments in a 30 minute walk.  The sound is better than average and has met my expectations.  I enjoy listening to music again while walking.
B000EHQTZO|5.0|The quality of this latest restoration is simply amazing, and the movie itself still stands the test of time.  It's too bad they had to lard up the latest version of what could have been a very impressive remake with gratuitous special effects and a misguided attempt to humanize the beast (laughing at his captive's vaudeville routine in his mountain retreat, ice skating in Central Park - whatever where they thinking?).  The original is, in my opinion, still the best KK ever made, and the movie has been well served in this restoration!
0060557818|5.0|This was my first experience with Neil Gaiman.  After listening to an Audio Version of Neverwhere I did some research on Mr. Gaiman and discovered that he is one talented gentleman.  He read the entire book and portrayed all of the characters - that was a real treat.  I could easily visualize many of the described sites, and came close to smelling the \\"London below\\".<br /><br />Young adults will love to get this book and read it with the same enthusiasm that they read Harry Potter.  Gaiman has created another world from London Above to London Below .  This book would make a great gift!
0393072231|4.0|Not the final word on the crisis, and not the most complete exposition of it, but surely the most thrilling.  Lewis applies his patented \\"human drama\\" technique, selecting a few colorful characters to explicate the big issues through their personal stories.      When the collapse occurred, he knew he would write about it, but who would be his subjects?  Not anyone at AIG, or Bear Stearns, or Goldman Sachs. Not even John Paulson, the now-famous money manager who made a killing. Fortunately for us, Lewis had the imagination to call the brilliantly dingy-minded Meredith Whitney at Oppenheimer and ask, \\"Who actually bet the store on collapse?\\"  She supplied him with a short list of small-time players who (omitting Paulson) led him to his cast for this book.      If he wanted \\"colorful\\", he struck it rich.      Steve Eisman:  discontented upper middle class Ivy-League-lawyer-turned-stock-analyst, iron-willed self-contained iconoclast who will tell a CEO to his face that his financials are \\"toilet paper\\", and whose main diversion is reading \\"Spider Man\\" comics.    Vincent Daniel:  lower middle class SUNY graduate; detail-oriented accountant with a dark view of humanity who spent six months reviewing rating agency databases and advised Eisman that the subprime lending market was basically a Ponzi scheme.    Michael Burry:  one-eyed medical school graduate afflicted with Asperger's syndrome who had hopeless people skills but the countervailing trait of obsessive focus; about the only non-lawyer in the world who actually READ the mortgage bond prospectuses and deciphered them, realizing that these AAA-rated things were actually junk.  (The rating mistakes were to believe that geographically diverse mortgages were uncorrelated, so that while a single one was trash, a collective thousand were safe; and that two FICO scores of 550 and 680 were the same as their average, ie, 615 each).    Charles Ledley and Jamie Mai:  rather aimless 20-somethings who started up a $110,000 fundin the proverbial Berkeley garage. Believed that  markets were inefficient because they mis-appraised the probability of out-of-ordinary events. The so-called \\"market\\" for mortgage default instruments, they concluded, underestimated the risk of default.      Lewis's book is yet another testament to the truth that history is made by identifiable PEOPLE, not impersonal forces. It was much cited in the Senate committee hearing where Goldman Sachs's personnel were grilled.    Those impersonal forces.  Almost every participant's self-justification goes like this: \\"it was risk, fate, the market, them-not-us, God, inertia, panic.\\" Don't buy it.     The central justifying principle of capitalism is that \\"value\\" is real.  Markets match the matrix of peoples' collective desires against the matrix of productive capability, and allocate resources accordingly.  Desires change, technology changes, wars happen, politics intervene, so \\"value\\" as measured by price is often in flux.  But these changes all reflect some condition of the real world, and in this sense value remains real, even as prices roil. As an ardent capitalist and free-marketeer, I hold with all of this, as long as the markets themselves are real.      In the collapse of 2008, it was clear that the prices of financial assets had nothing to do with value.  \\"The market\\" was a fiction.    The whole idea of \\"value\\" being lodged in paper and electronic ledgers is already a step removed from reality.  The traders at Goldman Sachs and their ilk never branded a cow, hammered a strut, drilled a tooth, or closed to a jury.  \\"Ah\\", they would have said, \\"but the value of those activities is summed up in these intangibles that we trade\\".  Well, nonsense.     Something was grievously wrong with the system that Goldman and a handful of other firms superintended.  We all know the general outline of the story.  A Mexican strawberry picker with an income of $14,000, Lewis tells us, could get a $724,000 mortgage.  Lots of people wereat fault for that, not least Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, who strong-armed the banks to lend, and effectively guaranteed these trash loans.  Goldman wasn't the culprit there.    But housing bubbles have burst before without the economy-wide catastrophe that happened here.  There was a lot more to the story, and Goldman, et. al., are at the center of that \\"rest of the story.\\"     In essence, mortgages and the houses that secured them were leveraged into a huge inverted pyramid of bonds made up of trash mortgages that collectively were alchemized into AAA ratings, and of \\"thin air\\" bets on these bonds in the form of credit default swaps and collateralized debt obligations that had no objective value in any sense that Adam Smith would recognize.  These \\"thin air\\" instruments created liabilites several times those of the mortagages they were supposedly tied to.  That's why a housing bust busted Wall Street. Goldman et. al. created these things, and manipulated them.  In doing so, they contributed not an iota of \\"value\\" to the American economy.    AIG, Bear Stearns, Lehman, Citigroup, and Merrill all paid the ultimate penalty for their role.  Goldman, by contrast, made a huge amount of money on its short positions against these phantom assets that it helped create--probably more than anyone else.      How?  Lewis tells us: \\"Goldman was in the position of selling bonds to its customers created by its own traders, so they might bet against them.\\"  In that single sentence, he summarizes what later became the basis of SEC's civil fraud claim, and probably the Justice Department's criminal fraud investigation.      He might have added that they succeeded in selling this crap to their customers precisely because of their imposing reputation.  \\"We're Goldman Sachs, and we know this market better than anyone\\" was the implicit--and probably explicit--sales pitch.  Their defense now is that they were merely \\"market makers\\"--robotic matchers of buyers and sellers who owed no duty toanyone.  Meanwhile, they had developed a proprietary trading strategy of betting against these things, and were conniving with the short-side clients in constructing them.  It's equivalent to a lawyer secretly advising the opposition, then claiming that his client had no right to know because \\"he was sophisticated and should have looked out for himself.\\" A disbarment offense by a lawyer, but perfectly fine in Goldman's scheme of ethics.     Whether the government's claims will be sustained in court will depend on very specific and detailed evidence, only fragments of which are now extant.  So we must suspend legal judgment.  But there is almost no one who would maintain that Goldman acted honorably.  There is an odious stench about their dealings, and they deserve the populist opprobrium.     Fascinating vignettes.  Why did AIG issue credit-default-swap liabilities amounting to several times the net worth of the company?  The head of the department was both thick-headed and a bully. How did Moody's rate all that mortgage-backed trash as AAA?  Moody's rater:  \\"That's a very good question.\\"    The crisis was made by people, not fate. Read the book if you doubt that.
B0036EH3TS|4.0|I just re-watched this movie for the first time in many years via the new Blu-Ray release. And, just as I remembered, it's one terrible action movie cliche after another with a preposterous save-the-world plot, dramatic CGI destruction sequences of world landmarks (weird to see the World Trade Towers standing, and undamaged, in the opening moments) and plenty of superfluous stuff that blows up ... It's also really good, blockbuster fun that--I'm a bit ashamed to admit--always makes me cry (the little boy who doesn't know his father kills me every time), even when I KNOW it's shamefully manipulating my emotions.<br /><br />Seriously, I think this might be the best-ever example of a summer, popcorn save-the-world movie. Great, cheesy fun that holds up, even a decade after its release. It walks that line between action, humor and emotional excess perfectly ... Unlike basically everything else director/producer Michael Bay has ever touched. (&lt;cough cough> Transformers ... Ugh!) Sure, Ben Affleck (whom I've actually liked in lots of other things) and Liv Tyler are pretty terrible, but the rest are perfectly cast, including Bruce Willis (this movie reminded me why he really is a movie star), Michael Clarke Duncan, Steve Busemci, Will Patton and even Owen Wilson who, frankly, I'd totally forgotten was in this film. Somehow they manage to deliver dialogue that would induce eye-rolling coming from just about any other actor and make me actually believe the absolutely ridiculous things they are saying.<br /><br />\\"Armageddon\\" is far from a cinematic masterpiece. Heck, it's even far from realistic (or even roughly believable for anyone who's ever passed 4th grade science), but, despite all that, it is really entertaining and, heck, isn't that what movies are all about?
0486415856|4.0|Even the best authors in the world sometimes put out something that... well, isn't up to their usual standards. For Jane Austen, that book was \\"Mansfield Park\\" -- her prose is typically excellent, and she weaves a memorable story about a poor young lady in the middle of a wealthy, dysfunctional family. But put bluntly, Fanny Price lacks the depth and complexity of Austen's other heroines.<br /><br />As a young girl, Fanny Price was sent from her poor family to live with her wealth relatives, the Bertrams, and was raised along with her four cousins Tom, Edmund, Maria and Julia.<br /><br />Despite being regarded only little better than a servant (especially by the fawning, cheap Mrs. Norris), Fanny is pretty happy -- especially since Edmund is kind and supportive of her at all times. But then the charming, fashionable Crawford sibilings arrive in the neighborhood, sparking off some love triangles (particularly between Maria and Henry Crawford, even though she's already engaged.<br /><br />And the whole thing becomes even more confused when Henry becomes intrigued by Fanny's refusal to be charmed by him as the others are. But when she rejects his proposal, she ends up banished from her beloved Mansfield Park... right before a devastating scandal and a perilous illness strikes the Bertram family. Does Fanny still have a chance at love and the family she's always been with?<br /><br />The biggest problem with \\"Mansfield Park\\" is Fanny Price -- even Austen's own mother didn't like her. She's a very flat, virtuously dull heroine for this story; unlike Austen's other heroines she doesn't have much personality growth or a personal flaw to overcome. And despite being the protagonist, Fanny seems more like a spectator on the outskirts of the plot until the second half (when she has a small but pivotal part to play in the story).<br /><br />Fortunately she's the only real flaw in this book. Austen's stately, vivid prose is full of deliciously witty moments (Aunt Norris \\"consoled herself for the loss of her husband by considering that she could do very well without him\\"), some tastefully-handled scandal, and a delicate house-of-romantic-cards that comes crashing down to ruin people's lives (and improve others). And she inserts some pointed commentary on people who care more about society's opinions than on morality.<br /><br />And the other characters in the book are pretty fascinating as well -- especially since Edmund, despite being a virtuous clergyman-in-training, is an intelligent and strong-willed man. The Bertrams are a rather dysfunctional family with a stern patriarch, a fluttery ethereal mother, a playboy heir and a couple of spoiled girls -- Maria in particular develops a crush on Henry, but doesn't bother to break off her engagement until it's too late. And the Crawfords are all flash and sparkle: a pair of charming, shallow people who are essentially hollow.<br /><br />\\"Mansfield Park\\" suffers from a rather insipid heroine, but the rest of the book is vintage Austen -- lies, romance, scandal and a dance of manners and society.d herself for the loss of her husband by considering that she could do very well without him\\"), some tastefully-handled scandal, and a delicate house-of-romantic-cards that comes crashing down to ruin people's lives (and improve others).

B002UNMW7O|2.0|Like everyone else, I loved the first movie.  But that was years ago and I've seen many movies since then.  Threfore, if you are bringing in new chracters that were related to chracters in the first movie, then do a flash-back of them in this follow-up movie.  I didn't know I was supposed to memorize their names for 10 years.<br /><br />It was difficult to figure out what was going on in this poorly put together pieces & parts movie and I wasn't entertained at all.  The acting wasn't serious, it wasn't taken seriously either.  The actors did all but wink back at us viewers.  The acting was either extremely over-done or tongue-in-cheek.<br /><br />I love the actress from Dexter but her role in this movie was too fake for me.  Her southern accent?!  Please!  And her investigating technique was a lame copy of the TV Monk character.<br /><br />The whole movie was lame as far as explaining what was going on and why.  Glad I didn't buy the DVD but just borrow it.  I still want my 2 hours back or did it just feel like forever before the movie ended?<br /><br />I am embarassed for Billy C, Fonda and the Dexter wife.  I hope the paycheck they showed-up (physically but not mentally)for was worth it.

B0021L8V1G|5.0|I know from my above comment it sounds like I didn't like the movie, but that isn't true I it's a really good movie. I just had a few problems with elements in it. Mainly with some characters and story. So before you read on there will be a few spoilers, I might give away so don't say I didn't warn you.    First Iron Man 2 takes place not long after the first movie. Tony Stark(Robert Downey Jr) is dealing with the repercussions of telling the world he's Iron Man. Mainly from the United States government and rival companies like Justin Hammer(Sam Rockwell). Of course this gets the attention of Ivan Vanko(Mickey Rourke) who blames the Stark family for stealing his fathers invention and destroying his family. Things go down hill from there for Tony Stark. That's it for the plot except Iron Man 2 is a much darker film from the first movie. The story is pretty good except they try to do to much in just 2hrs. That's really my biggest complaint with the movie. I'll explain more in the next paragraph.    Ok the problem I had with the movie was like I said they tried to add to much in just to 2 hrs. The biggest problem is was the force feeding of S.H.E.L.D. and the Avengers down our throats. Don't get me wrong I look forward to the Avengers movie, but what is the title of the movie...yes it's Iron Man 2 not a Avengers prequel. I didn't mind Nick Fury(Samuel L. Jackson) so much simply because I just love Jackson, he brings life to every role he plays. The character I had the biggest problem with was The Black Widow or Natasha Romanoff(Scarlett Johansson).  What a pointless character, sure I know Johansson is hot, but what was her point in the movie.  She added nothing to the movie. Oh I know to force feed us the Avengers, and from the rumors I read a Black Widow movie some time down the road. Now I didn't mind all the Avenger references. There's one evolving Captain America which I thought was great and funny.    For me what stole the movie was the acting by the main actors and some of the supporting ones. Especially Robert Downey Jr(who again steals the show), Gwyneth Paltrow(Pepper Potts) and Mickey Rourke. The acting and chemistry between Downey Jr. and Paltrow was great.  Then there's Rourke who is reviving his film career one film at a time. He was great as Whiplash, one of the best bad guys in superhero films out side of the Joker from The Dark Knight of course. Some of the supporting cast did a good job as well from Sam Rockwell, Don Cheadle(James Rhodes), to Jon Favreau(Hogan).    Overall Iron Man 2 suffers from what many super hero sequels suffer from. It tries to do to much and add to much. That being said it's still a really good if not great film with a pretty good story, great acting and actors, and really good effects/visuals. So this movie is definitely worth checking out, and I'll see it again.
0937381888|5.0|I bought this book after reading the constant rave reviews about it. It has everything you will need to know when it comes to getting into home brewing beer.    When I got my first brew kit (Coopers Micro Brew Lager,) all I wanted to do was get home and jump into making my own beer. The first chapter is dedicated to making sure you can do just that. It tells you what to watch out for, what equipment you need to make sure you have, and step by step instructions on getting your beer from stove, to fermenter, to bottle, to stomach.     After the crash course, the book goes into the finer details of how beer is made. And by \\"finer details,\\" I mean science. The book goes into great detail concerning grains, the malting process, hops, yeast, adjuncts, the list goes on and on. And it does it at the same time as it's leading you down the path towards all grain brewing.
B000AOA2G8|2.0|I'll start off with the pros: very good quality that I can see will last me a lifetime, and saves time when working on older bottom brackets.    Like the Park Tool double-sided headset wrench, however, this tool is an extreme uni-tasker that I only use because I feel like I need to use it after wasting my money.  The pin spanner is only one size, which runs the risk of being useless if the bottom bracket needs a different size - a much better option is buying the Park Tool adjustable pin spanner, which fits every size.  As for the other end, I give the same alternative to the headset wrench: a 12 - 15 inch adjustable wrench that has the added leverage to produce much more torque on extremely tight bottom bracket cups.    Again, if you work on bottom brackets frequently or simply have money to waste, then buy it.  Otherwise get yourself a 12 -15 inch adjustable wrench and save yourself some money.

0971407614|5.0|I received this book just 3 days ago. I have not yet started any of the exercises regimes. The stuff on nutrition is a little sparse and I think some of it is not correct, but I didn't buy the book to learn about nutrition. Mark does not recommend any equipment in this book except a chinning bar. I think that is too Spartan. I think many of the exercise can be improved with a minimal amount of equipment, such as a jump rope, medicine ball and stability ball.    Pictures are okay, but more time could have been spent on that part of the book(increased cost, I guess).     My general impression thus far is that this will be a very useful tool in structuring more formal workouts than I have done in the past. I like Mark's approach to bodyweight exercise and I will have more feedback a month or so down the road.    I would recommend this book for beginners(I am one), but cannot say if the exercises would also attract more conditioned athletes than myself.     If you are into bodyweight exercises and calithethics, i would buy this book.      Update 9/2/2011    My observations 14 months later. Like some, I bought this book May 2010, but did not get around to using it on a steady basis until the IPhone app arrived. This made the book much easier to use with the various timers included( ladders, supersets, intervals , tabatas, etc)    I started the beginner level and am now up to the 6th week of the 1st class program. I am 63 1/2 , 5'8\\" and weigh 160 lbs. There has not been any weight loss over the course of the program. My muscles are more define and my waistline has trimmed to 31\\" waist. Same as I was in college.    I still have the same opinion as others on the nutritional portion of the book, but again I did not buy the book as a nutrition source.     The exercise regime is working and I am feeling better because I am looking better. Almost but not quite have a 6 pack.     To me what is unique about the book are the 4 10 week programs that are fairly easy to follow. Theyare varied enough and short enough that you do not dread doing the workouts, even when you are tired. Unlike P90X they are easy to fit into anyone's schedule. It is easy to get habituated, in other words Mark's program can become a lifestyle. I have friends that did P90X, but stopped from exhaustion after 90 days and lost most of what they had achieved. With YAYOG this is less like to happen.    So this is the first time in my life that I have followed an exercise routine for 14 weeks( i skipped the first 2 weeks of the basic program).    In addition, the IPhone app is a great tool to use with the book. It's a little klunky, but basically a gym in your pocket. You can use it anywhere. However the 4 10 week programs are not included, so you would need to photocopy these. Unfortunately the app does not allow you to customize your personal workout program, though the developer of the app is promising this in a forthcoming release. one cannot rally use the app at this point on a standalone basis, but at $1.99 it's still a bargain for the timers alone.    Finally, my home gym is not as spartan as Mark would like. I do have a few pieces of equipment that make performing body weigh exercise more enjoyable:  1. chinning bar  2. dip station  3. roman chair(for hyperextensions)  4  suspension trainer  5. power pushup  6. ab roller  7  Plyometric boxes    I agree that all these are optional, but they make doing some of the recommended exercises more convenient and fun. All of these use your own body weight to achieve there goals.    Two things that the book lacks is any focus on warm up routine (i jumprope or i do plyo tabatas) and nothing on streching.    Small quibbles.A great value and an excellent book. 5 stars.    PS. another book worth using as an adjunct is \\"Pilates For Men\\" by Daniel Lyon[[ASIN:0060820772 The Complete Book of Pilates for Men: The Lifetime Plan for Strength, Power & Peak Performance]]
B002VECM72|3.0|Good movie, but best actress? Every other role must have sucked on 2009.  She was good, but the best, very unlikely. The Movie was good and entertaining. i think Sandra had a better role in Demolition Man, lol. O well, good for her.
0143116177|4.0|Interesting, informative, valuable, and all that. I think I know more about money after having read this.<br /><br />Ferguson's purpose seems to be to help the reader understand the history of and rationale for the major elements of economic life. Because of that, he focuses more than I would like on the last few hundred years, whereas I would love to know more about how money functioned in ancient times.<br /><br />Big takeway: Money is real. I've had my doubts about that in the past.

B001LPWGE6|4.0|These movies would be 5 stars if not for the creatively idiotic camera techniques implemented in the 2nd film, and carried forward into the 3rd film. I am unsure of the technical terms for the technique, but I am confident that the method will go down in film history as temporary, creative insanity. If you're able to ignore the stupidity of the camera work, then you'll find more pleasure in the films than I did. Unfortunately, this series is one of my favorite film genres, and an excellent series, only to be heavily damaged by inane, immature directing.    And at $35, $15 a film, for this quality of directing, I'll wait a good long while before purchasing.

B000001GPX|1.0|Considering how well served this symphony is by the gramophone, and how many superb artists have given us the benefit of their reading, the praise heaped on this hysterical product is well-nigh incomprehensible to me. I don't wish to single out any competitors; but just by way of example (and because Kleiber is plainly imitating a famous precedent), listen to the first movement, alternating section by section in quick succession, between Karajan's 1962 recording [[ASIN:B000001GBQ Ludwig van Beethoven: 9 Symphonien]] and this Kleiber offering. Quick switching helps you focus on the details; and especially on how the conductor controls the dynamics. Result: you'll hear a man doing his best work and a boy trying his best to match his footprints step by step. Even the 80-year-old Bruno Walter managed to show what dynamism really means. Not running wild, like a dog chasing a rabbit. Same applies to the last movement. There is no grandeur here, just climax piled on climax in a senseless paroxysm of noise.  The seventh, in contrast, is almost too demure. Maybe Kleiber felt that enough was enough; but (comparison again) you can go to Solti/Chicago SO [[ASIN:B0000041W3 Beethoven: Symphonies Nos. 7 & 8]] to discover how truly powerful dynamics can be made to arise from a basically quite slow pace.  I don't want to harp. Yet I kept going back to this album, saying to myself, \\"surely this excitement is not just hype -- there must be something to it?\\" Well, I've come to the point where I don't ever want to hear this again. Music need not be just pleasure; but it should be (especially this symphony) sublime in its turbulence, and uplifting in the grandeur of its final pages.  But this performance leaves me breathless and dismayed. When it's over, you shake your head and ask, where amid this furious gesticulating is all the greatness gone?

B002T3LHG2|5.0|We live in a veritable golden age of independent and folk musical artistry.  From The Avett Brothers to Derek Webb to The Decemberists to Damien Rice to Colm Mac Con Iomaire to Iron & Wine (a few of my favorites from America and Ireland), the folk indie music scene is absolutely brilliant.  Within this genre perhaps no artists write more heart-wrenchingly beautiful and emotionally raw music than the dynamic duo of Glenn Hansard and Markéta Irglová, also known as The Swell Season    To most readers, Hansard and Irglová will be best known and recognized as the stars of the wonderful modern musical, \\"Once\\".  Filmed in Dublin over two and a half weeks at 130,000, \\"Once\\" is a beautifully executed story of love and friendship as expressed by the genuine, heart-felt music of The Swell Season.  As a coming-out for Hansard and Iglová (although it must be said that Hansard had previously been in the entertaining Irish film \\"The Commitments\\" and has been performing as front-man for the Irish band The Frames for year) \\"Once\\" showed the kind of magic that can happen when two artists who were made for each other join forces to create something truly special.    It is obvious that Hansard and Irglová are at their artistic best when corroborating together.  Their voices meld together in exquisite harmony in a fashion that is absolutely breath taking.  Their chemistry is un-matched.  They truly are each other's muse.  It is precisely this chemistry (and emotional honesty for that matter) that is the true genius of \\"Once\\".  The movie and the music is real, it is genuine and it is understandable and relatable.  Watching \\"Once\\" is to forget that one is watching a movie.  The viewer joins into the story with the characters, feeling what they feel and experiencing what they experience.    This honesty and chemistry is the same strength of \\"Strict Joy\\".  A story of hurt, heartache and subdued joy, \\"Strict Joy\\" is beautifully written and performed.  Communicating the many-faceted feelings of a relationship broken and bruised (but not completely finished), \\"Strict Joy\\" provides the listener with songs of hope (\\"Low Rising\\"), repentance (\\"I Have Loved You Wrong\\") and sorrowful frustration (\\"Two Tongues\\"), the album runs the gamut of experience and emotion.    Far from the raw, emotive energy of \\"Once\\" (most notably in the songs \\"When Your Mind's Made Up\\" and \\"Lies\\"), \\"Strict Joy\\" employs a more refined, mature and consistent introspection (ala \\"Falling Slowly\\").  Much of this musical maturation seems to be ground in the growing integration and skills of Irglová, specifically in the songs she writes and performs with Hansard.  As for Hansard, he is as good in this album as he is with anything he writes.  His transparent song crafting is infectious and his energy is revitalizing.  He is one of the most gifted and experience songwriters in the indie music scene.  Add the growing skills of Irglová and it is hard to imagine much of a creative limit for the duo.    The album's best moment is found in the song \\"I Have Loved You Wrong\\".  Hopefully haunting, the song expresses a surprising sorrow for wrongs committed and a deep and abiding desire for reconciliation.  Similar in tone and sound to the achingly lovely \\"The Hill\\" from \\"Once\\", \\"I Have Loved You Wrong\\" is Irglová at her best.  The addition of Hansard's harmony at the close of the song is absolute dynamite and demonstrates just how perfectly their voices are suited for each other.    While not as strong or approachable as the soundtrack for \\"Once\\", \\"Strict Joy\\" is still a stellar effort by The Swell Season and a worthy addition to any music lover's library.

I am also a close and personal friend of the author of this book and can tell you that Mark is the real deal and knows what he is talking about.  I have been his sparring partner for several years and always wondered how he kept in such great shape and had more endurance than myself.    So, he then put me on his program of body-weight exercises and in a short time I was feeling stronger and going those extra rounds in the ring.  My core felt stronger and my lower back pain went away.  This is the best i've felt in years!!!!  At the age of 38 I went on to win my first Professional Muay Thai fight in Patong Thailand thanks to Mark and the exercises he describes in his book.    Bottom line is.........This book works!!!!!

0307387178|1.0|The beginning and nearly first half of the book draws you in, then as you venture through pages and pages it becomes a non-impressive read. The author pieced the last steps of McCandless very well but the book doesn't offer much detail and insight into the young man's thoughts and personal feelings toward his family or why he is ultimately deciding to wonder off into the Alaska wilderness with crap gear and a bag of rice. It rather details that he was influenced by one of his favorite books (which turns out to be fiction) before his unfortunate death... which has me constantly thinking that he is either truly dumb or wants slow suicide. Overall I really felt like this could have been kept from being written as a book. I think many people tend to get caught up and think it's a good book in how the young man adventures with virtually nothing but a giant backpack and leaves everything he once knew behind for reasons unknown. It's unforgettable I know, but many people drift and it seems this kid was well liked by the people he met which leads me to believe why the book was written in his honor. The authors own experiences are really annoying and are not relevant to the book.    Would have rather been reading something else.

B00005JKDR|5.0|Monsters, Inc. is one hour and thirty-four minutes and was released in theaters on November 2, 2001. The movie focuses around two main characters: James P. \\"Sulley\\" Sullivan and Michael \\"Mike\\" Wazowski. Sulley and Mike are best friends who live together and work at the Monsters, Inc; a scare plant. Sulley is the top Scarer at the plant and Mike is his assistant scarer. At the end of a shift one day Mike forgot to file his paperwork because his mind is on Celia Mae, his girlfriend, who he is taken her to Harryhausen for her birthday. Sulley steps in for Mike and does his paperwork for him. Sulley is picking up the paperwork and notices that one of the doors has not been put away. He peeks in the room to see if there are any monsters in it and finds out there is none. When he is back on the Scare Floor he sees a little two year old girl playing with his tail and all fun breaks loose. The rest of the story is about Sulley and Mike trying to get Boo (the name giving to the three year old girl by Sulley) back to her world. Along the way the two find out the Randall is kidnapping children for his scare machine and the one who is to blame for the door being found by Sulley. Mike and Sulley are at one point banished to the Himalayas where they meet the Abominable Snowman who was also banished there for reasons unknown. Back at Monsters, Inc. the two send Randall through one of the doors and destroy the door so he cannot return, get Mr. Waternoose to reveal the plans of the scare machine to the Child Detection Agency, and finally send Boo home. The computer animation of Monsters, Inc. is great, the story does not drag, and it keeps everybody laughing. The only thing I really hate is the two disc set. In my opinion everything could have gone on one disc and much of what is on Disc 2 could have been left off. Monsters, Inc. gets an AAAA++++.

B001FB55L2|5.0|This is not necessarily a war movie, though it has a crucial part set in Afghanistan. Instead of a copter crash in enemy territory, it could just as well be about a starved polar expedition.<br />The hero (Tobey M.) goes to war and is presumed dead. The widow (Natalie P.) is honestly grieving. The brother (Jake G.) is a useless ex-con who tries to find his footing in life outside prison. Father (Sam S.) is a Vietnam veteran who adolates hero-son and detests convict-son. Brother and 'widow' become friends, the little daughters begin to like uncle Tommy... and then the missing hero returns to life, with his mind and soul all smashed up. A classic heartbreak story.
B002ZG997M|5.0|THE BOOK OF ELI<br /><br />STARRING: Denzel Washington, Gary Oldman, Mila Kunis, Jennifer Beals, Ray Stevenson, Evan Jones, Tom Waits and Malcolm McDowell<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Gary Whitta<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Albert Hughes and Allen Hughes<br /><br />Rated: R<br />Genre: Action<br />Release Date: 15 January 2010<br />Review Date: 18 March 2010<br /><br />Ever wonder what a religious post apocalyptic western would look like? If you have, then The Book of Eli is it. If you haven't - see it anyway. You'll be pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The sensational Denzel Washington stars as Eli. He's a lonely drifter wondering the streets of a morally and economically abandoned America. After a great war that tore a hole in the sky and upset the balance of the sun, the world more or less came to an end.<br /><br />That was over 30 years ago and Eli has been walking ever since. He, like those few who survived, cannot go outside without shades on; as the sky has turned to a desolate burnt mass that will blind you. The brilliant filmmakers (Albert and Allen Hughes) who brought us From Hell; have crafted a very unique and appealing-to-the-cinematic-eye, landscape for Denzel's character to trek across.<br /><br />Eli has one mission: to protect a sacred book that he has in his possession, and to take it west. Faith is his employer; faith in the heavenly voice that has told him to do so.<br /><br />Please don't make the ignorant mistake that others have made by assuming that it has taken him 30 years to walk from A to B. His path has been unknown to him, as is all of ours in life, and those 30 years were spent with him learning from and experiencing things of which the film does not need to show us. Plus, his path leads him to a place where he interacts with certain characters that would not have been there 30 years ago or even 15 years ago, and he needs to meet them in order for his destiny to be fulfilled entirely.<br /><br />This is a very religious film, if you didn't pick up on it from the beginning of this review or from the advertising. Eli is being led by God, okay. I know it's a movie, but films of the past have asked us to accept much more unbelievable elements and we all have; so just go with it and have some fun.<br /><br />Eli is met along the way by sadistic motorcycle gangs and rapists and thieves; really bad guys. People butcher and slaughter one another for food, water, sex and whatever else you may have to offer them. Eli partakes in none of this, and handles those who oppose his goal appropriately to his situation and to the genre of this film - he kills them; violently, innovatively, and in very entertaining ways.<br /><br />If you are some-one who believes strongly that violence is never the answer, no matter what the situation, then skip this film and go watch Sesame Street instead. It's jam-packed with violence; justified violence. Let's face it - sometimes the only way to counter violence, is to retaliate with even more of it. That's a fact folks.<br /><br />Eventually Eli stumbles into a town run by a heinous dictator. Who better to play a grizzly villain, than the villain's villain himself: Gary Oldman. From Bram Stoker's Dracula and The Fifth Element, to True Romance and The Professional, Oldman has portrayed some of the most celebrated movie-psychotics of all time. He adds The Book of Eli to that list with another phenomenal performance as Carnegie.<br /><br />Carnegie is the guy you have seen a thousand times in different westerns; the bully who has taken over the town and has his own personal henchman, and is forcing a beautiful woman to be his love interest. But it's the sadistic charm that Oldman brings to this character that sets him apart from others. He is magnificent and terrifying.<br /><br />Carnegie's agenda is to get his hands on a sacred book that he believes will grant him power to rule everyone left alive on our miserable planet. The book is of course the one which Eli possesses.<br /><br />WhenEli wonders into Carnegie's town for supplies, he finds some trouble. After a bloody battle is had, leaving Eli victorious, Carnegie is impressed with his skills and wishes to hire him as part of his crew. When Eli refuses, Carnegie grants him a free night in his hotel with a generous meal, in hopes of persuading him. Eli accepts the offer and stays the night.<br /><br />Jennifer Beals gives a terrific performance as Claudia, that woman being forced into Carnegie's life that we discussed earlier. Her daughter Solara (Mila Kunis) is forced to work in the saloon and sometimes provide sexual favors to guests. Carnegie forces her to offer herself to Eli, in one of the film's best and most enduring scenes.<br /><br />Obviously, Eli declines her gesture and befriends her instead. The two create a strong partnership and flee from Carnegie and his group of degenerate dirt-bags. Naturally they follow, and several interesting interactions are had before the film reaches its end.<br /><br />The violence in the film will no doubt confuse many, as that's all they will see it as. They will miss the fact that Eli is on a quest from God, and never once invites an altercation upon himself. Eli is always grief stricken or warn-down by his acts of violence and finds no pleasure in them.<br /><br />There is one scene in the film where he does kill an unarmed man, but I believe that he either does this because God tells him to, as the guy is evil and will murder others as he has just attempted to do to Eli; or he does this because of the simple fact that the man will bleed to death, in the middle of no-where, as a result of the injury he has sustained.<br /><br />You'll be impressed to know that Denzel did al of his own stunts in this film, and trained severely to make these action sequences look believable. They do.<br /><br />The Book of Eli also has one of the most original endings ever seen in any film; right up there with the shock-value of The Sixth Sense. Watching it a second time, makes it as equally painstakingly obvious with clues, but hardly anyone will ever catch it the first time around.<br /><br />It's good to see a big Hollywood-backed movie that evokes a strong Christian theme. You don't catch too many of those. Eli gives a terrific quote in the film that has and will continue to stick with me: \\"There's always a choice.\\"li victorious, Carnegie is impressed with his skills and wishes to hire him as part of his crew.

B002VECMAE|5.0|An extraordinarily talented and experienced international law enforcement officer watched this on loan from me before I saw it, and hated it.  Now that I have watched it myself, I understand--if you have not been deeply engaged with CIA and all of its idiocyncrasies including remote viewing, acoustic-kitty, the pigeons that came before Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), and then over to SOF (Special Operations Forces) where \\"unconventional\\" had to go covert to survive the straight-leg generals with no clue, you will simply not appreciate this movie.<br /><br />DanD nails it--this is satire and also a brilliant documentary of what can only be decribed as a well-intentioned long-running Goat F..k.  The movie is a collage of several different real initiatives including the First Earth Battalion (I knew a couple of the principals, decades ahead of their time); the Peace Warrior initiative, and of course Remote Viewing, the CIA's notorious MKULTRA and LSD for unwitting victims, and so on.<br /><br />At one point in the movie the two principal actors are discussing the remorse--the angst--over having used his power to actually kill a goat with his mind, and the other guy pops in with \\"Silence of the Goats.\\"  That just about sums it up--this is, for someone steeped in the well-intentioned lunacy of the past--a perfect five, and I have to believe that the world-class actors that decided to do this did it knowing that it would be misunderstood by many, but a real hoot among the veterans of the seventies and eighties.<br /><br />The only thing not in here, certainly worthy of a sequel to this movie, is extra-terrestial encounters, leveraging extra-terrestial technologies, warnings from extraterrestials [humans now being in a state of quarentine for being stupid squared], and the exotic, wasteful, and generally hilarious methods used to keep Area 51 and related projects \\"secret.\\"<br /><br />See also:<br />[[ASIN:B000QEIOSU Peaceful Warrior (Widescreen)]]<br />[[ASIN:1449524559 First Earth Battalion Operations Manual: Reprint of Original Manual from the 70's]]<br />[[ASIN:0708814824 On the Psychology of Military Incompetence]]<br />[[ASIN:B001HZ3GYY Psychic Warrior]]<br />[[ASIN:0312964137 Psychic Warrior: The True Story of America's Foremost Psychic Spy and the Cover-Up of the CIA's Top-Secret Stargate Program]]<br />[[ASIN:1571744827 Memoirs of a Psychic Spy: The Remarkable Life of U.S. Government Remote Viewer 001]]<br />[[ASIN:1552975649 Hidden Secrets: The Complete History of Espionage and the Technology Used to Support It]][[ASIN:0967323827 Hidden Truth: Forbidden Knowledge]]<br />[[ASIN:0967323819 Disclosure : Military and Government Witnesses Reveal the Greatest Secrets in Modern History]]<br />[[ASIN:0967323827 Hidden Truth: Forbidden Knowledge]]eprint of Original Manual from the 70's]]  [[ASIN:0708814824 On the Psychology of Military Incompetence]]  [[ASIN:B001HZ3GYY Psychic Warrior]]  [[ASIN:0312964137 Psychic Warrior: The True Story of America's Foremost Psychic Spy and the Cover-Up of the CIA's Top-Secret Stargate Program]]  [[ASIN:1571744827 Memoirs of a Psychic Spy: The Remarkable Life of U.S. Government Remote Viewer 001]]  [[ASIN:1552975649 Hidden Secrets: The Complete History of Espionage and the Technology Used to Support It]][[ASIN:0967323827 Hidden Truth: Forbidden Knowledge]]  [[ASIN:0967323819 Disclosure : Military and Government Witnesses Reveal the Greatest Secrets in Modern History]]  [[ASIN:0967323827 Hidden Truth: Forbidden Knowledge]]
014241543X|5.0|This is the first book to ever make me cry. Don't get me wrong, I am an avid book reader and I am emotionally invested in many books that I read, but If I Stay really got me. The characters were incredibly well-developed through the voice of the main character, Mia. By the end of the book, I felt like it was my dad, my boyfriend, my brother...and in turn, I experienced the pain of losing them right along with Mia. While the book, in theory, seems similar to Lovely Bones, I found that I was able to identfy much more with Mia and sympathize with her situation, and rationalize her thoughts and decisions.     Simply put, pick up this book. You will not regret it.
193413712X|4.0|I gave Tinkers 4 out of 5 stars, because I thought Paul Harding's writing (style, lyrical prose, description) was exceptional. I do however, have a beef with writers, who decide not to put quotations around dialogue. I hate that. I realize that Mr. Harding is not the only one to do that, most notably Cormac McCarthy, whom I love. But I find that to be pure gimmickry.    As a reader of many books, I found Harding's descriptions of the clocks fascinating through the usage of a fictional horologist, Rev. Kenner Davenport. It was quite metaphorical in how it related to the main story as well as the characters, George and his father Howard. The explanations of the various Borealis's confused me at first, until I realized early on that much of that was part of Howard's description of his epilectic seizures. However, I wasn't crazy about Harding's changing POV's from George to Howard every other paragraph. I found that distracting. I also found it odd that Harding would change tenses from first-person present, to third-person past so often within paragraphs. I found that distracting as well, as it sometimes took me out of the story.    In sum, I very much liked this first effort by Paul Harding and was lucky enough to hear him speak two weeks ago at the LA Book Festival. I purchased a signed copy of his book. Do I think it deserves the Pulitzer? No, but I'm not on the judging committee. I did think it was a terrific book that showed great promise especially as a first novel, and I would recommend him to others. But I thought Colum McCann's LET THE GREAT WORLD SPIN was a better effort (he did win the National Book Award).
B0039TD7PY|5.0|Carol King and James Taylor together at the Troubadour!  I have to say that of all the artists, I can't think of two others that represent the 60's and 70's better than these two.  There songs and voices are cornerstones to the era and have the power to propel us back to a momentous time when we felt empowered to change the world.<br /><br />James Taylor performs most of his classics, Fire and Rain; Carolina on My Mind; Sweet Baby James, and others.  Carol King likewise gives us her classics, I Feel the Earth Move; So Far Away and others.  I also did not know that Carol King helped to write Up On the Roof and actually let James release it before she did.  The benefits of live concerts.<br /><br />Both the CD and DVD are well produced.  Watch the DVD allows the producers to include the small banter and stories that are often left off a live CD.<br /><br />If you're a product of the 60's and 70's and you listened to the music then, this is one purchase you'll want to make.<br /><br />Bless us all and peace.
B000XA5K4I|5.0|This is a great comic book action movie!    I think that the people that didn't like it had unreasonable expectations.  I think some viewers expected it to be a realistic action movie.  It's NOT.  If you accept it for what it is, it is really great.  It's chock full of fantastic cartoon type action.  I lost count of how bad guys were killed with carrots let alone bullets!  This is pure entertainment that left me grinning from ear to ear by the end of the movie.
1423113381|4.0|I had not intended to pick this book up.  I wasn't that impressed with The Lightning Thief (although I admit to not having read the rest of the Percy Jackson series - even though I own them).  But I did end up picking up The Red Pyramid and about 5 chapters in was very glad I'd done so.<br /><br />Some folks are saying they don't enjoy this book as much as the Percy Jackson series.  I can tell you right now, if it came to a contest between The Lightning Thief and The Red Pyramid, in my opinion, The Red Pyramid wins hands down.  I loved the alternating narration between the two Kane children, Sadie and Carter.  I loved the supporting characters of Bast, Horus and Isis.  I really enjoyed Riordan making this book seem as if it were a story that were actually happening and pulling the readers into the story.<br /><br />Too often there's a big cliffhanger in books that make the wait for the next one seemingly unbearable.  I enjoyed the great resolution in The Red Pyramid, and although it was enough to make me want to pick up the second book, it didn't have me throwing up my hands in frustration bemoaning the fact that the next book isn't due out for a while.<br /><br />The only criticism I really have for the book is that it seems as if Riordan threw some action scenes in just to keep a readers attention - the book could have done with a few of them gone and a shorter story because it really started to drag a bit for the last half of the book.  Too much of the same old - fight after fight and me wondering just how long a few days can possibly take!<br /><br />That's my only criticism though - and overall this is a fun book, educational with regards to the Egyptian gods, full of action, good choices made by children and a book I'll be recommending my nieces and nephews read.
B000PMGS8G|5.0|\\"Klytus, I'm booorred. What plaything do you have for me today.\\" -Emperor Ming    Wow, one of the most perfect summer action movies. I remember seeing it in the theater. Basically the earth is being attacked from the kingdom of Mongo in outer space and a spacecraft built by mad scientist Dr. Zarkov(Topol) is hurled with him, Dale(Melody Anderson), and, accidentaly, football star Flash Gordon((Sam J. Jones))(\\"Quaterback, New York Jets\\") to stop them. Zarkov and Dale realize later that ultimate athlete Flash is their only hope against the EVIL emperor Ming, played with excelent gusto by Max von Sydow.    If any part of what I just wrote does not make you interested. DO NOT SEE THIS FILM.  If you think that its cheesey, it is, but its also a LOT of fun.      Ther set design is cool(30's serial with everything over the top), the leads bland(Jones and Anderson just roll through the motions, with Anderson getting the better part), the soundtrack loud(Courtesy of Queen),  the action pieces exciting(love the final battle),  the effects old fasioned(lot of paintings), and the supporting cast awsome:  von Sydow makes this one and he's the best thing here, Topol brings in a lot of doubt to weather Zarkov is friend or foe, Timothy Dalton shows you why he eventually became Bond, Ornella Muti is VERY attractive and get the meatiest part here, Brian Blessed doesn't overact; he expoldes and it works, and Peter Wyngarde just oozes evil as Ming's #2.    Just turn off your brain and enjoy the fights, double crosses, and Blessed shouting and you will have a hell of a time.   DVD is cool too with a 30's FG serial and interviews(but no Von Sydow darn it).
B0038VPB5W|5.0|It's pretty obvious that, for the most part, the hard-core Metal fans that loved the previous BFMV efforts are not in love with the new CD.      Me?  I happen to love the Crue, Linkin Park, all the 80's hair metal, Metallica, Priest, Godsmack, The Answer, etc.    I think the new BFMV kicks some ass and I'm gonna wear it out.     Oh, like others have already said,...lots of good songs here, but the ending \\"Pretty on the Outside\\" is indeed a great one to close the show.
B002KGEORM|5.0|SOA is the best show on television. It's the Sopranos on motorcycles. The last shows that were this good were Rome and the Sopranos. Nothing else comes close.<br />Obviously you have to enjoy this sort of programming or you won't feel the same way but, if you like Rome or the Sopranos, you will love this show.<br />Katey Sagal is incredible and really gives the show that little something extra that puts it over the top. The rest of the cast is excellent and the writing is very good.<br />If you are familiar with the 1% lifestyle you will notice the occasional glaring contradiction but, this is television after all and they are trying to appeal to a wide audience.<br />I paid to download season 2 even though I fully intend to purchase the dvd's when they are released. Since I am a hardcore slickdealer, that says a lot.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|If you must read more, then by all means enjoy:<br /><br />Plot was ridiculously predictable.  Not your typical, easy-to-figure out type of movie.  So shallow, it was insulting.  Fore-shadowing of a caliber that a 2 year old might need to be checked for developmental delays if they were unable to tell you exactly was about to happen throughout the movie.  Although I don't doubt a 2 year old might be over-whelmed by the visual effects, they were 4-out-of-5-stars worthy, but being shiny \\"doth not a good movie make\\".<br /><br />I'm sure I will receive numerous replies about how wonderful it was, and by all means if that's your opinion, express it in a review or however you wish, just don't condemn my opinion for being different than yours.  Let's reserve that for political discussions.
0345479092|5.0|This book gives the most down-to-earth and usable tips for new parents of any book I have read.  It is good to find out what really works for infants.  The author knows her babies and has helped many parents in their homes.  (A lot of doctors are giving recommendations about things that they have not actually experienced.)  This book advocates positive things and not extremes.  It is wonderful and really works.
B002HR1W1K|5.0|Not only did this movie have a hysterical script, it was perfectly cast, and flawlessly directed to such an extent that it still brings tears to my eyes when I think about how hard I laughed THROUGH OUT this movie!  I originally rented it through netflix, but after watching it, I was on Amazon less than 5 minutes later making the purchase.  Whether or not this particular blu ray disc is packed full of features, or a great bang for your buck, I don't yet know since it hasn't arrived yet, but the movie is just plan entertaining from beginning to end.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone with a sense of humor.
B00005JO9J|5.0|This product was like new!  No visible scratches and outer casing was in great condition!
1423113381|5.0|What impressed me most about the Percy Jackson series was how well Mr. Riordan incorporated mythology into modern settings and characters that are likable and current. I'll admit I was hesitant with this new series, Egyptian mythology is a lot harder since so much of it is supposition.<br />He succeeded very well at doing for Egyptian mythology what he did with Greek mythology. In some ways, it's even better. His Percy Jackson books were based heavily off of myth. The Egyptian books were based on myth and archeology. There is a lot of information in this fantasy book which could very well inspire people to learn more, and it's packaged very well in an appealing story. Like his Percy Jackson books, I think this is a series my whole family will happily read and discuss.It's a hefty book (at 516 pages), but my daughter snagged it as soon as I was done. She was impressed enough with his previous work to really look forward to this one.<br />Carter, a young man in his early teens and his sister Sadie are the main characters in this book. It starts off running and doesn't slow down as they try to solve the mystery of what happened to their parents and who they are. Carter is a very self-possessed young man who grew up with his father who traveled the world teaching and studying Egyptology. Sadie is his younger sister and she's more impulsive, she grew up with her grandparents in London in a nice stable home. She's a bit of a rebel with red streaks in her hair that contrast with her brother's button down shirts and slacks. Very nicely written characters, and the point of view goes back and forth between them and still keep the voices separate.<br />I'm not going to write a synopsis of the story, I'm sure other reviewers will. I liked this book a lot though, and recommend it easily to people who enjoy a good non-romantic ya urban fantasy.
B0004Z33EQ|3.0|As the second installment of the &#34;Rambo&#34; saga, this film definitely ups-the-ante in terms of action and body count. &#34;Rambo: First Blood Part II&#34; takes Rambo back to the jungles of Vietnam, where most of the mental traumas that dog him began. His mission is to search for missing POWs, instead he falls right back into a war that, for him, has never really ended.<br /><br />As I said, the action in this film goes way beyond anything we saw in the first one (but with James Cameron as one of the screenplay writers, that's not exactly a surprise). Less content to let the personal and political dramas propel the action, this film is pretty much the reverse, with the action being cause to create those plot developments. In many way, this film seems to forget the humanity shown in the original and opts to let the excitement of the moment wash over you, like the backwash of an F-16 fighter jet, as the explosive battle sequences blast you against the back wall. Although, while extremely over the top in almost every stunt and fight, to the point ungodly suspension of disbelief is pretty much the order of the day, it is a beautifully choreographed bloodbath to behold. It basically, for good or ill, set the stage for what the 80's action epic would be expected to achieve for the rest of the decade.<br /><br />While not exactly a deeply emotive character in the first film, Sly gets even less moments here. There is no understanding to what Rambo is feeling being back in the place that has tortured him so. There is almost no attempt to play on those feelings at all, save an all-too-brief scene on a boat, between Rambo and the young Vietnamese woman (played by Julia Nickson) who is helping him in the mission, but that's as far as they go to give you any idea on what Rambo is thinking and feeling, being back in 'Nam after all this time. I would have liked to get into Rambo's thoughts more, as the traumas he'd suffered there could have added even more depth to an emotionally complex character. But that simply isn't what this film was about.<br /><br />Richard Crenna reprises his role, as Rambo's C.O., but he gets very little to do in this film. Whereas in the first he was a key to understanding Rambo and used to contrast the political themes that were presented, here he is merely a very small cog, used mainly to set up the plot to get Rambo back into action. He does have one very intense scene, where he argues with the slimy Washington bureaucrat (played by Charles Napier), which brought back a momentary flair from the first film, but it is over quickly, as the need to get back to the jungle slaughter is the paramount concern here.<br /><br />&#34;Rambo: First Blood Part II&#34; was less the ending of an iconic character's saga (not the least of which is due to the fact two more sequels were made) and more the start of replacing character-driven action, with action-driven drama. It created a new standard for what action films could be (and in many cases, would be) from that point on. It set up a game of constant oneupmanship with the other action stars of the day, as they all attempted to outdo what this film began. In some ways, this film is almost a whole new entity, completely separate from the original film in every thing but the characters names, yet it is also strangely completely bound to it. As a sequel to a film that had some very deep philosophical and political themes, this film fails to recapture almost any of that same spirit, but in terms of spinning the action film genre into an ever growing and testosterone-fueled behemoth, determined to make the impossible seem probable, as well as solidifying Rambo's status as an 80's icon for all-time, the film succeeds on a level no other film could ever hope to manage. This is truly the film that epitomizes the phrase, &#34;check your brain at the door and enjoy!&#34; Which I am more than able to do.nally complex character.

B0030IIZ56|5.0|Viewed on a Panasonic 50\\" plasma via a Panasonic DMP-BD80 through a Yamaha RX-V869 receiver (5.1 speakers) and an HDMI splitter/amp.<br /><br />PQ - gorgeous.  details previously unseen DVD include: Jessie's hair is actually braided yarn, all of the toys themselves have differing sheens and paint whorls,  Woody's horse looks textured, and check out the cheetos' dust on Al's fingertips and his stubble!  not quite as immersive an environment as Up!, but still several  degrees better than the DVD.<br /><br />AQ - great ambient atmosphere in a DTS HD track.  LFE in the beginning gets a workout on planet Zurg.  outstanding!
B002WIDRM6|5.0|This is going to be the year (2010) for Lady A.  Along with \\"Need You Now\\" and \\"American Honey\\", the tracks \\"Ready To Love Again\\", \\"If I Knew Then\\", and \\"Perfect Day\\" are destined to top the charts.  Absolutely love it!!!!
B001V7UXG2|5.0|My mom and I started watching these reruns on our local PBS channel and we continued to watch them because we recognized Hugh Laurie before he did the show House and Stephan Fry, from well everything else. Our library in town has all of the discs so when PBS stopped showing them we could check them out from the library. But that's only when we remembered to do so, which wasn't very frequently. So when I saw that you had the entire box set on sale, I bought it, even though it was months before Mother's day. And when it came in the mail, my mom opened it early. And I've never seen anyone so excited in my entire life, jumping up and down in the kitchen saying thank you over and over again. Best early mother's day ever she says. So thanks a bunch AMAZON for the great sale price, it made my day, and it made my mom's whole year. So far we are on the second season, and loving every minute of it.
0394721780|4.0|Love the teaching style of this cookbook, but you need a lot of time to tackle some of these dishes.  I bought the book mainly for the section on veggies.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|The action in this film is very good as are the special effects. However, the endless lens flares are very annoying. They distract from the scenes and smear the picture. Not artistic at all. The acting is sometimes over the top like a Saturday Night Live skit. Chekov's accent is much too exagerated and Bones is far too dramatic; a comic parody of the original actors. I'm sorry I spent $28 when a week earlier it was only $12.
0307341550|4.0|I read this book a few years ago, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It is about a child murder and the investigation following the murder.  Since the story is based around the death of a child, the book is quite emotional at times.  It was written well and I would recommend this to a friend if they are interested in crime stories.   Much better then IN THE WOODS by Tana French. (see my review for that horrible mess)
B0039OGGVQ|4.0|Great effort by Slash.  Some of the songs would make great radio play-  Track # 3 \\"Beautiful Dangerous\\" w/ Fergie & track# 7 \\"Gotten\\" w/ Adam Levine of Maroon5.  The reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the album doesn't have great lyrics throughout- though some songs do.  The guitar playing is great & the album really shows off the depth of Slash.  Contrary to popular belief the guy has a brain if you watch any interview with him that wasn't done by MTV, tabloid TV, or with Axel Rose.    If you are a Maroon5 fan, Track# 7 is worth downloading.  Fergie Fans will find track# 3 worthy also.
B001E45XT4|4.0|Overall I enjoy this product for gaming.  The ear cups are nice and large and fit comfortably even over my glasses.  The sound quality for bass is better than my Seinheiser HD280 Pro's, but other than the bass my Seinhiser's are still better for sound quality.  From what I can tell the mic quality is good enough and has good volume.
0765356147|4.0|Let me start by saying that I thought book one was good, and book two was an incredible drag.    Book three of the Mistborn series was very good, but had a few major annoyances, which I will get to later.  First off, I loved the ending.  A good ending should give the reader the impression that the story was meant to get there from the very beginning, but it shouldn't be entirely predictable.  There were elements that I did not see coming, and I liked how they turned out.  I especially liked how Sazed's religious studies culminated in his final work - it was a nice resolution to his hideously drawn-out faith crisis.  Vin's final confrontation with the inquisitors and then with Ruin himself was exciting, and Elend's final war with the koloss was a satisfying climax to the story.  Sanderson brought together all his elements, explained his secrets, and brought the story to its conclusion with mystifying power (no pun intended).      I also liked the character of TenSoon and the immersion into the kandra culture.  It was fascinating and well-told, though somewhat short-lived (but that's probably a good thing).      Despite these high points, the book did have some definite drawbacks for me:    The personal and ethical dilemma's were drawn out and made little sense.  Sazed's religious crisis was so irritating, I wanted to put the book down every time he talked about it.  In the first book, Sazed seemed like a wise old scholar, who saw past the institution and theology of a faith to the true heart of it, the nuggets of truth buried in each one.  He seemed to understand what most people only understand AFTER a crisis of faith.  But after losing the love of his life in book two, he reverts to a juvenile who just lost the faith he followed fervently in high school, having just found out, \\"Whoa!  There's inconsistencies here!  What the...?\\"  Then he proceeds to drone on about it until the end of the book.  Thankfully, his crisis turns out to have significance for the conclusion of the story as a whole, but it struck me as rather weak and incredibly bland.    Next on my list of frustrations, Elend Venture brings his legions of koloss armies to make war with the city of Fadrex, hoping to save all the people together.  Believe me, I understand the moral dilemma of doing wrong to accomplish good things.  It's a good ethical question: I believe I need to conquer this city in order to save my people and possibly the world.  But the struggle is overstated (through repetition) and skewed.  Elend decides to try diplomacy first, before attacking the city, hoping to convince its king that they can make an alliance, but when that fails, he feels he is forced to bring death and destruction on the people's citizens.  My problem with this is that the idea of \\"political assassination\\" comes up only a couple of times, and Elend quickly dismisses it, with the statement that that's just \\"not what we do.\\"  REALLY???  You bring an army of monsters to a peaceful city and struggle with the ethical quandry of attacking, but with barely a thought you decide that assassination is going TOO FAR?  I'm sorry but if someone thinks that a political assassination is too far beyond the line of decency, but STARTING A WAR that will kill THOUSANDS of people is borderline, they need to have their heads examined.  Sending an army of monsters to kill innocent civilians is so far beyond political assassination in ethical standards, it is unthinkable that the one should be considered and the other thrown out the window.  That, in my book, makes Elend Venture a complete moron who should not be leading a bake sale, let alone a kingdom.    Lastly, though there may be other problems, this is the other main one with which I had issues.  I don't know how many people noticed this, and I know it is mostly a style thing, but it seems that Sanderson absolutely refuses to use the word \\"but.\\"  Perhaps, for some people that's nice.  We don't have to have sentences riddled with five or sixclauses at a time, but is it really worth struggling through thousands of uses of the word \\"HOWEVER?\\"  It is not the fact that the auther merely uses the word, which is a valid word, in and of itself.  However, this particular word is the kind of word that is meant to make someone... slow... down... and... pay... special attention.  When you read this word it can be substituted for the normal use of the conjunction, \\"but\\"... However... it is usually meant for... EMPHASIS.  It is not meant for a permanent, transient, replacement.  Basically, all I'm saying is, he uses this word as often as another auther would usually make a new clause with \\"but,\\" and it really, I mean REALLY, breaks up the flow of the the book.  It's fine, once in a while, for Sazed to use it, because it is the kind of word a lecturer would use to stop someone in their tracks when their line of thought is about to go to the wrong place, but it really shouldn't be used by most of the other characters, as most people really don't use it all that much in everyday life, and it really shouldn't be used that much by the narrator.  It might be a fun and useful exercise for a writer to try writng a short story without ever using the word \\"but,\\" but with a published work, it should be edited to include the times when \\"but\\" is appropriate, which is most of the time.      Okay, I'm done ranting.  Except for these three primary complaints, I really enjoyed this book.  I would give it between a three and a four star rating, but I can't, so because the second book was such a drag and this one left me pleasantly surprised, I still offer it a generous four stars.
B002ZIAC26|4.0|Teen Dream is full of lush melodies suspended in a backdrop of intricate soundscapes. Its ambient and soft in the way lo-fi instrumental records are, but still demands your attention as to not put you to sleep or fade into the background. I can only compare it to Fleet Foxes, but unlike them, Beach House manage to make more complete and cohesive songs.      In my mind two tracks stand out. That being the first and last track    'Zebra'    I dont know what it's really about, its mostly a feeling, like looking at a striking painting. Her voice is largely inaudible but now and again I pick up phrases \\"black and white horse.. arching among us\\". My mind goes places. A feeling seeps through the canvas.   For me, it surfaces that feeling I get when Im out in nature, away from suburban landscape. That moment when I realize where I am and remember where Im from, the two are such contrasting existences. Maybe here, it is being among animals... and seeing that zebra \\"Anywhere you run... you run before us\\" and to admire it for what it is and has been, long before we ever came along.       'Take Care'    The great thing about this love song is that it stays grounded. Unlike the usual power ballad that claims love for \\"inifinity\\" \\"forever\\" \\"always\\". She sings for the moment.. not forever not always... but right here and right now. She can see their love growing and in a year or two, she is sure she will wed him... take care of him... its genuine and yet somehow still retains an airy lightness to it. Its not your impulsive love anthem, but it is absolute in ways they could never be.     Im sure you will find your own favourites
B002S0OBN2|5.0|At first, after reading the synopsis of the story I thought it would be a hokey CD. I couldn't have been more wrong. I love the repeated melodies throughout, the soaring vocals of Christine, the pain and anguish of both the Phantom and Raoul. In short, it far exceeded my expectations. I am eagerly awaiting it's Broadway debut this Fall.

067101756X|4.0|Insidestraight gave a very balanced and personally involved review of this book. But there is one other possibility to his assumption that author Corso merely had a lot of \\"stories.\\"<br /><br />After the book came out Corso's son said (on a TV interview) that his father told him that (in essence): \\"You ain't seen nothing yet.\\" Because (he said) that the revelations in his book were only about 10% of what could be revealed. Corso never said he was violating his confidentiality agreement, or going against orders, or revealing classified information.<br /><br />I think it is possible that the material he used in his book was formally de-classified and thereby cleared for publication, while other things that Corso knew were (perhaps) not cleared. I have read from several sources that the military has adopted this type of policy now - (I.E.: to begin to slowly revel what they know about ET and alien technology.)<br /><br />So in the bookstore when Corso was having a personal conversation with the young boy, he may have been revealing more of what he really knew, instead of making up stories... But that's the problem when people tell half-truths - you never know which of the half they are telling.<br /><br />A good reason for FULL disclosure.<br /><br />c.bard

B00005B36H|5.0|This is not music, it is transcendental art. Bang your heads, scream at the top of your lungs; you are embodying something more powerful than its constituent parts. Breathe in, breathe out; swing on this fantastic spiral. Listen closely and you will understand. And maybe, just maybe, you will find what you have been looking for all along... I think I have. A two word summation: Life affirming.

B002VKE1K2|3.0|This was actually pretty good.  Decent plot.      In 86 minutes, there's about 80 minutes of plot/cheap tricks.  And maybe a combined total of 6 minutes of totally scary stuff.
080508990X|5.0|I love these books - wonderful illustrations and fun for kids... Plus in a board book, virtually indestructible!
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|My kids just loved it!  My 2 year daughter can't get enough of this DVD.  I rank it up there as one of the all time bests you want to keep in your collection.  Very moving.  You'll find yourself going through a range of emotions, and at times even getting tears in your eyes.  Great animation and special effects, combined with a good story makes for a wonderful experience whether it's your 1st time watching it or your 20th.  Enjoy!
B002VECM4A|1.0|What is redeemable about a movie whose main character is so completely abused?  What is to be learned from such a life, whose only outlet for survival is boring fantasies, followed by a child whose father is unmentionable?  Is the theme: Just keep going?  Well, that seems to be negated by what happens to her in the end.  There's no real win for Precious, just a temporary smile on the way to amplified losses.    This movie is the stuff Soap Opera's are made of, fluffy shallow filling, and I don't like Soap Operas.  I don't care what the setting and socioeconomic status is, that isn't a reason to love a movie.  A brain tumor followed by a long lost father out for revenge for my second-cousins failed pizza joint is just as ridiculous as what Precious goes through.    Brick by boring brick the main character's miserable life just gets worse and it's taxing.  There's no contrast between happy chords and sad ones, it's just an endless baseball bat being swung.  \\"Think you feel bad for Precious?  Well how about this?\\"  I feel for Precious, but it's nothing but pity, and no one goes to a movie theater to feel pity.  You go for rolling hills of experience at best or to bettered at superbest, and this one is just a hole that keeps getting deeper.    This movie gets the worst criticism any entertainment can get:  It's boring.
0312330871|5.0|Most of the Agatha Christie books I've read have been awesomely bad, but this book is just awesome.  Ten strangers trapped on an island, being slowly murdered by one of their own for their past crimes.  In true Agatha Christie fashion, when you take a step back and look at how many coincidences had to work out just right for all of the pieces of the killer's plan to work, it's an absurd concept, but internally, it's consistent.  Considering that there are only about 200 pages and ten main characters, Christie does an admirable job drawing out the complexities and personalities of her characters, and the tense scenes after the suspect list narrows to four are especially well done.  Christie even manages to avoid most of the rampant classism so present in her other works (although there is a fair amount of gratuitous anti-Semitism - the killer's henchman is Jewish, so of course everyone needs to bring that up in a derogatory way when they talk about him).  Yes, the whole thing is a little ludicrous, but it's a great quick read, and I highly recommend it to anyone who thinks he doesn't like reading mysteries.  This one is a classic that has earned its reputation.
B0039OGGVQ|5.0|Amazing solo effort. A lot of times a great musician will branch out for a solo effort and come up slightly off base i.e. Chris Cornell \\"Scream\\" or you will think what would have been with better supporting players i.e. Scott Weiland \\"Happy in Galoshes\\". This disc does neither, but more reinforces how much Slash's instrumentals compliment and even elevate any material they are matched to. A must have for G n R and Velvet Revolver fans alike.
1401223176|2.0|I don't really see the appeal of this book...  Yes, the art is nice, in a nineties way, and the pace is pretty good over the span of the whole collection.  There are some fight scenes and some explorations of Batman continuity, but.. it's not good.  The story is presented as a mystery, in which one character is shown to be the only real suspect, and then after ten issues or so, other suspects emerge momentarily but never for more than a few pages.  Is a reader supposed to be surprised at the semi-reveal at the end?<br /><br />Also, there are token appearances by about a million heroes and villains associated with Batman (like Loeb's work in The Long Halloween), but no one is really given enough time to be an effective and worthwhile addition to the story, at least from the perspective of a reader mostly unfamiliar with DC comics in general and Batman comics in particular.  The exception is Catwoman, and her growing romance with Batman forms the emotional arc of the collection, but I never really bought it.  I'm not a fan of stories where characters say \\"I have feelings for her\\" a lot but do not really seem to demonstrate those feelings - that may be a key part of the stoic Batman's character, but I found it irritating.<br /><br />In context, maybe this series of issues had value, but as a new reader, I just found them pointless and underwhelming.
B002ZFQD04|3.0|Don't get me wrong. I think Madonna is amazing and the DVD quality is great and the way it was cut really makes you feel like you're in the audience however its not her best tour. This really just seems like a b-version of the Confessions tour.  Its still technically impressive but the substance isn't there.  The staging doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense either.
0684833395|3.0|This book is about 350 pages too long.  It's not that it's bad, it's just that Heller makes himself quite clear in the first thirty pages and then ensnares the reader in chapter after chapter of \\"War as an Endless Sitting at the Mad Hatter's Tea Party.\\"  I think that the length and density and madness of the book is itself part of Heller's unique take on the \\"War is Hell\\" theme, but I still wish he had chopped out a dozen chapters or so.      The book doesn't really have a plot, exactly, as instead it examines a number of characters involved in WWII in Italy.  There are some plot points, like a particular mission in which Snowden is killed, but the plot does not advance so much as loop back on itself in a Gordian knot until the last fifty pages or so, where the structure makes a welcome shift to a more straightforward but significantly darker series of events after an accidental mid-air collision.      There are some very amusing moments in this book - I laughed out loud at some of the developments in the Glorious Loyalty Oath Crusade, and some of the more nakedly amoral actions of Milo (the ultimate capitalist) - but it's not exactly a laugh-out-loud funny book overall.  Heller seems more inclined to use humor to engage the reader in the absurdity of war, and I don't know that he's entirely successful at each attempt.      Overall, I see why this is a classic, and I'm happy that I let my fear of peer pressure stop me from giving up after the first hundred pages, but I can see why it's not for everyone.
0971407614|5.0|UPDATE: There is now a companion app for iPhone available on the app store! Search for \\"You Are Your Own Gym\\" on iTunes. This app goes great with the book since it allows a user to use timers for the workouts.    INTRO    This is an awesome book with a great introduction using the author's military experience. I've been using the workouts for a short while and already notice my ass getting kicked by stuff I wasn't doing in the gym.    PRO'S    * The 10-week workout plans are awesome, and the beginner workouts will challenge strong guys that come from a weight training background. They are written in such a way that a beginner can jump in and get in shape with less than an hour a day (usually 15-30 minutes). They are very detailed and describe which exercises to do on which days. They also describe what type of set/repetition methodology to use, such as: ladders, tabatas, interval sets, etc. Slowly the workouts transition from high-volume/low-intensity to high-intensity/low-rep and finally alternates between the two rapidly. It may remind a lot of people of P90X, except it's a fraction of the price and with more sensible theory explained.  * This book is an excellent fitness reference with over 100 bodyweight exercises categorized by one of the following types:  PUSH, PULL, LEGS, and CORE. In addition to this, there is a set of exercises that develops all of the body's muscles.  * The theory behind the programs are also included so that users can formulate their own programs.  * Almost all of the workouts in the book can be done inside with minimal equipment. Great for people who travel or are on a budget.  * People who weight train at the gym a lot will notice they are getting more range of motion and working out more muscles. E.g. If you do squats at the gym, the side lunges and 1-legged Romanian dead lifts will hit other muscles you neglected while improving stability.  * Diet theory and suggestions are included in a dedicated chapter, but not so much data that itoverloads the reader. The main emphasis of the book is still on exercises.    BOTTOM LINE  Great job Mark on putting together these 10-week programs. This is a great book and I hope to buy another copy from the next edition of \\"You Are Your Own Gym\\" by Mark Lauren!
B0018O4YSQ|5.0|Dark City is an intelligent and enthralling film, and after watching it you will be a fan for life.  It is an interesting blend of sci fi and film noir, and a beautiful film to behold. It is not a perfect movie, and has some flaws, but all in all it is a unique and interesting movie. For those who draw comparisons to the Matrix, I would point out that Dark City came out the year before the Wachowski brothers' excellent film. I would also add that criticism claiming that director Alex Proyas rips off Lang's Metropolis or Otomo's Akira, are completely off base. There is a difference between ripping off and paying homage to someone's work. Dark City pays homage to Lang and Otomo, but is by no means the bastard child of either film. This movie stands as a classic all on its own.
B002VECMAE|3.0|This is what happens when you have a film with a brilliant cast, some individually brilliant scenes and some individually brilliantly directed and scripted scenes... but in which the individual scenes transcend the plot.  As a result, the film seems to aim wondrously.<br /><br />The coming attractions and PR made me really want to watch it... but about half way through the film I just didn't get where it was going, and shortly after that I wondered where it would end and kept wanting to turn it off, though each time there would be at least one laugh out loud scene to break me out of the zen like stupor and reaching which would keep me from going for the remove.<br /><br />What fails is that the plot seems thin and almost improvised... It goes like this:  What if the U.S. had a para-normal paramilitary unit... and suppose it was lead by an aging new age hippie, carried on by his wacko G-Gordan Liddy meets New Age movement disciple... and what if (well, I won't spoil the film's effort to have a conclusive ending...)<br />still what if a journalist (by fate) was let in on the secret and there was some great big cover up.  What if???<br /><br />Using a similar CONFESSIONS OF A DANGEROUS MIND type marketing ploy (i.e. its really... can you believe it?  Well, probably you don't... then again...) the film makes you want to watch it, but really its just a series of schticks thrown into a story that doesn't quite work with George Clooney, Kevin Spaces and Jeff Bridges playing the roles they typically do.<br /><br />Ensemble seemed to be having fun though...<br /><br />All in all, I probably would have enjoyed it in the theater, but like a barn full of goats, I'd have to call this one a bit of a stinker...  It would have worked far better as a straight sketch comedy vehicle than a... urm... dryly sardistic movie...  then again, look who's in it!<br /><br />On a positive note... it didn't win a DOFCA Award (Central Ohio Film Association.)
B0031ZWZR2|5.0|The first part of Season 1 of Flashforward is some great TV! If you enjoy shows like 24, LOST, or Fringe (others that I watch) you'll love Flashforward.  The show has some great solid characters and deals with some complex paradoxes that drew me in since the first episode.  First, I believe the solid characters to be John Cho (from Star Trek) and Sonya Walger (LOST and Terminator).  Their acting is great and their stories drive the show. I won't give their stories away, but it does beg the question: What would you do if you saw your future?  That drives us into some of the paradoxes or grand questions that the show dives into.  Can you change fate? Is the future known? Could doing something to avoid your unwanted future actually cause it! I'll admit, there are a few side stories that are lame compared to the two or three main ones that drive the show.  But, these are over shadowed by the complex character relationships, sharp action sequences, and edge of your seat tension.  I look forward to seeing where Season One part 2 will end up and can't wait for more of this show!
B002L6I9Z4|4.0|I guess I don't understand all the people complaining about poor photo quality... what do you expect for a kids' toy?  We just turned the flash off, and the pictures are adorable.  It's so easy, my four year old has no problems using it, the battery stays charged for a long time, and it's easy to download the pictures onto the computer.  My daughter absolutely loves it.  I recommend getting a case for it, though, especially for little kids.
B002VECM6S|4.0|\\"The Blind Side\\" is a feel-good movie that will get your tear ducts flowing if you're a sentimentalist like I am. But if you let your intellectual critical faculties loose, you may feel as I do: I don't believe in the story as presented, I don't buy Sandra Bullock's character, and I found the acting uniformly poor. When Sandra, Mrs. Fashion Plate, a decorator, took into her home the big hulking African-American boy, I didn't believe it; nor did I believe it when she storms onto the field and orders the coach around. I didn't buy any of her family, and their acting certainly didn't help close the sale. Sandra plays a nervy, bossy character, but it's hard to suspend disbelief when she confronts some homeboys in the projects and claims she's packing.<br /> Kathy Bates plays the boy's tutor. Now if she had been the central character in the story, playing Bullock's role, I might have bought the story and the wife's character, but then the movie wouldn't have made hundreds of millions of dollars.<br /> This is the true story of a NFL lineman. Bullock, her husband, and Bates were all Ole Miss graduates and rabid football fans. In the movie the suggestion is made that this oversized boy was taken into the home deliberately to groom him as a future football star for Ole Miss. That would make more sense than the story as it stands. The movie has a lot of football game footage to satisfy sports fans.<br /> That the husband was so supportive of his wife and so uncritical, I find hard to believe. Sandra Bullock wanted to be a glamourpuss and a high-minded Christian do-gooder at the same time. She won an Academy Award for this role, so perhaps a lot of people out there thought she was the best of the best for that year.<br /> I don't buy the story, the characters, the acting - the whole nine yards, but I can understand the film's appeal to countless fans.
B0038KHTI0|5.0|Tobias has prepared a special CD set here.  It's literally two hours of non-stop awesomeness!  I cannot stress enough that every song on both albums are of the highest quality.

B002IYEQR4|5.0|To begin, this is not the kind of movie you buy if your a casual/typical movie watcher, if you are a normal run of the mill movie enthusiest then you should most likely look to the standard edition of this movie to have in your collection.    With that out of the way lets make it clear this \\"Ultimate cut\\" has been made specifically for the hardcore Watchmen fans, this movie weaves the \\"Tales of the Black Freighter\\" side story directly into the extended edition release, its as close as you can get to the graphic novel with out actually reading it, the movie clocks in at just under 4 hours, again if you loved the novel you'll watch every second of it.    It comes really nicely packaged in a all-in-one box with two slide out cases, one containing the Graphic novel motion comic, which is a nice rendition of the graphic novel in its original art work and narrated this disc clocks in at five hours because it is read page by page right on your screen, and the second case is what contains the actaul live action movie and a second disc that has all the speacial features you would come to expect with a package of this kind, all in all a well thought out package to proudly display in your collection.    There also is a third disc that contains a digital copy of the theatrical version of the movie(not the Ultimate cut that comes packaged inside),  which comes in at about 3 hours.    In Blu-Ray the movie looks amazing and clear, every scene is shown to you exactly as you would hope a High definition movie would.    Note to the Hardcore: The \\"Tales of the Black Freighter\\" addition in the live action movie is the annimated version that was released prior to the movie's release on dvd/blu-ray, it is NOT a live action sequence as the rest of the movie, these sections of the \\"Black Freighter\\" are narrated by Gerrard Butler <-------(leonidis from 300)

0312383347|5.0|Once again another wonderful easy reading book by Janet Evanovich.  This is a great book and there were parts of it that had me laughing so hard. I love the way she descibes the characters in her books, this one especially.
0307712508|2.0|I hoped this book would tell the amazing story of the life of a seemingly insignificant woman who lives on through her cells, and continues to contribute perhaps her greatest achievement, helping science unlock the keys to diseases. It should have been about how this woman touched every life in the modern world and made their life better.    Although the book starts off this way, it was as though the publisher kicked back the manuscript and said \\"more sex\\". Awkward passages appear about incest in Henrietta's family, then more stories about her relatives trysts that bear no value in the telling of Henrietta and her cells or of the science or scientists that studied them.    Soon, the book drones on and on about her second and third removed relatives sexual relations and complaints of: \\"po me\\" and \\"I ain't got no money\\" and \\"white folks stole her cells\\" when, in fact, her cells were harvested at a time when no one was paid, no permissions were customarily asked, and the authors own book conveys a time in medical research where medicine was more collaborative than today when patents are issued on human genes that we all share.    After giving the author most of the first half of the book to get her story back on track, I popped the audio CD out and gave it away to a physician friend who had worked with HeLa cells and might get farther than I did. Too bad this interesting story was dragged through the mud of life of her uninvolved relatives.
B00005JOHC|5.0|this is the funniest show on television for adult men.  need I say more?
B0030AOE0Y|3.0|but you've gotta be kidding me. This DVD was a Target Exclusive that came out at the same time the Ultimate Edition Blu Ray's did. This DVD was $8 on sale- $11 regular. The extra content is the same stuff you've seen a dozen times when ABC broadcast HP:SS, so it's not new unless you've missed their showing the last 4 years it's been playing. But to pay THIS price when it was on store shelves for 25%???    WOW- this is crazy. For 7 minutes???
B001FB55I0|5.0|Blu Ray is the only way to watch this movie...excellent sound with surround sound setup and the picture is extra crisp.
B0039OGGVQ|5.0|It's very hard to hate Slash because he is just so cool. He makes the guitar sound sexy as hell. With his black top hat, a bottle of Jack Daniels by his side, and a cigarette in his mouth,  makes slash is one of the most recognizable and iconic guitarits in rock. Not only did his former band Guns n roses make some of the best rock ever recorded, but they also had some epic music video's to go along with them (November rain, Estranged) Even his second band Velvet Revolver made some killer music. So when I heard that the new Slash Cd was coming out, I was beyond excited. And let me tell you it lived up to my expectations. While the new Slash album doesn't break any new ground and plays it pretty safe, it is still enjoyable as hell. It's got everything from Fergie to Lemmy, how can you go wrong with that? The Fergie song rocks so don't let the name Fergie turn you sour to the album because the track is really good! Infact Fergie could very easily do a rock album and it wouldn't sound out of place at all. Shes got the pipes for rock and is a nice piece of eye candy( and there is nothing wrong with that) My favorite Track is the Lemmy Track called Dr Alibi. This song just flat out ROCKS! A Straight up rock song that will keep you banging your head and leave you wanting more. The first single \\"By the sword\\" features Andrew Stockdale of Wolfmother. It's a killer song with just a hint of Led Zeppelin in it. Stockdale's vocals are AWESOME, infact If you havent checked out any music from Wolfmother, you are missing out. Wolfmother is a great retro sounding, 70's influenced rock band that has recieved limited radio airplay, which is such a shame because they rock. Pretty much every song on the Slash album is enjoyable and unique in it's own way. Its an album that that will satisfy the 40 year old rocker who grew up on GNR and the 11 year old rocker who plays guitar hero in the basement. I highly recommend this album. And please go out and purchase the album, don't download it.Show Slash some support by purchasing his music!
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|Compared to DVD, 300 is 300 times better in Blu Ray. So crisp you can see the sweat comming from the pores on the spartans. Excellent buy especially for the money. You just can't beat this price on amazon
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I originally reviewed this without having seen the original series and was clueless about the narrative and all its ideas.  But a commenter advised that I view the series first, that it was excellent and more than worth seeing.  Once I got it in blueray, I was astounded at its intelligence and fun.  It was with great anticipation that I re-watched this, and it was of course a completely different experience.  While this makes the film fan fiction, it is genuinely first rate fan fiction.<br /><br />In the series, you get to know the personalities, which form a peculiar balance of idealism and pragmatism.  I particularly enjoyed the tension between the captain and the freelance companion, which is left hanging.  Then there is the political situation or scifi scenario.  In the film, you see the background of Rain, which is far more interesting than in the TV series.  The characters commit themselves to a mission that relates back to their origins in the great war.  It is really fun and unexpected.<br /><br />I now see that this is a great series, even if it is a fan cult phenom.  Warmly recommended.
B003EVFHYG|5.0|It isn't often that I like a movie soundtrack enough to buy it. Apart from being slightly geographically challenged (there's a distinctively Celtic air weaving it's way in and out) this is an amazing soundtrack. There's a great balance between soaring through the sky, battling the bad guys, and \\"dancing\\" with a new friend. The movie is great on its own but this music really makes it take wing.
B001F0TM5I|2.0|I am a huge fan, but QT should stick to films that are not about dismembering young ladies for fun... everyone in the room (watching) got nauseous- it just really missed the mark for the people I know. Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction are among the best, so violence is fine... Planet Terror was a hit with the group. Deathproof quite easily was opposite in its effect and had moments and a general theme that was unhealthy and unnecessary for a man of talent (QT I mean).

B001QTXM5Y|3.0|I watched The Watchmen in the theatres and left very disappointed.  After watching it on DVD/Blu-ray/PPV a few times, I have revised my opinion ... a little bit.    I never read The Watchmen comic book.  I have read MANY comic books, over the last 30+ years and maintain a 1200+ book collection.  As a devoted comic book fan, I ass-u-me'd that The Watchmen was a \\"normal\\" comic book that would be the basis for a typical comic book movie.  I was very, very wrong.    Ironically, the character that exhibits the most classic heroic qualities is the one that everyone else in the movie calls insane:  Rorschach.  He is \\"compelled\\" to fight evil.  He can't turn his back on it, once he was brutally exposed to it.  Jackie Earle Haley does an AMAZING acting job.  I would have been quite happy if this was just a Rorschach movie.    The Comedian is a rapist and a cold blooded murder.  He rapes a fellow super hero.  He cold bloodedly shoots a pregnant woman (carrying HIS child) in the head.  His version of crowd control is to start beating people to a pulp, including a woman again, and then shooting the unarmed people with a shotgun.  HE is the hero??!!  The Comedian exhibits all of the traits of a classic villian.    There are two \\"normal/average\\" super heroes that don't really have any super powers, akin to Batman.  They seem like classic, good heroes ... until they wander into an alley and proceed to brutally maim and kill a bunch of muggers.  Bizarrely, they exhibit super strength when fighting, which I never really understood.    Mr. Manhattan is a virtual God.  He gets cranky and atomizes a bunch (20?) of people trying to interview him on live tv.  I sympathize with his view of the obnoxious media, but I don't think their murder is justified.  Mr. Manhattan also acts very non-God like, when he cheats on his aging girlfriend with a younger, better looking girl. (Not unlike the actor who portrays him, Billy Crudup, who dumped his pregnant girlfriend for the someone \\"hotter\\").The super hero/villian Ozymandias is billed as the smartest man in the world.  Oddly, that also makes him the fastest and apparently super strong also.  His goal is logical, of saving mankind, but brutal. Killing millions of people isn't the option that pops into most super hero's brains.  Why he is killing ALL retired super heroes, after one (The Comedian ... what a bizarre name for a brutal, sadistic psychopath) discovers his evil plan is unclear.    Seeing the movie again, at home, made me appreciate details of the film even though my overall opinion of the film didn't change.  As I said, Jackie Earle Haley's Rorschach is magnificent (and makes me want to see him recreate Freddy Krueger in the new Nightmare on Elm Street.  Based on Rorschach he will be great).  I hadn't remembered all of his performance from when I saw the movie in the theatre.  His interview with the prison psychiatrist really showed why he was a super hero.  He was eloquent and passionate and believable.  Rorschach's final death scene was heart wrenching to watch.  Mr. Haley is simply great.    After repeated viewings, I admired the visual style of the film, which was extremely well done.  As others have said, the opening credits are great.  The flashback's during Hollis Mason's fight to the death are perfectly interspersed with the \\"live\\" action.  It was clear that Hollis, as the original Nite Owl, was a formidable man.  If he wasn't so outnumbered, I'm sure the \\"old man\\" would have won that fight.    Overall, parts of the movie (Rorschach and the visual style) are very good, but funamentally the movie was not good.  Other reviews have said that the characters are \\"human\\" and \\"flawed\\".  When the \\"heroes\\" are so flawed that they are villians, something is very, very wrong.

0375413405|5.0|Very good cookbook, a classic. I've tried a lot of these recipes and they are crowd pleasers.
B000R4SMCW|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised that this plot had many twists - didn't see it coming. Loved the way it played out. And loved the soundtrack, excellent music. Ryan Gosling at his best, holds his own with Tony Hopkins.

0800141660|5.0|I've watched this film many times, even had an online chat with Lindsay Doran, the producer. This is a stunning film, and Emma Thompson's contribution as the screenwriter made this film a gem. Excellent cast, and of course, excellent scenery. Strongly recommended as a gift to a special person.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|Fun film, beautifully shot (\\"the fabulous two story living room), not surprising since Nancy Meyers has an eye for style and color. Well cast, story only has a few flaws, but easy to overlook. Excellent soundtrack too!

B002KSPKRS|5.0|Can't tell you how much I enjoy using this everytime I turn on my system!  Everything works like they say it does, and it does wonders for gameplay.  The 7.1 surround sound capability really ups the ante, and creates a whole new level to the play time I didn't think could be achieved!    One caution I would like to provide though is that the Microphone Monitoring feature doesn't allow you to hear yourself very loudly, so if you're prone to yelling when that sniper at the back of the map clips you as you spawn don't expect this thing to let you hear your true volume.    Other than that though, I can't rave about this device enough!  From what I can tell its still the best you can get, and even though the price looks steep, I haven't regretted it for a second.
B00006I53S|5.0|I made a lot of research before buying this lens. was looking for an \\"all around\\" lens for the usual \\"family use\\": hiking, family events etc. I was tired of constantly switching lens and having to carry a lot of equipment with me.  You may find that this lens doesn't get the highest scores in all the expert sites but for an average user like me (Canon 450D) I would just say: ignore it! the pictures come out crystal clear at any focal length, and your family will never notice any slight issues on the edges...  The focus is fast, accurate and relatively quite, although i must say that I don't see why USM is such a big fuss. It's not going to be a factor on my next lens for sure. I rarely use the manual focus option but it's nice to have. Again, not such a big deal.  The lens construction is good although not great. The zoom is not as smooth as I would expect. It's quite a big lens that gives you a real \\"pro\\" look but it's not huge so still easy to carry around.  On my 450D, 135mm is enough for most uses. It's nice to have as much zoom as you can but for a single lens this is really a nice zoom. I also don't see any limitation with the 28mm. It's good for most uses including landscape. The only issue I can see is with taking photos of buildings: sometimes you will not be able to fit the entire building in your frame.    Bottom line is: ever since I got it. I have not taken it off the camera... well, except maybe a few time when I used my 50mm prime for specific shots.
B000000OAC|1.0|Sadly, this Queen record is light years behind its predecessors. I was profoundly disappointed with this album upon it's 1977 release. I could never bring myself to purchase it then as I was subject to it ad nauseam via indiscriminating peers and mainstream radio. I bought it a couple of years ago hoping with the passage of almost 30 years my stance would have softened. With the exception of 'All Dead' and 'It's Late' this is a disposable record. Utter dreck. Actually 'Shear Heart Attack' is OK too but nothing here stands up to their groundbreaking earlier work. They set the standard with NIGHT AT THE OPERA and any of their other releases from 73-76. INNUENDO is also quite good. This one is abysmal. To say \\"I hate it\\" (*) is pretty extreme, however, simply saying \\"I don't like it\\" (**) doesn't exactly express how little regard I have for this record. This is where one of my favorite bands simply lost it.
1401923119|4.0|This is an exciting book that reveals a scientific basis for the demolition of the theory of genetic determinism.<br />In his work as a cell biologist Lipton discovered that the cell membrane and not the gene-containing nucleus is responsible for what happens in the cell. He thereby concludes that we are not controlled by our genes but that it is our interactions with the environment that are significant. His book thus provides a weighty contribution to the nature-nurture debate.<br /><br />He also refutes the old Darwinian beliefs that evolution occurs through combat and struggle, and confirms the validity of the work of the much maligned biologist Lamarck.<br /><br />I freely admit that many of the scientific details contained in this book are beyond my understanding. Nevertheless, Lipton's description of his enthusiasm when experiencing his big insight, and of the effect his revelation had on his beliefs, development and life as a whole make this book far from dry, and in fact fascinating.<br /><br />We learn from the book that regardless of our genes and our circumstances we can change our lives through our thoughts and feelings, though the author emphasizes that our subconscious programmes are a force to be reckoned with, re-programming thus being essential.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book!
0891419063|5.0|I first became acquainted with some of these characters in \\"The War\\". The series produced by Ken Burns . That is how I heard about E.B. Sledge.<br /><br />This book is the best book I have ever read about the Marines at War. E.B.Sledge was there.  There are no Gung-Ho, Hollywood type Marines in this book. This book is about the average American boy who wanted to fight.  Sledge tells all about the horrors he went through with his company. Some of Sledge's comrades are encountered in the T.V. series \\" The Pacific \\". This book has served as a reference for the series. If you can't stand reading about what these young men went through from \\"Boot Camp\\" to Okinawa then don't buy the book. This is also a great history book on WW ll.
B002361MJC|4.0|The fact that American diet hasn't changed that much after all those findings indicates ordinary citizens are losing the battle against big businesses.  It is indeed silly that Americans are paying lots of money to be unhealthy and fat at the same time.
B001AKTZPA|5.0|Another great album from this band. They have so much melody and sound so great. I really love this band. This isn't their best album, but it's still great.
B000024EXY|5.0|I was at the Seattle show, in 1976, their first stop in the lower 48, on this tour and this disc brings back some HUGE memories of that show. I had the double album on vinyl and this is a great replacement. Having been a fan since '71 and being familiar w/ Peter Gabriel at the mic, it was with \\"eager anticipation\\" that I was curious as to how Phil Collins was going to do w/ the mic. A huge fan of his drumming, I was pleased to see/hear a very decent replacement for Gabriel....tho I would love to have seen Gabriel, too. I had not heard of Chester Thompson, prior to this gig and was totally blown away by his talent's and when he and Collins dueled, well, I'd never seen/heard anything like it, before/since and I've seen everyone from Led Zepplin, ELP, Eagles, Yes, ZZ Top the Stones, Jeff Beck, Foghat, and all in between, since '69. This was by far the best show I'd ever seen. Especially to have seen Steve Hackett w/ the band and his incredible guitar work, oh my word!!<br /> The greatest shame is that this was not recorded for viewing. When they came on w/ the incredible laser/light show that they toured w/, it set the standard for concert's! These guy's were out to prove something! And that, they did. Get this disc! You'll not regret it!
B001AKTZPK|5.0|When I first listened to this album a few years ago I thought this was a greatest hits album. I can't believe how good every song is. Wow!
0307588335|5.0|Excellent recount of a highly placed trader in a firm run by leaders who think of themselves as royality.  Written like a mystery with month to month unvailing of the downfall of Lehman.  Great insight into the working of that side of Wallstreet.
B001FOPODS|5.0|I have shown this version in my music class as part of a unit on Peter and the Wolf.  The kids really enjoyed it.  What was even better, however, was that the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra showed this film with them playing the music to a sold-out hall.  It was outstanding.  I would recommend this film.  Kids love it.  Adult love it.
B000JIHP88|5.0|I bought this for my 2 month old niece and she loves it. She kicks her legs and arms and make those happy baby noises. I am glad I bought this for her. I love to see her happy. The music is very soothing as well.
1579126278|5.0|In my opinion the detective novel \\"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\\" by Agatha Christie is one of the best detective novels ever written. The first time, I read this book when I was 13 years old, and I was already fascinated by it. I have always refrained from reading it a second time for a long time, but now, 33 years later, I could not refrain from doing so.    And I must confess I did not regret it. To the contrary, when you already know the end of the story you read it from a different point of view. You are not concentrated on the \\"who done it\\" question and, hence, you may come to following interesting conclusions:    (1) The story fits perfectly. You do not discover errors, even after the second reading. The reader is not misguided by mysterious events, which lead him into wrong paths and which are lost at the end of the story.    (2) The story is thoroughly designed. There are many side events which play a significant role in the whole plot, which contribute to the whole confusion during the investigation of the crime and which unravel themselves one by one with the help of Poirot's perfect analytic mind.    (3) The I narrator tells the story with much wit and humour which is due to the position in which he finds himself during the developement of the whole story.    (4) There are many hints which might lead you, the reader, directly to the murderer if you only concentrated on your subconcious common sense and read the text carefully.    With my knowledge of at least 20 Agatha Christie novels I must say that she has never written a second book like this. But of course, you only write a masterpiece once in your life.
B0030DHPGQ|3.0|Simply put: this book is a collection of examples designed to motivate the reader to take charge of his/her life and implement change. Unfortunately, though, the examples begin to become repetitive, with little new information really being presented after the halfway point.<br /><br />I liked it, it was an enjoyable read, but there's just something.... I can't quite put my finger on it, that's keeping me from recommending this to others.
B0000027D5|4.0|Passionate reminder of the wild-ride live act Santana once was in what must be one of their most explosive official classic live releases.
B002BZOVLG|5.0|Another outstanding Blu Ray Mozart opera production. Thankfully traditional costuming and sets, but acted and sung with skill and relish to the delight of the audience and this viewer. The three leading ladies are particularly good and their comic acting is very amusing. One wonders just what the young Mozart observed about the behaviour of the aristocracy in his travels because his operas reflect obvious disrespect for them, something which caused considerable uproar when they were first produced. In this opera he credits the maid, Despina, deliciously sung and acted by Ainhoa Garmendia, with more intelligence and astuteness to see through the disguises of the men, than the ladies who are supposed to love them!!<br /><br />As with most operas the storyline is thin and unbelievable but the artists in this Glynedebourne effort imbue the production with such delightful singing and acting one soon forgets the total improbability of what is happening and become completely immersed in it. This is the BD Mozart opera I have enjoyed the most out of a generally good lot.<br /><br />The audio and video are up to the usual high Blu Ray standards. We are fortunate to have been given so many top notch Mozart operas in this format. Unreservedly recommended.
B001993Y22|5.0|This movie is so touching and it dives in to the issue of the afterlife.  Humans tend to want to live forever.  We don't say why should I do such and such if I will die tomorrow.  In our minds, we live for today and tomorrow.  I love it!
B000GFLKF8|4.0|Inside Man is a Spike Lee directed \\"Joint\\" starring academy award winners Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, Jodie Foster as well as academy award nominee Christopher Plummer.<br /><br />This is a story of a successful bankrobbery by a wiley criminal (Clive Owen) and a New York Police negotiator, Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington). The robbers are always one move ahead of the Police Department and keep control of the situation. Not only have they taken over the entire bank, they have about 30 hostages to bargain with. It is a tense situation, and the robbers have the power. During the negotiations the bank chair (Christopher Plummer) brings in Madeline White (Jodie Foster), a tough, cold, yet pleasant power broker.  He needs her discretion to get something out of his safety deposit box to save his reputation. She has connections with the Mayor and asks him for access.  He owes her a favor so she is allowed to meet with the robbers in person to present a \\"deal\\".  After she leaves, Detective Frazier also talks to the head of the heist and threatens him.  Before Frazier leaves the robber says \\"I will walk out of here\\".<br /><br />As Detective Frazier continues negotiations there are flashbacks of hostage interviews  (so we know they are saved at the end) and witty scenes where the robbers are ordering pizza for hungry hostages.<br /><br />Overall the movie is an energetic, witty, enjoyable thriller that weaves throughout Spike Lee's familiar touching on race, power and class issues.
0061537969|5.0|I am not a \\"reader\\" by nature, but when the book came in the mail, not for me, I read the back cover and started in. I finished it in 4 days and I can honestly say I would read it again and I will always have this book on the shelf.
193413712X|3.0|You can't help but admire a writer who believes in his story after all the rejections, yet like a literary Rocky with a tiny publisher (think Burgess Meredith), he wins the biggest prize of all. That said, I found Paul Harding's bobbing and weaving a little tiresome at times. I know, his descriptions are masterful; his knowledge of clocks and the minutia of a traveling salesmen did, we'll all agree, create an admirable verisimilitude. But a story as dark as his needs some light, and there isn't much. The snowy bleakness, as blanketing as the deathbed ruminations of the main character. The father's epileptic fit I can relate to having used my handkerchief with one hand while driving with the other to the emergency room, one of several unplanned trips we've made over the few years. The broken stick, the reaching into the mouth, the gnawed hand by the spasmodic father was, I thought, a little over the top, but at least it was drama. In this short but long novel, poetry provides the succulence to sustain us, but like a five course meal, it can leave you feeling stuffed.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|I *LOVE* Community.  I watch an episode then I watch it again on Hulu, even the short clips are hilarious!  When the heck is this DVD going to be released!  It is a must have!
B0011UBDTK|4.0|Okay, I am completely in love with this series.  I didn't watch a single episode until after I was forced to watch the movie and discovered that I fell in love with each of the girls in two hours time.  I went through and rented each of the seasons and soon discovered that I NEEDED to own them.  I watch Sex and the City most mornings while I get ready for work because it's so fun and upbeat.    Now to this product specifically.  I have been able to watch all of the disks, however I have found that several of them freeze as if they are dirty and it takes a minute for my dvd player to read them.  I'm not thrilled with that since I JUST bought this product, so clearly I haven't had time to scratch or soil it.  The disks come in a BEAUTIFUL pink velvet covered photo album with episode details, fun quotes, and gorgeous pics of each of the ladies before the start of each season.    Overall I am very happy with the purchase, but I worried about how well the disks will read in a year if they are already having problems after a week or two.  That's the only reason that I gave it four stars instead of five.
0425180638|5.0|[[ASIN:1608609995 Hunt You Down]]  I have always been a fan of Patricia Cornwell. But when I finished reading The Last Precinct, something told me that I had finally finished one of the best books I would ever read. Her ability to tell the story through the eyes of each character makes for the most intense reading I have had in a long time. Having read some of the critiques, I am continually amazed how some people manage to become world authorities on authors. Most of these people have never written a word in their lives-let alone a novel, and yet they manage to live vicariously through the lives of authors. I suggest they sit down one day and actually try to write a novel. Let us be the judge. Well done Patricia! Keep 'em coming!!
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I just finished watching this movie and I am completely blown away.  After all the hype and hullabaloo I finally decided to see what it was all about.  I watched it on a 26 inch Sony flatscreen tv connected to my computer, and was simply mesmerized.  It was magnificent on my tv - many of the special effects had me gasping out loud to myself.  Pure video genius, far and away the best computer-generated imagery I have ever seen.  The story was thoroughly enjoyable, the acting was quite good, and of course the imagery just outstanding.  I'm thoroughly pleased and give it 5 stars all the way.  I'm very glad I bought the DVD and it will always be in my collection to watch whenever I get the urge.  I highly, highly recommend this to any sci-fi fan.  James Cameron has done it again - easily the best movie I've seen in quite some time.
0307266303|4.0|I didn't have very high expectations for this book, but it turned out to be a fast, absorbing, interesting read about ultrarunning, barefoot running, The Tarahumara Indians' running culture, and the evolutionary advantages of human distance running abilities.      It's one of those \\"can't-stop-reading\\" types of books.  I expected to read a few pages now and then, taking a couple of weeks to read, but I finished it in about 3 days of obsessed reading.  No doubt the author idealizes his subjects, but that's okay -- just take it for what it is.  All the personalities are interesting, and it's a glimpse into an unseen world of ultrarunning that completely absorbs the lives of the people who live within it.  I've known only one ultramarathoner, and the profile fits.    The Tarahumara are another story.  The book focuses on the place of running in their culture and on their running accomplishments.  It'd be great to hear even more about them, a people that values their invisibility and repels publicity.  Or maybe it's better not to disturb them.
0439023483|4.0|My daughter is an extremely picky reader, but this book thoroughly engaged her.  I kept finding her up waaaay past her bedtime with it (and was so thrilled about this that I just let her keep right on reading).<br /><br />Given her enthusiasm for this one, I had to read it also.  I loved it. The characters and plot are engaging, the details are satisfyingly addressed, and the first thing I did after finishing it was to request the sequel from the library (also very good, by the way).<br /><br />Pros: The book features a strong female character with spirit, brains, and ingenuity; her male counterpart is full of good-heartedness and solid integrity.  I like that it focuses on the benefits of being resourceful and thinking outside the box, something I think is so important for kids to start exploring at this age (Grade 6+).  The main character spends a lot of time weighing her own motivations and trying to do the right thing, but isn't presented as an unflawed mary sue.  The concept of sacrifice for the greater good vs personal integrity are key plot elements.  The main character listens to her own intuition and judgement, and does what she knows to be the right thing, even under enormous pressure from others.  Again, this is the age where kids are really starting to experience this sort of stuff in real life, and can't have too many positive examples, even if they are fictional.<br /><br />Cons:  It's a little dark, being a book about kids who are put in a gladiator-like scenario to fight to the death while their battle is broadcast live to the rest of the nation.  There is a definite theme of mistrust for authority (the government is corrupt in this series), which may upset some parents.  There are some tones of sexual manipulation-- nothing more than mild kissing, but the motivations are political, not emotional.  Again, this is not something that bothered me personally (actually thought it another great example of the main character having to wrestle with her own integrity in weighing the needs of the many vs. the needs of the one vs. the right thing to do), but it might upset some.  One of the more featured adult characters is drunk a good part of the time, and depression is featured in passing.<br /><br />Although the main character is female, there's enough action to satisfy a young reader of either sex.  It's also multi-layered enough for any adults who are looking for a quick, enjoyable read.he needs of the many vs. the needs of the one vs. the right thing to do), but it might upset some.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|This is hands down the best cooler for the money on the market today. If you have room in your case for having a 120mm fan jutting out on four enormous heat pipes then stop thinking about it and buy this! I have installed after market coolers ranging from 35-90 dollars on computer builds and this one takes the cake on performance. The newer quad and now hex core processors today throw off a lot more heat than our previous dual core generation CPUs. Even if you're running at factory speeds, get this. You won't be disappointing. I would suggest, however, that you use your own thermal grease over cooler master's included. While it is sufficient, Arctic Silver 5 or another competing performance brand of thermal paste is going to get you the best performance for your time and money.

0394800184|5.0|Are You My Mother? by PD Eastman uses the most simple of words and phrases along with a storyline which on the surface is so minimal and easy. But this book is weighted with gold. The story is a quest parable for the deepest of life questions, relationships, self-identity, safety, and meaning.     \\"Are you my Mother?\\" is the simple repeated question to which the youngest of children are able to relate. Silly animals are asked over and over, and even Big Snort the steam shovel is asked with comical whimsy. And yet, each time baby bird asks the question, it is pregnant with meaning! \\"Are you my mother?\\" means: Are you the one who loves me? Are you the one who will take me in and care for me? Are you the one upon whom I can rely, trust, and find this to be a safe world? Because I need to know the one who has brought me into the world and given me life. Read this to your children over and over, parents! They understand the emotional and relational content of this book. And afterwards, ask your children: \\"And who is your mother?\\"  Then, give a hug, share the relationship, assure with your presence.     As I am writing this, it's Mother's Day tomorrow. At age 52 I can still read this book and my heart is reassured: thank you, mother earth, for giving me birth, life, and a home. And my human mother's face I see on the last page, and I know who I am.

B000H5TVJY|5.0|This movie is great. It is sickeningly disturbing and a great movie that twists your mind. It is a movie where it expounds on the life of a rich wallstret suck up who is going insane, and indeed does crack a little. With a surprising, believable twist, with Ptrick Bateman (played by Christian Bale) going on a murder spree. No plot spoilers here, what I said was in the trailers.    The sad, miserable life of this rich man finally empties his soul of what little emotion he had left, where he vents his frustrations on his assistant and on unwitting victims.    Watch the movie to see the suck up go from polite to maniacal. A little too disturbing for my tastes, some parts seemed sad because Christian Bale plays such a supreme performance. I never thought I would have pity for a rich person, let alone a murderer.    Also, they don't have a lot of nudity. What they show are a few porn scenes but with literally one or two butt and boob shots that are about a split second, but I swear they let your imagination FLY. Man. The power of the mind.
0553381687|5.0|The plot basically was about power struggle among 7 lands' high lords, with their intrigues, lies, betrayals, loyalties, honors and friendships. Each chapter was narrated by different character, Princess in exile, winter land Lord, bastard Son, true Heirs, royal Lady and a dwarfed Lord.<br /><br />Some major events were experienced by several characters, then, the event would be told from different angle when each character took their turns to narrate. Therefore, a character that looked like villain in previous pages could become hero in the next pages. Some characters were cunning and evil at one situation, but humanly reasonable in another situation, made it impossible to love/hate anybody in particular.<br /><br />Characters were killed and died forever, when they miscalculated the risk they were facing. I was shocked at first it happened, shook my head in disbelief. I had half hoped the character would come to life again in some pages later. They never did, of course! The left behind characters would then adjust and cope in different ways, which was very interesting. I could not wait to find out how the future would unfold for those characters. I guess this was what kept me running through pages, and finished the first book so quick.<br /><br />Also, unlike many fantasy book whose arch nemesis was a Dark Lord sitting in his throne, out to destroy the world and humanity (thus made him evil), this book's evil was dark deeds in real life sense; tricking a child to trust and be killed, aborting unborn baby, incestuous relationship, exchanging sibling for power, and many mores, all done using lies and betrayals. Words used to describe the battles, the killings and sexual encounter, were bleak and harsh with no sugar coating, some found it offensive. But hey! This book is not for kids or teens. This is definitely a read for a more mature reader.<br /><br />A Game of Thrones has everything to make it an entertaining read. George Martin really knew how to tell a compelling story. Look forward to starting the second book now.tarting the second book now.
B0000E5NPZ|2.0|This is a boring, tedious film. The director has no interest in the screenplay, his actors (most of whom are bored beyond description), or, for that matter, anything else. And, Geoffrey Horne! He was the closest thing Hollywood had to a male Bella Darvi! Any wonder his career went absolutely nowhere.<br /><br />One or two saving graces, however: Georges Auric's score and the great Saul Bass's credits.
B00003CXWV|4.0|I really like this movie. I bought it on here a [Amazon.com] long, long time ago. The only thing you have to keep in mind is just because it is actually based on a true story & actual events does NOT mean it is an autobiography. In other words, there are of course going to be both added events & deleted ones as well. So, if you're looking for more of a biography &/or autobiography my advice is to purchase the book. However, this is a good movie & if you can just go into it either not caring that it's not a story told verbatim/word-for-word, or if you can separate the two, (book & movie) then, I really feel almost anyone will very much enjoy this movie. Besides, if you buy it on here you can purchase a used one for close to nothing, so if you end up to hating it then you at least you haven't lost much. I say go for it.
B002ZG974M|3.0|I am probably not the best person to review Thomas Balmes' 2010 documentary following the lives of four babies during their first year. The film is only 79 minutes, but it feels awfully long to this childless reviewer especially since it carries the randomness of a string of related YouTube videos. However, I am not a complete curmudgeon since there are several moments of delight to be found in Balmes' extended-shot approach which rarely goes above the eye-line of an infant. The director goes to four distinct places to highlight cultural dissimilarities and the universality of babies' experiences in responding to the world around them - pastoral Mongolia, heavily urban Tokyo, the Namibian desert, and kid-friendly San Francisco. There is no voiceover narration, just the gurgling noises, crying jags and first words from the babies in a fashion closer to a wildlife documentary.<br /><br />As for the babies who could technically be up for leading-category Oscars, there is Mari of Tokyo, who appears to show both a contemplative curiosity about the family cat and an artist's temperament in her epic fit when she falls to the floor and pounds her legs on the playroom floor. Hattie of San Francisco takes to her jumpy chair and her playground race car like Evel Kneival and actually has the film's funniest scene when she tries to escape her parents as they perform an unbearably pretentious Native American earth chant. Bayarjargal of Mongolia displays the most perseverance as he confronts the mayhem caused by a bullying older brother, thirsty goat, and an aggressive rooster. However, it's Ponijao of Namibia who steals the movie as the model of stoicism as she replicates her mother's domestic actions with just pebbles, dirt and the occasional piece of food. In fact, you might be amazed like me at how self-sufficient all these adorable babies are.
B00000K0E5|5.0|As I have been asked to review Golden Eye, I will say that it is the first movie I ever went to see in the theater multiple times. The opening scenes were spectacular! The characterizations and the actors, even their teeth, were interesting. I have seen this movie over 270 times since it came out. I had 3 copies and my daughter had 1 and all disappeared, so I purchased the special edition. We spent 3 hours watching the special features. Didn't even watch the movie that day. We did later. Still riviting! You can consider me a fan. I have all the Bond movies and at least some of the history videos. Golden Eye and especially the special edition, if you can find it, well worth the price.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|I liked the music.  The less than earth gravity alien ecology was well thought out. Considering that there was only a time-worn discredited political message instead of a plot and cardboard cutouts instead of characters, the film still was entertaining enough to almost rate 2 stars. Sigourney Weaver is a good enough actress to breathe a little life into her cardboard cutout.  Zoe Saldana had the only part that was designed to have life in it, and did a good job.  Michelle Rodriguez played her part with a laid back fatalism that pulled her cardboard character into a third dimension for a while.  The discredited political message that advanced technology is bad and environmentally destructive, that people who seek profits are inherently evil, and employ sadistic killers to advance their ecology destroying agenda, did not substitute for an actual plot, without which this movie is just a special effects showcase ending with all the innocent savages around the campfire singing kumbaya.  If you want to see the movie for its effects, wait a while, get the necessary technology as it becomes available, and wait for the inevitable re-release in 3D.
B002DKGWSE|1.0|The remake of The Last House on the Left does not deliver. Whatever promise any of you who have not seen it yet believe it holds, I suggest you stay away now. This film is horrible. One thing that irks me to no end is the IMDb rating. How the hell is this rated higher than the original? While the original is by no means a great film, it is still a horror classic.    I wonder what anyone could see in this.    The original was a remake of Ingmar Bergman's The Virgin Spring, and explored the concept of revenge: a young girl is murdered and when the murderers stop by the parents' home to spend the night not knowing that they've killed their daughter, the parents take action and dispatch those who killed their child.    Sounds brutal, doesn't it? The main difference is that the original tackled the topic almost perfectly. This one just goes way off the mark. While the original was a masterpiece in exploitation (and had excellent performances by the actors who played the criminals and sported some nasty rape and torture sequences that served to make Wes Craven a household name), the remake is just a trashy wannabe of a film that does not even graze the achievements of its predecessor. I'd say one should stick to the Bergman and the Craven editions overall. There was a light rehash on this material named Chaos, but that one was a failure on all levels.    This one is just sad.    A waste of talent on all levels (not even Monica Potter and Tony Goldwyn, whom I both like could save it) and there's something more disturbing about the annoying Sara Paxton playing their daughter (who survives, unfortunately--unnecessary change) that is more disturbing than the actual rape and torture sequences, which I found laughable.    I find it funny how anyone could label this \\"anti-human,\\" as some reviewers of the film did.    It's not. It's just a pathetic attempt at money. The blood and guts aren't even enough to satisfy gorehounds, and whatever great things anyone has heard of the ending, discredit them.    It gets you down.    I thank myself I saw this for free. No way would I have given this my money.

Nothing wrong with a traditional life as long as that is the life you really want to live, but most people live lives of quiet desperation feeling that there is no way out. Here is a man who shows us that it is possible, albeit a challenge. It takes courage and conviction and a vision to seek the possibilities of life that will lead us to and allow us to live our destiny.<br />Dr Gunta Krumins-Caldwell author of On Silver Wings
B0021L8V1G|4.0|It is inevitable to compare the sequel to it's 2008 original, and the first IRON MAN was great, fanboy status aside I recommended it to everyone....I would make the same recommendation for IM2, across the board.... But if you are a fanboy, you already know this because you went to the midnight show!<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr.  was talked about connected with the role long before it became a fact, so he is still dream casting for the role of Tony Stark, and he still exceeds expectations as the Industrialist, this time facing certain death due to his HEARTcondition. Tony overindulges in the Celebrity, parties and booze as he embraces while searching for a cure and trying to find himself, too . This is a classic IM storyline from the comics, as is his confrontation with WhipLash a.K.a Ivan Venko a.k.a. Mickey Rourke, out to reclaim his family right to the Stark Legacy. Meanwhile,  the government and wacky , rival weapons-manufacturer Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) are pressuring Tony to turn the IRON MAN tech over to the government. Once flippantly reassuring the Senate committee that he has things under control, Venko appears and all hell busts loose. Stark's best bud Col 'Rhodey' Rhodes (played this time Don Cheadle)is out to help Tony back on track while struggling with his own duties and responsibilities to protect the Country.<br /><br />The story is a little crowed with Whiplash working on his revenge, Rhodey overcoming his personal obstacles and Tony's, the slinky agent Black widow infiltrating Stark Industries while Tony's unrequited love Pepper Potts (Paltrow) takes over the Company while it appears that holding on to the IM tech was a mistake, once an armored super villain appears, and later a haywire drone army. Although, I would question the point of Scarlett Johansson's character , but for the super-spy cat suit fight sequence along with director Jon Favreau, which causes me to preemptively retract said statement and enjoy the spandex and party dresses. And Venko's backstory is thankfully short , as is the movie get to the action, from the Opening scene the film is high energy and beautiful graphics.... everything  from the dancing EXPO  girls...the Iron Man-ites, to  the fight between IRON MAN and War Machine (for non-geeks War Machine is the armor Rhodes wears during his time as IRON MAN in the comics, seen in IM1). In fact the fight between Tony and Rhodes at the party to a mix-music is worth admission!!!<br /><br />Cheadle as Rhodey was a good swap the great chemistry between him and RDJr., RDJr. and Paltrow still great. Robert Downey Jr. slips right back ...I'm reminded by IM2 why I was a such a hugh Rourke fan even thru the STUPId Yrs...he does soooo much with soooo little, count Rourke's lines, most  in Russian and tell me it ain't an amazing performance, the presences...(while you are at it look up Angel Heart and Prayer for the Dying, 2 great Mickey Rourke movies). Watch for an homage or two to other AVENGERS characters as the Marvel movies move grow ever nearer to those future releases.... Next stop Thor:The Movie....<br /><br />Again,  War Machine vs. Iron Man in the same film is worth admission.... War Machine teamed with Iron Man for show down, bonus<br />stayed after the credits...I advise you to stay....upshot on the film....it rocked don't let some Chicago Tribune reviewer tell ya different, (Tribune gave an uncalled for 2 1/2 ) like the first film, fanboyness aside, it was GOOD!kstory is thankfully short , as is the movie get to the action, from the Opening scene the film is high energy and beautiful graphics.... everything  from the dancing EXPO  girls...the Iron Man-ites, to  the fight between IRON MAN and War Machine (for non-geeks War Machine is the armor Rhodes wears during his time as IRON MAN in the comics, seen in IM1).

076790592X|5.0|What a beautiful book. What a wonderful way of presenting to the world what we all need to learn, and that is, learning to die so we can live! What a zest for life Morris had. Here was a man who really lived the moment. He was able to appreciate everything that life had to offer, but in its truest sense. Not the material wonders of the world, but the wonders of the heart and that living from the heart gives so much joy for yourself as well as others.

0142418471|5.0|Will Grayson, Will Grayson is a story about two teen-aged guys, with the same name, whose paths cross and intertwine.  Will Grayson lives in Evanston, Illinois. (He will be referred to as Will-E for this review.) He has two rules that he lives by: (1) Shut up and (2) Don't care too much. He flies under the radar for the most part. He's been best friends with Tiny Cooper (the 300-pound, loud, proud, look-at-me-I'm-gay guy that everybody loves) since they were in grade school.   Tiny is flamboyant, vivacious and screams confidence. He's definitely used to being the center of attention.  He's the guy that everybody likes and falls in love with, whether you are gay or straight. And he falls in love more often than he changes his underwear! Tiny is putting on the high school musical of the year and steals the show in this book.    Then there's Jane. Will-E doesn't know if she's gay or straight and he doesn't know if he likes her or not. Will-E doesn't date much and lacks skills in that department. Tiny tries his hand at match-maker by trying to hook up Will-E and Jane.  Will Grayson lives in Naperville, Illinois. (He will be referred to as Will-N for this review.) Will-N lives about an hour away from Will-E. He is depressed, angry and bitter. But at the same time, he just wants to be loved. He, like Will-E, doesn't have many friends. There's Maura, who understands his dark humor and puts up with his crap (and vice-versa). But Will-N can only take Maura so much before she starts to irritate him. He can only stand her in small doses. Derek and Simon are the computer geeks who Will-N sits with at lunch. The three of them are also on the Mathletes together.  Will-E was suppose to be with Tiny and Jane at a 21 and over club, to watch a band perform, but his fake ID turned out to be a dud (the ID stated he was 20 instead of 21). While Tiny and Jane get inside, Will-E walks around town killing time before they all ride home together. He ends up using his dud fake ID to get intoa p**n shop where he is greeted with:  *****  \\"You browsing or you want tokens?\\"  *****  Poor guy has no idea what he walked into! Wisely, Will-E chooses browsing.  Will-N is going to meet Isaac, his online boyfriend, for the very first time. The two have been chatting online for about a year and have decided that it's finally time to meet in real life. Isaac suggests the two meet at a place called Frenchy's, a place that Isaac's friend recommended. Will-N arrives at Frenchy's only to find out that it's a p**n shop.  As Will-E is paying for a magazine (a gag gift for Tiny for abandoning him), Will-N walks in. And this is where the two worlds of the two Will Graysons collide. Both being left abandoned, they sit outside on the curb and share their sorrows with each other. Things don't pan out between Will-N and Isaac. But that turns out okay because Tiny takes Isaac's place in Will-N heart and ends up being the common thread that binds the two Will Graysons.  You might be thinking that it would be easy to get the two Will Grayson's confused and mixed up while reading this book but Green and Levithan did an excellent job of separating the two narratives. Will Grayson, Will Grayson is told with alternating POVs in alternating chapters. The story from Will-E's POV is grammatically correct, whereas the story from Will-N's POV is in all lower case (even the names are in lower case). So it is easy to tell right from the start who's POV you are reading.  The premise for the book definitely caught my attention but the book blurb doesn't even give you a smidge of what's to come. Will Grayson, Will Grayson is a laugh-out-loud funny read that will capture your heart at the same time. This story left me with goose bumps (in a very good way). As I turned the last page and read the final line, I closed the book and thought to myself WOW!   You definitely do not want to miss out on this fabulous collaboration!  First line:  When I was little, my dad used to tell me, \\"Will, you canpick your friends, and you can pick your nose, but you can't pick your friend's nose.\\"  I normally don't give book acknowledgments a second thought (or mention them in reviews) but the ones in this book are worth taking at look at. It's at the back of the book and let me just say that this isn't your usual list of acknowledgments ;)
1442300051|5.0|I read this book straight through.  Very entertaining take on an incredibly technical and dry topic.  To those folks that seemed confused on if Michael was saying Wall St. were a bunch of geniuses or morons, I can only say that they clearly missed the message.  The simple answer to this is \\"yes\\".  You can find both genius and idiocy in what happened.  If anything, the only thing I would say is missing from the book was any kind of blame on those people who were lying to get their home loans.  The stipper character and the migrant worker were just as morally bankrupt as the people on Wall St.      Just as with illegal drugs, who is worse?  The person using or the person supplying?

B0018RBN8C|5.0|Duffy's Rockferry album honestly changed my music library. I first discover Duffy from the single 'Mercy'. The first time I heard I thought was good but then kind of forgot about it. Then I listened to it again and again and again. Then I was like I must get the whole album this woman is incredible! And boy she is! The album blew me away. Her sound is so unique, and the songs are moving. I know there is not a more listened to album in my library then Rockferry. I love the complete album, some of my favorites are Serious, Stepping Stone, Warwick Avenue, and I'm Scared. If you haven't already discovered Rockferry, this is one album you cannot go without.
1584282584|5.0|I am usually disappointed with most of Amherst photography books because they are generally full of gorgeous photos but not much about practical photography techniques.<br /><br />This book, On-Camera Flash Techniques by Neil van Niekrek is different. It discusses lighting concept and techniques very clearly. It does not have lighting diagram for every photos, but it has behind the scene picture which is even better.<br /><br />The book discussed about how to use on-camera flash. Most of the time, photographers do not have  luxury of having assistant to carry and hold reflector or off camera lighting gears or they don't have the time to adjust and set up. Most of photographers use on-camera flash.<br /><br />Neil shows us how to set up your camera and flash properly, how to direct the light, how and when to use flash modifier and how to deal with specific but highly encounter situations.<br /><br />You'll end up more knowledgeable about lighting, flash, camera modes, and most importantly, you can use this knowledge in practice right away. Highly recommended for photojournalists, wedding photographers and on location portrait shooters.<br /><br />Check out more book reviews on my blog. You can find the address through my profile page.

B000070IXT|2.0|My review is for the SUPERBIT release of this movie. SUPERBIT is supposed to represent the top of the line and best image quality a DVD can achieve and many times those DVDs are actually reference DVDs. Well, the quality in this SUPERBIT edition of RESIDENT EVIL is so so, not bad not good, just like any other DVD. It certainly does not do justice to the SUPERBIT term. Other DVDs that honor the SUPERBIT name are the FIFTH ELEMENT and THE BIG HIT version but this version is nothing to talk about. It is not as terrible as the other SUPERBIT DVD or Charlie's Angels but if you are buying this DVD for reference or video quality purposes look elsewhere.

B001HN69AY|5.0|Terry Gilliam remains one of the more idiosyncratic and creative writer/director/producer phenomenons in the business.  His ability as an illustrator and as a satirist date back to his college years at Occidental College in Los Angeles where he daily startled students and faulty alike with his broad but biting and well groomed antics.  For this viewer THE IMAGINARIUM OF DOCTOR PARNASSUS is one of his strongest forays in the field that can only be described as the Gilliam Genre. He combines a superb cast of characters portrayed by some of the finest actors in the field with his gift for creating visual effects that step beyond mere illustration but stay within the realm of painterly artistry instead of depending on CGI.  And despite the zany story line that is typical of Gilliam's output, he also has some strong philosophical points to make.  Comedy and fantasy combine to make drama in the line of Shakespearean creators.<br /><br />The story, written by Gilliam with and assist from Charles McKeown,  is a mixture of fairy tale an the Faust legend all played out in the present day world - with very special exit points through mirrors into the world of pure imagination.  Christopher Plummer gives great dignity to the immortal Doctor Parnassus who is the Faust of the tale - selling his beloved daughter Valentina (a wonderful Lily Cole) to one Mr Nick (the Devil) played subtly by Tom Waits.  Parnassus runs a bizarre sideshow with his daughter Valentina, his lead man Anton (Andrew Garfield) and the 2'8\\" Percy (Verne Troyer).  Into their lives drops (from a hanging under the bridge! rescue) the odd Tony (Heath Ledger, proving in his last role that he was truly a fine actor).  Tony helps Parnassus alter his pact with Mr Nick in a series of strange events and in the course of these events the character of Tony is developed as three others - Colin Farrell, Jude Law, and Johnny Depp.  The rest of the tale is left up to the audience to squeeze in the moments of high comedy and advanced, surrealistic creativity that Gilliam offers this project.  'All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely players: They have their exits and their entrances...'.  It is a pleasure to give into fantasy with Gilliam's films, and this one is a jewel!  Grady Harp, May 10surrealistic creativity that Gilliam offers this project.

0307454541|5.0|Highly recommended thriller.<br />Different than many other murder stories, this book develops the characters with a good level of depth. Their feelings, thoughts and human contradictions were very well crafted by Larsson. This further strengthens an already good plot, surrounding the disappearance of the granddaughter of a Swedish industrialist. A controversial journalist is hired 30 years later to try to solve this case, which is further complicated by the complex (and many times conflictive) relationships on the industrialist's family.<br />This book is a must for everyone that likes to read a good thriller. Again, as said before, it's significantly better than most of thrillers. Good read!

B002SV3KOM|5.0|Pianist, Aldo Ciccolini, is most remembered for his interpretations of Satie and Debussy.  Many consider his 1960's recordings of the complete output of Satie to be the definitive performances, striking a nuanced balance between quirkiness and fog that various other pianists might lean in favor of. What impressed me most in digesting this set was how versatile Ciccolini could be, with eminently respectable takes on Bach and Scarlatti keyboard works, and repertoire far beyond the French works he is most associated with.  This 56 CD set is enough of a bargain to take a chance on, and is chock full of enjoyable and less entrenched piano works by Borodin, Albeniz, Severac, and Granados.  However the cornerstones are 13 discs of Debussy and Ravel (mostly the former), and 11 Discs of Satie, including both traversals of his complete works (1960s & 1980s), with a few other extraneous performances included.
0061922315|5.0|I've had a hard time finding a book that I could really get into lately.  \\"Secret Daughter\\" solved that problem.  It is both a beautiful and heartwrenching story.    The characters are described in enough detail that you feel connected to them, but not so much detail that it becomes a character study.  One character in particular (Sarla) made me wish she was real so that I could sit down with her and talk for hours.    The story volleys back and forth between 2 women and their families...one who gave up her cherished daughter and the other who adopted and deeply loved the girl.  The story portrays the stark differences between the lives of 2 women and the opportunities available to them in life.  At one spectrum there is the American doctor who lacks nothing except a child and she of course is able to adopt Asha (the secret daughter).  At the other, Kavita is struggling for daily survival after moving from her rural village to Mumbai.      The book explorers women's roles, poverty, love, infanticide, hope, family, cultural traditions and more.    Well worth your time!

B0039SFKSW|3.0|With a band like Asia, and with a reputation like Downes/Howe/Palmer/Wetton, there are bound to be rabid fans posting here. I am not a rabid fan, just a fan. My objectivity is not so clouded as to make a poor judgment about \\"Omega\\", the latest release from the original Asia band members. I will also add that I like King Crimson, Yes, The Buggles and Emerson, Lake & Palmer (as well as Genesis, Rush, GTR, ABWH).<br /><br />As always, before I listen to a new release, I go back and listen to the previous albums leading up to the latest. That would be \\"Asia\\" (1982), \\"Alpha\\" (1983), \\"Astra\\" (1985) and \\"Phoenix\\" (2008). Why only those? Well, those albums had all four (or three) original members just like \\"Omega\\" does. Also, I'll be up front about my dislike of Wetton-less Asia, not that I have anything against the other Asia band.<br /><br />\\"Omega\\" suffers from the same thing \\"Phoenix\\" suffered from--age. What I mean by this is that I know these guys are all about 60 years old, but come on guys, I mean come on! There's no edge anymore. The old Asia fire is sorely lacking. Just go back and play \\"Heat Of The Moment\\" and crank it up. Howe's guitar man! Palmer's drumming man! Wetton's forceful vocals and lyrics that had a bite man! Listen to \\"Only Time Will Tell\\" and hear how good Downes synths were man! None of that type of fire appears on \\"Phoenix\\" or \\"Omega\\".<br /><br />These are old men playing old men music. The cheese is so thick here. Let me start with Downes' use of outdated synths when he needs to tear a page off from Trent Reznor's play book instead. The weakest choice on the entire \\"Omega\\" album is the outdated synths Downes employs. I literally had to adjust my listening to accept his hardware choices. The lyrics, my god, the lyrics. Asia is a Christian rock band now. Look at all the religious overtones here. Please no. Wetton's vocals are in fine form though. It's too bad he and Downes can't write better lyrics. You can be 60 and still have something edgy to say. I mean you have all that life experience to write about, right? Who says you have to get religious, or worse, \\"spiritual\\"? Say something damn it!<br /><br />So that leaves Howe and Palmer. Did Howe play on this album? I didn't notice. And that's a shame because he is a guitar god. Not here though. I'd rather listen to \\"Anderson, Bruford, Wakeman & Howe\\". Palmer's drumming? The one thing that could save \\"Omega\\" and Asia? Weak. His wrists must have arthritis because try as he may, his drumming is nothing notable here.<br /><br />\\"Omega\\" also suffers from poor production. This is on some podunk Italian label \\"Frontiers\\". \\"Omega\\" sounds like it was made in a garage by some Asia cover band. Where is a reputable producer when you need one? Especially to reign in these four guys. Being on an independent label affords the band creative license, but do we really want them to have that much freedom? No major label would touch \\"Omega\\".

And that's a shame because he is a guitar god. Not here though. I'd rather listen to \\"Anderson, Bruford, Wakeman & Howe\\". Palmer's drumming? The one thing that could save \\"Omega\\" and Asia? Weak. His wrists must have arthritis because try as he may, his drumming is nothing notable here.    \\"Omega\\" also suffers from poor production. This is on some podunk Italian label \\"Frontiers\\". \\"Omega\\" sounds like it was made in a garage by some Asia cover band. Where is a reputable producer when you need one?

B001P9EQH8|5.0|i highly recommend this product if you have a pair of Head-direct/HifiMan RE2's. I liked the RE2's before, but they completely lacked bass, and this gives you the option of bumping up the bass when you need it. also, it really allows you to crank up the volume considerably.  Head-Direct sells the RE2/E5 combo for $40+ shipping and i am very pleased with the sound from this duo.    (i use this for music on my blackberry and laptop)

B002JVWRAO|5.0|This is a great show, watched it from the first beginning. when they wernt sure on how to kill this to now. this final season is just as good as the first. I think they will probaly have a spin off of this show maybe with bobby and cass. dont know but where can you go though. they killed everything from ghost to now fighting the devil. so dont know if the show will have a spin off or if it did what direction it would take. but then again im no writer. this seaason they have to put lucifer back in hell after sam unnowingly realeased him and in order to do that they have to get the four rings of the hoursemen then get lucifer back at the gate so they can open it and put him back in hell. all the while why dean trys to avoid the angels and keep micheal from takeing over his body to fight lucifer and killing almost every human on the planet. this show has it all if you watched it for the last 4 seasons like I did. the charactoer went from young boys just getting started in the life to killing vampire in their sleep. they both struggled with haveing to live the life and not have a home to call their own or loosing both parents. to just fighting each other. sometimes fun to watch and other time sadd. you can really get into the life of the characters in this show and c the pain and uncertainty that they go throught with makeing the tuff decisions every day. exspecally dean he went from a wise cracking tough guy to a down on his knees praying for some help average joe. and sam went from this college whole life in front of him familly man to a guy trying to be the tough guy because he sees his big brother struggling hero. know he messed up big time with the choices he made and trying so hard to make up for it and prove himself again. you even see the characters bobby and cass change from when they first appeered. this show just rocks and I dont know any show that can compete with this show in haveing it all. It's funny, sadd, scary, heart breaking, exiting, never boring never the same old same old. just nothing comes close to this show in my opinon. so yes id say buy this season and the last four. youll be wathcing them over and over.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Daria: The Complete Animated Series<br /><br />The Complete Series in Full-Screen Format (Five Seasons and 2 Movies) on 8 Discs with a running time of 1606 minutes! Whoa! This will be released on DVD on May 11th.<br /><br />Who can forget Daria Morgendorffer? Even I, who did not grow up with cable and wouldn't have been allowed to watch it if I did since teenagers were speaking rudely to their parents, knew the impact \\"Daria\\" had on the hearts and minds of the young. Watching it fresh for the first time as a 26 year old, it makes me flash back to those days in high school....*shudder* and I feel her pain that can only be combated by truly brilliant sarcasm.<br /><br />The series \\"Daria\\" paints a picture many young people are familiar with of high school jocks, cheerleaders, nerds, antisocial elitists, and the most ditzy \\"popular\\" younger sister along with a phony suburban mother and a clueless father. Parents have a lot of trouble understanding their kids when they get in high school -- case closed, there is no argument here. High school is a brutal trial by fire that is supposed to be some of the happiest days of our lives. Then thank goodness we graduate and move on to bigger and better things. Even college is scorned in this show as a series of frat parties, keg stands, and paying people to write your papers for you without a hint of real nostalgia. (Tangent: Yes, college is supposed to be the next stage of the \\"best days\\" and it too can have wonderful, endearing moments way more than high school every could, but wouldn't it really be great if we lived every day in the present without looking back or forward? I could be on to something here. Just sayin'. ;-) )<br /><br />The character Daria just doesn't fit in anywhere and doesn't WANT to. She scorns everyone and would much rather sit back with her friend, Jane and puzzle on the mystery of other people's idiosyncrasies. Her sarcasm is hilarious and unforgettable as she would tell a whole sub-population of people to go to hell if she actually cared about them. If you looked up \\"indifference\\" in the dictionary, you would probably see her picture.<br /><br />This series ran for five seasons and even included two movies, all of which are included in this set. Unfortunately it is in full-screen, but what can you do? It ran from 1997-2002. A major difference that might be noticed by fans of the show that is addressed in an insert in the case is that 99% of the music changed because of the cost of licensing it and that's why it's taken so long to release this collection.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />The Pilot episode \\"Sealed with a Kick\\" is included as a bonus....I thought it was part of the collection *shrug*. Also you get to see Mystik Spiral's music video \\"Freakin' Friends\\" featuring Trent Lane singing. There are written character profiles on EVERYONE so that should keep you occupied for a while if all the other content wasn't enough!<br /><br />The two movies in the series are included as extras on the last disc: \\"Is It Fall Yet?\\" and \\"Is It College Yet?\\" They are both like extended episodes in the spirit of the series. The Fall one focuses on summer plans and College obviously on the future.<br /><br />Top Ten Video Countdown hosted by Daria & Jane is great if you like the MTV's countdowns. You get to see Daria and Jane using as much sarcasm as possible in their introductions but it does not show any of the actual music videos since that would require too much licensing. Mystik Spiral spin-off script is a DVD-ROM extra available for download. It is a third draft that was never made into a series.<br /><br />The cast and crew interviews give a lot of background to the series. MTV was looking for an animated series that would appeal more to women and Daria started as a character on \\"Beavis and Butthead\\" and decided to create a spin-off with her and they needed a strong female protagonist. The show developed naturally without a lot of direction and it was pretty much afree-for-all in the first season. The same voice-over actress, Wendy Hoopes voiced Quinn, her mother Helen, and Daria's best friend Jane by using different registers in her voice.ed Quinn, her mother Helen, and Daria's best friend Jane by using different registers in her voice.

0767903862|4.0|Bill Bryson has one of the most enjoyable voices in travel writing specifically and non-fiction writing overall. He takes his research seriously but presents his experiences in a light-hearted, self-effacing manner, which bothers some people. I know, for instance, several friends of mine who are avid hikers thoroughly detested Bryson's A Walk In The Woods because he didn't approach hiking the Appalachian Trail with the proper seriousness. But I think that's the point of Bryson's travel writing -- he is NOT the expert, he's the average guy who goes out there, experiences something, falls in love with it or not.<br /><br />Here, he gets the point across that Australia is endlessly fascinating, endlessly dangerous, endlessly friendly, and endlessly ignored, with chapters dedicated to each region of the continent as he explores them on several different trips. He weaves the history of Australia the continent, and Australia the nation, into each section rather than lumping it all at the beginning; he does likewise with the nature segments. Bryson doesn't pretend to be either a natural scientist or a mathematician, although he brings those subjects into his work. His love for Australia shines through most of the book, even when he is painfully admitting he has no idea how to solve the problem of the still large separation between the white population and the Aborigines.<br /><br />Of course it wouldn't be a Bryson book without some travel mishaps, although here they are largely of the \\"took a wrong road, forgot to book a hotel room\\" type and nothing really life threatening.<br />The edition I read had been updated with Bryson's reports from the Sydney Olympics, more fun reading as he picks apart American journalists' obvious lack of understanding about Australia, and how easily even veteran writers latch onto the classic Aussie stereotypes.  Then again, Bryson indulges in at least one stereotype of his own: the always happy, always accommodating Australian.  Almost anyone Bryson mentions in the book as having a negative personality end up being foreigners like himself; I can only think of one instance where he talks about negative or rude Australians, and they all seem to work at one particular hotel and reside in one particular city. I find that to be a bit of a stretch.<br /><br />But again, Bryson's voice and obvious love for his subject make the book fun to read and fairly informative considering it is one man's travelogue rather than a history text.the book as having a negative personality end up being foreigners like himself; I can only think of one instance where he talks about negative or rude Australians, and they all seem to work at one particular hotel and reside in one particular city.

0446401307|3.0|This is the 13th novel featuring Harry Bosch in little more than a decade, and while the LAPD homicide expert has evolved somewhat (he actually owns a digital camera now), he really hasn't changed in the essentials, even if he is getting older and grayer. That's both a good thing and a bad thing. Harry's mission -- to speak for the dead, because \\"everybody counts or nobody counts\\" -- is timeless, but his inability to handle authority well limits his prospects in the department and also seems to guarantee a succession of partners (the last two of whom have been shot while on the job). Now he's in the new \\"Special\\" unit of the Robbery-Homicide Division, handling cases that are too sensitive, or newsworthy, or simply too likely to become a \\"hobby\\" to be relegated to the homicide teams in the city's seventeen precincts. As his first roll-out since his transfer -- which he's been waiting for almost anxiously -- he's called to an execution-like murder scene at a scenic overlook on Mulholland Drive, which quickly ties back to the theft of a large quantity of medical-grade cesium from a hospital where the victim worked. It appears to be a terrorist crime and Harry's sometime lover, FBI agent Rachel Walling, becomes involved. Only one witness turns up, whom Harry tries to keep under wraps as insurance against losing control of the case to the feds (who really don't care about the homicide). And then the LAPD's own Homeland Security department goes off on a tear, which Connelly uses as an example of the present tendency of our government at all levels to cry \\"Terrorism\\" to cover up Constitutional and other legal infractions. The whole narrative covers twelve hours (and, true to form, Harry's newest partner takes a bullet) and the geography, as Bosch notes, is very restricted -- but where the whole thing ends up is, nevertheless, a long, long way from where it all began. This isn't a bad story but it's ultimately rather lightweight compared to some of Detective Bosch's earlier outings. There's not much subtlety, either in the characterizations (especially of the feds) nor in the motivations. And I'm beginning to tire of Agent Walling's personal psychological instability. Much of this may be a result of the author having originally written the story as a serial in the NEW YORK TIMES SUNDAY MAGAZINE. It certainly *feels* like a serial, or an overextended short story. And what in the world was the final fate of Capt. Hadley and his killing of a bystander whose politics he didn't approve of? After his little Vietnam warning-story, I can't see Bosch agreeing to cover for him. Perhaps Connelly is becoming too concerned with marketing his work and less concerned with writing it.outings.

B0021L8V1G|4.0|There's nothing like that first kiss, yeah, and so even though IRON MAN 2 comes out and unleashes its share of awesomeness, even though it is very much worth a look, the mystery is gone, the expectations met, we've, er, already copped that feel. IRON MAN 2, good as it is, doesn't drop on us like lightning in a bottle, and so it isn't quite as exhilarating. What it does give us is more of that good Robert Downey, Jr.<br /><br />The guy has made the Invincible Iron Man into his own, and I can't see anyone else now as Tony Stark, and I'm betting you can't, either. Downey brings the same devilish, bigger-than-life charisma, that same brash \\"I'm Tony Stark! Who the eff are you?!\\" swagger. Tony Stark is brilliant and ego-centric, but he's got good intentions. His heart's in the right place, and so we forgive the rampant narcissism. Plus, he's a fun dude to be around.<br /><br />IRON MAN 2 chronicles Tony's fall from grace and his redemption. Six months ago Tony Stark told the world that he was Iron Man. But has fame and success gone to his head? He's been more eccentric lately, indulging even more in hedonism lately, and he's conducting the Stark Expo like it's a rock concert (which is actually bloody cool). Certain parties are worried. Iron Man's arrival had gone a ways into ensuring global peace or at least global detente. But six months later, the American government - as embodied in the person of the slimy Senator Stern (Garry Shandling) - is itching to get its paws on the Iron Man tech and, so, Tony has to attend senate hearings. Stark, in his own inimitable manner, blows the hearings out of the water.<br /><br />There's a fatal flaw in the schematics, a gremlin in the wires. Carefree on the outside, on the inside Tony is very concerned. The palladium element in the arc reactor in his chest is gradually poisoning him, and each use of the Iron Man armor accelerates the condition. But he keeps up the pretense, having informed no one of his impending death. Maybe you can't blame the guy for carrying on so.<br /><br />I actually expected this movie to delve into Tony's alcoholism (from the classic story arc in the comics), but we only get a peek at the man's fondness for booze. We do get moments when we see the flamboyant playboy take a sippy, as well as one epic drunken binge at a party (while in armor, no less). This public eff-up sends Tony's credibility plummeting, and that slimy senator's smirk just got even smirkier.<br /><br />Rival industrialist Justin Hammer isn't the Big Bad of the movie, but Sam Rockwell supplies him with a pronounced air of unctuousness, and you hate him. Hammer, fed up with languishing in Stark's shadow, hires a crazed and tattooed Russian physicist to craft his own arsenal of armored suits, and a Russian physicist played by the menacing Mickey Rourke probably would have no choice but to be crazed and tattooed. They don't call Rourke's character by his supervillain code name, but it's Whiplash (with a smidge of Crimson Dynamo thrown in). He nurses a serious grudge against Tony and Tony's father, Howard Stark, who had a falling out with Whiplash's own inventor father. But how does Rourke get away with chewing a toothpick all the time?<br /><br />IRON MAN 2 isn't magic like the first movie and that initial sense of novelty has worn off, but it's still terrific and the scale is bigger. Downey's presence drives the thing, and the fact that we don't mind that Tony Stark is onscreen more than Iron Man says something about the skills set Downey brings to the party. We still get that good banter between him and Gwyneth Paltrow. Don Cheadle takes over from Terrence Howard, and it's like he's always been on board as Rhodey. The f/x is flawless state of the art stuff; there's nothing like heavy metal clashing resoundingly. If you've at all seen the posters and the trailer, then you already know War Machine would make his debut, and he may not be as impressive as the ol' shellhead but, damn, he's got all those bigmounted guns. And, for dessert, curvy Scarlett Johansson steps into the franchise as the smoking hot Black Widow and she demonstrates high levels of kickassery. And oh that sexy black leather....<br /><br />I only wish Pepper Potts were given more stuff to do.<br /><br />Jon Favreau features himself more as Happy Hogan, a chauffer in this incarnation, and I'm not mad at Favreau. What's the point of being director if you can't call your own number once in a while? Meanwhile, IRON MAN 2, in a scene here and there, gets us another step closer to that Avengers movie. Somewhere, executives from DC Comics must be gnashing their teeth, late to the game, lagging behind. The Green Lantern movie had better be something.<br /><br />And, as become a habit with Marvel Studios flicks, stick around until after the closing credits, yeah? Nerd nirvana awaits.mounted guns.

B002QEXN2K|2.0|I did not enjoy the album.  Let me expound.  I have always liked John Mayer; he was there for me as a senior in highschool, boldly singing about the promise life holds for those who dare to muster courage and set out into it.  He was there for me in college playing Sting's 'message in a bottle' reminding us that, when we feel lost, there are countless others we can connect with.  He was there for...well, actually...then he kind of let us down on heavier things and I had to make due by searching limewire for obscure earlier work I may have overlooked.  Luckily the Trio album eventually arrived as if to say 'okay, my last album was less than you expected, but i'm trying to figure it out; enjoy this in the meantime'.  And the masses rejoiced in John's decision to return to making music that is creative and inspired.  Then came Continuum which provided us a giant sigh of relief as we saw a return to mayer, his guitar, and thoughtful songs about life that contain his subtle optimistic bent.  Yes, things seemed to be going well between fans and John Mayer.  The new found trust lead us to imagine that the future with JM would always be as great as watching the 'where the light is' DVD.  Unfortunately, though, Mayer got dumped by a woman who was still pissed about being dumped by Brad Pitt, and like the youngest child often takes it out on the dog, Mayer, in a haze of scorn and destitution (okay, that may be a bit over the top, but you get what I'm saying) took it out on the fans.  Now, I'm not saying Battle Studies is garbage, but, compared to JM when he takes his time and writes from a good place, the album lacks dynamic and originality and leaves the fan saying 'dammit john, if i wanted a normal pop album i would have bought gavin degraw.  Basically, it has the results of a history term paper that you put off until the night before it was due.  C-.  ...life as the fan on the side...
0071636080|4.0|Of the hundreds of books on presentation skills I've read over the past 10 years (alright, probably not \\"hundreds\\" -- but at least 20 or 30), this is easily one of the best. Whether you personally like Steve Jobs or Apple products doesn't matter. What the author, Carmine Gallo, so effectively does is identify -- and provide specific examples of -- presentation design and delivery best practices that anyone can learn and apply.<br /><br />Also extremely helpful is that the book references numerous other great resources including three of the other top books out there on designing and delivering effective presentations: Slide:ology (by Nancy Duarte), Presentation Zen (by Garr Reynolds), and Beyond Bullet Points (by Cliff Atkinson). Additionally, the book provides numerous valuable links to online video examples so as to bring his points to life.<br /><br />As a leadership development and presentations skills trainer and coach myself, I would highly recommend this book to anyone who seriously wants to take their presentation skills to a whole new level of impact and effectiveness.
B001S33D1G|5.0|For those unfamiliar with the story:  young Coraline (NOT Caroline!) Jones is bored to death over the summer holidays in the new flat her parents have moved her into.  She discovers a door in the wall, as well as the key that unlocks it, and discovers a portal to a mirror world where her Other Mother awaits to give her the never-boring, never-unhappy, life she's missing in the real world.  Needless to say, there is something not quite right about the Other Mother's offer ... starting with the fact that in order to stay in this other world, Coraline must let the Other Mother sew buttons over her eyes.<br /><br />Coraline preceded Gaiman's Newberry-award-winning The Graveyard Book as a book aimed directly at teens.  The two books make great compaion pieces: one about a strong-willed girl discovering what her real family means to her, the other about a ghostly boy discovering that family is what forms around you as you grow.  Coraline is smart, adventurous ... and not afraid to admit when she's afraid.  She doesn't have all the answers, but she's smart enough to figure them out.<br /><br />Coraline, the book, is creepy, eerie, moody -- it has all the Gaiman hallmarks.  The animated film directed by Henry Selick is good -- but read the original for a slightly different view on Coraline's world.  Znd then listen to Neil Gaiman read the book in its entirety on cd, as I just did.

B000001FZK|5.0|I recall Wynton Marsalis' prophetic statement about jazz music,\\"If you go to it, you will get the benefit of IT\\". While I would not classify it as jazz, so is true for Talk Talk's - Laughing Stock. You must \\"go to it\\".   It is a brilliant work, full of musical textures, arrangements, and melodic complexities. You would be hard pressed to define it, or to select a category. It teeters on rock, but has the inventiveness and improvisational glue of jazz, and an etherial blend of atmospheric nuances that mix the avant-garde with a dark ambient, new-age - without the techno-sound annoyances. Hauntingly beautiful and curious, Mark Hollis' voice is infused with a controlled intensity that weaves into, and also cuts through the most complex passages. You'll find yourself going back to individual tracks again and again to pick up on sounds, lyrics, and sweet notes that weren't heard previously. These are some of the most compelling tracks I've ever heard in music.   When I first listened to Laughing Stock, I immediately acknowledged it's departure from the magnificent melodic structure that make up the tracks on, Color of Spring - also a brilliant work, and so ahead of it's time. Even more innovative than the uniquely beautiful, Spirit of Eden, Laughing Stock is an experiment with lyrical sounds and structure, always keeping true to the experience Talk Talk wanted to create.   Any fan of Talk Talk who has an open-minded sensibility about music will understand the overwhelming significance of the work they produced from Colour of Spring through Laughing Stock. They're gifts, and they await those who have the capacity to challenge and really appreciate musical beauty and ingenuity.
B0002O7XW2|5.0|As someone who really loved the film instantly upon seeing it when it first hit the local theater back in the early '80's, I'd almost been as captivated more by the mysteries behind the film's making than the intense hold the that subject matter of the film had on me.  If you have ever wondered just how did those special effects get coordinated, why the at-the-time unknown actors were chosen for the leading roles, or what was the backstory behind how to adapt the Steven King book into a workable screenplay, then you are likely to really enjoy the special features section.  For me, watching the many deleted scenes were also enjoyable as there was some decent footage that didn't make the original cut.  If you are a fan of Carpenter, the car, and/or the movie, there's plenty available in this DVD to make it worth your time and money.
B003BZXI6E|5.0|I don't know what I expected from this . . . another well-timed but superficial performance to enhance sales vis a vis Oprah . . . the former president was there, and his wife and child . . . lots of old timers from the theater world.  Phyllis Newman, Mrs. Jule Styne, Lorraine Gordon, etc. Her buddy, Cis Corman, and husband, the very cool Mr. Brolin. Could this possibly be a sincere artistic effort? I got it in the mail yesterday and sat down with my dogs and a glass of red wine and a little trepidation. I am not that fond of the \\"Love is the Answer\\" CD, though on repeated hearings, I think it is masterful, but requires some effort like an obscure artsy French or Japanese movie, maybe. Not a simple listen for me. I have purchased everything Streisand has released since I first saw the movie \\"Funny Girl\\" in 1968; I admittedly have not liked everything she has done. I walked out of her 2006 concert tour in Washington, DC at intermission because I thought it was awful (mostly Il Divo, in restrospect). I guess I mostly like my Barbra to myself and not in an arena with 15,000 other people. Anyway, I watched this thing once, and as each song passed, and as the banter played out, I became haunted and mesmerized once again by this \\"girl singer.\\" Where did she come from? Where did this voice come from? This face? These eyes? That knowing smile? The gift of irony and sharp-edged humor? So after another couple of glasses of wine, I watched it again knowing I could just sit back and enjoy the give and take of it. I still don't know what to say. It's unlike anything I've seen previously from her or anyone else. As good in its way as \\"Happening in Central Park.\\" Once she hits her stride and we get used to the panning shots of the audience and band, and take a deep breath because we know this is a \\"real\\" and \\"live\\" performance, then the thing makes complete sense as a work of art and not as the promotion it may have started out as. The long delay at the beginning waiting for her to appear, the anticipation, her inner Barbra shining through (she IS funny) in the dialogue (scripted? who knows);the planned or unplanned pan and zoom to her long-ago self singing at the \\"Blue Angel.\\" This is the \\"girl singer\\" we hoped was still around somewhere. By the end, I wasn't sitting down, but was up against the big screen, with the speakers turned up to blasting, staring at this woman that could have been 67 or 17, she was that good, that eternal. Through all the showbiz stuff, and criticisms, and praise and awards, and whatever, here is at last a performance that will stand up there with the best she has ever done, or at least that we have the privelege to view. She worked at this, you can tell, her hair is a mess by the end. And she is hot, not just dewy. And did I say that she was beautiful, and funny, and sweet, and complicated, and . . . simply Streisand. I loved her interactions with the piano player, so cute, so giving. He must have been stressed, especially when she walked off the stage early, and you can hear him in the background shouting to the band \\"Happy Days are Here Again\\" to cover her leaving the stage unexpectedly. The camerwork is startingly considering all the limitations in this small and crowded room.

What a gift!o appear, the anticipation, her inner Barbra shining through (she IS funny) in the dialogue (scripted? who knows);the planned or unplanned pan and zoom to her long-ago self singing at the \\"Blue Angel.\\" This is the \\"girl singer\\" we hoped was still around somewhere. By the end, I wasn't sitting down, but was up against the big screen, with the speakers turned up to blasting, staring at this woman that could have been 67 or 17, she was that good, that eternal. Through all the showbiz stuff, and criticisms, and praise and awards, and whatever, here is at last a performance that will stand up there with the best she has ever done, or at least that we have the privelege to view. She worked at this, you can tell, her hair is a mess by the end. And she is hot, not just dewy. And did I say that she was beautiful, and funny, and sweet, and complicated, and . . . simply Streisand. I loved her interactions with the piano player, so cute, so giving. He must have been stressed, especially when she walked off the stage early, and you can hear him in the background shouting to the band \\"Happy Days are Here Again\\" to cover her leaving the stage unexpectedly. The camerwork is startingly considering all the limitations in this small and crowded room. I don't know, for some reason this made me think of the incomparable Robert Altman and how he might have made this. It even plays a bit like a movie. It really is that good! So finally, thank you, dearest, for all the years. Thank you most of all for this performance. What a gift!

B000WQWPJQ|5.0|'Cast Away' first hit standard DVD back in 2001, and at the time was widely considered to be one of the best transfers around. I gave that disc a quick spin before watching this new Blu-ray, and was surprised by how well it has held up. That gave this new 1080p/AVC MPEG-4 encode a great deal to live up to, but I'm happy to report that it's more than up to the challenge. (Note that the back of the Blu-ray box incorrectly lists the film's aspect ratio as 2.35:1; it is in fact 1.85:1.)    Robert Zemeckis brings all of his considerable visual talents to 'Cast Away,' as well as the latest in CGI technology (at least circa 2000). As such, the film is visually sumptuous all the way through -- particularly the second act on the island. The level of depth and detail reaches fantastic, and the color saturation is exquisite. The shimmering waters are a gorgeous, crystal clear blue, and the expansive vistas are flush with deep jungle greens. Just as impressive are darker scenes, with shadow delineation holding up wonderfully even in scenes with minimal light sources (such as moonlight or a bonfire). Yes, there is grain in the picture, but all of the positive elements can elevate 'Cast Away' to the level of demo material.    It's not really a complaint, but the opening and closing acts of \\"Cast Away' a bit more plain, at least in terms of bright colors and picturesque visuals. However, this is obviously intentional, and even here the transfer doesn't falter. The visual palette is muted but fleshtones hold firm, and there is still a great deal of depth and dimensionality throughout. The presentation is also nice and sharp, with no irritating edge enhancement or other compression issues. Now seven years old, 'Cast Away' fully qualifies as a Blu-ray catalog title, but it's one of the best I've seen yet from Fox.
0312360258|4.0|Marked is a fun, easy read that is different from all of the other vampire books out right now. I was immediately sucked in from page 1. You should note that this was written with teens in mind and it does have some slang/conversation that could have been a lot better, but overall it was a good, quick, no stress read.<br /><br />I went to SIHS, and many friends actually had P.C Cast as an English teacher, so having places in the book that I know (SIHS, Philbrook Museum, Jenks Aquarium, etc.) really added an interesting level to reading this book that I have never experienced before.<br /><br />Overall, it is a strong start to a new teen vampire series and I cannot wait to start reading the rest of the series.

In all of these movies she catches your attention. Now she stars in this major movie. She absolutely shines as the young Queen Victoria. I believed her portrayal. I was captivated. The costumes were beautiful. She looked beautiful. Emily Blunt makes the movie. She made it very good indeed.
B00004SAAY|5.0|When I first heard these recordings they were a radio simulcast and I recorded them on tape.  I lost the tapes and several years later I thought I had found the recording, but it was by the academy of ancient music.  For over 28 years I have been dissaopointed that I didn't have my tapes because I thought the CDs just didn't have the same quality.  Today I was looking again for the music as I lost my CDs and I was on youtube and I found this recording which I instantly realized is the original recording that I had back in 82.

0743437497|4.0|I couldn't help but read this book with Kubrick's movie in mind, and it suffers because of it.<br /><br />On the plus side, the book offers a much deeper look at the characters, and the history of the hotel, and is written with great style.<br /><br />On the negative side, is that the story is pretty obvious, and takes a long time getting to its exciting finish. The movie cuts away a lot of this detail, and seems better for it. I also feel that the movie is more stylistically original, although its visuals have been copied so much in the last 30 years that it's hard to appreciate.

B0021L8V1G|5.0|\\"Iron Man 2\\" is more than a worthy sequel to the original Iron Man film. The majority of the good guys return intact - Robert Downey, Jr as billionaire industrialist Tony Stark and his powerful alter ego, Iron Man, Gwyneth Paltrow as Stark's right hand assistant, Pepper Potts, and Jon Favreau (also the the two films' director) as Stark's bodyguard, Happy Hogan, and Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, head of the SHIELD intelligence agency. Two new actors join this group -  Don Cheadle, replacing Terrence Howard as Stark friend and Air Force officer, James \\"Rhodey\\" Rhodes, and Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Rushman, Stark's new aide who turns into a lot more.<br /><br />The bad guys are Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vanko, a son of a former business partner of Stark's father. The elder Vanko dies at the beginning of the film, setting the son on a quest for vengeance that results in a suit much like Stark's, including a powerful electrical whip. Whiplash, as Rourke's character comes to be known, makes a very public attempt to kill Stark. After the attempt fails, Vanko is rescued from prison by Justin Hammer, a business rival of Stark's who wants to use Vanko's expertise to create more powerful armor and sell it to the US military.<br /><br />Add to this already potent mix several other complications - Stark's deepening relationship with Pepper, who he anoints as his replacement at Stark Industries, his growing egotism and hubris that makes very vulnerable to attack, and his body's rejection of the power cell in his chest that is grdually killing him, and you have a movie with a huge cast, lots of plot entanglements, and lots and lots of action.<br /><br />But it all works. The cast is terrific, the movie is alternately thrilling, funny, and touching, and the viewer doesn't leave this movie feeling that they don't want to see Iron Man 3. And for the movie studio, Marvel, regular cast members and movie fans, what happens next in the Iron Man franchise promises to be a very, very good thing.
0688163173|5.0|I couldn't put down this eerie and unsettling fast-paced psychological thriller by the author of Mystic River. Two U.S. marshals are sent to Ashecliffe Hospital for the Criminally Insane on a small island off Massachusetts in the summer of 1954 to investigate the disappearance of a patient. They must relinquish their guns and have trouble getting cooperation from the staff, especially the director Dr. Cawley.<br /><br />Teddy Daniels, the lead marshal, is having a hard time dealing with the death of his wife two years ago. He has an ulterior motive for wanting to be on the island. A hurricane hits the island preventing Teddy and his partner, Chuck Aule, from leaving, but it gives them time to find out what is really going on after the patient mysteriously reappears. What is happening in Unit C? What is real and what is imagined? It will keep you guessing until the end.
B00275EGWY|2.0|This wasn't a terrible movie, but it wasn't recommendable either.  I viewed this knowing that it won some awards and drew a lot of attention so I expected something that was well done, but unfortunately it wasn't.  The writing was pretty darn bad.  Everything the characters say has been said in other movies, they are more stereotypes than not, and I think anyone with a cursory knowledge of the military (and by that I mean someone familiar with Call of Duty video games and the History channel) will find all kinds of Military inaccuracies;  I can only imagine what some of our servicemen thought when watching this.  In all I must have missed something because the characters are more caricatures (not particularly likeable) and the story was aimless, more of a day in the life kind of thing with no point other than a series of happenings.   Unfortunately I think this film is the product of hype rather than quality, and at around two hours and twenty minutes I'd recommend checking something else out.

B000002KO3|5.0|I really have no excuse for not checking out Remain In Light much sooner (like five years ago when everyone in my life was talking about it).  Some of the weirdest, wildest, craziest, offbeat, creative dance/rock/pop music I've honestly EVER heard.      I'm surprised this band is a part of the New York late 70's rock scene with the likes of the Ramones, Blondie, and Patti Smith.  They honestly feel like a British band.  I'm thinking about comparisons to either Roxy Music or 10cc as far as experimental and melodic weirdness is concerned.  Check out those bands if you like the Talking Heads.    I guess what HAS to be said is that an album like this takes time, patience and dedication to fully appreciate.  My initial reaction was NOT a good one, but that's quite alright, because I went in expecting that since I already knew what kind of band I was dealing with when it comes to the Talking Heads.  Just flat out *weird*.    I guess the first half is the more noticeable to me as far as melody and experimentation goes.  Then again, the second half of the album has plenty of highly sophisticated musical ideas as well.  This is a really hard band to explain, but I'll try.    \\"Born Under Punches (The Heat Goes On)\\" immediately shows to me what kind of album to expect- an early 80's effort with dance beats probably influenced by the disco movement (that soon turned into the new wave movement, obviously).  Some of the vocal melodies in this track jump out to me only after several listens.  That's how you know we're not dealing with any plain ol' ordinary band here.    Perhaps it's the high amount of experimentation taking place making me not realize half of these musical ideas are even THERE.  It's like repeated listens are an absolute requirement to really GET this band.  That's why anyone who dismisses this album without really listening to it is someone with an opinion hard to take seriously.      I'm also a really big Captain Beefheart fan, and some of these songs are put together in a tricky, initially off putting way similar to the good Captain during the classic late 60's/early 70's years.    For anyone who believes all the highly original bands were a thing of the past by this point in time (in 1980) well, think again!  Remain In Light is an absolute treasure of some top notch creativity done in a highly sophisticated and challenging way.      Remain In Light is the kind of album you listen to late at night while sitting in a dark room and willing to accept a really bizarre and ultimately fascinating style of songwriting.  HIGHLY recommended.

B0021L8V1Q|5.0|Both my husband and I had originally planned to see this movie because we both saw the first Iron Man movie together and enjoyed it.  After viewing the Iron Man 2 movie today, we both are glad to have seen it.  For starters, if you thought highly of the first Iron Man movie, it is safe to say that you are going to enjoy the second.  In addition, I felt that the plot to the first Iron man movie was excellent and well developed. I was uncertain if Iron Man 2 was going to top the first one in action and excitement. Let me say that Iron Man 2 was even better than the first for those who wonder if this is the case. In addition, when Terrence Howard was dropped after the first Iron Man and replaced by Don Cheadle to be Tony Stark's (Robert Downey Jr's) sidekick in Iron Man 2, I was also unsure how this would play out. Needless to say, Don Cheadle did a fine job as Iron Man's sidekick in this movie. Admittedly, the character that I enjoyed the most was Robert Downey Jr's potrayal as Tony Stark back in action. Robert Downey Jr happens to be one of my favorite actors and he really gave an even stronger performance this time around.  Gwyneth Paltrow is back as his reliable and self confident love interest who is deeply concerned for Tony Stark and wants the best for him.  Scarlet Johanson plays an eloquent femme fatale named Natasha who also cares to help out Tony Stark.  Then there is Mickey Rourke who plays a very convincing nemesis and \\"evil genius\\" villian named Vanko as the one who targets Tony Stark for revenge. Sam Rockwell plays a calculated senator by the last name of Hammer who craves some of the power that Tony Stark has.  Then there is Gary Shandling who also plays as one of the congressman who also seems to desire some of the influence of the Iron Man.  Samuel Jackson happens to also make an appearance as one of the men who is for the Iron Man. Overall, a strong all star cast and I feel that an excellent job was done on casting the characters for their respective parts.  It was exciting to see the romantic side of Robert Downey Jr's Tony Stark character strive to continue in impressing Pepper Potts while simultaneously being forced to come to terms with maintaining the powerful and heroic legacy of his job as Iron Man,with some exciting scenes thrown in for strong measure. This is a great date night movie that both men and women are going to enjoy.  From my perspective, the very talented Robert Downey Jr. has also solidified his status as one of the talented actors to watch for years to come (his acting continues to get better and better in my modest opinion).parts.

B000S1M9LY|3.0|I thought the book was pretty much a mess, it was all over the map. You really could toss the pages in the air and, except for a few story lines that actually progress through the book, you could shuffle the pages back together in random order and the result would be equally as coherent as currently written. Other reviewers are correct in saying some parts of the book are engaging and others boring, if not downright unnecessary.<br /><br />I have the print and Kindle edition. I have to say, the Kindle edition is superior because the story has more than 300 footnotes and all are hyperlinked in the text, so clicking back and forth from the text to the footnote and then back to the story is easy. In the print version, you have to flip pages to the end of the book then find your place again. Not to sound lazy...

1593081545|5.0|As reviewers remark, Jane Austen likes to set up a tension between \\"opposing\\" forces, in the form of protagonists' ruling traits, and let this tension play out through the denouement of each novel.  The best known example is the embodiment of \\"Pride\\" vs. \\"Prejudice\\", in the two main characters of that named book.  Another is showcased via the two sisters Elinor and Marianne embodying [[ASIN:1440469563 Sense And Sensibility]].  In Mansfield Park, the two contrasting characteristics are to my reading, a steadfast \\"purity\\" vs. \\"corruptibility\\" of character as the latter is exposed to life experience.<br /> Fanny Price, the heroine, is a paragon of unyielding virtue, embodying the ideal of early 19th century maidenly womanhood.  She is kind, keenly sensitive to others' feelings, and quite intelligent, but modest, indeed self-effacing.  She is happy and fulfilled by a life of domestic harmony and predictability, in the splendid but peaceful countryside of rural England.  In contrast is Mary Crawford(who befriends a reluctant Fanny), a stylish wealthy import to the country from \\"town\\" (London), who is portrayed as having internalized the \\"flaws\\" of modern style and tastes, and who is the queen of ironic wit and self satisfaction.<br /> On the male side of the aisle are country cousin Edmund, the second son of Lord Bertram (Fanny's benefactor) destined to be a country parson, vs. his father's annointed heir, his dissolute older brother Thomas, and Mary's brother, the enigmatic charming Henry.  Edmund is the male parallel to Fanny, though unlike her, he's born among the rich and privileged.<br /> One must of course now ask why Austen goes to the trouble of setting up a lovely choreography of these contrasting characters--their meeting, \\"playing\\" together, falling in love, competing, clashing, and ultimately settling into their adult fates.  Well, there are many lessons to be conveyed, mostly moral.<br />  That this moral edification of the reader is done in a way that is sufferable, is to my jaded mind a real feat.  I attribute this to the genius of Jane Austen's beautiful prose, alternately satirical  vs. romantic, (itself a feat of writing), and to the subtlety with which the morals are driven home.  The \\"lessons\\" themselves, (e.g. that privilege confers a huge but by no means decisive advantage in the pursuit of happiness, and how character and fate combine to determine the result), are conveyed via the brilliant choreography of her plot, which marches with that rare blend of inexorability and suspense, that is in my view Austen's greatest claim to greatness.fferable, is to my jaded mind a real feat.

B00012QM8G|5.0|Based on a true the Schindler `s List is a story about  Oskar Schindler, who is a German businessman in Poland who sees an opportunity to make money from the Nazi's now ruling Germany. He starts a company to make cookware and utensils and then uses bribes to win military contract. He also hires an accountant Itzhak Stern  to help run the factory. By staffing his plant with Jews who've been herded into Krakow's ghetto by Nazi troops, Schindler has a very dependable labor force. For Stern, who is also a Jew this job could mean survival for himself and the other Jews working for Schindler. Then  n 1942, all of Krakow's Jews are assigned to the Plaszow Forced Labor Camp, overseen by Commandant Amon Goet who is a raging alcoholic who occasionally shoots prisoners from his balcony for fun. Schindler arranges to continue using Polish Jews in his plant, but, as he sees what is happening to his employees, he begins to develop a conscience. He realizes that his factory is the only thing preventing his staff from being shipped to the death camps. He then begins to demands more workers in effort to keep more Jews alive and starts bribing Nazi leaders to keep Jews on his employee lists and out of the camps. By the time Germany falls to the allies, Schindler has lost his entire fortune -- and saved 1,100 people from death at a concentration camp.  This movie is very inspiring and relates greatly to World Religion in this time period Hitler was out to make an Aryan race which included blonde hair and blue eyes which left many Jews out of that category. To better accomplish this goal he isolated them and sent them to concentration camps to be killed. Judaism was not accepted because of Hitler's belief but the events of the Holocaust made the Jewish people stronger and made sure that their children and the rest of the world know what they went through so that it would never be forgotten or happen again.

And the story is pretty good too. Impersonation is the key here in this bizarre tale that will keep you guessing to the end.<br /><br />\\"The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle.\\" The greatest Sherlock title of all time. Well, that is, before you realize that a carbuncle is a gem, and not a giant boil (which is another definition of the word carbuncle). Well, the story is really one of my favorites because it is just so bizarre and fun. You will love it.<br /><br />\\"The Adventure of the Speckled Band\\" sounds interesting, but I suppose that is because you wonder what the heck a 'speckled band' is. Well, it is a really good Holmes tale, that is what it is, and while it is certainly quite unbelievable in its elaborateness, it is yet kinda of fun when you realize Holmes sets himself up to be murdered.<br /><br />\\"The Adventure of the Engineer's Thumb\\" is a misnomer, since the engineer's thumb, well, dies. Not much adventure in that. Nevertheless, Sir Conan Doyle has indeed proven once again that he can come up with a good title. The story itself is another super bizarre set of circumstances that read more like a 19th century James Bond than anything else. Complete fancy, but a fun tale nonetheless, and a good spiritual sucessor to 'Speckled Band.'<br /><br />\\"The Adventure of the Noble Batchelor\\" is another of Doyle's 'Adventure' series of stories, and it is the least adventurous of the lot so far. I really found this one fairly drab, and with a little American racism thrown in...like all California gold rush miners use phrases like \\"He jumped my claim!\\" REALLY! Meh.<br /><br />\\"The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet\\" is one of the best in this whole collection. It requires great observational skill to be able to figure this one out before it is over, and it always helps when you let your suspicions get the best of you. Bravo Sir Doyle. Bravo.<br /><br />\\"The Adventure of the Cooper Beeches\\" (no beeches isn't spelled wrong, it is talking about the tree) is a great creepy and fascinating tale. While again, it is a little far fetched, I really enjoyed it, and found it to be positively creeptacular. This would make an excellent movie, and you could even creep it up a notch.<br /><br />This is a great starting place for Holmes fans, as it represents a minimal sampling of some of his best stuff. If you haven't read these, then, well, you haven't read Holmes.<br /><br />Sherlock Holmes is supposed to be a genius, but he never really feels that way. He is just very observant, and can quickly theorize as to the causes behind his observations. And then, the best thing about him is his selection of crimes. He only chooses the most unique, for he does it because he loves it, and not for money, and not because it is his job. He is a CSI artist in a world of paint by numbers police. \\"Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell. You have degraded what should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales.\\" Well, that is what Sherlock told our good buddy Holmes when he talked about his own adventures. Not that I don't see his point, but if they HAD been lectures, instead of tales, we would have missed a great deal of fun...<br /><br />Recommended.ou haven't read these, then, well, you haven't read Holmes.<br /><br />Sherlock Holmes is supposed to be a genius, but he never really feels that way.

B000003BDJ|5.0|My  growd up sister used to have a stero that u could carry around, the turntable folded out and u could detach the speakers lay down on the floor and use them like giant headphones- this was one of my favorites- still is. No reason for anyone who likes rock not to have it- maybe it should be a required piece of I.D.??  HOWEVER  After listening to serval SACD- or 5.1 DTS this  sound quality took a little getting used to so I plunked down some $$ for the DSD and it sounds incredible!!!  Bottom line YOU NEED THIS IN ANY FORM.. (might even help you firm up that spare tire ;-)
B002ZCDR88|5.0|I came to this collection after reading about the project in the NY Times, and not owning any of Merchant's other work.  I was intrigued by her obsession with working on this collection of poems, turning them into music, researching the poets, and working with many different musicians in a wide range of genres.  I think the end result is a staggering achievement -- it is moving, stimulating and entertaining -- the performances are wonderful, and the book that accompanies the CDs is an absolute gem.
B00006EXDM|5.0|I'm not sure what DSD remasterd means this sounds Incredible- but the light that usally comes on when I play a SACD on my player doesnt come on when I play this. But the sound quailty is outstanding Worth every cent even though I alaready had the \\"regular\\" cd- which sounded pretty good itself.

B0000C8AV3|5.0|Dylan cd that I know all the words to- I had it on cassette when it came out- this sounds wonderfull- I worte it- you read it- buy it. I lucked out and got it before the prices went up But Id pay more for this.

B0000C8AVX|5.0|Dylan album I got, now that I think of it, I was in collage  and it was a clearance in Columiba music club (ha-ha) I was surprised that I knew a couple songs  Just trying to get into broader stuff then I listened to in High school- I just loved the whole attitude- Ya Know - its my life Im not neccesasarily interested in impressing you- your judgements about me really are meaningless. does it Get anymore Dylan then that? It inspired me to get Street legal at a used record store (I was in collage I couldnt really pay more then $1 for stuff) I went on from there- but this cd is really the root that broke through the  hardpack, everything before was incorporated into it and everything after grew out of it. So I cant imagine Dylan without this.

B0021L8V1G|4.0|At the end of 2008, I made two bold assertions: (1) That \\"Iron Man\\" was one of the year's best films; (2) that \\"Iron Man\\" was one of the greatest superhero films ever made. I still believe both to be true. Now we have \\"Iron Man 2.\\" While it is thoroughly entertaining, it's also a bit conventional when compared to its predecessor, having less of a compelling story but more in the ways of action, special effects, gadgets, humor, and stunt work. It's a comic book through and through. That's fine by me - what it lacks in introspection it more than makes up for in sheer fun. We have plenty to cheer for, not the least of which is our hero, billionaire industrialist Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.), who when we last left him had shut down the weapon's division of his company to focus on more humanitarian uses for technology. The result was a high tech metal suit equipped with rocket boosters and missile launchers.    It's now six months after Stark revealed himself as Iron Man at a press conference. Despite the demands of a United States Senate committee, he refuses to share his technology with the American military, believing that world peace can be maintained only if it's privatized. At this meeting, he humiliates Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), the CEO of a rival company who has unsuccessfully tried to outdo Stark's technology with his own prototype machines; in an effort to get ahead, Hammer appeals to Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), a Russian physicist who publically revealed his grudge against Stark by attacking him as he was car racing in Monaco. For as yet unknown reasons, Vanko has constructed an arc reactor very similar to the one implanted in Stark's chest. He has improved the design by attaching whips that surge with bolts of electrical energy.    Stark, meanwhile, is realizing that his chest implant, originally constructed as a way to keep him alive, contains an element that's slowly poisoning him. He doesn't handle it well. He acts out. He drinks in excess. He hastily appoints his former personal assistant, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), as the new CEO of his company. If he's to survive, he must replace the core of the implant with an entirely new element, one he has tried but failed to create on his own. Out of the blue comes special agent Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), who suggests that Stark look to his father's research for guidance.    New to the cast is Don Cheadle, who replaces Terrence Howard as Stark's dedicated but weary friend Lt. Colonel James Rhodes. Also new is Scarlett Johansson as Stark's newly hired personal assistant Natalie Rushman, who says she's from the company's legal department.    Watching this movie, I was quite dazzled by the sights and sounds, and I found the plot engaging in a suspension-of-disbelief kind of way. I did not, however, find it persuasive, as I did the first film, which I felt put a refreshing and thought-provoking spin on the traditional comic book adversary; Stark might have physically battled with the power-hungry Obadiah Stane, but his real enemies were war and injustice, both of which he took part in by selling weapons of mass destruction. This time around, it's much more by the book - a superhero pitted against a madman out for revenge, a fight to the finish that includes a lot of things blowing up, a showcase of digital wizardry and highly choreographed stunts. There are a number of films that can give you pretty much the same thing.    That being said, there's no denying the quality of the performances, especially Downey, whose cocky take on Stark makes the film fun but not jokey. Rockwell is quite good, playing Hammer is if he were Stark's slightly goofier evil twin - comedy relief with a hint of something darker, you might say. Credit also to Rourke, who truly does convey the anger, resentment, and pain his character feels in every one of his scenes. He isn't given all that much screen time, but when he's on, he's on, resonating with a deep, calm, frighteningly low voice andan imposing build.    If there is an \\"Iron Man 3,\\" and I have no doubt that there will be, I can only hope it doesn't follow its predecessor's lead and decline in quality. The original \\"Iron Man\\" was a superb film, redefining the superhero genre for both old and new generations of moviegoers. \\"Iron Man 2\\" is a great looking and wonderfully performed sequel, although its approach to the story is routine, more so than I had preferred it to be. Still, you've got to hand it to director Jon Favreau and writer Justin Theroux - they sure know how to entertain an audience. There's an early scene in which Stark, dressed as Iron Man, jumps off a plane, flies through the sky, and lands unharmed in the middle of one of his own lavishly high tech expos in New York City. Throngs of people cheer him on. I suspect the audiences for this movie will do the same when it's over.
B002QQ8HAG|3.0|Most of us don't really care for the world of high fashion, but it at least sparks our curiosity, which is why I personally watched this movie.<br /><br />To my surprise, I found that these people are actually rather dull.  Or more precisely, they're narrow and shallow, because their lives revolve around fashion and they exemplify the ideology that beauty is skin/clothes deep.  Making matters worse, because high fashion is tied with the elite world of conspicuous wealth, the people at Vogue also exhibit a crassly business mindset, thus compromising whatever purely artistic motives and pretensions they might have.<br /><br />The dullness of these people also makes for a dull movie, so I struggled to finish it.  But at least the movie is honest in presenting this dullness, rather than resorting to the standard approach of overglamorizing the fashion world, so I can at least give this movie three stars for that, though I still can't recommend it.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|Wow, I was surprised at how well made this series is....  This is a highly addictive show... just really fast paced, keep you entertained at every minute - LOVE the characters.... Its really very very good.    I just read that the 2nd season may be the last season?  That's insane!  What idiots...  I am surprised I only stumbled on this series - I had never heard of it before?
B001BNFR6W|1.0|Some discs in the first set we ordered were defective--skipping, pixelating, sometimes grinding to a halt.  This set was exchanged quickly and without expense on our part by Amazon.  The second set also contained discs with the exact same defects.  Upon attempting an online return of the second set we discovered that the return time window had closed and read that no return would be allowed.  There are 33 discs in this set and it is highly unlikely that one would encounter a defect in, say, disc 30 within the allowed return period.  We called Amazon, pointed this fact out, and were granted a full refund on the second set (but watch your credit card statement--only a partial refund was credited until we called customer service to follow up).  We would strongly discourage anyone from ordering this set until Amazon states specifically that the defective product has been removed from their stock.

B001FOPODS|5.0|This version of \\"Peter\\" is the best I've ever seen. The purpose behind teaching \\"Peter\\" in an elementary music setting is to introduce theme and variation as well as the instruments of the orchestra. I've always been so frustrated by the versions of this which have a narrator. Who needs a narrator when you already have a visual for students to watch? The narrators always take away from students' ability to listen to the music. In this version, no narrator exists leaving the story to the music and the beautiful stop motion animation. My students are better able to focus on the music (the themes and instruments) and vocally duplicate them after I use this DVD to enhance my unit plan on \\"Peter and the Wolf.\\" It makes me want to hug the director. -K.

B002VPE1B6|1.0|[[ASIN:B002VPE1B6 Avatar (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo) [Blu-ray]]]  Apparently 20th Century Fox installed NEW ENCRYPTION software rendering it unplayable on many stand alone and computer players.  It won't play on my brand new Dell Studio 1749 but will play on my year old desktop that I made for high-end gaming.    It is a ridiculous and ineffective attempt to cut down on piracy.  The encryption, unfortunately has had the opposite effect.    Paying consumers can not play the movie they paid for and piracy hackers have already broken the encryption.    You will need to make sure that your player is able to play the disc before you buy it.    Do a search on a popular search engine like G**gle for your Blu-ray player with the make and model number and see if it will play this movie.    You may have to go to the trouble to upgrade the firmware on your player.  For stand alone players this is a bit more difficult because you will have to download the firmware upgrade to a burnable disc or a USB drive, then take the disc or USB drive to the player and follow the firmware upgrade instruction.  You may need the player manual at hand to perform this task.     Even with all these steps your player may never play this movie so you will be stuck with a movie that you can't play.    DO ALL THE ABOVE BEFORE YOU BUY THE MOVIE.    ***You CANNOT RETURN OPENED MOVIES****    The movie it's self is OK but you may want to wait in the special edition that will be released later this year that includes a significant amount of new footage.
B002VECM4K|5.0|Adapted from the award winning novel \\"Push\\", \\"Precious\\" follows 16 year old Claireece \\"Precious\\" Jones (played incredibly by Gabourey Sidibe) in 1987 Harlem. 'Precious' is a severely obsese, illiterate, black young woman just trying to get through her life. She lives with her abusive mother Mary (Mo'Nique) who thrives on television and the welfare checks she recieves, in Section 8 housing. When the movie starts, we're taken into Precious' world of lonlineness, isolation, despair and depression. Through flashbacks, we learn that Precious was repeatedly raped by her mother's boyfriend, and has a child named Mongo (short for mongoloid) by him. After being impregnated a second time by him, the boyfriend departs leaving Mary to blame Precious for \\"making her man leave\\". We follow Precious as she gets suspended from school for being pregnant again, and enrolls in an alternative school, which she hopes will change her life. There she meets her new teacher, Blu Rain (Paula Patton) who sees the potential in Precious and begins teaching her how to read. As she becomes literate and educated, she begins to taste freedom.<br /><br />I don't want to get into too much plot-wise, as this is a movie that shouldn't be spoiled. \\"Precious\\" should be required viewing and deserves all the awards it has won (& will continue to win). It is one helluva powerful movie. Is it hard to take? Yes. But the film is hard to take because it's so realistic & because sometimes, life is so hard to take. That is how realistic this movie is. You feel like you are just as lonely and desperate and hopeless as Precious is. You feel like a fly on the wall in the section 8 housing, wanting to save Precious from all of her abusive, dysfunctional, horrifying relationships. The only love that Precious has ever known is pain. And while she fantasizes about a better life for herself by being someone else- a white woman, a music video star, a movie star - she can not break free from her life & the cycle of abuse. This is heavy, powerful stuff. It is also filmmaking at its finest. Beautifully directed, powerfully written, and amazingly acted, Precious is certainly one of my favorite films in recent memory. With supporting turns by Lenny Kravitz as a hospital nurse, and a suprisingly strong performance by Mariah Carey as a social worker, the cast is well rounded and strong. This is a movie that you MUST see. It's not an easy film, it's not a fluffy film, it's not neatly wrapped - just like our lives. This is where its greatest strength lies.<br />From [...]eavy, powerful stuff. It is also filmmaking at its finest.

0307271862|4.0|H. Mankell tells a compelling story of how the happenings in the world are closer than we think. What seems to be a brutal massacre in a remote village in Sweden turns out to be much more complex. What is the motive for the death of 19 people? We are taken on a geopolitical/economic tour in the 1860s via China to America and back to China and into 2006 via China and Africa. (A realistic aspect in The Man from Beijing world.) It was amazing to see how the story is weaved together. The story involves female Swedish judge who discovers her family's ties to the remote village. Fearing that her mother's foster parents have been married she travels there to see if it was them, and where her mother grew up. After discovering a subtle clue she feels tthe local police are not investigating the proper avenue. While working within the boundaries of the law she attempts to become her own private investigator. Her counterpart is the \\"Man from Beijing\\" who has mysterious wealth and power and may be tied to the mystery she is trying to solve.<br /><br />I enjoyed the writing style and pace of this book. Although The Man from Beijing is a stand-alone mystery, I am very interested in reading other works by H. Mankell

The book it about a boy who has to grow up fast and take on a lot of responsibility after his father dies.  The story is set in England in the 1700's and the young boy becomes involved with pirates in search of a hidden treasure.      He learns very quickly that not everyone is who or what they appear to be.  He realizes not everyone can be trusted.  The author does a good job of describing the characters and the narrator/main character, Jim matures as he faces and overcomes obstacles while searching for treasure with the pirates.

0780021967|2.0|Look out, step aside!  Minority opinion coming through!    On the '90's kids' game show \\"Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?\\", there was a quickfire round called \\"The Chase\\" announced by fedora-clad house band Rockapella grabbing whatever props they found out back and running across the stage.  It didn't matter what there was going on  -  usually, there WAS nothing coherent going on  -  just that there was commotion in a shared direction.    \\"The 39 Steps\\" is the clear predecessor to \\"The Chase.\\"  We escape a pursuit on a railcar, only to cut to a chase through a waterfall.  We get out of a waterfall; he's off through the moors.  We do get a '30's chopper (well, autogyro) chase, so that's something, I guess.  The movie never really stops and lets it all simmer, though; the plot doesn't build or twist  -  it just continues.  The lead's sent to a far-flung Scottish town with one cryptic clue  -  find the 39 steps  -  but no candidates for or information on those blasted steps arrives, so the bulk of the movie is one long Keystone Kops sequence with no clear goals in mind.    (Please don't comment to lecture me on the nature of the MacGuffin.  The device doesn't prohibit tension-escalating tactics in the chase itself  -  new information, changes in allegiances, junctures where the lead has to stop and desperately puzzle things out.  This cupboard is bare.)    We never really get a handle on the protagonist, either.  He's good in these situations, but almost too good  -  always instantly, nigh-painlessly ready with the perfect lie or escape.  (It is, though, entertaining to see him struggle successfully through an impromptu speech without any information on the guest of honor, the occasion, or his assumed identity as speaker.)  While actor Robert Donat is a suave presence, for the character, there doesn't seem to be a there there; he just acts as the plot requires at any given moment.  Also, some empty-headed ninny becomes important in the final act for utterly no reason that to supplant attempts at tension with a lame and totally extraneous romantic subplot.  The love interest's insufferability makes the protag's bullying of her no more welcome or comfortable, though.     We're left with a series of memorable images: a sudden, horrific burst into Donat's bedroom at night, and the subsequent telephone call, where the lead can see the voice on the other end of the line through his window.  The moors part of the chase, shot with the camera angled upward, so both hunters and quarry are starkly framed against a moving sky.  The simple yet brilliant action at the climax that prompts the end reveal.  Or the scared, beaten farmer's wife who takes a bit of pitiful cheer in lending the lead assistance  -  if only she had been the one manacled to him in the final act.    Look, obviously, I'm going against some pretty formidable grain in not being impressed by this movie  -  Criterion, for one.   Wait, didn't they include Michael Bay's \\"Armageddon\\" in their lineup a few years ago?  Heck with 'em.  In the meanwhile: yes, it's an early glimpse into the themes Hitchcock would revisit with much more success later in his career, but taken on its own narrative success, it's no \\"The Lady Vanishes.\\"

The author, a psychiatrist, does an excellent job of balancing facts and concepts with stories that illustrate them.

I purchased one of the brain training programs ([...]) and am benefiting greatly from it.
0385523386|5.0|This is a great memoir that is free from many of the peccadilloes encouraged by the genre these days--too much reflection, self-indulgence, writer's workshop vibe, etc.  Instead, Ms. Kerman tells the fairly wild tale of her year in prison with sympathetic, humorous observation of her fellow inmates, great attention to detail and the nuances of dialogue and character, self-awareness without wallowing.  She clearly is a gifted writer and observer, and while she had a ton of great material in prison, I tend to believe she could make a variety of things interesting.   If you want some insight into a different world than you (hopefully) will ever inhabit, this is a super interesting book.
B00000DR5I|5.0|First, I'd like to say that I'm only 22 years old and have been listening to TD for 3 years, now. Clearly, the vast Majority of their material was released long before I was born. However, I think that has allowed me to view the early albums, such as Rubycon, in a considerably more non-partial perspective. During the past 3 years, I have acquired 13 TD studio albums, 3 soundtracks, and 2 live albums. I have become very familiar with and very devout to this band in a relatively short time span.<br /> I bring this up for I have noticed most TD fans seem to enjoy albums from the mid-70's to the early-80's better than any other era in TD's very long and accomplished career. In fact, I've seen so-called \\"Die Hard fans\\" of TD outright bash the albums that were released during most of the 80's and all of the 90's. I, on the other hand, much prefer their albums from the 1980's and the 1990's. In fact, if I were to make a list of my Top 20 TD albums, half of them would be from the 80's decade.<br /> So then, why the 5-star rating for an album that is not amongst my favorite? Well, that is simply an indication of how good this album truly is. Even though I would not rate it even close to my favorite album from TD, I still have plenty of respect and admiration for the early era of TD's career. Even I, someone who is much more partial to their output released during the past 20 years, I'm constantly attracted to this album. It draws you in so subtly, but with absolute certainty.<br /> The first few times I listened to this album in its entirety, I was quite literally overwhelmed by the amount of musical progression lying in wait for me within Rubycon's 2 tracks. Now when I listen to this album, I play the first track, take a break, and then listen to the second. This album truly does challenge its listeners to take in all of the musical notes that submerge the ears, albeit gently and gradually.<br /> The key when listening to and enjoying this piece of music is, I think, to be patient. You may not be impressed with it upon your first or even second listen. Do not be discouraged! This is the type of album that keeps you coming back for more. There's so many musical characteristics to this album that it practically requires multiple listening sessions. Each track clocks in at over 17 minutes, and TD really does utilize all 17 minutes of each track to the fullest in order to represent multiple musical themes.<br /> I'd estimate that both tracks contain 3 to 4 movements, or segments, that are slowly introduced over their 17 minute running times. Each musical section is cleverly blended together to where both tracks progress seamlessly, without sounding rushed or truncated.<br /> Rubycon provides the listener with nearly 35 minutes of music in total with only two compositions and, perhaps, because of this fairly short running time, Rubycon is surprisingly listenable record that you are sure to never tire of. I purchased this record just slightly over a year ago and it sounds fresh like the first time I heard it.<br /> Although parts 1 and 2 are classic presentations of the genesis of the \\"Electronic\\" or \\"Techno\\" genre, as well as vitally important compositions in the history of TD, part 2 suites my tastes notably better than part 1. The music itself is a bit more enjoyable and the thematic transitions are smoother.<br /><br />To conclude, I hope Rubycon brings you the same enjoyment it has to me. It stands as one of recorded music's most unique and innovative contributions.may not be impressed with it upon your first or even second listen. Do not be discouraged!

I'd estimate that both tracks contain 3 to 4 movements, or segments, that are slowly introduced over their 17 minute running times. Each musical section is cleverly blended together to where both tracks progress seamlessly, without sounding rushed or truncated.    Rubycon provides the listener with nearly 35 minutes of music in total with only two compositions and, perhaps, because of this fairly short running time, Rubycon is surprisingly listenable record that you are sure to never tire of. I purchased this record just slightly over a year ago and it sounds fresh like the first time I heard it.    Although parts 1 and 2 are classic presentations of the genesis of the \\"Electronic\\" or \\"Techno\\" genre, as well as vitally important compositions in the history of TD, part 2 suites my tastes notably better than part 1. The music itself is a bit more enjoyable and the thematic transitions are smoother.     To conclude, I hope Rubycon brings you the same enjoyment it has to me. It stands as one of recorded music's most unique and innovative contributions.

Chickies, dope, sex and rock 'n roll and oh maybe a mystery.  How disappointing! Not to mention the dialogue was contrived and no-one really talked that way!

Hang in there--you will build endurance over time and suddenly you will be completing level 1 without contemplating suicide.  For me, 30 Day Shred combined with The Firm series of workout tapes (check out Allie Del Rio's workouts) have produced better results (25 pounds lost and greater strength) than the gym.
B0021L8V1G|4.0|While Iron Man 2 may not be perfect, it is a very solid and fun sequel. Improvements include better action sequences and some great characters added to the franchise. Unfortunately there is a lot going on here and even though it isn't hard to follow, there isn't enough time to give each sub plot the proper screen time it deserves. Oddly enough for a super hero film, I think they could have edited some of the talky scenes down and added a little more Iron Man action.<br /><br />A good example of this is when we meet Natasha Romanova she isn't given much to do and I found myself wondering if she was going to be The Black Widow on screen. She is only in one action sequence(a great one with one of the funniest moments in the film)late in the movie and she and Nick Fury are really only there to set up The Avengers movie. I'm not saying it should be edited out, but there is only so much ground you can cover in two hours. Whiplash is played with gusto by Mickey Rourke, but he doesn't have much screen time either and that seems to be the problem with this film, no one but Tony Stark gets enough screen time.<br /><br />After the first encounter with Whiplash in Monaco on the race track, we don't really get a good dose of Iron man until the final battle, which means there is over an hour of time where there isn't that much action. Considering what I had read about this being an action packed film, I found it to be very talky. This isn't necessarily a bad thing because the characters are well developed and the actors are all really good here.<br /><br />The final battle is very good with some very cool Iron Man destruction and some nifty moves, but it's surprising and anti-climatic when Whiplash is defeated very quickly. In the first film, I thought the final battle was too long and in this one, it just seems to end too abruptly. I'm not bashing this film in any way as it is a very fun film that I will most certainly own the DVD/Blu Ray when it is released, but I think the story may have been a little too ambitious for one film.<br /><br />Overall I give Iron Man 2 a solid B(4 stars)and I think Favreau did a very good job all things considered. Of course if you are seeing this in a theater, then stick around until the end of the credits role for a little teaser scene about another Marvel Hero who will be hitting theaters next year.ittle too ambitious for one film.

Even if GRRM does not finish the series, I consider myself an enlightened individual for having experienced the world he created. Since there are over 1500 reviews at the time I am posting this, I will leave it at that.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|My two girls, 4 and 2, enjoyed this movie so much they now watch every day! It's a modern princess story with the Disney touch.  I truly recommend it for all ages.
B002VPE1AW|1.0|Okay, first of all, I'd like to say that when I watched this, I didn't have high expectations for it and even with that mindset, I still felt quite cheated when Avatar was over.  What really amazes me is that this is the biggest box office success in cinema history, even though this movie wasn't groundbreaking in any area, save for those graphics, but great graphics alone never make a great movie.  Avatar is no different from the overpriced, mindless swill that Michael Bay, Jerry Bruckheimer, and Roland Emmerich are puking out frequently.  And what really saddens me is that this came from James Cameron, who is after all, the guy who made some of the most notable films in the sci-fi/action genre, which are Aliens and the first two Terminator movies.  For him to fall from grace like this is just saddening.  Anyway, let's break it down.<br /><br />PLOT<br /><br />For a movie with so much time and money spent on it, I was really disappointed with the fact that Avatar's plot is nothing more than a sci-fi themed CGI wankfest interpretation of Pocahontas and Dances with Wolves.  The film is set in the year 2154, when humans are mining a precious mineral called unobtanium on Pandora, a lush moon of a gas giant in the Alpha Centauri star system. The expansion of the mining colony threatens the continued existence of a local tribe of Na'vi--a sentient humanoid species indigenous to Pandora. A paraplegic Marine named Jake Sully is sent to spy on the Na'vi with an artificial Na'vi body referred to as an Avatar.  However, Jake has a change of heart and helps the Na'vi fight.  In other words, it can be broken down into the following simple structure.<br /><br />\\"Bad guys send in spy disguised as one of the good guys to get information about them as to conveniently subjugate them, but spy has change of heart and helps the good guys fight bad guys.\\"<br /><br />Sounds just like the previously mentioned movies.  If you watched a lot of movies, you can predict exactly what's going to happen as the movie progresses because this movie doing something original will throw off its balance in a fashion similar to a rhinoceros trying to give a blue whale and a prairie dog a piggyback ride while riding a unicycle.  It has the predictable romantic development with the main male and female leads, the numerous \\"deus ex machina\\" actions done solely for the convenience of the plot and characters, and so much other predictable and corny traits that make this movie such a bore.  A fine example of one of these many \\"deus ex machina\\" moments has to be when Jake (in Avatar form) manages to heavily damage a giant gunship with the Colonel (main bad guy) and as the gunship is falling down, the Colonel dons an armed mecha suit and just barely gets out of the plummeting gunship.  Of course, this has to happen because if it didn't, we wouldn't get that mandatory yet predictable \\"awesome epic showdown\\" between the hero and the villain.  In fact, my sister-in-law verbally predicted the said showdown as the Colonel was escaping the gunship.<br /><br />CHARACTERS<br /><br />Another nail in Avatar's coffin was the characters.  I didn't care about any of them because they were all so stereotypical and flat.  Sully was the \\"uncertain main lead,\\" Grace was the \\"concerned ultra-smart scientist,\\" and the Colonel was the \\"tough guy 'lets kill everything' army man,\\" and Neytiri is the \\"sexy, smart, and benevolent native-type princess.\\"  None of them were interesting and morally speaking, were all one-sided.  I HATE this because I find it so cliche and simple to belt out.  I would have preferred that the characters had more complexity to their beliefs and reasoning, but we don't get that here.<br /><br />THEMES<br /><br />Adding themes to movies can enhance them greatly, but if they're obvious and one-sided, they add next to no value to the film.  And in Avatar's case, the themes and social commentary are one-sided and obvious.  It sickens me as to how people are bleating about how\\"great\\" Avatar's message is about imperialism and destroying the environment.  Though when you take the movie's theme about being environmentally conscious into consideration, it's extremely laughable because its one-dimensional nature brings it on the level of such one-sided slop like Ferngully, Wall-E, Captain Planet, and On Deadly Ground.  While I'm personally not against taking measures to benefit the environment, I cringe at the whole \\"lets live in harmony with nature and take down technological progress\\" notion because I doubt that people will easily give up the technology that's essential to their lives (such as houses, computers, and cars) for the sake of benefiting the environment.  At least with Princess Mononoke, it displayed the ecology message in a more realistic and complex manner.  The messages about imperialism and militarism aren't any better because they too, are so obvious and one-sided.  Of course, corporations with mercenary aid taking over other chunks of land is certainly a detestable thing, but the reasoning for it is so tacky and unrealistic.  The only reasoning behind these heinous actions is that \\"the corporation needs a profit.\\"  What about the fact that this movie hints that Earth is low on natural resources and needs to power its civilization?  Or how about people working in the energy industry needing a paycheck to feed their families?  Of course, it has to be this simple and dumbed-down because if there was any complexity to these issues, mainstream audiences would be confused and the movie wouldn't have generated the unbelievably huge profit it got.<br /><br />APPEARANCE<br /><br />The only thing Avatar has going for it is the outstanding special effects and CGI used in the movie.  Indeed, the imagery is unbelievable, and it's pretty obvious as to where a huge chunk of Avatar's $500 million budget went.  I personally loved the military vehicles and weapons displayed in this movie because of the fact that I have an interest in military technology and the fact that while the vehicles and weapons were indeed futuristic, their appearances and functions were still largely based off current military technology.  Everything else looked fabulous as well since every little detail hasn't been skimped on any object, animate or inanimate.  However, I must scorn the idealistic physiques of the Na'vi because all of them looked like humanoid cat alien supermodels.  Would a little physical diversity be too much to ask for?  I guess it was another way for Cameron to show how the Na'vi have life down to a \\"T\\" as compared to those oh-so-evil humans.<br /><br />FINAL WORD<br /><br />If you want James Cameron's prime films, go check out Aliens and the first two Terminator movies instead of this (if you haven't already).  If you want the best sci-fi/action film of 2009, go check out District 9 instead of Avatar because D9, while a little overrated, has much more believable and interesting characters with much cooler action scenes with more subtle, believable messages about humanity.  D9 also had some good special effects to boot, almost as good as those in Avatar.  With all of this good stuff, you might wonder how big D9's budget was.  District 9's budget was $32 million, less than 1/15th of Avatar's.  Just comes to show that you don't need to spend half a billion dollars to make a worthwhile movie, you just need interesting characters with engaging plots.  Now if only James Cameron believed in those principles again, which made most of his films in the 80's and early 90's the classics people remember them as.the environment.

0786856297|5.0|I thought this book was really good and awesome. I liked the beginning of the 1st book.  It was very slow in the beginning but I loved the authors Rick Riordan. He is a strong character with problems of his own but friends and family always come first to him thought. Love his sarcastic sense of humor in this book. It is great for any age kids or young adult or adult. It is also educational because it teaches a lot about Greek mythology. Percy the main character is thrown into a whirlwind adventure that is keeping you on the edge of your seat the entire time as you read this book. This book is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR THE SUMMER TIME READING LIST FOR ANY SCHOOL GROUPS!!!
074322454X|5.0|I must say that I watched the HBO series long before I read the book, in fact didn't even know about the book until the HBO series.  That being said I loved the series and knew that the book would have to be just as good.  Although they have a different feel, you felt while reading it that you were there with Easy Company.    Ambrose certainly has a gift in interviewing and drawing the facts and story out.  While reading I couldn't help but be amazed at the men of Easy Company and what they did together.  You admire Winters for his actions and how he lead, and you feel this same feeling come across from the men that served under him.  As well you know that they would do anything for not only Winters but for one another.  This comes across in the details that Ambrose is able to draw out of the paratroopers.  Additionally, the same detail shows the horrors of war from the soldiers point of view, from dead soldiers to destroyed towns, to looting your own paratroopers to looting Germany, you can't help but feel the ups and downs.    That being said I am glad that I watched the series before I read the book.  I made the mistake of reading Leckie's Helmet For My Pillow just before The Pacific came out and I was a little disappointed with the series in the beginning because I was already familiar with what was going on.  With Band of Brothers I was enthralled by the series and still loved reading the book, which was the opposite of The Pacific (I've held off reading any more of the memoirs and the series has gotten a lot better, although still not as good as Band of Brothers).    Read this book even if you've watched the series.  The detail is more and the touch of the interviews add a lot to the series.  A definite recommend.    5 stars.

0385504225|1.0|I read Angels & Demons shortly after seeing the movie \\"The DaVinci Code.\\" While I loved Angels & Demons (at that time I was a freshman in high school), I can't stand this book. It's been a while since I've read the other book, so it might suffer from the same flaws this one does. Regardless, here's why I don't recommend this:    1. Every chapter ends with a major cliffhanger. It felt as if I were on a roller coaster; not a Cedar Point, Millennium Force coaster, but one in a small-town fair. There was a small bump every five or so pages that broke Brown's flow. This was extremely annoying.    2. Repetition of words and scenes. Every girl is described as \\"playful.\\" Every action that isn't serious is \\"playful.\\" Can you think of another word, Mr. Brown?     3. Another reviewer compared this book to Lost, hinting that Lost is poorly written. I'd beg to differ. Lost builds momentum, has question after question, everything in the show has a purpose, and its final season explains everything. Basically, it was all worth the wait. This book is has no where near the same depth as Lost's plot line. I felt like it was haphazardly thrown together (characters appearing out of no where, scenes with no purpose, etc.) and that the plot had little difference from that of the DaVinci Code or Angels & Demons: Langdon gets an emergency call that puts him in the middle of a giant conspiracy that ultimately finds him a girlfriend as he educates readers and his own audience about controversial topics in early Christian History. Same old, same old.      I put the book down fifteen or so chapters in after I had looked up the ending on Wikipedia. Just as I suspected, Langdon saves the day, gets rewarded, and preaches religious tolerance. While I'm a huge proponent of religious tolerance, I don't think Dan Brown's the guy best able to illustrate it.

B0012GN44U|5.0|Once asked how it felt to be the greatest rock guitarist in the world, Jimi Hendrix replied, \\"I wouldn't know. Ask Rory Gallagher.\\"<br /><br />This as good as a studio album as Rory recorded but nothing matches his live recordings.<br />Stand out cuts are the title track, Calling Card and Country Mile.<br />Two bonus tracks help out in making this a great studio effort of Rory at his peak.<br />As mentioned in the liner notes, sadly this would be the last album with Rory's amazing band, Gerry McAvoy on bass, Lou Martin on keyboards and Roddy de'Ath on drums.<br /><br />After all these years, and so long after Rory's untimely death, his music still has the gut-punch as the day these tracks were laid down.<br />I'm always surprised at how many rock/blues fanatics have never heard Rory. Like the great Roy Buchanan, they were better than many of the well known names in rock guitar.<br /><br />Rory is much missed but what he left behind is timeless and in my opinion, flawless.

B000PHOY0A|5.0|This is one of the most interesting and important books I have ever read. It begins with a black New Guinean named Yali asking the author why it is that the whites have all the \\"cargo\\" (material goods). Since it is apparent to both Yali and J. Diamond that New Guineans are at least as intelligent as whites, the author looks for environmental factors that could have shaped history in that direction.  He finds quite a few: better and more numerous farmable plants in Eurasia, as well as more species of domesticable animals than elsewhere. Beginning farming leads to some kind of records for taxes, the beginnings of chiefs and government.  This in turn leads to further developments.  If Eurasia began with better prospective foodstuffs in the first place, it also had advantages of a larger landmass for more people and a more sophisticated government and society, more people for inventions like spears or crossbows.    Germs come from domestic animals, and Eurasians had more of those. So whites' ancestors died by the millions, and those now alive have resistance to things like colds and influenza. Those germs had their first crack at native Americans in the 1490's to 1500s and wiped out many societies or their leaders (such as the Inca. The one Pizarro captured was a younger brother).  Knowing where we have come from and how we got here is essential citizenship knowledge in an increasingly global society. From here, we can decide how to share existing wealth more equitably, how to educate \\"backward\\" races, and, hopefully, how to preserve the lore of aboriginal peoples. After all, if large numbers and varieties of people were so beneficial for Eurasian culture, then preserving all our global heritage will make a stronger future for everyone.

He isn't quite ready to play by the rules, but it was easy enough for him to come up with his own style of play.  The cards that specify what you will build don't show Lego constructions, so it takes some imagination to figure out how to make some of the items.  How would you build a Lego fly, or zoo or frog?  The game includes a good assortment of pieces, including more unusual ones.
0393072231|5.0|Let me start out by declaring a bias in writing this review ; I'm a big fan of Michael Lewis generally and, in particular,  his writings about the stock markets & Wall Street financial businesses. I've read 2 of his earlier books on these subjects. He always combines a critical, factual analysis (he worked in the belly of the beast early in his career) of the games they play, but he does it in easy-to-read prose with a warm, human touch & understated humor. He got started with his best-seller \\"Liar's Poker\\" re: the 80's \\"decade of greed\\" Wall Street games.     I finished reading his newest book just this past week, during which all the stock markets got whacked hard (May 3-7, 2010). As for the \\"recovery\\", it's suspicious too... perhaps from 'buy the dip' computerized program trading, maybe from the mysterious \\"plunge protection\\" machinery of the US government. We don't know. But what Mr. Lewis has been telling you all along is that this is a dangerous market. It is no place for the nest eggs or life savings of widows, orphans, most working-families, or those retired or nearing-retirement. Mostly, it's a very good market for gamblers (e.g. hedge funds like Paulson), connected with well-connected insiders on Wall Street (of which Goldman Sachs is the ultimate) and compliant governmental regulators & legislators (\\"follow the money\\" , re: campaign donations)following dubious political mandates (maximizing home ownership as an entitlement via EEO-quota loans) and enabled by sleeping watchdogs at ratings agencies and accounting rules.    Before you conclude that I'm just an anti-business sorehead, consider my former education (MBA 1969) & work (founder & managing partner of a very successful Minneapolis-based engineering partnership which invented and patented manufacturing technologies licensed all over the world) before retiring. I'm hardly anti-capitalist ; but financial fraud and \\"crony capitalism\\" needs to be exposed. I'm a fan of this book and of Mr. Lewis because that's what he does so brilliantly but without the name-calling & yelling or any political partisanship.     This book deservedly is a best-seller, topping the lists of both Non-Fiction and Business book categories.
0393072231|3.0|Michael Lewis is a good writer and choose a good topic and from an unconventional perspective.  BUT! It easily could have been much better. It has a very rushed feel to the book production.  (1) It very badly needs an index. (2) It would help a lot to have pictures of the main characters. (3) A few diagrams of the flow and structure of the mortages wrapped up in the CDOs, CDSs, etc. would help a lot.
B00004RF83|5.0|The secret code between the conspirators is the Preakness horse-race - except it shows as being scheduled for a Sunday (it's always run on a Saturday) and the 2010 Preakness is just a week away. I didn't have a chance to view the DVD until just yesterday.    As usual in Hollywood, there are similar gaffs - the right side collar insignia on Kirk Douglas's shirt in upside-down. In the military, hats are never worn indoors (unless the individual is on duty and carrying a sidearm or rifle, e.g. Military Police.) Navy and Coast Guard personnel wear hats while aboard a vessel. These were Air Force, Marine Corps, and Army Officers and they wore their hats indoors - even in the White House - major military etiquette faux pas and reflected poorly on the authenticity of the movie, in that respect it was just like when General Scott (Lancaster) was caught by Douglas in an un-necessary lie.    In the United States, the military is controlled by the civilian government - all of the cabinet Secretaries are civilians and appointed by the President. The military budget is tightly controlled so that secret base couldn't have been created. Only the CIA budget is above scrutiny - there are funds for some special purposes for which accountability is not required - and there is no reason to think that the CIA is about to change the status-quo. The American people don't need to fear the military as there will never be a military coup in the United States.    It just shows that Hollywood can sometimes very much be a loose cannon on a rolling deck. Attention to detail is important in all phases of creative endeavors - and motion pictures are a modern art-form. The \\"view of the forest\\" was obscured because \\"the trees\\" got in the way.

B00104WHLA|5.0|Let's clear up some confusion: the only reason anyone should spending this kind of money on music is because this music is encoded on Sony's Super Audio (SACD) format.  If you are primarily in the market for mp3s, then you need not spend this much money to listen to them through a pair of tiny speakers incapable of micro-dynamics.  The reason this and the other Genesis box sets are worth this much money is BECAUSE of the SACD format!  But if you do not know what that is and/or do not have a home system capable of reproducing the full spectrum of audible frequencies, then do yourself a favor and save your money because no one looking for this box set wants to hear you whine and cry about the dvds being PAL and not NTSC!  Besides, quite a few of these songs are not even available for download.<br /><br />Now, as far as the SACDs themselves are concerned these remixes are very, very pleasing to the keen ear.  They are neither overly bright nor warm but even handed in their coloration.  And the multi-channel performance is a more balanced surround field with fewer distracting aural gimmicks than the first SACD box set released for Genesis.  My only complaint is with the remix of \\"Selling England By The Pound\\" which should have been truer to the original.  I love the improved sound quality of \\"Nursery Crime\\" and \\"Foxtrot\\" and would recommend both over the 1994 Definitive Editions, \\"Selling England By The Pound\\" was a case where one should not fix that which is not broken.  All I wanted with Genesis' greatest album was an upgrade in sound quality/performance.  The alternate vocal takes in \\"Dancing with the Moonlit Knight\\" as well as the noticeably different mixing of the keyboards on \\"The Cinema Show\\" would have been worthy bonus tracks, but these are two of the greatest progressive rock songs _ever_ written!  The original mixes have more than stood the test of time and deserved their due on SACD.<br /><br />The seventies were the golden age of Genesis, the quintet, the quartet, and, at least early on, the trio.  But there really was something truly magical when all five songwriters were together.  The manner in which Gabriel, Banks, Rutherford, Hackett, and Collins would interact with one another both creatively and musically was really one of those rare fortunes in history.  Such art deserves to live on in the SACD format!  I just wish that the late Eric Woolfson & Alan Parsons (The Alan Parsons Project) would receive a similar treatment.least early on, the trio.  But there really was something truly magical when all five songwriters were together.

B000A2RRF4|5.0|Watching this video took me back in time to again enjoy Michael Jacksons performance. He was one of the few to put so much into his concerts and his video's. The quality of the video itself is extremely well done. I remember seeing this concert on T.V. all those years ago. Thank you to Amazon for providing us with a link to our musical history.
B002B4OVWG|5.0|We received this monkey binky Wubbanub as a gift when our daughter was born.  She was and still is not much of a binky user in general.  So early on we didn't use the monkey at all.  However, at around 4 months our daughter showedsigns of teething so o. A whim I gave her the monkey.  Now it is one of three favorites that we don't go anywhere without!!!  She uses it mostly to suck or chew when she is teething.  It is the perfect size for her to hold and manipulate to knaw on the binky or the monkey itself!  It was such a hit that I ordered two more but with different animals - kitty and pony.  The monkey has a but more weight than the other two and is still the favorite!  I order it for gifts now for others and it has always been a hit!
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I was heartbroken  that the \\"This Is It\\" Tour actually was it for M.J. I think he looked good, he looked like M. Jackson would at that point in his life. We grew use to seeing his physical changes, and there were those of us who enjoyed his musical changes. This Is It is a must have for Michael's fans for it showed us where he was going with his future had he been allowed to have one. Blessed Be Michael, you will be remembered always.

His attention to detail and complicated plot line were so compelling that I was under his spell from the very beginning. Having spent time in Washington, DC I was able to picture the structures he described as if I were there. Thank you for the interesting ride, I enjoyed it!

0307341577|5.0|Flynn's novel has the effect of blunt force trauma. With icy precision and an eye for the consequences of poverty and despair, this novel hums with discordance and the chronic misery of a family mired in unhappiness. In January, 1985, Libby Day is the survivor of a family massacre, at seven years old the only witness to the murder of her mother and two sisters on their Kansas farm. Libby's brother, Ben, has spent the last twenty-five years in jail for what an avid press describes as \\"The Satan Sacrifice of Kinnakee Kansas\\". A sullen, angry teenager, Ben proves an uncooperative person of interest, the public promptly labeling him a drug-addicted Satanist. Now in her thirties, Libby bears the scars of that harrowing night, when she climbed from her mother's bedroom window to escape her family's grisly fate. Carefully coached, Libby is the star witness against Ben, the jury happy to put an end to the nightmare scenario of the butchered Day family, Ben an obvious target.<br /><br />An unlikely heroine, Libby is profoundly depressed, suicidal and nearly out of funds from a trust set up for the surviving victim of the crimes. A product of her environment, Libby is a manipulative liar and opportunist, a thief of people's belongings, anything to momentarily assuage the gaping hole in her life without family or hope. Approached by the Kill Club, a loose group of true crime aficionados, Libby seizes an opportunity to earn some desperately needed money by selling selected family memorabilia and visiting the brother she has not spoken to since her testimony in court. Her world already painfully distorted by the murders, contacting Ben is but another step down a dark path toward oblivion. Fearless, Libby has been waiting to die since that terrible January night.<br /><br />This novel is shocking, brutal and disconcerting, an unsparing exploration of people and their motives, a harsh landscape that questions long-held assumptions about the human capacity for violence. The Days are the object of ridicule, their hand-me-down clothes and indelible mark of less-than. It is easy to recoil, to point the finger of guilt at the angst-riddled teenager, Ben, and donate money for the profoundly disturbed survivor, who bounces from place to place wreaking havoc on those who provide shelter. And as the facts of that night are revealed, layer after layer of ugliness is exposed, a confluence of violence that fills the air with screams, then silence. From the Day family to Ben's questionable associates and his flirtation with the forbidden, from bone-crushing poverty and the banality of true evil, Flynn crafts a masterpiece of cold-blooded horror with no happy ending, daring the reader to look away. Stripping the mask of innocence from the predictable response to a heinous crime, Flynn stares into the void, daring us to do the same.

B001KOFH2G|5.0|Why didn't people take the critics' words on this one? Before I even knew about the series \\"Firefly\\" from which this came, I watched this on the insistence of one of my favorite movie critics and was BLOWN AWAY! Not only is the dialogue snappy and true to human conversation, but the story itself is completely original (unlike most of the formulaic stuff spewing out of Hollywood these days). This movie is a breath of fresh air, and the Blu-ray transfer is gorgeous. Extras give you a lot of insight into Joss Whedon's creativity. I liked the tour of the ship.
B0030IIZ56|5.0|I am thrilled with the price I paid for both movies. I received a BluRay disc and received a bonus DVD to play in my car when we travel or leave at Grandma's since she does not own a BluRay player.

0440243688|5.0|Reacher is a phenomenal mystery hero, and every book in Child's series is so intelligently and grippingly written that I have to choose between 4 and 5 stars.  I rate the Reacher series a little higher than the Harry Bosch series [which has more drawn-out weltschmerz], the Davenport series [more vapid], and maybe on a par with the Rain series--all four absolutely great! Child is especially good at having Reacher reflect, finding tiny, camouflaged facts and drawing well-reasoned [if sometimes far-fetched and sometimes mistaken] conclusions from them, sometimes in an instant and sometimes after long puzzling and realizing his own errors.  The recounting of Reacher's progressive inferences in Child's novels is what distinguishes them as superb, in my opinion.  There's usually a genuine mystery with an initially deceiving nature that requires one or two major perspective shifts before solution, and there's always action and instantaneous reaction, with most of the inevitable torture carried out off-stage.  Of course, in any series there's the repetitive stuff about Reacher, about his objects of interest [always guns, but here New York City, too].  There's also a cumulative level of far-fetched situations, characters, coincidences, mistakes by the otherwise competent characters, etc.<br /><br />This novel places Reacher in a different context, of organized international terrorism.  It poses an unusual type of mystery, with no clues until stooges from the various sides start giving him the information he needs to start inferring, and he has to change perspective several times.  Several of the supporting characters are almost as smart as Reacher, so the battles of wits are a little more balanced than usual.  This novel is pretty high on the far-fetchedness meter, but the resultant action usually justifies the suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />So I recommend Gone Tomorrow.  It may be a better read for people who haven't read a lot of other Reacher novels, since it dependson outside characters less than average, and repeats some plot patterns from other novels.  Child also has some writing quirks that become annoying after a while: \\"...if I stood I would be looking about three feet over their heads.  Less threatening to stay seated. More conducive to conversation.  And more practical, in terms of energy expenditure.  I was tired.\\"  Too tired to think a full sentence.  Too tired to avoid predictable rephrasings.  And the tighter the book, the fewer the pages.  Too hard to justify the $9.99 price.<br /><br />I don't mean that too negatively--I can't think of any series or author that doesn't get into repetition fairly fast.  I do think _Nothing to Lose_ was pretty weak--deep down too far-fetched and thus poorly plotted.  But the other novels have all been very high-quality.  After reading ten, you can get tired of any series pattern, but I find that the Reacher series keeps me reading compulsively and admiringly.<br /><br />Some other reviewers have happily noted the presence of less political commentary in this novel than usual--by which they mean less leftish political sentiment, of course, and admittedly there is more centrism.  But Reacher mostly believes in the military, distrusts and denigrates community and the essential contributions of government, encounters vast conspiracies, worships guns, and epitomizes the lone virtuous individual who is the only hope for solving problems.  But, of course, that's not political commentary, that's just the way things are, as proved by any John Wayne movie.<br /><br />P.S.: I take back one remark--in later books, Reacher believes less and less in the military, and maybe he didn't even start out all that pro.
B003BVK36Q|5.0|The question as to if this book is a page-turner or not to my mind is irrelevant because it is a sheer joy to pick up this le Carre novel and delight in his exquisite writing style. His story and characters are so credible, as he excels in the description of those small details of expression, of movement and of emotions that give color to our lives. One feels as if this novel had been written in glorious 3D and as a bonus you don't need special glasses to be right up there in the action. The writing radiates a rare intelligence and sophistication where the scenes and the characters are all so believable that you could reach out, touch them and partake in them.  In fact, and if anything, they are a little too real in the politically correct and threatening world we have created for ourselves.
B00006V9A0|5.0|I'm a casual Nirvana fan.  Not because I wouldn't have loved them if I'd paid enough attention at the time, but I was busy or something.  I was barely into rock and roll in the 90's.  But like every human with electricity, I bobbed my head to \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" whenever it played, and it played everywhere. I saw the lyrics printed somewhere and saw that it wasn't just silliness being screamed in a cool way; it was genuinely moving.  I heard \\"Come As You Are\\" a time or twelve in the same fashion. I saw the videos at friends' houses.  It was all on the peripheral to me.      But it was enough of a soul-jab for me to know that if I was listening to anything electric and screamy, this would probably be it.  When Curt died I felt a crazy amount of grief for how little I'd ever even seen his face:  A clue, I reckon, to how deep in you the guy can get at first blush.  I remember hearing the news and going outside where I was working and kicking the crap out some cardboard boxes and actually crying.  I was probably mostly enjoying a dose of 25-year-old drama, but there was a kernel of real sorrow. I really grieved.    Flash forward a decade and a half and I see this disc for nine bucks sitting in Wal Mart.  I barely know enough to know that if it's got SmLTSpirit but doesn't have a naked baby on it, this must be a compilation.  Looks like greatest hits or something.  I bought it and soaked in the hits in a super-tardy blaze of heaviness.  So, I feel unusually qualified to say, this is a great cd under at least one circumstance.  If you've only dug the band at a distance, get it and drink it in. This is a worthy band.  The heaviness is real, it's not just some quirk from Seattle past.  It's one of the only 5 or so \\"hard\\" CD's I own.  It's beautiful.  I feel sad all over again.

B0039SFKSW|5.0|This is an amazing collection of songs. There's enough here for those yearning for the old days with I BELIEVE, END OF THE WORLD, and HOLY WAR.  But you'll also find wonderfully crafted songs that don't sound like anything you have ever heard before. THERE WAS A TIME is a chilling, celtic sounding ballad with amazing vocals and poignant lyrics. My favorite so far. LISTEN CHILDREN is a great, upbeat pop song with ASIA flair. With each listen, you'll keep changing your mind about which song is your favorite. Buy one for yourself and one each for all of your friends. Amazing!

0060594896|5.0|Jack Canfield, co-author of the popular series of books, \\"Chicken Soup For the Soul\\", also wrote this amazing book, \\"The Success Principles\\"<br /><br />After being a successful information technology consultant for a number of years, I suffered some health set-backs and was unable to work. Followed closely by severe depression.  While I was attending an out-patient class, I was given a photocopy of a magazine article by Jack Canfield entitled: Visualize and Affirm Your Desired Outcomes. I new about Jack because of his other work so I knew that that article had some credibility. I decided to read and implement the handful of principles outlined in the article, visualizations, affirmations, and goal setting.<br /><br />Within a month or two of practicing these concepts, I found that I was feeling better in many areas.  Then, I bought the book, The Success Principles. I use it first, as a textbook for success and then for inspiration. I also highly recommend the Jack Canfield Training Group, Coaching Process.<br /><br />Currently I am enrolled in college and maintaining my health in all areas (Self-Care). As I continue the educational process, which I love, I have short, and long-term goals to further develop an IT (Information Technology)consulting business, further develop and launch an IT-based service company, similar to Geek Squad (but much larger), and to write books.<br />Thank You very much to Jack Canfield,<br /><br />Kevin Zaharas
B0001XTIUO|5.0|Full disclosure:  I am currently recording the long-awaited Linda Perhacs album, although this did occur because I was so enamored with \\"Parallelograms\\".<br /><br />\\"Parallelograms\\" is easily one of the most impressive \\"lost\\" albums. I can't help but wonder what would have happened if this has been promoted when it came out.  This sometimes psychedelic masterpiece has longing, whimsy, and mischief.  Both what drew me in were the often haunting vocals and otherworldly harmonies that are informed by Linda's synesthesia, where she experiences music as shapes.  This album is absolutely gorgeous and rewards repeated listening.<br /><br />Due to the beauty of her music, I went to Linda's show at the Redcat Theater in downtown Los Angeles and met her after the show. I am now recording her at Blueberry Buddha Recording Studios in Los Angeles, and along with Julia Holter, we have just finished mixing the first song. I am happy to report that, although a noticeable departure from \\"Parallelograms\\", she is still creating beautiful, enchanting, mesmerizing, psychedelic music. And yes, with taste, warmth, sensitivity, feeling, and perception, as former classmate T.J. Yarborough pointed out in his review.  She is a beautiful person inside and out, and I enjoy taking part in creating her music.<br /><br />We are creating / recording the music slowly, and sometimes it's difficult for me to be patient because I want to hear these songs finished so much, but I will have to be patient along with you and anyone else anxiously awaiting the next Linda Perhacs album!!! I believe it will be well worth the wait.  In the mean time, enjoy \\"Parallelograms\\".  Strongly recommended!!

0307473708|4.0|This book is very entertaining.  Having watched the show first and going back and read the book, I can see how the show creators saw a robust character and ran with it.  If you have not seen the show, it will be entertaining with a great amount of character development.  If you have, you will notice the show is true to the book to a point and then takes a different direction.  Either way, it will keep you guessing until the very end on what happens to Dexter.
B00005NB8K|2.0|The Doors - directed by Oliver Stone -  is a sad story about the 60's rock group and legend Jim Morrison, lead singer, poet and songwriter.  The movie covers the period from 1965-1971.  Val Kilmer stars as Jim Morrison, a very intelligent man who is his own worst enemy.  He cannot handle the pressures of success.  We see a slow train wreck as he turns to excesses in drugs, drink, women and exhibitionism.<br /><br />In the beginning (1965) he is going to college, but also a Southern California beach boy, writing poetry, finding his first true love.  It could be the start of Beach Blanket Bingo for that matter.  A friend helps Jim form the Doors rock group (named after the book by Aldus Huxley \\"The Doors of Perception\\")  and from there on it is a marathion of drugs, drink, egotism, confusion and despair.  Depending on how much you enjoy the 1960's counterculture will be how you view this movie.  It hypnotizes in the treadmill of drug trips, crazy outfits, California, trendy clubs, Andy Warhol parties, and outrageous behavior.<br /><br />As fabulous as Val Kilmer plays Jim Morrison, the drugged, halucinagenic excess becomes boring fast.  The opporutnity lost is that Morrison had talent with words, high intelligence, but spent it on the dark side.  Seeing this movie I am wondering if he could have been pulled from the abyss with better handlers and some on-going therapy. Morrison died in Paris at the young age of 27 and is buried in a near-by cemetery for famous artists.  Overall, the movie seemed like a long tabloid expose and I felt like this was an intrusion on the Morrison's privacy.<br /><br />It also starred Meg Ryan (as Morrison's girlfriend), and the Doors group played by Frank Whaley, Kyle MacLachlan
B0030IIZ56|5.0|TY2 on Bluray looks awesome! The transfer is amazing. Looks better than TY1 actually - which would make sense since it is newer. :)  Not much to say other than if you've already seen it on DVD and love the movie - it's a classic time piece.  The PQ and AQ are top notch, especially since it is DTS Master HD audio! The chapter when Buzz and the gang go looking for Woody at night in front of a Postal drop box - looks and sounds great! Of course the rest of the movie is awesome as well!!  If you don't have it, I recommend getting it - at least when it is 19.99 or below. ;)
0891419063|5.0|I was a student in Dr. Sledge's zoology class when I was in college at The University of Montevallo.  Unfortunately, I did not read his book until several years later, after he had passed away.  What a missed opportunity to discuss the fascinating experiences of a true war hero.<br /><br />This book is an excellent first hand account of real combat--describing all of it's ugliness in detail.  What I found truly gripping was how Dr. Sledge was able to convey the assault on all of the senses he experienced. It is amazing to me that this gentle man came though the kind of disgusting events detailed here.<br /><br />The book is superbly well written.  If you want an in-the-trenches account of the Pacific island battles, buy this book.  It will not disappoint.
B001OQCV2O|4.0|Well, simply put, Roland Emmerich has done it again! He has been noted for the destruction of the world in such flicks as Independence Day, Godzilla (ok, it was not the world, but New york City had the notoriety of being destroyed by a giant lizard!) & The Day After Tommorrow, has served us his latest, 2012!<br />If you love movies depicting any natural disasters, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, floods, tsunamis, avalanches & complete city-wide devastation, this is the movie for you. I am so glad he did include a meteor or an asteroid or a comet! The special effects are spectacular, the drama level is very much close to home. This is a film that entertains & leaves asking the big question, will this happen on the date specified???? Only time will tell!<br />The blu-ray is fantastic in its diplay & the sound is mind-blowing or the very least, ear-shattering! Bless DTS!!! The film is on the first disc together with deleted scenes, P-I-P commentary with the director, trailer previews(nothing to brag about) & some other stuff which has been mentioned before. The second has the rest of the doumentaries, bts stuff , the music video & making of, also. The third disc is the good old digital copy for those who enjoy that sort of thing.<br />This is not to be confused with the other blu-ray available which has the documentary 2012 Apocalyse.<br />This film is likely to be received by mixed audiences, everyone has their take on it.<br />Just enjoy it for the sheer entertainment value & with a bowl of popcorn too!!!

1596912863|5.0|Many women could relate to Shannon Hale's heroine in Austenland. In her thirties, living in New York, and still single after a slew of bad relationships, Jane has decided to forsake men and live out her life with Mr. Darcy. As a dedicated Austen fan, she spends her evenings watching Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle while lamenting the death of romance, top hats, cravats, and all other manner of Regency wonders. But what if those things didn't have to be a thing of the past? What if Austen fans could truly become a part of the stories they love so much, if only for a little while? Austenland provides a hilarious and insightful look into such a possibility.<br /><br />While having lunch, Jane Hayes' great aunt brutally scrutinizes Jane's affection of Austen's leading man. Her great aunt informs her that she must let go of her fantasies about fictional characters and stop destroying her real relationships. Following this conversation, Jane receives a \\"trip\\" from her great aunt in which she is to fly to England and partake in a sort of theme park geared towards Jane Austen fans. For an entire month, Jane is to be immersed in the life and times of Austen's characters.<br /><br />As soon as she arrives, Jane is forced to give over all of her modern amenities- cell phone, laptop, and all of her clothes. For the next month, she will eat, sleep, and breathe the 19th century. The house where Jane is staying is full of people, including various actors and another woman who is also living out her Austen fantasies. The actors include all of the expected character types, including a charming Wickham-esque rogue and an arrogant gentleman who fills the shoes of Mr. Darcy. Jane considers the whole thing to be incredibly ridiculous, and initially rebels against the whole concept. However, after some time at the park, she decides to go ahead and have some fun. To Jane, this is her last big Austen fantasy before she returns home and forsakes men and love for good. During her time at Austenland, Jane experiences all sorts of unusual and hilarious events that influence her perspectives on life and love.<br /><br />I loved this book! If you are a lover of Jane Austen, this book is a fun take on what it is to be an Austen fan! Keep in mind, this is not the type of book that takes you back in time to Regency England, and it's not written as such either. It's 100% modern, and aside from when the characters are role playing, all behavior and language is that of the 21st century. If you're looking for a literary classic, this is not it! However, if you are the sort of person who daydreams about being one of Austen's characters, I definitely feel that you would enjoy this book.<br /><br />One of my favorite qualities of this book was the writing. It was a light, easy read, and I love that you occasionally witness Jane's conflicted thoughts. Rather than being a straightforward (aka boring) thinker, Jane is often torn as to how she should respond to her situation. Her thought processes are hilarious (perhaps because they are slightly reminiscent of my own) and lend a bit of realism to the book. Another awesome feature is that each chapter is kicked off with a hilariously tragic story from Jane's previous relationships, allowing the reader to gain some understanding of why her love life has gone so awry.<br /><br />Frankly, I think a person could make bank if they decided to actually open a place like Austenland. I can think of a number of women who would gladly go play Lizzy Bennet for a month! This book really stands out among the numerous books I own that are based on the works of Jane Austen. It is the only book I've ever read that utilizes the modern fan as a character, giving voice to a fantasy that many Austen fans have had. It's a lot like BBC's Lost In Austen, but in a slightly more believable context.<br /><br />Have you ever fantasized about being Lizzy Bennet? Have you determined that your chances of a happy relationship are forever ruined because no man comes close to Mr. Darcy? Have you ever dreamed about what it would be like to attend a ball and mingle with the haute ton? If you answered yes to any of these, this book is for you!reamed about what it would be like to attend a ball and mingle with the haute ton? If you answered yes to any of these, this book is for you!

B002VPE1B6|5.0|I managed to miss this in the theaters and bought the blu-ray on a whim without a lot of prior exposure to the story.  My first reaction was nostalgia.  I read hundreds of books like Avatar as a child - cheap, latter-era pulp sci-fi for fifty cents out of the bargain bin at my local comic book shop.  Pages already slightly yellowed.  Deep-space marines fighting alien dragons from the door gun of their helicopter would have fit perfectly in one of those books.  They certainly weren't important literature, they weren't speaking to anything timeless in the human condition, and their plots may have been a bit thin... but they were COOL and a great way for a boy to lose himself to the world on a hot summer afternoon.  Seeing something from that genre brought to the big screen with these production values is odd.  It is as if one of them won the lottery somehow.  I think perhaps James Cameron read a lot of those books too, and liked them even more than I did.<br /><br />The movie itself is beautiful.  Just like the stories it inherits from, there are a lot of valid quibbles with Avatar.  Set them aside.  Instead, revel in perhaps the most vibrant and coherent rendition of an alien world world ever, one infused with joy and beauty.  There are some dark moments in the movie to be sure, but overall the tone is one of wonderment.  The musical score is excellent and fits the visuals perfectly.  THIS is the movie I wanted so desperately when I was ten years old.<br /><br />As a die-hard science fiction fan, I would love to see some of the more introspective examples of the genre get this level of treatment.  But until that day comes, there really is no choice but to marvel at the quality of execution we see here.  They have brought to life the sort of world that before could only live inside your imagination.

0060555661|5.0|The Intelligent Investor is arguably the greatest book ever written on investing.  What is unfortunate for this book, however, is that Warren Buffett's ringing endorsement of it makes people think the whole book will teach you to invest like him.  This perception is inaccurate.  There is a two-pronged theme to \\"The Intelligent Investor\\":  investment advice for the novice (classified in the book as the \\"defensive investor\\") and investment advice for the full-time investor (classified as the \\"enterprising investor\\").    The book is hugely valuable for both types, and the advice for the defensive investor is almost a prototype for much of the financial planning advice one receives today.  In fact, it is more valuable, since the focus is on lowering volatility and getting income from dividends and interest-- through boom and bust, low inflation and high inflation-- while generally paying much less for advice, since his strategies suggest there should low turnover in your portfolio.      What most people read the book for, however, is for the information on becoming a better-than-average investor.  I have heard Buffett say that Chapters 8 and 20 are the best chapters written in investing history, and I believe he is right.  Chapter 8 is especially important, as it discusses in very broad outlines how to value a company and when the price may be right for a purchase.  These concepts are fleshed out in tremendous detail in Security Analysis, but Chapter 8 is the best place to start.      Lastly, the writing in this book can be very dry.  Hopefully, setting the context here may offset some of that.  If it is not good enough, though, I would strongly recommend picking up the reprint of the fist edition:  the writing is MUCH smoother in that edition.  Interestingly, the first edition is much smaller, which suggests the book suffered from overediting as the years went by.     Hope this helps. The book really does deserve all of the praise it gets.  You just need to know the context.
B001OQCV6A|3.0|If you read the books and seen prior movies of Sherlock Holmes you and Guy Ritchie (this ain't \\"Snatch\\") should thank Robert Downey for his excellent acting ability to carry this movie.    Downey succesfuly created a character that was not likable or even enjoyable but entertainable with a small \\"e\\". The plot was ok but the story line was terrible - not a lot of deductive reasoning about the movie story line -- this suspends your logic for you and leaves you with nothing.     Watson and Lestrade characters were good and somewhat accurate to the book, they're played differently but well, as they are in other movies.    BEWARE - This is a perfect example of a movie that take traits of the main character of a book and overplays them to their suiting and, perhaps, to others enjoyment. They can then maintain that he was still in the character of the book, and they're right, but its \\"their right\\".    I still like Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes and all his characters traits, particulary being a good guy for me. Buy or rent his digitly remastered movies and buy some popcorn while you're at it. Your will Enjoy most of them with a  capital \\"E\\".
B0021L8V1G|4.0|The Iron Man 2 sequel begins in Moscow.  It is snowing outside, while an old man, Anton Vanko, lay dying in his bed, his son Ivan sitting next to him.  Apparently Howard Stark (father of Tony Stark) and Anton had worked together many years ago developing plans, but Howard had Anton shipped off to Siberia where he lived the rest of his life in poverty, while Howard Stark became filthy rich. Needless to say, Ivan is a bit upset when daddy dies.  He grabs some plans and starts working feverishly on an Iron Man \\"heart\\".<br /><br />Back in New York, Tony Stark is telling the world he is Iron Man and celebrating with a big Expo celebration for single-handedly achieving world peace.  He is summoned to Washington DC to testify before some Senate Committee and asked to turn over the Iron Man suit to the government because it is a weapon.  Of course, his answer is no.<br /><br />Back in Stark's ocean-front Malibu home, we find out the paladium core so vital to Iron Man is also killing Tony slowly by increasing his blood toxicity levels.  Not telling Gwenyth Paltrow, he appoints her CEO of Stark Industries and his successor, if anything happens to him.<br /><br />In the famous Monaco street race is where bad-guy Ivan catches up with Tony.  He comes at him with a bad attitude and a bad invention he has cooked up in his little make-shift Moscow lab.<br /><br />There is a lot of action that follows with the good-guy/bad-guy thing while Tony is trying to find something to keep him from paladium meltdown.  The CGI is great and the Iron Man characters are bigger than life.<br /><br />I thought the first one was better, maybe because the concept was new or maybe because I waited for this one for awhile.  In any case, the movie was still excellent and well worth seeing.  It was hard to believe that Ivan was Mickey Rourke.  He just looked so totally different to me.

1400032717|5.0|\\"I find people confusing.\\"(p. 14) Most people don't, however, Christopher John Francis Boone, the main character in the curious incident of the dog in the night-time, finds them incomprehensible. This book is a novel about an autistic boy growing up and learning to deal with life. It is written as if the main character is writing it throughout the story. It an eccentric book that will hook you in and won't let you out until you're done. Overall, I feel that this is an excellent read.   Of course, that is not to say the book does not have bad points. This book has language and some complex issues involved, so it is not acceptable for children. The book also has a unique style, which the reader may like or dislike, it simply depends on who is reading it. The style comes from the perspective of having an autistic child write the book, making the book quite individual. The unique style means this also falls under the category of advantages, of which there are more. The book is informative and direct, there is never a dull chapter or a misplaced plot event. You cannot guess the end until you've read it, and it is quite a surprise. The style is certainly the book's strongest point, because is incomparable. The language is straightforward and specific, showing exactly what the point is. The passages go from a calm explanation of how to solve a puzzle, to the harsh arguments when Christopher does something wrong. The language is British English, appropriate for the setting. Early on, Christopher tells us that he does not like or understand metaphors, so aside from a few exceptions, they are absent. Other literary devices are scarce as well, except for similes; there are several similes that Christopher uses to help explain things. Another interesting thing is the format. Instead of using traditional chapters, the author numbers them as prime numbers because of the main character's enjoyment of math.   As I said before, overall this is an excellent book. I recommend you read it today.
B00360CY50|2.0|If you love amy for her uniquely powerful voice and daring tempos this second album might be a dissapointment. I will say the album is mediocre, i.e. it's enjoyable but not \\"stop what I'm doing to listen intently enjoyable.\\"     Biggest complaint is that her voice is not sharp. It is drowned out by the music. Damn, I'll just wait for the next album.

B001W6RRFM|5.0|[[ASIN:1608607933 Words Aren't Fair]]<br /><br />By Martha J. Biery, author of Words Aren't Fair.<br /><br />I teach children with dyslexia. And what they say to me when they're frustrated is: \\"words aren't fair\\". And I tell them that's because our language has such a checkered past. However, because of their frustration, I decided to write a funky story about how English was invented, hoping to win them over in their quest to become skilled readers. My book is a work of fiction but it is based, loosely, on facts. After I finished the book, one of my mentors, a person well versed in the history of English, loved the book but was a little disappointed that I hadn't honored the history of English in my original story. So, I searched out Bill Bryson's \\"The Mother Tongue\\" and after reading it, I found a new approach. I rewrote my book, integrating some of his observations. What a quirky, wonderful gift Mr. Bryson has given to me and to the children. I am forever grateful! Brilliant!

0385732554|5.0|[[ASIN:1608607933 Words Aren't Fair]]<br /><br />By Martha J. Biery<br /><br />As a teacher of reluctant readers, I am always looking for a book that will spark the interest of my students - and this book is it! One of the most valuable traits of this book, beyond the lessons inside, is that the author allows the reader to make his/he own images with minimal information. What a gift to students who live in a world that loves to give them masses amd masses of visual stimuli! The minute my students try to imagine this gray world full of rigid rules and strange customs, they are creating their own images. And that's what sucks them in! One student went from a passive reader to a jumping jack, full of thoughts and ideas to share. This is my NO.1 book for middle schoolers.
B000068TPN|5.0|Although I was initially hesitant to We Were Soldiers thanks to Randall Wallace and Mel Gibson at the helm, I was pleasantly surprised at We Were Soldiers, which is an honest to god thanks to the soldiers of Vietnam.  Mel Gibson and Randall Wallace butchered impressive ancient warfare with horrendous writing and directing, and I don't even want to think about the horrible abomination known as Pearl Harbor.  Luckily, Randal Wallace learned after all those misfires and created We Were Soldiers, which actually honors the soldiers of The Vietnam War, something no other war film has never really done.  The closest thing?  The Green Berets.  Ugh.  We Were Soldiers is graphic, yes, but as some of the other reviewers can attest, this is what it was really like.  This film succeeds because of this, as it does for Vietnam veterans what Saving Private Ryan did for WW2 Veterans.<br /><br />We Were Soldiers is much different than other war films such as Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket.  While the aforementioned movies do more for me personally, We Were Soldiers is much different from those other films as it gives an honest and straight up thanks to the soldiers of Vietnam.  It strips away most of the the political and tension that went on during the Vietnam War and focuses squarely on the soldiers and the home front.  No other war film before really did an open letter to the soldiers, and for that reason We Were Soldiers is much more superior to say, Platoon.  Even better, it doesn't make the opposing soldiers seem like inhumane monsters either, but it also takes something's viewpoint to determine that, and I'll leave it at that.<br /><br />The film also reduces Mel Gibson to merely just acting (both Braveheart and Passion of the Christ seem they were made by a sadist, and one was silly and the other was a glorified snuff film), something that seemed to help The Patriot as well (though that had another problematic Director, Roland Emmerich).  Although I initially was reluctant to watch this movie thanks to Mel Gibson (reasons above), he gives a stoic and reserved performance, very in contrast to his wildly silly Braveheart performance.  I also do think after watching some Mel Gibson movies that South Park's charicture of Mel Gibson is juvenile and childish beyond belief, even though I can't argue with South Park's spot on observation of The Passion of the Christ (hated it as a Christian, hate it as an Agnostic).<br /><br />We Were Soldiers is a dramatization of the Battle of la Drang, based on Hal Moore's account of the battle as written by him.  For the most part, that's pretty much it.  However, We Were Soldiers works because of that, as it gives a sense of what Vietnam war veterans went through.  Another well made part is the home front, which shows what the people at home go through as well.  While I'm not married, I can really sense what it's like when young couples are seperated, and even more what their wives would feel when they learn of the death of their own husbands.  I also liked the feeling of what it is like to tell a young child what war is about, it's no easy feat to explain that to a child.<br /><br />The battle scenes are extremely well made, and while they have a soundtrack, it adds to the carnage.  They are set in winding fields that add extreme confusion, with high doses of napalm and muzzle attacks.  They sound brutal and amazing, and Wallace's direction adds tension and a sense of instinct that other war films don't have.  This film, like other war films of recent memory, are very violent, with people being burned, people's heads being ripped up by machine guns, and skin sliding off of a soldiers who was doused with napalm.  I do have one problem, and that would be the final charge, as the cheesy voice over ruins that battle.  Luckily.  I really can't find fault in the battle scenes, which are first rate.  I certainly think they did an excellent job at making Vietnam warfare seem very real.<br /><br />I'll givethe last word to the Vietnam veterans who have spoken well about this film.  We Were Soldiers is quite underrated actually, and the critics who found it cheesy really need to have their tastes checked, in my opinion.  It may not quite stake out new grounds, but it's still an open letter to the Vietnam war and leaves out all of the crappy politics.  All that ____ really doesn't matter anyway, and no matter how it happened, people are killed either way.  Why the hell does it matter.  Ah, I'm ranting.  Just check We Were Soldiers out.  It likely won't soften up to the hardest cynics, but one who can understand the casualties of each side will surely enjoy it.  If anything, the battle scenes are great.

B00169N0BK|5.0|Now I am coming from a colour spyder and an epson 2200, now using the 3880 and the munki I will say this is a must have device ( or the sypder print ) if your serious into accurate prints.<br /><br />I did not have much trouble installing in windows 7 and I did make sure to disable any prior colour correction settings etc. my work flow was already tuned to accept this as well so since I was already using a colour managed work flow I understood what I was getting into. Using the default setting and calibration you will get a good but not fully accurate re profile, I did redo the profile using 100 cdm vs the default 120 ( 120 is too bright ) and now the monitor very accurately matches my prints. I even used the munki to recalibrate my sony tv for improving bluray viewing, worked very well there to ( when played back from a computer ) and I am also using it to preview / proof prints at their actual size before printing. The munki did a very good job also on some old paper stocks we had that had no existing profiles for the 3880, the prints match almost exactly what we would print on new epson paper and profiles, good job! I can't wait to try this out on art store papers, BUT!<br /><br />Why can we not print the 2nd sheet at any time? some papers need 24hrs and the munki software won't allow for the 2nd profile print to be made after closing the software. Xrite come on let us save a profile session and print that last sheet later. This is a major beef with the software that should be corrected. I could also use more advanced features in the software ( like type of lcd for tn, ips panels etc )<br /><br />Since I am using a newer version of the software I may not be experiencing some difficulty others may have had with activations etc. I have a mac in the studio I will try and profile as it is the main editing station for line art and web graphics, my experience may change then with the software on the mac.<br /><br />For the hardware I don't like the way I have to turn the dial to different modes, I always press the calibrate button when trying to turn it and the soft case could use the dial marks, would help me having to remove it to know where they are to switch modes. Minor gripe as I just needed to mark the soft case my self.<br /><br />I can say that for my needs in my work flow it does work and I will recommend it for serious use, I think this product may be over kill for causal users or users who would always would use same brand papers that have existing manufactures profiles and would not be proofing random paper samples.I always press the calibrate button when trying to turn it and the soft case could use the dial marks, would help me having to remove it to know where they are to switch modes.

I've always loved mythology so this book was a perfect match for me.  I also loved the Percy Jackson Series.  I liked that you got to hear the story from two different points of view.  In the beginning I thought Rick's new writing style was a little confusing but once I got used to it I thought it was great.  Thanks for reading my review.  Hope you enjoy the book like I did.

There is alot of book hours to fit into the movie Eclipse but I think it will work.  Breaking Dawn, I have no idea how they will fit all that action into one movie.
0385504225|1.0|This book is possibly the worst book I have ever read.  The plot is definitely much weaker than the previous two books.  The story often rambles on, repeating the same information about ancient mysteries multiple times over multiple pages.  The language is clunky and flows very poorly.  The climax was barely there and the final revelation was simply disappointing.  The last pages are comprised of yet more rambling that comes after the climax and could have been easily left out for a cleaner ending.  I will think twice before I pick up another Dan Brown book in the future.

B002T45VX6|5.0|Shakira's career really began when she was an 18-year-old pop-rocker with folk ifluences from her native Colombia. This Shakira wrote about love, society, and even politics in Pies Descalzos, the album that made her famous across Latin America and Spain. The next step in her career was Donde Estan Los Ladrones, another pop-rock album that was similar to Pies Descalzos but more vibrant and bold. Then came a major turning point: Laundry Service, Shakira's crossover album. She entered the American and worldwide markets with an album that was more influenced by mainstream pop. This was a new side to Shakira, complete with a new image as a hip-shaking Latina crooner. Many fans resented this new style, but if they had looked closer, they would've seen the same substance that was in her Spanish music; it was just hidden under catchier beats. This new style was maintained in two more albums, the Spanish Fijacion Oral Volume 1 and the English Oral Fixation Volume 2.     With She Wolf, Shakira's music has taken yet another new direction. The electro-influenced dance beats of her latest album got Shakira even more criticism from some lifelong fans, who implied that she had sold out her individual style to sell more records. However, I emplore these people to look a little deeper into the music of She Wolf. They'll find Shakira's same old writing style, unique voice, and Latin, Middle Eastern, and rock influences; these essential elements of Shakira's music are merely accompanied by pulsing, danceable beats. And, to be honest, She Wolf's track list contains some of Shakira's best songs ever.    Frankly, She Wolf is an excellent album. However, it seems like it hasn't sold as well as Shakira's previous albums. My theory is that this is due to bad timing on the part of her record company; the album was released months after its successful main single, which doesn't seem logical at all. Hopefully, the latest single, Gypsy (a fabulous song) will help sales pick up in America. Because She Wolf deserves to be at number 1 on the charts.    P.S. I can't wait for Shakira's 2010-2011 world tour!
B001AK3S4Y|4.0|Although I am a fan of a number of SciFi Action genres, for some reason I was expecting to be less enthusiastic about Hellboy then I ended up being.<br /><br />Although there are some VERY SciFi elements to the story - Hellboy's existence to begin with - there is a very strong undercurrent of people being valued for what they do, not how they are born which I think is an exceptional theme.  Plus you gotta love anyone who kicks Nazi butt!!!!<br /><br />I found the film settings rich and very dimensional.  The interesting little details helped add dimension. Such as the eggs Abe loves and the cats Hellboy loves.  The story is entertaining and takes you on a ride through all kinds of fantastic locations and the interpersonal relationships add depth.<br /><br />I enjoyed it enough to buy Hellboy 2, unseen as soon as it was available.

I simply plugged it in to my PS3 console I bought 2 years ago and it asked if I wanted to use the internet to play the movie. Clicked yes, it apparently updated itself and played it just fine.

B002T9H2MO|5.0|Initially, [[ASIN:B002T9H2MO Moon]] might seem like a remake of [[ASIN:B000UJ48SG 2001 - A Space Odyssey]] - it even has a HAL-like computer called Gerty - but it takes a different turn. In fact, after the first half-hour, [[ASIN:B002T9H2MO Moon]] is more about lunar technician Sam Bell's mysterious origins than space exploration. The plot is surprisingly thick and takes some unexpected turns. I won't spoil it, but it's definitely pretty cool.     I love the ambience of the movie. The sterile, white setting really does seem like a realistic portrayal of man's future in space. The eerie silence  (there's not much soundtrack) adds to the effect. Soon into the movie, you'll feel like you'r right there on the moon base.    Overall, highly recommended. This didn't seem to get much attention in theaters, but it's definitely one of the better and more original releases of 2009.

B0039SFKSW|4.0|This is a really good CD. The best thing the original 4 have done since the first album. Lots of well written songs and top quality production. The playing is for the most part tasteful and restrained but there are a few nice guitar, keyboard, and drum flourishes from Howe, Downes and Palmer respectively. Let me highlight some tracks...    1. \\"I Believe\\" Really good tune. Nice chorus, great vocals. I personally like to start the album off with this one instead of \\"Finger on the Trigger\\" (which I skip all together, the only song I don't care for on the album, I like everything else).    2. \\"Listen Children\\" Well constructed, another good chorus.    3. \\"Light the Way\\" Wow, this one's really cool. Very good Howe/Wetton composition, it really rocks. Great chord progressions/melody.    4. \\"I'm Still the Same\\" An interesting departure for Asia. A little like Asia does the Beatles. Who'd have thought?    5. \\"End of the World\\" Another mature, well constructed, melodic piece. Great singing from Wetton.    Definitely worth purchasing a copy. Well done Wetton, Downes, Howe and Palmer.

B0021L8V1G|5.0|I'm not a big fan of movies, but this is one of my favorites.  To be honest, I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was as sequels are rarely as good as the first, but I think this movie was better than the first Iron Man.  Totally worth going to.
B00000JMG7|5.0|Let me be the 25th person to tell the world this is a GREAT collection of music(25 is my favorite number).  I've been a big fan of Rory since back when I bought the 1st Taste record.  I was just the tiniest bit unsure about this since some of the BBC sets sound a little stiff to me.  I shouldn't have worried; to me this is the best BBC release ever, and I've heard a lot of them(Cream, Kinks, Yardbirds, Who and more).  Rory is on fire from start to finish. If I had to choose I guess the live disc is my favorite with \\"Got My Mojo Working\\" and Garbage Man\\" on it.     And all this music is yours for $7.98(or less)!
B0034G4OYU|5.0|There is no way you can see this absolutely stunning IMAX 3D show and not ask yourself, \\"And, why are we basically suspending our space program?\\"<br /><br />Just a terrific show and the film brings home the fact that every penny spent on our space program, and Hubble, has proved to be the best bargain ever purchased in the history of our planet .. ..<br /><br />There is absolutely no way we could see back to the beginning of creation without the Hubble & NASA .. ..<br /><br />It will make you tear up seeing what we can accomplish and what we can do .. ..<br /><br />More fulfilling is seeing all the young kids in the audience and watching their jaws drop when they see pictures of the universe from Hubble and all the star nurseries that have been discovered .. ..<br /><br />Our space program (NASA) proves to all of us that anything is possible and that they have made 'the impossible into inevitable' .. ..<br /><br />SAVE NASA!!

B003405MF6|5.0|This album is a departure/new direction for Jeff Beck, with a string orchestra on most of the tracks.  Several are really beautiful to hear.  His cover of 'Over The Rainbow' is a revelation and is absolutely gorgeous! I have nearly all of Jeff's albums, and this is one of my favorites!
B001UN1KVE|5.0|This movie looks great in HD. I know comedies don't need to be in HD because they aren't the epics that most people look for, but this movie looks great in HD.

B0009QTS0I|5.0|This review refers to the Classic Records Vinyl edition. I've compared, on audiophile equipment, this version with the \\"From the Capitol Vaults\\" reissue, and Classic's sounds incredible! Heavy, clear sound.  Ok, Capitol's limited edition on red vinyl is so charming, but if you are looking for the best sounding album go for the Classic Records edition, highly recommended!!!

B001HN69AY|5.0|What can you say? It's Heath Ledger's last work before his death. That should be worth the price of admission alone. If not stay to watch a beautiful movie. The movie is a wild ride of Dr Parnassusian psychedelic bliss! Enjoy!
B002ZG9788|5.0|I hated the original, so if you didn't like the original then you will like this one.
0061537969|5.0|Read this book, now!   Do not wait for the movie because they will ruin a beautiful story with a bad screenplay and lousy directing.  I have not felt so passionate about a book in a long while.  This story was perfection.  Not deep and \\"prose\\"-filled.  Nothing quirky or difficult.  Just a damn good story with a barrel of laughs, a bucket of tears, and characters of compassion and strength that will stay with you - - - for a very long time.  Also an ending I loved.  So often I read great books with ridiculous and lousy endings - - this one does not let you down.  I can't wait to try another book by this author.
B002PHVAQY|5.0|The plug is bigger than I thought it would be - it is about 3.25&#34; x 1.5&#34; x .75&#34;. Still it is a convenient enough size. The batteries last longer than I thought they would. They last a long time. The sound is good.   I use the Honeytone amplifier [[ASIN:B000B6DHB2 Danelectro N10 HoneyTone Amplifier (Beatnik Burgandy)]] as a headphone amplifier most of the time because I would rather use a DC adapter than batteries, but this plug is a convenient thing when you don't want to be hindered by a cord and  just want to play wherever you want.  If I ever lost it, I would definitely buy another.
B003JYOEYM|2.0|Very disappointed .The movie seems a lil disjointed at times.Day of the Dead was much better and more interesting.Sorry George.
B001AQO46E|5.0|This movie is in dire need of the Blu-Ray treatment.  Such a shame that the DVD is not even an Anamorphic transfer (The Abyss is the other non-anamorphic transfer that needs to be re-issued and done right).  Unfortunately, James Cameron has neglected this movie ever since September 11th since True Lies deals with terrorism on US soil.  That is why he scrapped the sequel.  So who knows if we will ever see True Lies on BD.  I would be perfectly happy with an anamorphic transfer!  Thankfully my Samsung DLP does a perfect zoom to compensate for non-anamorphic transfers.  But the real deal would still be superior.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|been a long time since mtv did something right and releasing daria on dvd almost makes up for some of the mindless garbage it has on air now.  daria was one of those rare witty smart shows that just seems to have gained more followers in the years since it was off the air.  back when most teens actually had a mind of their own and used it, daria gave a voice for all those \\"brains\\" out there, proving that smart is not a four letter word, (that would be smar) get the dvd's, show it to this new generation who haven't been as blessed as we have, there still are fashion clubs that try to control everything and new daria's need to be shown just how to do battle in that special brainy way.  hopefully mtv will release more shows, \\"downtown\\" was daria only more urban and older
B001KNUUTM|5.0|I gave this as a gift and the recipient has been extremely happy with it, she loves this pianist. He plays very clearly and expressively (she tells me), and this recording is excellent. And I am happy it arrived (to me) very quickly, even with Super Saver shipping.
B002VKE1K2|4.0|All the best scary scenes are at night when they are sleeping. You stare and try not to blink becuase you don't want to miss anything. Your eyes go left and right trying to focus on the whole room and hallway. It's creepy and you wonder what's going to happen. A few of the nights were very creepy and make you jump. The rest of the film is good too. I like the two main people and everything that goes on between them. What they do and their actions and responses, it's realistic enough. I watched this with my friend the first time and he spent the rest of the night trying to scare me from standing over the bed to getting a knive in the kitchen. Great and fun film.
1423113381|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the Percy Jackson series and was excited to pick up this new book by Riordan.  I can definitely say I was not disappointed!  The book is told from the points of view of Carter and Sadie Kane in alternating sequence.  The chapters are not redundant in anyway.  The main plot of the book deals with the release of 5 Egyptian gods and the aftermath that follows.  I don't want to give too much away, but I will say it was so good I finished it in one day!
0307593525|5.0|I'm not much of a cook.  I admit it.  So why would I want this 2 volume set of french cookbooks by THE Julia?  Because this is not just a french cookbook; this is an instructional cookbook that gives lessons and tips that translate into any type or ethnicity of cooking.  For instance...what shape of roaster do you buy?  Best type of stovetop and oven?  How do you fry an egg in butter without the butter smoking?  What's the best type of stovetop saucepan?  Julia doesn't just give you the recipe for a dish; she tells you every minute detail in making that dish tasty and successful.  Tips that the non-cook would not know (I would think that good cooks know these things already, but I'm not sure, since I'm not a good cook).  I'm not going to make most of the dishes in her books.  But I'll make some of them, and I will use her tips and techniques for many other meals to come, regardless of the type of dish it is.  It is a plus that the book is also well written, easy to read, and interesting.  I just regret not having gotten these books years ago.  These books would make excellent gifts for young people in their twenties, newlyweds, or anyone learning to cook.  They also make great gifts for middle aged women like myself, who would like to (finally) learn a thing or two about cooking!
B003BVK36Q|2.0|This was a disappointing read.  I found the style rather \\"talky\\" and, despite all the \\"high drama,\\" that the novel eventually ended with not much to say. I liked the early LeCarre, but dropped off some years ago as his vision was too cold and gray for me. I returned to this one only to find the vision colder and grayer.

B001QOOCTE|5.0|The concept itself of gathering many musicians all over the world itself it nothing short of amazing, and to be able to blend them together into songs, is even more amazing! And all the tracks actually sounded very good!    This is one of the must have CD+DVD and you won't regret buying it! In fact, i bought two! One as backup... :)
044654146X|5.0|This book really transcends just the history of a nation's success, as it really provides a blueprint for success for any organization.  The overall non-bureaucratic environment in many of Israel's start-up technology companies should be studied and implemented by most United States companies.  A very worthwhile, informative and easy read.  Highly recommended.
B0034JKZ3G|5.0|Disney has not lost it's touch! This movie was very well done. Everyone in the house enjoyed it from my 2 year old to my husband. The music is exactly what you'd expect from Randy Newman - very catchy and everyone ends up singing along.    We've watched it at least 20 times, thanks to my daughter...  Well worth it!
B003629IPW|5.0|I had the single disc version, but when I learned about the additional content - unfinished rehearsals (Dirty Diana) which aren't in the movie; and special features of the band, dancers, and vocalists, I bought this and feel well rewarded.
1591843162|3.0|It seems whatever Godin is selling I'm buying.  Gotta give him credit for that.  My advice for Linchpin is to make it through the first half of the book - as the second half is really where the action is. Stick it out.  Godin might have something to sell, but that does not mean he is wrong.  His basic point that, that the economy has ripped away any security of careers or institutions, and that we need to change our outlook towards work, is probably exactly right.  The question is what do we do with this knowledge.   I like Godin allright, some folks may hate him, I think he is worth reading to generate a great discussion.    Grade:  B
0439023483|5.0|There's really not more to add that hasn't been said already.     I am hard to please where it comes to books. I have a huge list of books of which I have only read a chapter, a page, or even a paragraph. This story sucked me in from the first words and never let me go. Sure, it has its problems (if everyone is starving and can't afford food, how do they each have a television?), but I found this story so engaging, I couldn't do anything productive in my life until every last word was read.    As far as its designation as a book for young adults, I balk at that. The images Collins portrays of children dying bloodily at the hands of other children are chilling and nightmare inducing. I am appalled that some school districts have chosen this book as their summer reader. But, for a mature teenager or an adult, you cannot go wrong with the Hunger Games series.

1594488878|4.0|Nick Hornby is one of my favorites.  The prince of lad lit.  Juliet find Hornby back in top form - and surprisingly writing in the voice of a young woman (at least for half the book).  As an obsessive blogger I enjoyed having my tribe skewed, and as a guy I can't argue with any of Hornby's observations about the shortcomings of our gender.  Bad long-term relationships, reclusive rock-stars, complicated families, museum politics and small English coastal cities - Hornby keeps it all light, balanced and delightful.  Grade:  B+

0393072231|5.0|Years ago Lewis wrote a wonderful first book describing the excesses and increasing amorality that ultimately took down Salomon Brothers.    After the investment banking world nearly caused a new great depression, he has returned to the world of the big banks and written the best book I have read on how the great mortgage bubble of the 21st Century was created, and ultimately burst, who knew what, how they found it out, and when they knew it.    It is seriously well researched, everyone who was a key player seems to have talked to him in depth, it is based on a hard understanding of how Wall Street worked and still works, and it is truly well written.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|We rented this on Net-Filx, and I can recommend it alone, for thoroughly continuous humor. The fun just doesn't quit, and doesn't disappoint. It's like the Marx Brothers, or Rodney Dangerfield at his best....that is a \\"Rodney Dangerfield\\" playing every male part! Death and Love are two subjects of both the greatest human seriousness, and greatest human folly. This film is the antidote to the up-tight and lugubrious religious, and funeral industry's, professional superficiality....and in the social context, of expected conventional funeral behavior. In its way, it loosens up the mind to consider the real meaning of a death and remembrance, the true meaning of mourning...and the deeper meaning of human life. I'm overstating just a little, but this film does carry a very clever screen play, and excellent character acting. I can assuredly recommend it to lovers of good comedy. I think this film is in there with \\"Sideways\\", as one of the most extravagantly delightful films of the new century.
B0009MDPYM|3.0|The Feb/2005 released movie Constantine,based on the Hellblazer comic series,comes to DVD in a widescreen edition that is interesting in its premise but falters in its' delivery.<br />The story involves one John Constantine(Keanu Reeves)who has always had the ability to see things people weren't \\"meant to see\\".He has done alot of bad things in his life and he has tried to atone for them by working against evil so when he goes his path will lead up and not down.One day he is approached by a police woman named Angela Dodson(Rachel Weisz)to help her regarding her twin sister's untimely death;a plunge off of a roof.At first John balks but relents,soon realizing there is more to the death than meets the eye.John journeys to the other side and back and even assists Angela in doing the same,but they realize too late that her sisters death was basically a ruse to get at Angela.<br />John learns that the archangel Gabriel is actually working with the son of the devil to unleash his progeny onto the world.In order to do this Angela becomes the host for the child and the angel will use the \\"spear of destiny\\"(the actual tip of the lance that was used to kill Jesus on the cross)to open her womb and release evil to rule man.Gabriel reckons that only those that survive the time to come will be worthy of God's real salvation.In the meantime John has summoned the Devil himself in a last ditch attempt to foil the Devil's son and the archangel's plans.The Devil indeed stops the birth and renders the angel wingless and earth bound.He returns to John who asks that Angela's sister be let free from Hell in his stead.This is a sacrifice and the Devil has been tricked but in one last effort to keep John from going heavenward,he removes the lung cancer that is killing him and keeps him earth bound to live out his life;hoping one day he will slip up and be his forever.<br />The movie has ALOT of promise throughout with an interesting plot of good versus evil playing out between a man desperate to be redeemed and the evil that would take over the world.The special effects are well done especially in the fight scenes and those involving the glimpses of Hell.However the side plots of Angela and her sister,his side kick Chas Kramer(Shia LaBeouf),his priest friend Father Hennessy(Pruitt Vince)and other characters are just dealt with so heavy handedly,that the plot's narrative flow suffers considerably everytime we go from the action scenes and back to the plot/character advancement.It's a stop/start of a roller coaster ride that detracts from the overall enjoyment of the film.The only three characters I found engaging at all and enhanced the film to any degree,besides Reeve's Constantine,were John's friend Scavenger(Jesse Ramirez),Gabriel(Tilda Swinton) and a beautifully played evil Satan by Peter Stormare.The others were just nondescript window dressing.<br />Technically this film has been transferred well and is presented in its wide screen format.Extras include 18 minutes of so called \\"additional scenes\\" which are nothing other than expanded or alternate scenes;with or without commentary.There is also the theatrical trailer.This DVD is actually Disc One of the original two disc release version,just so you know.<br />In conclusion I found Constantine one with a unique and different take on the whole Angels versus Demons,good versus evil chestnut,but overall the plot is a roller coaster of stops and starts which detract from its flow and overall enjoyment;despite the good S/FX.It could/should have been better.I recommend it as a little above average.emed and the evil that would take over the world.The special effects are well done especially in the fight scenes and those involving the glimpses of Hell.However the side plots of Angela and her sister,his side kick Chas Kramer(Shia LaBeouf),his priest friend Father Hennessy(Pruitt Vince)and other characters are just dealt with so heavy handedly,that the plot's narrative flow suffers considerably everytime we go from the action scenes and back to the plot/character advancement.It's a stop/start of a roller coaster ride that detracts from the overall enjoyment of the film.The only three characters I found engaging at all and enhanced the film to any degree,besides Reeve's Constantine,were John's friend Scavenger(Jesse Ramirez),Gabriel(Tilda Swinton) and a beautifully played evil Satan by Peter Stormare.The others were just nondescript window dressing.

0767803434|4.0|Director Wolfgang Petersen had previously focused on the life of the President in his film, In the Line of Fire (1993), and he returns to that subject in Air Force One (1997), a big budget, over the edge thriller, that had the cooperation of the US Government, and the personal support of President Bill Clinton.  Although Kevin Costner was originally in mind to play the President, it would be hard to imagine anyone better suited to this role at the time, than Harrison Ford (Indiana Jones).<br /><br />President James Marshall (Ford) is returning from the Soviet Union, travelling with his staff and family on Air Force One, the President's custom modified 747.  While in flight, terrorists disguised as journalists, take over the plane, led by Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldham).  Secret service agents rush the President to the escape pod in the lower section of the plane.  The pod is launched, so the terrorists believe that the President has escaped, but he remains hidden aboard.<br /><br />Back in Washington, Vice President Kathryn Bennett (Glenn Close), is in charge of the negotiations with Korshunov, who is demanding the release of General Radek (Jurgen Prochnow), a criminal being held in a Soviet prison.  US fighters arrive to escort AF1.  As the Government works to recover the pod, Korshunov begins to execute hostages.  The President communicates with Washington via satellite phone, restating his policy of non-negotiation with terrorists.  This signals Marshall's transition from Commander In Chief, to chief buttkicker.<br /><br />Finishing as one of the top five grossing films of 1997, AF1 is a classic late 90's mainstream Hollywood blockbuster.  With a huge budget, big stars, special effects, and tons of studio backing, it is Grade A entertainment for the masses, where lovable action hero type, Harrison Ford, dons a superhero cape, and against impossible odds, Marshall saves the day.<br /><br />For the film's key element, the producers researched the real AF1, as much as they could, but much about the craft remained classified.  Within that pseudo-realistic framework however, reality is seriously mangled, as Marshall travels with relative ease, and the hull is never breached by a bullet.  The terrorists are terribly inefficient, failing to take immediate control of the cockpit, and letting the President escape.  Oldman's Korshunov, is quite the patriot, when threatening women and a child, but isn't much as commander of men.  The cast also includes William H. Macy (Sahara), Wendy Crewson, Xander Berkley, Paul Guilfoyle (CSI) Dean Stockwell (Quantum Leap), Liesel Mathews (A Little Princess), and Jurgen Prochnow (Das Boot).<br /><br />Wolfgang Petersen is a storyteller, that understands the effective use of action, and he provides an enthusiastic, and informative commentary.  He marvels at the amazing things that were done in the special effects department, which by today's standards, appear quite dated.  Air Force One is an overdramatic, pretentious, but fun fantasy, with a patriotic streak.  It is too bad that today's real problems can't be dealt with so simply.the craft remained classified.

1400052173|1.0|The focus of this book seemed off.  Too much information about Mrs. Lacks' descendants (whose claim to fame seems to be they were related to her), the author ( I don't care that she's white and agnostic and was born into middle-class suburbia) and not enough  information on Mrs. Lacks' life. For instance, the author matter-of-factly mentions that Henrietta had her first child at barely 14 glossing over the fact this makes her the child victim of incest/statutory rape by her cousin/future husband who appears to resent he didn't get paid for her cancer cells.      Ms. Skloot also comes off as condescending towards the Lacks family with her dialogue and purposeful misspellings to \\"imitate\\" African American Southern speech.  Was she purposely trying to make them seem ignorant??  Frankly,  it seems like the medical community isn't the only one trying to make a buck off of or get famous by using Mrs. Lacks.    I started skimming through the book mid-way through, but what I read didn't make me think the author had a good point that people should be paid for their cells, tissues, etc.  We live too much in a culture that believes everything should be a financial transaction.  Aren't umbilical cords used in research, too?  And I'm pretty sure the mothers/children aren't paid for them.   I'm not even sure I buy the argument that cancer cells are  a part of who we are any way, any more than umbilical cords are.  Cancer cells are invaders in our bodies.     If the author wanted to focus on Henrietta Lacks and her cancer cells, and whether people deserved to be paid for their cells, she should have done that.  I would have liked to read more about the arguments for and against. If she wanted to focus on Mrs. Lacks and her life then she should have done that instead of glossing over her.  There's not enough of either of these subjects in this book to make it as interesting as it could have been.  It's too bad, too, because I think Mrs. Lacks life would have made a wonderful storyin the right hands.

B002VECM4A|3.0|I read the book back in 1997 and remember not being very impressed. When I heard Oprah crowing about this movie before it came out, I was reminded of that long-forgotten book. I generally like Gabourney Sidibe when I have seen her in interviews and I was curious to see her in this film, since she had never acted in film before. In person, I think she is lovely and charming. In the film, she is downright ugly and hard to look at. I was also curious to see Mariah Carey so stripped down.<br />Precious is an interesting film and very well acted by everyone involved. That being said, in my opinion, its not the big awe-inspiring movie that everyone says it is. If you watch the interview with Sapphire, you see she is was a teacher who took bits and pieces of the lives of her students to make this film. And there might be the problem, the life Precious leads seems a little too over the top. Just how many hardships can one girl deal with? Obesity, poverty, incest, rape, disabled child, illiteracy, physical, mental and emotional abuse? There sure is a lot heaped on this one character. It's like a very strange, urban Cinderella story that she even manages to survive as well as she does. And maybe thats why I didn't find this as compelling as everyone else, I felt it was a little bit dishonest.
0307454541|1.0|The book was slow and at parts predictable. Perhaps I had such high expectations due to the glowing reviews everyone else seemed to have that there was no chance the book could live up to them. Or perhaps I started it because I wanted to read a thriller, but this was much more a mediocre drama with a bit of mystery thrown in.

I had my own journey seeking 'who am I' about 15 yrs ago, and I went to an Ashram over a 15 yr period about seven times. I now feel so peaceful with the spiritual life I lead.  Meditation is so important.    I have been to Italy, India and Ubud, Bali, and love all three.  I am a great non fiction reader.  The book was fantastic to read and loved Elizabeth's honesty.
B00005JMCW|5.0|This was a good choice for my 8 year old granddaughter. She has watched it several times.  I bought her the older version first but she prefers this modern version.
B000EF5NAS|5.0|I loved this film when I first saw it in the 1980's, saw it several times after.    I finally decided to buy it to watch again whenever I need a wonderful story which is sometimes sad, other times funny, always well-scripted and well-acted.    The actors are perfect in their roles.  The contrast between the modern \\"Deep South\\" and the pre-Civil Rights era is itself one of the characters.    We know things will work out OK in the end, but the getting there is what makes this film worth watching again and again.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|After listening to her sing on \\"Prarie Home Companion\\", I purchsed the CD.  I can hear the influence of the \\"Indie Girls\\" and like her ability to write narrative songs and her  ablity to sing in such a wide vocal range.
0143038419|5.0|I recommend LISTENING to the author read this book on the audio CD set, which I checked out of the library.  She has a wonderful, easy manner in telling her story, as though she were having a spontaneous conversation with you.  Her account is part humor, part pathos, like real life experiences, and sometimes I liked her, and sometimes I didn't, just like the people I know.  But it takes courage to bare one's soul the way she does, and risk being called self-indulgent.  YOU don't have to like this book and are free to put it down.  But for me, she became a friend whose \\"visits\\" I looked forward to.
B000GCFO0I|5.0|I loved this movie when I saw it in theaters and I had to have it on DVD. It is one of the few \\"video game gone movie\\" genre movies that I love. It is packed with creepy creatures, horrific noises, a twisted plot, and memorable characters that you may not want to remember when you're trying to go to sleep at night. If you enjoy a movie with great gory effects and a plot that unravels as you go, then pick this movie up today!
B0033TJATW|5.0|I already had this on vhs but wanted a dvd version. I love the music videos of michael. Speed Demon shows Michael genius. The quality was great. I would recommend Moonwalker to any Michael Jackson fan.
B002XZ62HK|5.0|This album is excellent from beginning to end.  Celtic Woman has once again put together a collection of songs that highlight the talents of the individual soloists, but also provides ample opportunity for the ladies to harmonize.  I would highly recommend this album to any Celtic Woman fan and to anyone else willing to give this album a listen.  I don't think you will be disapponted.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|Bought the DVD of Stranger Than Fiction a couple of years ago and somehow lost the disc.  An hour ago, I was hooking up an old DVD player to my living room TV. As I turned on the TV, the movie that was on the air via broadcast TV, happened to be the exact same movie as the DVD disc that was inside the DVD player!!! The film: \\"Stranger than Fiction\\".    Freaky, Weird, Coincidence!    I took this as a sign to watch the movie again...Which I am doing now...    A great film, a lot of fun, highly recommended!
0740748475|5.0|Calvin and Hobbes were two of my best friends growing up. I loved reading, and then, rereading the books of the series until I laughed myself silly. I would then grab after my parents' newspaper (especially on Sunday) and go for the comic section. I read them all to be fair, but the Calvin and Hobbes strips were by far the best.<br /><br />With that being said, this collection is true dream come to life. The collection might not be meant for constant perusing like the books I had when I was young that I wore out to death, but they are something that I never had before: a complete collection of the best comic strip ever created.<br /><br />Calvin is an open minded, adventurous boy who has a knack for getting into mischief. His overactive imagination created his best friend, Hobbes, who in real life is a stuffed tiger. Together they would conquer the great outdoors, cause trouble for Calvin's arch nemesis, Susie, and disobey and cause trouble for Calvin's parents on multiple occasions.<br /><br />This is a true treasure for any household, regardless of whether or not you've read a single strip of this series before or not. I highly hope you give this collection a try.<br /><br />Darien Summers, author of [[ASIN:1432746022 The Mischievous Hare]], a children's book.
0060107081|5.0|I bought a second hand hardcover copy.  It is perfect with that already read look. Forwarding was excellent. I live in Italy and the book came from Vancouver.  5 stars!
B000N4SHOE|5.0|This film has to be one of the finest of its genre. Hollywood, in all its glory, would be hard pressed to produce a better film in any category: The actors are superb, especially Renee Zellweger, direction was spot on, cinematography was flawless. In fact I'm going to buy more copies to give to everyone I care about!
B00000DS2K|3.0|In the world of music, there are several things I don't understand. At the top of the list lies Ozzy Osbourne and that business manager wife of his. Ozzy has shown more disrespect towards his back catalog of music than any other musician I can think of in order to save a few measly dollars. While this won't stop me from enjoying the tracks and albums I like, the stories behind re-recording parts of classic albums like Blizzard of Ozz are just ugly. Just as ugly is almost acting as if The Ultimate Sin and \\"Shot in the Dark\\" never existed in the first place.    Now don't get me wrong, The Ultimate Sin is far from a five star album. Like a lot of people, my main concern was obtaining a copy of Shot in the Dark on a CD since you can't find it on any other album. With that mission accomplished, I thought the story was over. Far from it. Needless to say I was surprised how the rest of the album managed to sneak up on me, from the Cold War inspired \\"Thank God for the Bomb\\" to welcoming beat of \\"Secret Loser\\" there is much more to be discovered here. In fact, \\"Secret Loser\\" pretty much sums up the situation this albums is in considering it was passed up for re-release and re-mastering in 2002.    One can only wonder why such a worthy pit stop would be deleted from Osbourne's catalog. Most people - myself included at one point - erroneously thought The Ultimate Sin was shelved because of a royalties dispute between Osborune and Phil Soussan. This doesn't seem to be the case since the last legal dispute between the two was settled back in the 1990's. So what's the deal? Hopefully, with Ozzy's back catalog being re-released again this album with get another look by the big wigs that ultimately make the decisions. Maybe they'll make the right choice this time and restore this discarded piece of history. Still, I'm not counting on it.    Anyway, as was said before, I can't give The Ultimate Sin a five out of five. The album is enjoyable and gives according to how much the listener is willing to put into it but it's still not a top of the line release. Such truths aside, the album definitely deserves much more credit than it seems to receive from its creator and can easily find a place in any music lover's collection.
B002VECM72|5.0|This is an EXCELLENT film and I will watch it again and again. There is such a feeling that just makes you feel \\"warm\\" inside and I don't care who you are, but if you are human, you will feel emotion if you are able and let yourself go. EXCELLENT FILM.... EXTREMELY WELL DONE BY ALL INVOLVED.....
0525421580|5.0|As soon as I got Will Grayson, Will Grayson in the post I had to start reading it straight away! So (as we were going on holiday) I read it in the car, 1h30. Then read it when we arrived for a further 1h30. Then later that night (after we got back from the day out) I read for 1h and finished the book. I struggled to put it down when my family told me we were going out! The book its self is amazing!  I wasn't waiting as long as I thought I would be for the book, I thought i'd be waiting 2 weeks. It arrived after 8 days, so I was really happy with the speed. No complaints here!
B0039OGGVQ|5.0|Slash has still got it! Every song is different but great. I had only heard of half the singers but they're great.RNFNR
B002VKE0XA|4.0|Have to say I enjoyed this film, possibly because I watched it after all the media hype over it so I didnt see it expecting it to be the best thing since sliced bread nor did I watch it hoping it to be awful so I could slate it amongst friends.<br /><br />The plot as everyone knows is a suburban couple, boyfriend and girlfriend.  Girlfriend complains about hearing strange noises in the house and boyfriend decides to set up a camera in the bedroom to document this suspected paranormal activity (Hence the name of the film) The film then shot mostly from the perspective of one or the other couple holding the camera documents the following 3 weeks and what happens.<br /><br />The big plus of this (Especially if you are in charge of the films budget) Is you have a very small cast.  The couple, a psychic, a friend who comes to visit and of course the ghost/demon. That is not to detract from the film in any way because the film is actually pretty good.  For a start the film goes right into the plot.  There is no sitting around waiting for something to happen you pretty much get an introduction from the Micha (The boyfriend) Of his intention to document what his happening to them then its on with the film.  Because its shot from the perspective of someone documenting their own lives its edited accordingly so the pot is very free flowing rather than going off in tangents like a normal feature film can often do.  There are no real special effects (To speak of) So to compensate for this the director has used silence to scare the audience.  You will be siting in front of the TV while the couple sleep waiting for something to happen, the silence playing on your mind, did you hear something?  Did you see something in the corner of the screen? Then BANG! It happens. In a way its similar to some Japanese horror movies in that its low on gore and more on psychological scares.  Things start to escalate in the house as the days pass until they reach a conclusion that you probably didnt expect.<br /><br />I did like the case in this film, Micha playing the rational boyfriend very well (Though it can get a bit tedious)  The only thing that was a bit silly was their constant need to keep the lights off and rather run around in pitch dark with only a camera light to guide them (Really if the idea was that some psychotic demon was possessing the house tying to harm them the last thing you would be doing is running about in the dark)  Aside from that I have to say I enjoyed this film.id like the case in this film, Micha playing the rational boyfriend very well (Though it can get a bit tedious)  The only thing that was a bit silly was their constant need to keep the lights off and rather run around in pitch dark with only a camera light to guide them (Really if the idea was that some psychotic demon was possessing the house tying to harm them the last thing you would be doing is running about in the dark)  Aside from that I have to say I enjoyed this film.
0743455967|5.0|I read my first Stephen King book! And, actually, after reading this, there are several of his novels that I want to pick up.    This is not a \\"How-To\\" manual, which I appreciate. The first part of the book are short memories, starting with his childhood, up through high school, college and young married life. This part suckered me in. He's obviously a talented writer, but there was something about the simplicity that caught me. Also, he's damn witty. And blunt. I laughed.    There's quite a bit of information on the craft of writing in this book, which, you can't really argue with...well, maybe you can, but I'm not going to. Though, a big chunk of this information, I read and enjoyed, however, since I write non-fiction, it didn't apply to me. However, some of my writing reads like fiction, so I will definitely use some of the instructions, especially regarding dialogue.    This book confirmed what I already know. I need to read, read and read some more. I've gotten away from that. And lock myself in a room when I am writing. I got a lot out of how to do your first draft, what to do with your second draft and then who to give the book to.    I'm going to stop writing now because writing a review on a book about writing is unnerving.
0545123267|5.0|Plot Summary:  At 17-years-old, Grace is mature beyond her years, no thanks to her negligent parents.  She has always been fascinated by the wolves who live in the forest behind her home, and one yellow-eyed wolf in particular has visited her regularly for 6 years.  Sam is a werewolf who lives as a human during the warm summer months, but every autumn the cool weather triggers his change into wolf form.  When a chance accident allows Sam to finally meet Grace, it's like two soul mates finding each other, but the days of summer are over, and Sam's days as a human are numbered too.    I must give Shiver top marks for delivering such a romantic story.  I read plenty of romance novels, but they're often surprisingly short on the romance, and Shiver is a story that runneth over with sweet, savory moments.  I loved it.  This is the first paranormal young adult romance with a contemporary high school setting that has seduced me so completely.  Normally I get a little twitchy with these types of stories (high school scarred me for life), but Maggie Stiefvater didn't overdo it.  She had laser-like focus on Sam and Grace, and their relationship overshadows everything else, which makes this story approachable for adult fans too.    I'll admit right now that Sam, the hero, is just too good to be true, but I am not complaining.  If there was ever a guy who should be a role model for teens everywhere, it's him.  We ladies wouldn't complain if there were a few more smart, funny, sensitive men who aren't afraid to make romantic gestures, and put forth some real effort when it comes to courting.  Sam is a modern guy with old-fashioned instincts, and the combination is devastating.      In the Publisher's Weekly review for Shiver it said that this is Romeo & Juliet with werewolves.  That's an apt description, but I'm happy to say that it doesn't end the same way.  I also need to add that Ms. Stiefvater adds a new chapter to werewolf mythology that is well-thought out and plausible.Even readers who normally scoff at paranormal plots would sink into this story without any hang-ups.  The quality and attention to detail raise Shiver up from being very good to truly excellent.      The second book in the Wolves of Mercy Falls series, [[ASIN:0545123283 Linger]], will be released on July 20, 2010.
B0039SFKSW|5.0|Asia's latest album Omega is somewhere between a four and five rating, but I choose five stars, to counterbalance the ridiculous low ratings. This album is chuck full of catchy melodic material with musicianship that fits the bill perfectly with John Wetton's lead vocals and those rich Asia harmonies. Some reviewers are comparing this album to Alpha, but for me, it's a cross between Alpha and Astra 'cause it's a bit heavier. If you enjoyed Asia's first three albums and the reunion album Phoenix, you will LOVE Omega.
B000VI6T6U|5.0|The man w/ the guitar shows the world, why he got his nickname (the man with is guitar). This is one concert many should have had the chance to see for free, to know there would and never will be another like Jimi.
0143038419|2.0|Was not too impressed. The first section on Italy was great. By the time she got to India, I was so completely over her whining, which carried into Indonesia, and became quickly annoyed. All of a sudden, she was \\"over it\\" and the end was  \\"I'm re-married now, read about it in my next book.\\" Uh....
B002VPE1B6|3.0|The movie is too long for the story. The story is just another Cowboys vs Indians movie (aka a copy of Dances With Wolves). The animation is good looking but it doesn't look real. It looks like a fancy cartoon. District 9, Battlestar Galactica, and Terminator Salvation look much much better as far as the visual goes.    Avatar is a big budget movie; but nothing special as a movie.  3 stars from me.
B002T9H2L0|1.0|Im not trying to bash the seller of this disk set im sure its perfect.  The movie on the other hand....  was a absolute disaster i cannot believe the ratings exceeded 1/5  the ENTIRE movie was pure GORE and more gore the directors attempts of humor i didnt even notice i was so horrified at the gore in this movie.  i mind as well get front row seats to a woodchipper and watch babies get thrown in there for nearly 2 hours. the movie only had one part where i so much as grinned when brad pit was speaking Italian and had to repeat his name over and over again.  other than that this movie was just another bloodbath flick that should have gotten ripped off the sets.  i guess you may like it if you enjoy tearing small animals apart while they scream or some intense woodchipper action theres no reason to even give this movie a chance.
B002VPE1AW|1.0|I was frankly, disappointed in this movie. It was alright ...the acting was fine...the special effects were good...not great but I really resented the story. It was basically a re-telling of the American Indian's story and again the \\"white man\\" is made to be the villain.  In the movie the US soldiers (all white) are the villains and the poor blue people are the victims until they fight back. This isn't a true account of the real history (the Indians killed whole families so they could steal their mirrors and drinking glasses) All Indians were not good and victimized and all European settlers were not all violent, bad people... This is a movie that  re-writes history, again, with the PC bend.    It was an outrage for Black American children to view their race as stupid and ignorant in movies and was one of the main complaints in the 60's. It hurt their self-esteem. It was corrected...No entire race should be viewed that way...but NOW it's acceptable for European American children (White)ato see their race depicted as bad, evil and violent and all other races are kind, gentle and humble...this is NOT accurate and it is a repeat of the same racism that has always been sold in the USA...just different players. We haven't learned anything from the freedom marches in the 60's and the way the Black Americans were treated...we've just changed the players...and racism continues...RACISTS COME IN ALL COLORS!!!
B000UOOT1W|4.0|This would be a three star compilation if not for the Tina Turner version of \\"Play The Game,\\" which blows the Michelle Branch version out of the water. It also shows up why this \\"Ultimate Santana\\" is overall a weak collection. Santana has made some of the most incredible fusion of styles out of the many 60's and 70's guitar gods, but by the 80's and 90's, he was churning out mediocre albums on a regular basis. You'll note that - over than the three big early hits \\"Black Magic Woman,\\" \\"Oye Como Va\\" and \\"Evil Ways,\\" his Columbia albums are absent from this set.<br /><br />That is because Clive Davis took a chance on signing Carlos to Arista, then shepherded Santana into a studio with a clutch of guests to record \\"Supernatural.\\" Carlos rose to the challenge, hooking up with talent that was worthy of his skills (Eric Clapton) and some that made him sound modern to the times (the inescapable \\"Smooth,\\" with Rob Thomas). It was a flawless album that deservedly brought Santana back to commercial prominence and won a slew of Grammys (ala Bonnie Raitt's \\"Nick Of Time\\").<br /><br />Unfortunately, that made everyone try to re-bake the cake for \\"Shaman,\\" a much lesser effort that essentially turned Santana into a guest on his own album. Ditto for \\"All That I Am.\\" Frankly, Chad Kroger of Nickelback doesn't merit the honor of carrying Carlos' guitar cases, yet here he is, singing \\"Into The Night.\\" And while Santana's music may have inspired hip-hoppers and rappers, that doesn't mean they share his virtuosity. So Baby Bash or The Product G&B tracks? Phooey. Listen to the actual soul that Tina Turner invests in her song, and then listen to Jennifer Lopez. Like Santana, Tina has the goods. many of the rest of these \\"Ultimate\\" guests? Not so much.
B001UV4XWY|2.0|A married couple Norma (Cameron Diaz) and Arthur (James Marsden) receives a wooden box with a big red button from a stranger, a man named Arlington Steward (Frank Langella). Arlington says that if they press the button, they can get one million dollars, but someone they don't know will die. Well, it is a typical story you might have seen in one of old sci-fi TV shows. Actually, Richard Matheson's short story (\\"Button, Button\\") has been adapted for a \\"The Twilight Zone\\" episode in 1986, directed by Peter Medak.    The new adaptation by Richard Kelly (of the \\"Donnie Darko\\" fame) opens with an intriguing premise, but like many Richard Matheson adaptations (such as recent \\"I Am Legend\\" starring Will Smith), the 115-minute film suffers from overlength. Not only that; the filmmakers couldn't resist the temptation of cramming half-baked ideas into a lumbering story: nosebleeds, NASA, Arthur C Clarke, Jean Paul Sartre, and so on. Quite honestly, I don't know what the film is all about.    While we are hoping that under the absurd and unconvincing appearance we can find deeper meanings, the film's muddled story with many unsolved sub-plots finally reaches its melodramatic conclusion, for which all these impossible characters and unlikely events are created. The pretentious ending reminds me of a phrase \\"mystery for mystery's sake,\\" which \\"The Box\\" exactly is.
0312330537|4.0|Overall I really enjoyed this book. The story is epic with diverse rich set of characters. This is an amazing view of Bombay from arrival and getting to know the people through to building his deep understanding of the Indian people and customs. What I didn't like was the fact that the lines between fact and fiction are blurred in this book with the author not willing to divulge how much of the story is true.
B000FIMG68|5.0|I think Lost is a very interesting series. I liked the 1st season better but I'm  glad I got the 2nd season.

B003CR9BYE|5.0|Frank Sinatra approached his mid-sixties to early seventies recording sessions as a kind of opportunity to reinvent himself. Perhaps he had tired of singing the catalogue of \\"standards\\" that he had been doing since his earliest days with Harry James and Tommy Dorsey. He mastered this material to the point where he could boast having recorded the definative versions of \\"Lady Is A Tramp\\", \\"I've Got You Under My Skin\\", \\"Night And Day\\", \\"I Get A Kick Out Of You\\", \\"Witchcraft\\", \\"I've Got The World On A String\\" and dozens and dozens more. So what new frontier could he conquer? He tried his hand at contemporary songwriters like Rod McKuen, Michele LeGrand, Paul Anka, even Lennon/McCartney and George Harrison. The results were spotty at best. He attempted a country & western \\"theme\\" album, called \\"Watertown\\" that was nothing short of disastorous. And he recorded pop material by Lee Hazelwood with daughter Nancy that would even make Barry Manilow blush. More embarrassing still was the Sonny Bono song \\"My Baby Shot Me Down\\". Yes \\"Dooby Dooby Doo\\" didn't quite have the same Sinatra charm as \\"Ring a Ding Ding\\". So where could he find new material that suited his more mature, relaxed style?    How about Bosa Nova? The world was exploding with this new South American sound since \\"The Girl From Ipanema\\" first hit the airwaves. Stan Getz was one of the first to test the water with instrumental versions of Antonio Carlos Jobim's best compositions. He and jazz guitarist Charlie Byrd perhaps did more to bring this new music to the forefront than any other recording artist. But Sinatra wanted to do something different. His idea was do create a synthesis of his own jazz inflected vocals with more authentic accompaniment. So why not record his Bosa Nova album with the principle architect, Antonio Carlos Jobim. Why not? Afterall, Frank really was indeed the Chairman of the Board, so who could say no to the boss. The overall results of this pairing was nothing less than phenomenal. Sinatrainstantly owned Jobim's compostions, \\"Girl From Ipanema\\", \\"Dindi\\", \\"Corcovado\\", \\"How Insensitive\\" and \\"Once I Loved\\" in the same way he owned songs by Johnny Mercer, Cole Porter, Rogers & Hart, Jimmy Van Heusen & Sammy Cahn  and other great tin pan alley composers. Sinatra's pharsing has always been impeccable and his diction near perfect. These recordings demonstrate how his peerless ability to deliver a lyric with such ease, is beyond comparison. Jobim proves the perfect accompanist, as he provides a soft, sensative and very understated platte. With neither artist overshadowing the other, they truly compliment each other with the utmost style and elegance. And longtime collaborator Claus Ogerman provided the beautiful arrangements for strings and woodwinds that added to the warm, dreamy tropical atmosphere. Yes, these sessions could not be more diverse in every way from the big brassy numbers like \\"Chicago, My Kind Of Town\\", \\"That's Life\\" and \\"My Way\\", that dominated Sinatra's mid sixties through early seventies repertoire.        This wonderful album along with selections from its companion piece \\"Sinatra & Company\\" have been long out of print. So kudos to Concord Records to have the good sense to combine both along with the marketing savvey to release it this Spring. What great music to enjoy from May through September and beyond. Sinatra and Jobim go together like....Well, like moonlight and music!
B002CLBJPK|4.0|I've loved this movie since I was a kid. It doesn't exactly hold up completely today, but it is still a really fun movie to watch when you need to cheer yourself up on a rainy day. It's just pure fun. It doesn't make a lot of sense, but it's a Disney movie....it doesn't have to. The only thing preventing me from giving this 5 stars is that it doesn't have a commentary, which we've all come to expect from dvds. I'd recommend that you get this for your kids or the kid in you.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is definitely one of my favorite fitness DVDs & a really great value.     There are three different workouts, separated by intensity - but I find all three to be challenging enough to rotate through. Usually most DVDs that have different levels, the beginner (Level 1) is too easy - but even Level 1 on here is great & perfect for the days when you have a bit less energy than usual. Plus, you can even pump up Level 1 by adding weights to the cardio moves & increasing your weights for the strength moves.     I know some people find Jillian a bit too pushy/intense - and she does talk a bit too much at times - but I find it all mostly just motivating to keep pushing on!    It is awesome to be able to get such a complete workout in only 30 minutes - this DVD keeps me going day after day & is easy to squeeze in even when you're busy! I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to get in shape & stay in shape!
B002N5N5M0|5.0|Lithgows character in this is probably the creepiest character I've ever seen or read.  Deeply disturbing, and brilliantly protrayed by Lithgow (of course).  Dexter is my guilty pleasure.  Brilliant acting, the writing is flawless if sometimes very disturbing, inspired characterization, humor mixed with the macabre, what more could you want on a cold winters night.  I watched the previous seasons over and over again, but I was unable to watch this one twice.  Like I said, Lithgows character was the most frightening character I've ever seen or read. This is the thing nightmares are made of.  If you missed the season, go for it.  If you weren't as horrified as I was, go for it.

B0030Y11XS|4.0|I will be the first to admit that I do not like a lot of Michael Moore's politics and disagree with him on a number of things.  Having said that, I would strongly recommend that people watch Capitalism: A Love Story.  This film is ideally suited for times such as these. For once, Moore abandons the smug self-righteous persona that makes it so hard to enjoy or be informed by his other films. For the first time since Roger and Me he seems genuinely concerned for the lives of those around him.     His most telling argument is when he shows major banks foreclosing on small families and offering the argument that in America, we have capitalism and that is the best system ever. However when these very same banks find that they are over extended, they turn to the government to bail them out and give them the very same type of help the refuse to give to anyone else.  Again, while you don't have to like his politics, I do believe this is a movie well worth your time!
B002GOAH1U|5.0|It arrived on time and in great condition..the movie is fabulous..I buy again from this vender..
B00005O3VD|5.0|Based somewhat loosely on the life of Fanny Brice, a Jewish comedienne and actress from the Lower East Side of Manhattan (actually Henry Street), this movie is a reflection of her life with Oscar Barbra Streisand in the title role. Streisand is perfect in this performance as the self-conscious Fanny Brice who makes fun of her own appearance as we see in her debut with the Ziegfield Follies.     The film is a perfect standard of the traditional musicals in film history. The art direction is perfect as a time period piece during Fanny's life from Keeney's Music Hall to Ziefield's. The Ziegfield Follies musical numbers are spectacularly done on film and what translated from stage to film is beautifully done here.     The casting is first rate with Streisand who played the role on Broadway as Fanny Brice. Omar Shariff plays the husband, Nick Arnstein, does a first rate job in the role. It's not easy when you're up against Streisand in her early part of her film career. The supporting cast included Ann Medford, Kaye Francis, and Walter Pidgeon (played Ziegfield) are all wonderful.    But still this is Fanny's story, her life, and the film and in the end, Streisand's performance as Fanny makes me wonder if she's playing herself as well. Fanny and Barbra connect on so many levels.    The DVD comes with 2 documentaries about Streisand. I donated this DVD to my middle school that has a music program. If anything, they can watch it in class.
B001NFNFNU|4.0|We've been so used to seeing Angelina Jolie as a commercial action star (Lara Croft / Wanted / Sky Captain etc) or tabloid fodder as Brad Pitt's other half - that audiences have forgotten that she really does have Oscar-worthy acting chops (she won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar early on in 1999).  Changeling is one of her best performances and proof of her underrated talent.<br /><br />While many \\"true\\" movie adaptations take heavy doses of creative interpretation, Changeling didn't have to rewrite history to that extent for the sake of dramatization. The story itself is incredible and would defy belief, but to their credit, the filmmakers have retained most of the actual details that transpired.  In particular, one has to applaud screenwriter J. Michael Straczynski for finding and developing the material.  The team behind this was rock solid - Ron Howard was originally slated to direct, but eventually gave the reins to Clint Eastwood because of scheduling conflicts.  The result is an Eastwood effort which ranks among his best directorial works.<br /><br />What makes this different from your mother's odyssey or missing child films is simply the strange circumstances of the case - a corrupt LA Police Department and murders - elements that no doubt attracted Eastwood.  But what emerges is a poignant portrait of a strong woman who remained defiant and determined to establish the truth.<br /><br />Few would put Jolie in the league of Kate Winslet (who eventually won the Oscar that year).  But she definitely holds her own in this one.  All I can think about is how Angelina Jolie looked \\"robbed\\" at various awards shows in 2009, and one can appreciate her disappointment after watching Changeling.
B000EWBNMS|5.0|I just got into Medium this year and wanted to go back to the beginning.  Stories are creative and clever and I love the characters.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|A great movie beautifully rendered in Blu Ray.  The extras - making of - are mostly interesting although some get tediously long.  My only complaint was the additional and deleted scenes section did not have the traditional \\"directors narrative\\" option so you could hear from the source exactly why the given scene was deleted or what, specifically, it was originally supposed to add to the movie.  I always enjoy that with those and without it  you are just left to guess for yourself.  It makes them a lot less interesting not having it.
B002L3RVCY|5.0|What a fabulous present for my son, who is 10 years and a great star wars fan.  He just loves the dvd,s and the book mthat comes with it.
B002VECM6S|5.0|This is a great show, very down to earth. It will show you how bad we have treated the Black Americans in our past and how just a few stood tall and helped a \\"person\\" in need without regard to color or creed. Sandra Bullock is a Queen!
B001P3SA94|3.0|I watched the film with a friend last night & just about gagged on all the inaccuracies that are also perpetrated in the featurettes. See \\"K Cooper\\"'s \\"most helpful review\\" for some of the specifics. The biggest (but far from only) playing with the facts is totally ignoring Leonard's brother Phil Chess. It's a shame they didn't at least set the record straight in the featurettes, that would have undid much of the damage.<br /><br />One other thing I noticed is that the actors who copy Muddy & Wolf did a great job, but oddly rapper Mos Def makes Chuck Berry's singing voice sound like a white country singer. Couldn't they afford to license the real recordings? And modern \\"Urban\\" artist Beyonce is so NOT the blues. Totally out of place. Oh, & Howlin' Wolf wasn't skinny!<br /><br />I resent this movie for the inaccuracies, it could have been so much more.<br /><br />3-4 Stars for entertainment, 1 for accuracy.
B0002KVUKM|5.0|I saw this movie several months ago for the first time and got completely hooked on it. There's tons of action, beautiful romance, plenty of beautifully evil characters and a healthy dose of comic relief. All the actors did a fantastic job on it. They even included subtitles for the special features, which was a plus. The only minor detail that annoys me is that some of the subtitles, both for English and other languages, don't match up with the spoken lines at times. But other than that, this movie/DVD is awesome <3

0393072231|5.0|This author has that terrific narrative touch which starts with the understanding that story telling about real people is essential to getting across anything as  complex as the disaster wrought by Wall Street and all the greedy folks who got those silly greedy buyers into real estate which they could not afford.<br /><br />Texas Guinan was a former silent screen actress and singer who became a popular hostess in New York City speakeasy's during prohibition.

It ended Gutfreund's run as \\"King of Wall Street, when Warren Buffett took over the board and Gutfreund resigned.<br /><br />At this lunch, verbal bullets were exchanged, but in a courteous high priced restaurant, they shook hands and departed, leaving the reader to understand that immorality as the average person would define is not the Wall Streeters do!
B0037W68F4|3.0|I understand that people are saying that MGMT are trying to stay away from the mainstream with this album. They're also saying that those who don't like this album are assumed to only enjoy those \\"catchy singles\\" such as \\"Time to Pretend,\\" \\"Kids,\\" and \\"Electric Feel.\\" Hate to admit it, but I barely enjoyed the first two (although \\"Kids\\" has a catchy beat...it got old pretty quick). \\"Electric Feel\\" on the other hand took me into a dimension of music that I haven't heard for a while...so shoot me, because it is just that good. This was also the song I would use to reel in the OS virgins so they can listen to the entire album. I'm actually a lover of \\"The Youth,\\"-(be still my heart!) \\"Indie Rokkers,\\"-from Time to Pretend, \\"Pieces of What,\\"-(tear drop), \\"Of Moons Birds & Monsters,\\" \\"The Handshake,\\" and \\"Future Reflections.\\"     Congratulations is an album where one can appreciate MGMT for such an experimental ride. It's as if you walked in on a few -just for the hell of it- jam sessions that turned into songs. On the other hand, I'm a gal who can also appreciate melodies -like the ones from the singles listed above. sigh* Hence, the two missing stars for quite a lack of melodies, great chord transitions, etc.. that I used to enjoy tripping into another dimension with. Also, I'm sure MGMT did not create \\"Electric Feel\\" and other songs to purposefully cater to the mainstream, this is what their creativity put out. If the mainstream liked it then should they rip their hair out? No. I believe MGMT Only caters to their creativity, and if the Indie crowd loves it...great; If the mainstream crowd starts to dig it...cool. No love lost, friends. We shouldn't be upset about who ends up liking the creativity of another. Music is for all to hear and love.     Hugs, Peace and Love.
B00004XMV6|5.0|This is the original film I saw years ago.  The DVD is in perfect condition and just what I was looking for to share with a close friend who has never seen it.  Mickey and Kim look great.  Where did all the time go?

B002QH2NUA|5.0|Paul McCartney's New CD/DVD Live In New York City is his best concert ever!  When he performs Beattles Songs like I Saw Her Sttanding There, it is like John, George, Paul and Ringo are on Stage Together.  Paul McCartny just keeps getting better with age.  He payed trbute to Linda when he sang  My Love, a song that he wrote for her.  He also performed Classic songs from his days with Wings like Band On The Run, and Jet. The Next Time Paul McCartney goes on Tour It will definitely be a concert I will attend!
B002MBAJ4M|5.0|We should all like to be ourselves.  But if I could pick a currect music figure who I would trade places with (and I don't - I got a loving wife and home). But... this guy would be it.  Or maybe I'd like to be his bass player and stay in the background.  Either way... while mule does not produce duds, this one is nearly a masterpiece.  What do I consider a masterpiece?  An album that holds its own from first song to last with enough sparkling moments to make it special.  Thats hard to do. Rock gods Zeppelin did it most of their career, buts thats why they are Zeppelin and hailed so highly.  As at least one other reviewer mentioned, this should be on the list for the best album in its genre for the year.  When I start hanging on every riff and note of Warren's guitar, when I start to feel the genious of the added organ and bass contributions. Matt on drums- also great.  We are seriously on to something.  My music collection approaches over 20k in ivestment.  I go everywhere with the music I collect. Jazz, Blues, Raggae, Indy-Alt.  The only thing I really leave alone is super hardcore death metal, pop-country, and rap/hiphop (even then I will usually be caught with some of that stuff to.  I don't have time to follow live acts all of the time, but I did take a four show journey a couple years back with Mule.  My favorite was them playing at 4am at the All-good festival.  This album can bring blues bliss, serious heavy throbs, tears, and laughs.  Its all there.  Go mule.  You have not fallen from my top ten, and now I want to tour a bit with them after hearing this CD.  Does not get much better than this.  I think there is one tune I could skip over...while others might love it - and thats Gordon James (yet even that is decent). One or two tunes shy of a masterpiece.

B000LXH0AE|5.0|I have to admit, even old guys stuck in the past can enjoy this modern tale. Anyway, I did. Especially when that cold, modern life eroded under the assault of warm influences and generous tendencies. And the callous storyteller grew a heart. And the story--the improbable, ludicrous, amazing story--found an ending I could live with.    The special effects provided an interesting sheen. A fresh storyline complimented the modern feel. And the acting? Wonderful turns by all. Tony Hale...great supporting character. Queen Latifah...did her best with a limited role. Maggie Gyllenhaal...radiated sincerity and a funky integrity. Dustin Hoffman...earnestly professorial and as deadpan as you get. Emma Thompson...perfect voice for this film as she poured herself entirely into her character. And Will Ferrell...who knew he of all people could underplay a character and breathe so much life and quiet humor into him?    This movie will become a classic.
B0021L8V1G|4.0|I thought this movie was awesome and just as good as the original. It's filled to the brim with action, explosions, suspense, and comedy. The film takes place six months after the original, and Tony Stark is loving the fame and publicity he's made with Iron Man. Tony is slowly being poisoned by the palladium in his arc reactor, until he can find a replacement. He soon develops a drinking problem. During a race at Monaco, Tony is attacked by Ivan Vanko/Whiplash. Whiplash teams up with a weapons manufacturer to perfect a line of armored combat units that will upstage Tony. The units begin to attack, which are remote-controlled by Whiplash. Iron Man must team up with War Machine in order to save the day. I highly recommend IRON MAN 2!!!
1932100660|5.0|This is the best book I've ever read or seen on nutrition and health! It is amazing. It is scientifically sound and very well researched - which I can say about very few other nutrition titles on the market. Excellent book - must read! Following this book's advice, my cholesterol is down more than 100 points, and my weight is down 22 lbs. and still falling : )
B0015DROBO|2.0|It starts well with an interesting character in an interesting situation - a journalist found guilty of libel. Then there's a gigantic family history, including a mysterious disappearance. Then some completely unnecessary scenes of absolute sadism, in which I think in one instance we are supposed to side with the perpetrator. Then more plodding through family relationships. Then it becomes a standard serial killer novel. Finally, there is a wildly implausible, convoluted, embarrassingly bad, uninteresting resolution.    Why the fuss about this badly crafted book?
B0029NY9Y4|2.0|I actually saw this movie in the theater, but I never got around to writing a review of it. This one is well overdue.<br /><br />For those who love this type of movie, you'll probably fall for this one too. After all, it has spectacular special effects we've all come to expect from the adaptation of these graphic novels. (My personal favorite is, of course, 300 because it tell a story I find intriguing, and the acting, as well as special effects, is superb.)<br /><br />However, I found this one to be disappointing. In the opening scene, one of the super heroes, one of the Watchmen is murdered. Great start for the movie, but for about the next 45 mintues, (I timed it), we're inundated with the background of these people and what happened in the past. As if the script writer didn't know what to do next, we get a graphic, and way too long and unnecessary sex scene. Finally we're propelled back into the action of the story.<br /><br />What made this movie so hard to watch was all of the background information crammed into the beginning of the story. Why not weave those details in and tell them to us as the story progressed? Also, the sex scene was completely unnecessary. I get it. These two people were attracted to one another. So what? How did it contribute to the story? It didn't.<br /><br />If you like this kind of movie, you'll enjoy it. I gave this movie a low rating not because it was necessarily bad, but simply because I rated it according to the ratings: I didn't like it. It was money I wasted on watching a movie I didn't find worth watching.

0312243022|4.0|I've never read anything by Virginia Woolf and therefore some of the glowing reviews mentioning that this book revives Woolf's work were lost on me.  Nevertheless even without a strong appreciation for the strength of the Woolf homage, I still found The Hours to be an excellent novel.    There are three main characters. One isVirginia Woolf herself, the second is Clarissa living in the New York literary world of the late twentieth century and the third is Laura living as a standard 1950s housewife.  The stories are superficially linked by some Woolf references.  Laura is reading Mrs. Dalloway and Clarissa's close friend refers to her as Mrs. Dalloway.  As the story unfolds they are much more closely linked than may at first be apparent.    Each story is just a snapshot but deals with the inner lives and thoughts of women just living through the next hours of their lives.  The book leads off with Virginia's suicide and then proceeds to describe the lives of the other women from different times.  There's great sadness and the famous term \\"living lives of quiet desperation\\" came to mind during the book.    For me, the most profound ties were between Laura and Virginia who really struggle through their lives.  All of these struggles occur despite what on the surface would appear to be successful and vibrant lives.  All of the women have very supportive partners and few financial worries.  They are loved, yet they struggle.    I found Cunningham's writing to be very insightful and thematically rich.  It is particularly unusual that a male writer would so poignantly capture the feelings and lives of three female characters.  We usually see this insight from women writing about women or men writing about men.  Obviously being male, I do not necessarily have the definitive opinion on how well Cunningham has captured the inner struggles and lives of these women.  I'd be very curious to hear more from female reviewers on this.    From my perspective The Hours is an excellentnovel that I definitely recommend.
B003INBOEC|5.0|As a fan of Chinese cinema for over 30 years, I've seen (and own) a lot of movies. However, whilst there have been dozens of memorable ones, few stand out as masterpieces in the Wuxia genre - 'Ip Man' is one such film, an instant classic that sets a new benchmark for action cinema. Wilson Yip, Sammo Hung and Donnie Yen have totally hit the mark in this outstanding motion picture, crafting a story that, although not sticking entirely to the facts (well, after all, it IS about entertainment!), works perfectly to tell the story of a real life Chinese hero, the late Grandmaster of Wing Chun Gung-fu, Ip Man. The camera work, direction and the performances of the entire crew make this a film that grabs the audience and holds them in its clutches from start to final gut-wrenching finish (all very good reasons why this film won the 'Best Picture' and \\"Best Action Choreography' awards in the 2009 Hong Kong Film Awards). Donnie Yen gives what I feel is his finest performance ever, whilst Sammo Hung's action choreography is briliant, showcasing the art of Wing Chun in a manner never before done so well. The soundtrack is also beautifully matched to the tone of the movie. I for one cannot wait to see 'Ip Man 2'
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|The film THE DARK KNIGHT is amazing, a revelation to some including me but for those interested in the blu-ray version of a film there are many other questions.  How is the video?  How is the audio?  Is the blu-ray transfer worthy of a purchase.  The answer to both questions here is a resounding both are great and a purchase is a must.  Blu-ray allows much opportunity for crispness and clarity of picture - when done to its best a film takes on a life of its own.  And THE DARK KNIGHT can honestly be reviewed in two parts - the movie itself and the blu-ray version.  Critics have hailed the blu-ray version as one of the best examples of how blu-ray can shine.  This is not a quiet film in picture or audio.  There is much quick action, tons of important closeups and many dynamic shots created by director Christopher Nolan.  The clarity and crispness of the video on blu-ray never falters and will have you glued to your hd television.  Colors are vibrant, skin tones realistic and the ratio with blacks and whites superb.  All the explosions and effects shine and seem to pop from the screen.  The audio is also a masterpiece and provides the necessary accompaniment to such a perfect presentation.  Dialogue is perfect and action sequences very realistic.<br /><br />Of course one cannot review this film without mentioning the very sad aspect of Heath Ledger's untimely death.  How wonderful that his final role is such a true testament to the depth of talent he possessed.  He became THE JOKER in a way that ruled the film.  Just by his movements and way of speaking you got hints of the character's back story.  The performance was at the same time mezmerizing, perfection and terrifying.  This was an Oscar well deserved.  But we must also give huge kudos to director Christopher Nolan and actor Christian Bale.  Batman has been a comic, a television series and even done in film before.  Christopher Nolan's interpretation of the superhero take the story totally beyond comic book genre and presents Batman as a very real character with his own deep troubles and personal history.  This film is a story for the ages done well on all levels.  Acting, directing, writing all fall together for a deep, intense, scary story that will haunt you.  Heath Ledger's performance is worthy of a purchase alone but the film itself matches him at each level.  How often does this happen.<br /><br />Ans again, in regards to the blu-ray, this is a must purchase.  If you are a fan of the film you will be enthralled and even if you are not it is a necessity for it shows blu-ray at its best.ents Batman as a very real character with his own deep troubles and personal history.

0061564893|5.0|1421 started a little slow for me, but quickly gained momentum.  There is a lot of detail, but the inferences drawn (and many of the facts presented) are absolutely facinating. I believe this is a must read for anyone interested in world history.

B000C13Y2S|5.0|The product itself is very good and the light is very bright and works good.  Like the fact that it has a on/off switch so you dont have to keep something pressed down to keep the light on.  The only problem I had was with the weak metal loop that kept the light attached to the keyring.  After a while, mine got weak and broke off and now I have to find a way to attach the ring back so I can put it back on my keys.  Other than that, the light is very useful and I would recommend it to anyone for purchase.
0307454541|4.0|One of the best mystery novels I've read.  Sort of a mix between \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" and \\"Oceans 11\\".  It takes 100 pages to get rolling, but once it does, the story gets under your skin and it's hard to put down.  Gets quite dark in some places, a little heavy on the S&M, but overall a very entertaining read.

B0036S4B6M|4.0|I ordered and read this book within a few days and loved it!  The book had an intelligent, but easy narrative about Piper's life in Danbury, minimum security federal prison.  I didn't know a whole lot about the prison system or mandatory sentences based on crimes, but it definitely made me empathetic to her struggles and the other prisoner's struggles.  It sounds like there is a great need to overhaul the prison system to actually make it a therapeutic place as well as a place of punishment.  It sounds like the government can do a whole lot more to help people who are coming out of the judicial system and into the real world and there is a great need for this.<br /><br />I would recommend this memoir to anyone!

B0015DROBO|4.0|If I hadn't downloaded The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo on my Kindle, I would have tossed it aside after reading the first chapter.  The Swedish terms and idioms were so \\"unfriendly\\".  I couldn't pronounce the characters' names \\"in my mind\\".  Every time I turned on my Kindle it was in my face, so I was in the doctor's office waiting and decided to keep on clicking through it for a few more pages. When Salander showed up on the scene, I couldn't put my Kindle down because of the fast paced suspense.<br />Larsson's description of the frigid weather in Sweden makes me want to wrap up in a snuggy just thinking about this book.  All I can say is: stick with this one.  You won't regret it. I just downloaded the next one, The Girl Who Played With Fire so I've got to go.

I received the book all right, but WITHOUT the crucial part for practicing and/or meditation - the CD.  The Amazon did not specify that the book includes the CD and did not forwarn the purchaser before finishing the sale that this particular book is missing this important intrinsic part.  The book without the CD is useless.  I wasted my money.   I would change my opinion of Amazon and the book should Amzon complete the package and forward to me the missing item.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|FABULOUS, FABULOUS!  Better than Sopranos, which is better than anything else on TV.<br />  Obviously I wholeheartedly agree with most previous reviews. I just want to add my two cents to highlight some areas that I think reviewers didn't quite do justice to:<br />1. Don's Wife:  Betty Draper is often stereotyped by reviewers as being a gorgeous \\"childlike\\" Stepford wife type.  I disagree. There is much more to her than meets the superficial eye.  She is a woman with beautifully portrayed ambivalence--she revels in, and dazzles us, in her in her breezy handling of her assigned role as gorgeous, loving, devoted wife and mother, and housewife.  But, inside, there is depression, loneliness, alienation, and even anger and a sense of entrapment.  Indeed, her lines reveal this at almost every turn.  On the one hand, she is clearly an opinion leader among her neighborhood girlfriends, (e.g. in her persuading her friends to show some tolerance and sympathy for the divorcee who just joined the neighborhood), and she is a complete equal in her intelligent repartees with Don.  On the other hand, she is a nervous hostess, full of anxiety to put on the perfect birthday party for her little girl, and she is afflicted with some scary psychosomatic numbness and shaking in her hands, which lead her to the 1960s shrink's couch.  Her relationship with Don is a beautifully scripted and choreographed blend of real love, with a partnership of openness and honesty with regard to all of their SHARED life, battling with deception, and clandestine played out escape fantasies in each of their private lives.<br />2. As many reviewers comment, Mad Men is a real gem of a presentation of an anti-PC, \\"in your face\\" 1960s world.  BUT, it doesn't simply flaunt and revel in the \\"capitalist\\", \\"materialistic\\", \\"vice-ridden\\" culture.<br />  Far from glorifying this lifestyle, it displays, indeed very much wants to capture the viewer's attention to, all the darkness, the traps, the alienation, the Darwinian competition, and the sickness, that this world creates!  Indeed, this very unapologetic flamboyant, and gorgeous, movie quality TV show, treats the viewer with a rare degree of respect--the viewer sees it as it really was, and judges without interference or propaganda, for him or her self.  What a rare treat!tion, and the sickness, that this world creates!  Indeed, this very unapologetic flamboyant, and gorgeous, movie quality TV show, treats the viewer with a rare degree of respect--the viewer sees it as it really was, and judges without interference or propaganda, for him or her self.

B0037W68F4|5.0|To sum it up simply, the difference between OS and Congratulations is the same as the difference between the Sun and the Moon. Both are equally as great in their two different worlds, and each shine very brightly.     I believe MGMT chose a great path with this album and it will sit highly with those who really appreciate music. At first listen it did come off as odd because it lacked all the catchy chorus work from the first album, but even at first listen I knew there was something special about this album. This is such a great throwback to artist such as The Beatles, Bowie, and Pink Floyd but with a lot of elements and overtones that you got from OS.     If you felt kinda odd through the first listen, give it another try and the beauty in this album will sure to open up
0552998486|4.0|From the back cover:   Try me...Test me...Taste me...  When an exotic stranger, Vianne Rocher, arrives in the French village of Lansquenet and opens a chocolate boutique directly opposite the church, Father Reynaud identifies her as a serious danger to his flock - especially as it is the beginning of Lent, the traditional season of self-denial. War is declared as the priest denounces the newcomer's wares as the ultimate sin. Suddenly Vianne's shop-cum-cafe means that there is somewhere for secrets to be whispered, grievances to be aired, dreams to be tested. But Vianne's plans for an Easter Chocolate Festival divide the whole community in a conflict that escalates into a 'Church not Chocolate' battle. As mouths water in anticipation, can the solemnity of the Church compare with the pagan passion of a chocolate eclair? For the first time here is a novel in which chocolate enjoys its true importance, emerging as a moral issue, as an agent of transformation - as well as a pleasure bordering on obsession. Rich, clever and mischievous, this is a triumphant read.    Review:  The film Chocolat is one of my favourite films to watch, especially on cold winter nights rugged up on the couch with a cup of hot chocolate. I'm really glad that I watched the film before I read the book as they are really quite different and I think if I had read the book first I would have been disappointed in the movie and not fallen in love with it. As it stands now, I feel like I can really enjoy both the book and film despite their differences. The movie has a slightly saccharine tone, with the characters portrayed in a way that leads the viewer to feel an affection for their foibles, but the book is much darker. While there is the comic aspect to the writing (some parts very funny that made me laugh aloud) the characters' light and dark aspects are much more clearly presented, with some of the dark being truly horrific.     The writing is rich and descriptive, especially the descriptions of the chocolates, and I warn you to have some chocolate to hand whilst reading or you might find yourself on a midnight chocolate run because you just can't sleep until you get some! Everything about the people, their mannerisms, clothes, speech, and the village, houses, church, paths, gardens and river is so well described that I feel that if I happened upon Lansquenet I would recognise it immediately and would recognise all the people too. But also the motivations of the characters, both publicly announced and those held secretly, are fully explored, and I feel like I took a journey through the human condition as the events of the story unfolded.    This is a book to disappear into and emerge from with an appreciation and understanding of the way people survive the struggles of life. I really enjoyed this book and am looking forward to reading more of Joanne Harris' books.
B0039SFKSW|4.0|Not many changes were made to the style and production of these songs from the last release. You'll dig this if you are a big Asia fan. The songs are instantly likeable but nothing here stands out as being astonishing, which is disappointing. I think they're just happy to be playing together and making new music without the stress of coming out with something revolutionary.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|It's obvious from watching and listening to this concert that these two great artists have great admiration and love for each other.  Add some great songs and an excellent band and this package is definitely a five star show. My only complaint is that it's so entertaining and enjoyable that it seems to end too soon! This set belongs in the collection of any fan of James and Carole or anyone who loves great music that is timeless.
B0006GAO3G|5.0|Elmore Leonard's novel Get Shorty was a hit, as was its movie adaptation. I say this as an Italian-American from New York who's lived in Miami - aka Brooklyn with palm trees -- so I get where it comes from. I'm just glad that this comedic gem finally got the two-disc treatment. It gets better with each viewing. The extras are fun and interesting, if a bit lightweight.<br /><br />It's enough to say that the intricate plot is classic Elmore Leonard, and that the script has retained much of  his pithy dialogue. I'd rather focus on the quirky characters and their players because it is they who make this film snap, crackle and pop.<br /><br />IMO Get Shorty would have gotten little attention without John Travolta's stellar performance. From his razor-cut helmet hair to his expertly wielded cigarette to his swaggering walk, Travolta IS Chili Palmer, a Miami-based loan shark with orca-like charm who thinks quickly, speaks directly and acts decisively. He's also a film buff who decides to get into the movie business because it's a lot like organized crime, but with more legit money. Travolta doesn't play Chili; he inhabits the character, which is high praise.<br /><br />The same is true of Travolta's co-stars. The excellent Gene Hackman is perfect as dim-witted Harry Zimm, a horror film producer whose gambling habit and big mouth land him in serious doodoo. Danny DeVito captures the egocentricity of \\"shorty\\" Norman Weir, the talented actor turned Movie Stah that Harry wants for his one-shot prestige film. Rene Russo competes with these big-name actors for our attention and wins. Her MILF looks and sardonically rendered lines turn jaded actress Karen Flores into a real prize. No wonder all these guys want her.<br /><br />Every part is well cast. Dennis Farina never misses; here he plays beat-up Miami mob boss Ray \\"Bones\\" Barboni with comic malevolence. He's after dry-cleaner Leo Devoe (a milquetoast-y David Paymer), a \\"dead\\" airline crash victim that Chili finds living largeon the insurance money that he owes to Bones. Delroy Lindo has a pivotal role as LA limo king and coke dealer Bo Catlett, one of Harry's investors and a deadly dude if he or his carpeting get messed with. James Gandolfini hints at his future Sopranos success as Bear, a pony-tailed movie stunt man who moonlights as Bo's bodyguard. Miguel Sandoval is Mr. Escobar, a Colombian drug lord who arrives in L.A. to lean on Bo about his coke payment and overdue nephew.<br /><br />The many uncredited cameos sprinkled throughout Get Shorty give it added insider hipness. Examples: Bette Midler appears more than once as Doris Saphron, the zaftig widow of Zimm's former script writer who sees the producer as her new meal ticket. I'm surprised no one has mentioned spotting Alex Rocco reprising his mobster-on-the-massage-table scene from GF1, or Barry Sonnenfeld, the film's director, playing a hotel doorman getting tipped by Leo in LV. There are other very recognizable faces, but why should I spoil your fun?<br /><br />A last thought: I'm puzzled as to why so few people have commented on Get Shorty's great music. It's a sassy mix of original music by John Lurie, jazz standards and R&B classics played by Booker T and the MGs. Seriously, these tracks are cool enough to air condition your house in August.<br /><br />So look at me, Harry. Look at me. Just watch, listen and be cool. You got that?

0393072231|5.0|Michael Lewis does an outstanding job of making understandable the abstract world of mortgage backed securities and credit default swaps.

B0018LX9T4|5.0|One of those take it or leave it, hate it or love it movies, Secretary is an on the edge yet non-judgmental look at BDSM, or, to the squares out there, Bondage Domination Sadomasochism.<br /><br />Innocent and self-destructive, and recently released from a psych ward, Lee Holloway (Maggie Gyllenhaal) self-mutilates to make up for her poor self-esteem and repressed sexual submissiveness.  After taking up typing she applies for a job as a secretary for E. Edward Grey (James Spader), an OCD lawyer with an apparently bustling law practice.  As the two grow to know one another, they learn a shared appreciation for an unorthodox physical, psychological, emotional attraction that transforms Lee from a pathetic girl next door into a more confident person and unleashes the creepy sadist sequestered inside Grey's calm demeanor.<br /><br />Gyllenhall and Spader act perfectly, but I suspect it's because they're perfect for the role.  She conveys emotion perfectly in this role because she appears to be a person of great emotional fragility and considerable deferment.  On the other hand, Spader delivers every role in his own collected style that's a bit too good not to be partially truthful.  I can't imagine any other actor in either role.<br /><br />Romantic and taboo at the same time, the plot flows well with some dark humor filling the gaps between BDSM scenes.  Beautifully filmed shots of long hallways in which secretaries must crawl to their master and hard desks on which delicious derrieres receive rosy handprints.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />Jason Elin
0316017922|4.0|Malcom Gladwell has written a book that is food for thought, not a rigorous study, about why people are successful.  However, he conveniently identifies well-known people who fit his hypotheses, but omits other successes that don't support his points and people who fit his success profile that never became successful.  Nonetheless, he makes several points which are worth thinking about.  The flow of the book is a little bewildering, in terms of figuring out what point he is trying to make at a given time, and how well they hang together.    His first point is that success grows for people properly incubated with opportunities.  He mentions Bill Gates and his opportunities for exposure to computer programming.  However, Bill Gates is hardly the only person who had similar opportunities in those years, yet was the only one to go on to become, at various times, the richest man in the world.  And his ultimate success depended on much more than his initial skills in software development.    He meanders on to his second point, which is that people must be very focused on their chosen goal, and he cites 10,000 hours of work as being that magic threshold, whether it is for musicians or computer programmers.  He emphasizes that the average person with the devotion to putting in time can outpace the talented who lack the same motivation.  This is probably the most valuable lesson in the book, but again there is no rigorous study to back this up.  He offers as an example the Beatles days of being a bar band in Hamburg.  But what he doesn't seem to understand is that the Beatles' success was not due to their polished performance abilities.  It was due to their creativity, songwriting, personalities, and creating a new sound at exactly the time that the public was hungry for it.  None of that was enhanced by thousands of hours slogging away at playing covers in Hamburg.    One section is interesting but a non sequitur that discusses the different communications styles across cultures and how those difference have a direct impact on cockpit crew dynamics and can be traced as causes of air accidents.    He discusses how the Asian work ethic probably evolved from the demands of farming rice, and how it differs from growing crops common the U.S. and Europe.  He may have a point in his claim that rice paddy productivity is directly related to how well the farmer manages it, compared to other crops where one plants and prays for the right weather.    The book closes with a description of an experimental middle school in the South Bronx where students spend more hours in school, and perform much better than their peers who started out with similar abilities.  This is the most credible case he makes as far as an objective argument.    The book is very readable, held my interest throughout, and provided some thought-provoking material.  I welcomed it as a mind-opener, although his main point--you'll do better if you work harder--is hardly a surprise to any of us or our lecturing grandfathers.      I would treat this book as a stimulating discussion well worth the participation, but don't mistake for a scholarly treatise.
B0002ZDVF4|1.0|I was sent the wrong movie. I was suppose to get the Bourne Ultimatum. Not worth sending back as it only cost a $1.99. Would have cost me more to send back than to give it away.
B000HWZ61Y|5.0|This Cd includes the basis Hysteria soundtracks but the bonus versions and b-sides you rarely hear played even in concert. Lucky I have heard some of these songs in concert and it's a great reminder of their act. This a great gift for any Def Leppard fan you know!
B002PLALCE|5.0|If you want your music to be sugar-coated, your minstrel's voice to be perfect, and the content to be all upbeat, this cd isn't for you.  If, however, you like honest, bare-bones music, with the singer's voice letting you know maybe a little more than you'd normally want to about the singer, and if you are content to let the musician and producer choose the music on the album, then this album just might be for you.  If you are a life-long Johnny Cash fan, as I am, or if you are a teenager, newly come to like Cash's work, then you are in for a treat.  I can't possibly rate any Cash recording with less than five stars.  Maybe that is because I have been listening to Johnny's music since he first started singing for Sam Phillips.  Maybe it is because I have read every book written about him, as well as every book written by the man, himself.  Maybe it is because I have followed Johnny Cash throughout his career, through his years of being an amphetamine junkie, through his initial link up with June Carter, through his years of renewal after he kicked the drugs, through loving his tv show, and through wondering where he disappeared to, when I could no longer find any new Albums by him.  Certainly I rate his albums with five stars ever since he signed with Rick Rubin because I feel that everything he has done with Rubin is absolutely sterling.  Sure, his voice begins to sound like the voice of a sick, tired old man on American IV Recording, \\"The Man Comes Around\\", but that album and the accompanying video that was made to go with it, brought tears to my eyes as I realized that \\"my\\" Johnny Cash was, suddenly, old and sick.  Once I had accepted that fact, I was able to enjoy subsequent Johnny Cash albums with only the occasional tear for the fragility of his voice.    My favourite cuts on the American V recording are Larry Gatlin's \\"Help Me\\", Johnny Cash's \\"Like the 309\\", Bruce Springsteen's \\"Further On Up the Road\\", Hank Williams' \\"On the Evening Train\\", Johnny Cash's \\"ICame to Believe\\". Don Gibson's \\"A Legend in My Time\\", and Ian Tyson's \\"Four Strong Winds\\".  I like it when Johnny sings songs about the \\"hereafter\\", or of a spiritual nature, of which a number of these qualify.  Cash opens with a plea to God to \\"Help Me\\".  His fragile voice are testimony enough that he can't make it on his own any more. The next song on the album, \\"God's Gonna Cut You Down\\", captures the memory of what his voice once was, it's sort of there on this one.  I liked the beat of an old \\"slave-song\\".  \\"Like the 309\\" is just a plain song about facing death, accepting it, and being ready to go.  It's stark, with a sort of Blue's guitar accompaniment.  Very powerful. Gordon Lightfoot's \\"If You Could Read My Mind\\" didn't really seem to fit, but if it's what Johnny wanted on the album, who am I to take issue?  I am also a fan of Bruce Springsteen, and so hearing Johnny sing one of his songs is like the \\"frosting on the cake\\".  The words of the song are stark and cold, but the musicality of it is beautiful, as is the sentiment of meeting \\"further on up the road\\".  I believe in the resurrection of the dead, and this song is about that.  Williams'\\"On the Evening Train\\" is another song about death.  It's sad, but so was the man who recorded it for this album.  He had just lost his beloved wife, best friend and partner of over thirty years, June Carter, and he is singing from that place of stark, hurting loss.   He sang the words to this song from his very heart.  Johnny Cash's \\"I Came To Believe\\", is his own spiritual testimony, written in his own words, that expressed his personal faith.  It is beautiful.  RodMcKuen's \\"Love's Been Good to Me\\" didn't seem to fit the image I, personally, have of Johnny Cash.  It's the song of a ramblin' man, but maybe it expresses Cash's life before June Carter.  Quine sabe?  Johnny Cash, himself, is a legend in his time.  And even though the words don't seem to fit Cash's life, this oldy is fitting for this album.  Cash speaks some of the words on this song, and his spoken voice is strong and he sounds like himself.  Hugh Moffatt's \\"Rose of My Heart\\" is also one of my favourites on this album.  It's as if Johnny is singing the very words to June.  The waltz time of this lovely old piece helps to make it a heart-stealer.  \\"Four Strong Winds\\" was popular when I was in high school, or perhaps at the University of Denver.  I'm not sure of the exact time that I first heard it, but within that time frame.  I loved the song then, and I love it now, sung by my beloved Johnny.  Finally, Herscher & Klein's \\"I'm Free From the Chain Gang Now\\" reflect Johnny's empathy for the prisoner, but it has a spiritual undertone.  I read a review by someone claiming that this album was the album of a very sick man who was facing death and who had just lost his wife.  All of that is true, but to me, it gives authenticity to this album.  There's no pretense or gloss on this album.  A lot of the songs are about death, or about spiritual things.  But, so what?  I agree that this album isn't for everyone, but that perhaps everyone should hear it at least once.  Johnny Cash's fans will find him, or he will find them, no matter what their age or cultural background.    As usual, a thanks to Rick Rubin for signing Johnny and for bringing out this album and American VI.  His belief in Johnny has given all of us who love Johnny Cash the great benefit of the American Recording series - a true gift!
B001HN697M|3.0|I was disappointed in the choice for the lead actress at first cause of the looks between the original one used in the first film for daughter. But her acting skills were better than I expected. This was a pretty good film for being a third and a prequel.
B00008IAMD|5.0|From the strong, driving guitar accompaniment to Johnny Cash's admittedly frayed, aged voice singing of Armeggedon, quoting directly from the Bible, this song grabs you and leaves you wondering and thinking, and more than a little shaken. The entire album seems to be autobiographical.  Johnny's reflections on his spiritual beliefs, his fight with drug addiction, his deep love for his wife, June Carter, his love OF the American West, and his final assurance that \\"We'll Meet Again\\", are all here.  The John Lennon/Paul McCartney favourite \\"In My Life\\" seems to speak for Johnny.  It brings tears to your eyes.  Honest tears from an honest album.  Also sold alongside this album is Mark Romanek's dvd of the Nine Inch Nails' song \\"Hurt\\".  The first time I watched this dvd, and saw Cash, old, his eyes clouded by Glaucoma, his voice revealing the ravages of time and the hard life he had led, saw the camera pan across the opulent room in his house where the dvd was made to focus on June Carter standing watching him, an immense sadness and tenderness in her eyes, I just sat in front of the tv and sobbed.  I can't watch that dvd without the tears flowing.  It flashes back on Cash when he was a young, healthy, very handsome man, showing him hopping a freight train, walking around his boyhood home near Dyess, Arkansas, shows that same home surrounded by floodwaters, shows him and June in concert together, shows them as the proud new parents of their son, John Carter Cash - in short, visits Cash's life at different times and stages.  And it ends with the aged, ill Cash, singing the words, \\"If I could start again, in another time and place, I would keep myself, I would find a way.\\"  If you've heard the cd but not seen the dvd, you need to, by all means.  The cd and dvd are \\"bookends\\" with the life of Johnny Cash in between.  Entirely memorable!
B00003CXRM|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies.  It's very funny, plus it has a lot of good bluegrass in it.
0891419063|5.0|While not specifically an antiwar account, E.B. Sledge's, With The Old Breed presents the horrors of war graphically in all five senses. In this personal memoir, Sledge takes us into the hell of war and the lingering terror inside his own mind.  We not only see the devestation, we hear the deafening explosions, feel the mud in our \\"boondockers,\\" taste the rain-soaked c-rations, and most of all smell the rotting corpses of his fellow marines and enemies that litter the battlefield.  In one scene, Sledge describes digging a foxhole on Okinawa only to have his entrenching tool pierce the ribcage of a buried Japanese soldier.  The stench fills the air and turns loose a horde of maggots from the dead's body. In a sense Sledge is the soldier's Everyman who lays bare the terrible costs of war echoing like cannon fire through the ages.  What struck me  the most about this autobiography is how so relatively few people in leadership positions can send so many to die for some cause these leaders deem as just.  Sledge carried these memories with him throughout his life as a biology professor at a small Alabama college.  He passed away in 2001 and is now with the old breed.  May he and all his comrades in arms rest in peace for eternity.
B002RI99IM|3.0|When I first heard about this book and its premise, I was quite eager to read it. Unfortunately, the book disappointed me.    The premise is quite interesting and the book contains many good ideas. However, the book is marred by the Taleb's ego. I found this really sapped my enthusiasm for reading further and extracting those good ideas.     Also, his criticisms of other ideas are often wrong. For example he criticises economics for not being able to deal with differentiated products when it does.    At the end of the day, I found this book difficult and frustrating to read. It had some good ideas that I have taken away, but I wonder whether it was really worth the effort.    Lastly, I couldn't resist making a very pedantic quibble about the cover - black swans have read beaks with a white band across the front, not orange beaks with a black tip like white swans. It seems the cover designer and editors are victims of the black swan effect.
B00275EGWY|5.0|This was a movie about a maverick adrenalin junkie working in a bomb disposal unit in Iraq.  At the point we're seeing this guy, he's straying more and more from the rules until he gets himself and the others with him in trouble.  The acting in it was excellent, the filming and pacing was to the point, and the directing was tight.  Bigelow's vision was apparent all the way through this, and she gave us a solid picture.  She makes those of us who haven't experienced it feel the tension and heat and insanity of the situation that everyone over there is having to deal with every day.    This isn't a documentary.  It's fiction about someone pushing the rules to get his rush in a tense situation.  And as such, it's well told and a great movie.
B001W6S0C6|5.0|I bought this because I'm a huge fan of the film and Michael Keaton still remains my fav. Batman (i'm also a big Tim Burton fan)<br />The bluray version looks so good and the book edition has lots of cool pics on the set of this classic film. If you are someone who did not like Keaton as Batman just remember one thing, if he hadn't been Batman you wouldn't have any Batman films other than the old corny Adam West one. I only wish Keaton and Burton had made the third film to have a nice little trilogy because the third and fourth movies sucked bad. But there are lots of great bonus features on this bluray and if you are like me and grew up with this version of Batman you will love it on bluray. I like the new movies with Christian Bale but I don't think they are good because of him. The villains make his movies watchable (do i need to say how great Ledger was as the Joker?)<br />Keaton was able to capture the tortured soul look of Bruce Wayne and make you see his pain for the tragic loss of his parents. Bale just isn't believable nor does he make you feel the sense of loss for Wayne. But I do like the new Batman films or at least I loved The Dark Knight, Batman Begins did not impress me much. So yes I highly recommend buying this 20th Anniversary Edition of Batman on bluray.<br />It just looks so amazing in hi-def.
B000FC2FVA|5.0|This is an excellent Phoenix album. If you liked Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix (their 4th album which received the most widespread recognition) then you will love this album just as much, if not more! Excellent music, catchy tunes and lyrics, and that mellow-yet-rockin' beat that keeps surfacing throughout the entire album, making it seem like all 10 tracks here are just one song, seamlessly flowing into each other, yet without sounding repetitive or boring. (Well, the lyrics for Second to None do get a tad repetitive, but that's just Phoenix's style.) Each song can stand on its own, but this album is definitely meant to be heard all together. If you're here because you heard Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix and thought to check out their earlier stuff, then buy this. You won't regret it. Or, if you're just looking for a cool new band to add to your music library, then buy this. You won't regret it. Heck, if you like to hear bands and music that aren't mainstream, popular, or just plain overplayed, then buy this. You won't regret it.    Seeing a pattern here?
B001UV4XWY|1.0|Dawn K (see next paragraph) said it all better than I could, and it would just be redundant to say all that again. Suffice...it may have been the worst screenplay or editing of any movie I've ever seen. I recommend highly not to waste the almost two hours only to walk away unsatisfied and not even caring what the answers are to all the dangling questions. The actors mostly seem to put their hearts into their performances, so that's not the problem(although Cameron just doesn't fit this role or movie genre - doesn't have the stretch) the content and dialog are.<br /><br />From Dawn K on DVD [...] reviews:<br />The main idea of the movie isn't so bad - that people (in the movie, it seems to be married couples) must decide in 24 hours if they should press a button which will mean they'll get $1 million but also that somewhere, someone they don't know will die. The problems of the movie are many: the movie gives hazy glimpses of \\"employees\\" who seem to work for the man who makes \\"the box\\" offers, yet even the box man is working for someone else - it would have been nice to have a clearer explanation of who the box man is and the reason/s why the experiment (what I got from it is some kind of alien population is conducting experiments on humans and only humans can stop this experimentation by \\"making the right choice\\" and if they don't make the right choice, there is a threat of annihilation by said unknown alien leaders) is being done. The movie is confusing, shallow, and goes off on several tangents which either have nothing to do with the storyline or which also go unresolved (Norma and the box man connect briefly, but it doesn't seem to mean anything or change anything; we never find out how the \\"employees\\" are made and why, where they come from, and where they go; the involvement of the children just didn't seem to fit the equation set by the box man; and the list of unanswered questions goes on). I was dissatisfied upon finishing the movie, though I did like some of the characters and would have liked to have known/understood more.acters and would have liked to have known/understood more.
B001F6TXME|4.0|I was told by different camera shops that a wired remote was not available for the Nikon D5000.  I did a search here on Amazon and to my surprise there is one.

B000YRY7TO|4.0|The Movie may not remind you of action from Police story series or the Armour of God but yes its worth the watch for the different character chosen by Jackie this time. The Baby is too cute and the movie has certain excellent choreographed stunts and the comedy timing is smooth in all the scenes. This Dragon Dynasty version has an interview of Jackie with run time of almost one hour and the best part is the same has a English Audio too with the print of this edition being far better than the other Rob B Hood version from different distributor versions....... A die hard Jackie Chan fan should purchase a own copy of this special 2 disc edition.
0316069906|2.0|Well, my son asked me to buy him this book so I did and I decided to read it before he did!    I have to say that it was chock full of statistics and had some stories of what the slaughterhouses actually do to the animals.    Did it sway my decision and make me feel like I shouldn't eat meat?  NO!    It did open my eyes to the in-humane ways companies are raising the meat we put in our mouths, and it has made me think to SLow Down on meat comsumption.    God put animals on the earth to eat.  Are companies taking it to the absolute extreme?  YES!  I would support cracking down on slaughterhouses and the chemicals needed to produce big and quickly, but I'm not about to become a vegan!
0545123267|5.0|When Grace Brisbane was a young girl, wolves grabbed her from her backyard swing and dragged her into the woods. Only one wolf out of the pack did not attack her, a wolf with vivid yellow eyes. Six years later, Grace remains fascinated (obsessed?) by the yellow-eyed wolf. She spends hours in her backyard watching him. And Sam, the wolf, watches her back. Sam is a werewolf, wolf by winter, boy by summer, but he only ever watches Grace from a distance until the death of a local boy finally brings them together.<br /><br />Shiver is, first and foremost, a love story. Grace and Sam have been bound together since that day that the wolves grabbed her as a child. Grace's parents, while loving, basically leave her to raise herself (Sam says they're \\"like busy little brainless birds, fluttering in and out of their nest at all hours of the day or night, so involved in the pleasure of nest building that they hadn't noticed that it had been empty for years\\") and she's having a hard time staying close with her best friends Rachel and Olivia. Sam is loved and supported by his pack leaders Beck and Paul, but he longs to be human. The romance between Sam and Grace is intense, but it is right for the characters. Both are more mature than their years.<br /><br />Maggie Stiefvater is a good very writer, and Shiver is a very good book. Count me as yet another reader anxiously awaiting the next book.

B0034EIVKK|1.0|Only sounding like the Scott-Heron of old on the spoken word parts - of which there are too few - this album tries to be a lot of things but fails at all of them.  It is not a welcome return to form, it is not the return of an artist at the level of master, it is not engaging, it is not accessible.<br /><br />Scott-Heron expresses a lot of wear-and-tear here, more than most people are probably prepared for that don't know he's had a rough go of life for the last couple of decades.  This record makes it abundantly clear that he need not put out another record unless a) he stops trying to sing altogether and focuses on spoken word pieces, and b) he spends more time crafting more poignant spoken word pieces.  The background work is mostly forgettable and loose, probably to accomodate an artist well past his prime, settling for dirges and riffs.  The album isn't risk-taking; it's bad.<br /><br />If you're a completist, knock yourself out.  If you're a fan, this might make you more sad than anything else.
0370006542|5.0|This book was perfect. Someone had already signed it (the last owner) what can you do? They said it was a little worse for the ware, but in good condition, and they were right. After I received it, I headed over the Wonder Con in San Francisco, and has Peter S. Beagle himself sign it. If you get a chance to meet him, do. He's a sweetheart.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|What a tremendous take on an old theme. Downey and Law make a good pairing for the legendary couple in the 21st Century. Brilliantly acted and directed. Guy's got his mojo back with a vengeance - more please!<br />Great print, safely and quickly delivered despite the volcanic ash. TThanks guys.
B000SX6LHU|5.0|I Might Be Wrong is an EP covering eight songs from Radiohead's Kid A/Amnesiac touring. This is why all of the songs on here are from those two records. Quite frankly, it's about time they put out a live album. Sometimes songs change when they're played live and you can see how the band evolves when you hear their live music. Now, the selection is not perfect; I would have liked to have heard Optimistic or Pyramid Song with a live twist, and I can only imagine what they would have done to How To Disappear Completely. However, they did pick a lot of their strongest songs and they all sound, quite frankly, amazing.    For example, The National Anthem has been greatly changed for the better. The beat has been picked up and fleshed out a little. The brass has been taken out, so the alternative vibe shines throughout the entire song. In its place is radio transmission to make it feel like Radiohead thinks today's world is like: flooded with nonsense. Who knows, this might have inspired the cover art of Hail To The Thief.    I Might Be Wrong is now a catchy rock beat. Like Spinning Plates is now piano-based, but still remains haunting. Morning Bell is more vocal-backed. Idioteque explodes into a frenzied audience sing-along. The upbeat Dollars and Cents gains a creepy undertone.    And, most notably, Everything In Its Right Place, the staple and climax of the album, almost DOUBLES in length. A short \\"here comes the flood\\" part is played before the piano even kicks in. Then it continues as normal until the final stretch where everything becomes distorted and Thom's voice reverberates in the background... I won't give it away, but it is spectacular. And, of course, this is one of the only places to get the live-only exclusive track True Love Waits, which provides the perfect ending to the EP: moving and reflective.    So, in conclusion, this is a staple for all Radiohead fans - especially concert-goers and Kid A and Amnesiac lovers. If you can't see one of their live performances, buy this. You just might find that there is a future after all.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|The summer of 2010 is nearly upon us and here to ring in the blistering heat is the first official blockbuster of the season, \\"Iron Man 2\\". After the gigantic success of \\"Iron Man\\" in 2008, the inevitable sequel was quickly announced by Marvel Studios. So, with only two short years to piece together the continuing story of billionaire Tony Stark and his alter-ego Iron Man, director Jon Favreau and company quickly began working on what could possibly be one of the biggest movies, if not the biggest of the year. With expectations surrounding this follow-up understandably high, \\"Iron Man 2\\" would definitely need to up the stakes and the spectacle in order to meet audience demand. But have no fear true believer (just a little nod to Stan Lee there); this movie succeeds brilliantly on all counts.    \\"Iron Man 2\\" picks up six months after the events of the previous film. Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) is beginning to feel the pressure of living the life of a publicly known superhero. With his behavior growing more and more erratic, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Lt. Col. James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) begin to wonder if Tony's days as Iron Man need to come to a close. Meanwhile, a new threat is emerging onto the scene, Ivan Vanko a.k.a. Whiplash (Mickey Rourke), seeking to destroy Tony Stark for sins of the father, so to speak. Plus, a rival weapons manufacturer, Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), is trying to create his own version of the Iron Man armor, and will stop at nothing to achieve his ambitious goal. With so much at stake, Tony will have to look inside himself to rediscover the man behind the armor, and in a sense re-forge the Iron Man.    The first film featured a terrific blend of action, comedy (well-written and smart, not so much tongue-in-cheek), drama, and stunning visual effects to bring the hero to life. With \\"Iron Man 2\\" the action is even more intense, with bigger special effects sequences, but this time the comedy takes more of a backseat to make room fora much more dramatic storyline. Put all of these elements together and mix them just right and you've got yourself a recipe for another successful superhero jaunt.    The action sequences in the original were fast-paced and well-executed pieces of summer movie fun. However, the action in this film blows away everything that was done before with considerable ease. If you thought that there wasn't enough armored action the first-go-round, then \\"Iron Man 2\\" should definitely meet your needs. If nothing else, the final 30 minutes of the movie will leave even the most ardent action junkie satisfied for quite some time.    Assisting in creating the incredible action scenes is some truly impressive visual effects work courtesy once more from Industrial Light and Magic. The visuals' seamless blend with the live action elements makes the futuristic aspects of the movie more believable rather than if the CGI had been over-the-top. Case in point, the holographic imagery Stark uses when associating/working with JARVIS in the lab. This obvious usage of CGI while very apparent doesn't seem all that removed from our reality, to the point that one could easily see this tech being available in the not so distant future. Not to mention all of the CGI intensive moments featuring Iron Man and War Machine in action are so exciting, and for comic book lovers, seeing the duo fighting side-by-side is simply incredible. Their scenes alone make it worth watching on the big screen at least one time.    Of course, the glue holding all of the exciting visuals and thrilling action sequences together is the solid screenplay written by Justin Theroux (\\"Tropic Thunder\\"), featuring elements loosely based upon the acclaimed \\"Demon in a Bottle\\" storyline from the comic books. As I stated earlier, the original film featured plenty of humor, wit, and sarcasm (primarily from Tony), this installment opts for a more mature tone which is very appropriate given the upheavals occurring in Tony's life after his proclamation of, \\"I am Iron Man.\\" So, for those of you hoping for the same light-hearted fare, sorry not this time, and honestly the movie works well without it.    Now, there are some that felt this darker tinged story, especially in the first half of the movie, causes this entry to not feel as fun or entertaining as its predecessor. Personally, I felt the thematic shift was a natural progression for the character (not to mention keeping in-line with the comic book source material), and had the humor remained front-and-center then the story would have fallen flat on its face. While I do understand the detractors' point of view, the lesser success of the two \\"Fantastic Four\\" movies should serve as a prime example of allowing for too much humor, thus, overshadowing the potential for good dramatic storytelling. Thankfully, screenwriter Justin Theroux and director Jon Favreau managed to avoid the aforementioned movies' pratfall, and the drama was allowed a chance to thrive.    Of course, the story would be nothing without the incredible cast assembled to breathe life into these iconic characters. Leading the assemblage once more is Hollywood's most successful comeback kid, Robert Downey, Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Robert appears to be relishing the opportunity to reprise what could easily be called his most recognizable role. Robert once again brings his smooth talking, hyper-active personality to the character, but with a darker edge than previously seen. Portraying a man on the edge of losing his way, Robert's terrific performance was most likely influenced by his own infamous past. Even with the darker thematic elements, Downey, Jr. manages to keep things interesting and from sinking too far down during the film's gloomy, yet necessary moments.    In the supporting roles we find actress Gwyneth Paltrow returning as Pepper Potts. While Gwyneth easily holds her own opposite Robert, and their scenes are always rife with a playful tension and chemistry; sadly, it felt like her role was somewhat diminished from that of the original film. Even though she was featured throughout the entire duration, often times she seemed to be more of an afterthought to the scenes. Obviously, in a film with such a large cast, fitting everyone in with equal time is a difficult task, so I do understand that some judicious editing had to be done. Also, I'm not saying that having a little less Pepper Potts results in a less enjoyable movie, not in the least bit. I was just surprised more than anything to see her character on the backburner.    The character of Lt. Col. James Rhodes, portrayed this time by Don Cheadle (\\"Traitor\\") replacing Terrence Howard, is much more involved in not only the story, but also the action sequences, due to his donning of the War Machine armor. I was curious as to what I was going to think of Don Cheadle as Rhodes compared to Terrence, since I enjoyed his portrayal in the first movie. However, after seeing the movie I was left wishing Cheadle would have portrayed the character in both films. As good of an actor as Terrence Howard is, Don Cheadle really looked like he fit the part, and played the role perfectly both in and out of the armor. Cheadle just came off as a harder, more militaristic man in his portrayal, whereas Terrence seemed more on the softer side and slightly out of place in the role by comparison. It's too bad we can't go back and do some re-shoots to insert Don Cheadle into the original movie for better continuity.    Several new characters joined the cast of the expanding Marvel movie universe as we were introduced to Stark Industries' main business rival Justin Hammer, the villainous Ivan Vanko, and undercover spy Natasha Romanoff. Sam Rockwell (\\"Moon\\") is perfectly sniveling and smarmy as Justin Hammer. He's a man who, like Tony Stark, is recognized for his weapons manufacturing, but unlike Stark he has no qualms about eliminating whoever gets in his way. As the film's primary villain, Ivan Vanko a.k.a. Whiplash, Mickey Rourke (\\"Sin City\\") is creepy, brilliant, cold, and calculating in every aspect of his plot for vengeance against the Stark family and their business empire.    Now, Mickey Rourke may be a strange guy in the real world, and some could even argue a bit unstable, but one thing is for certain, he is one great actor. His performance was spot on every step of the way. For instance, unlike so many American actors, he never once appeared to struggle to maintain his character's Russian accent throughout the whole duration. This character will not garner him the accolades that his role in \\"The Wrestler\\" did, but he should be recognized all the same for continually putting terrific work on display every time he hits the screen.    Rounding out the newcomers is Scarlett Johansson (\\"The Island\\") as Natasha Romanoff, otherwise known as the Black Widow in the comic book world. Scarlett establishes her character in a humorous moment early on as being much more than what she seems, and from there we are given a character that is smart, sexy, and above all, lethal. After seeing her in this movie, I can't wait to see more of Scarlett's take on the Black Widow in future installments of this series or maybe even in some of the other Marvel franchises that are in the works.    Lastly, Samuel L. Jackson returns once more as the Director of S.H.I.E.LD., Nick Fury. At the end of the previous film, we are introduced to Nick Fury, albeit ever so briefly. Thankfully, this time around he is given a little bit more screen time, popping up every once in a while over the course of the movie. Samuel is clearly enjoying his role as the Marvel Universe's top spy, and is leaving fans wanting to see more of his character in the future films.    So, when all is said and done, without a doubt \\"Iron Man 2\\" easily lives up to all the hype. Boasting an engaging story that is filled with terrific characters, plenty of new plot developments, and incredible action scenes that are brimmingwith stunning CGI; director Jon Favreau's follow-up delivers in every way imaginable and even manages to surpass its predecessor. Not a bad day's work for a superhero.    \\"Iron Man 2\\" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.
0143038419|2.0|I just didn't care for this book.  After reading it, I feel just like I've watched one of those solidly mediocre romantic comedies (after seeing about a million glossy promos): I'm disappointed in myself for falling for the hype, & irritated at having spent the time & money.    Liz seems fun & funny--I can see why she makes so many friends throughout the course of her story--but I simply was not interested enough in her life or her journey to spend so much time with it, & didn't find her narrative voice compelling.  I suspect the book only really resonates with people who can relate to her personal situation, which is too bad, since its premises (heartbreak, eating, connecting with God & others, finding love) hold universal appeal.  I'll bet an excellent editor could have brought that out.    As it stands, I wouldn't recommend EPL to anyone who is not recovering from divorce and/or deeply interested in eastern religion.  Unless they enjoy rom com quality books.

I sat at my computer for much of the audio book, so I could look up the images to which he referred.  While I didn't need any persuasion with regard to the theories of Darwin, my details were lacking and I enjoyed learning from the good doctor in this book.  Highly recommended reading for most of us that could have used a better education in the sciences.

0307266303|5.0|I rarely have the time to finish reading a book anymore, but I MADE time for this one. This book was purchased for my boyfriend who had heard about it on the radio. He went in to our room, closed the door, and didn't come out until ours later; he finished the book in one sitting. He kept encouraging me to read it, but it just wasn't something I was interested in. On a whim, I decided to read the first chapter just to see what all of the fuss was about; I, like him, holed myself up and finished the book in one day.<br /><br />We're going to be buy Vibram Five Finger shoes and go running together. That's how powerful this book is. You. Will. Want. To. Run!<br /><br />This is not a book you check out from a library; rather, this is a book you must own.

B002HWRYJE|5.0|My husband and I are Star Trek fans. Now, we aren't the kind of fans that dress up and go to conventions, but we watched ALL the different series religiously, except the newest series.  We just couldn't get into the newest series.    We were excited when this movie came out and actually went to the theaters to see it.  We generally don't go to the theaters - we wait for the movie to come out on dvd.  We subscribe to that home delivery movie rental place.  Once we saw this movie at the theaters, I couldn't wait for it to come out on dvd so I could buy it.  We don't buy very many movies either, but this one is a KEEPER.

B001OQCV6A|5.0|This movie was not like the Sherlock Holmes I am used to.  Holmes was a little strange and lost when not working on a case.  Jude Law and Robert Downey Jr worked well together.  It would be nice to see another Holmes adventure with these two.  The old London with the polluted sky was a good touch, most people don't think about London being like that, which it was with all of those coal fires burning in every house.  They just needed to have it rain more.  But the movie was good and the delivery was on time.  I would recommend Amazon to anyone.
B002RKXO6S|2.0|Like many, I own all of Bon Jovi's CDs, have bought them all on the release date and have been happy with all of them through the release of Have A Nice Day.  This one sounds to me like they grabbed Slippery When Wet and tried to re-record it by changing a few chords and putting different lyrics over the music.  Also, after 30+ years of releasing records and touring, making millions of dollars in the process, I just don't buy into that they can relate to working a hard 40 hour work week, struggling to pay the bills, etc.  Sorry guys, I hate to give a bad review but on the heals of a very lame country record attempt, (Lost Highway) this one just came out tired & lame.
B001C3KCSY|5.0|Best new music around.  Catchy beat and lyrics - many different tempos.  I can listen to this CD over and over and not get bored.
B002ZCDR88|5.0|So you can call me a \\"fanboy\\" if you'd like. I don't mind. I have enjoyed Natalie's work since the eighties. But when I read about this latest project I was sure I would hate it. Know what? I don't. The various styles of music keep things from getting boring, and there are some really beautiful moments. Check out \\"The Land of Nod\\" for one. Does everything work? For me, no. I really don't like \\"The Peppery Man\\" or \\"Calico Pie\\". The former too bluesy and the latter too hickish. But I dig the sixties style pop sound on \\"It Makes a Change\\" and the quiet folkishnes of \\"If No One Ever Marries Me\\". You can call this a kids album and Lord knows some of it is. \\"Bleezers Ice Cream\\" is straight out of Sesame Street. But really, it was made for adults. This is the kind of thing the Grammy people love. I'm looking forward to seeing if this gets any recognition come Grammy time.
B002ZFQD04|5.0|What a great DVD/CD.  Being in Oz, we didn't get to see the Sticky & Sweet Tour (boo!) and being a fan of Madge's for over 20 years, it was great to hear her take on old classics such as Borderline, etc.  Well worth the investment!
B0021L8V1G|5.0|I usually have trouble sitting through a movie, but I didn't budge once while watching Iron Man 2. It was awesome! The perfect amount of comedy, action, and suspense. If you liked the first Iron Man (and even if you didn't) Go see it! You'll love it!
B001GCUO5M|4.0|I have said this before and I will say it again. If it wasn't for Kevin Costner, 'Goodfellas' would have recieved the best picture honor in 1990. Martin Scorcese for the past 20 years has given us some of the most meorable movies of our generation. They have a very similar theme and tend to use the same actors as well. Now, we are given 'Shutter Island', which is a step away from the usual and giving us something fresh.<br /><br />I had no idea that this film was based on a comic book, but seeing the trailers and knowing how well DiCaprio works with Scorcese I was very eagar to see how this movie turned out. The movie was a good watch, but there were a few flaws to it. Still, I don't want to rip this film because this was a brave move by Scorcese. He decided to break the usual mafia mold and give us a psychological thriller. We do have the Scorcese elements such as the large amount of 'F' bombs and the whole 1950s/1960s gangster/detective vibe which he loves to do. Still, The acting was great, especially in the every end when the truth about Shutter Island was revield. DiCaprio's performace throughout the movie was good, but bland at times until the very end. His character took a huge twist and the dramatic turn her took was just incredible it made up for the last hour and a half. The movie I felt was too predictable. I pretty much figured out what was going on about half way into the movie. As a whole package it was definitely something new from a director who's work I enjoy.<br /><br />My thoughts on 'Shutter Island', take the time to see it. It was a new step in Martin Scorcese's career I would love to see if he intends to continue trying new genres of film. While predictable it is still enjoyable.
B0021L8V1G|4.0|Tony Stark, aka Iron Man, is flying high, at the top of his game, or so it seems.  He's single-handedly managed to shut down the arms race, achieving de facto world peace, and his rivals aren't even close. Or so he thinks.  It turns out he and his father before him have made some hidden enemies along the way to corporate and personal success, and the U.S. military (not to mention nearly every other world power) doesn't like being preempted by a cocky upstart, and won't rest until they own the Iron Man suit or its equivalent.  Add to that daddy issues, frustrations at work with a frazzled overcompensating secretary and a beautiful and dangerous new assistant, and the stage is set for a classic escalation towards a massive climax.  It gets busy, and even goes dark here and there, especially when we see the super baddy evil genius Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), but never loses the playful and comic tone established by Robert Downey, Jr., his best friend Don Cheadle (Lt. Rhodes), and his incompetent archrival Sam Rockwell (Justin Hammer). For me the coolest parts of both films were the construction sequences, that make engineering complex and high power equipment look more fun than video games - as in this one when Stark gets a bright idea and remodels his entire house in order to construct a cool new energy source. Nothing profound, but lots of fun.

B000DJBEXA|5.0|For me, the masterpiece here is the haunting Fantasy in C, D. 934, with its mysterious opening and a slow movement based on the melancholy lied, \\"Sei mir gegrusst.\\" Having heard a cello transcription done in concert by Pieter Wispelwey, I found it hard to locate a comparable reading until I came upon the duo of Isabelle Faust and Alexander Melnikov.  I knew of the Russian pianist as a protege of Richter's, but of the German violinist I knew nothing. They are a lovely pair musically, full of refined liveliness, adroit in finding the hidden emotional half-tones in Schubert's apparently simple writing.<br /><br />I'm a bit embarrassed that I don't know any of Schubert's violin music; perhaps I just needed to run across readings that were this captivating. Although the Fantasy and the Rondo brilliant were written for a virtuoso duo -- so the Gramophone reviewer states -- their technical demands sound fairly modest to me. I can imagine a talented teenager getting through them with little difficulty. But it takes real musicality to find the poised intensity that lifts these scores to their modestly sublime place in Schubert's output.  Having sampled a few other readings, including those by Gidon Kremer and Isaac Stern, I don't think I need to look farther than this lovely CD.<br /><br />Here's the program: Violin Sonata, D574. Fantasie, D934. Rondo brillant, D895

0792844890|4.0|By the time of this film's release, Mel Brooks had already established himself as the master of the genre spoof film. But &#34;Spaceballs&#34; is, if not his finest hour, one of the top three efforts in his long list of satirizing comedies. And geek culture would never be the same.<br /><br />Basically parodying the original Star Wars saga, but mixing in elements of other sci-fi mainstays, like &#34;Star Trek,&#34; &#34;Alien&#34; and others, Brooks employs his twisted skills to skewer one of the most beloved and well-known franchises in movie history and does so masterfully. There are plenty of sight-gags and word play moments, as is expected in a Mel Brooks comedy. I especially liked all the &#34;Spaceballs&#34; merchandise that constantly shows up in the film. From bed sheets to toilet paper, it's one of several running gags that I never get tired of.<br /><br />It features some early work by Bill Pullman and Daphne Zuniga, who would both move on to bigger things in the future. Here, they have a perfect chemistry, as the snobby-but-yielding Princess and the rugged-but-tender hero. I like that, even before they fall for each other, they already argue like an old married couple.<br /><br />The main stars here, though, are (the late) John Candy and Rick Moranis, both of whom are staples in the world of the 80's comedy film. John Candy has some nice scenes and gets some yuks going, but it is Rick Moranis, as the evil-but-inept Lord Dark Helmet, who basically steals the show. Most of the funniest moment and lines belong to him. From playing with his &#34;Spaceballs&#34; dolls, to having his men (literally) combing the desert for our heroes, he proves that, even in a total farce, evil is always the more interesting and fun to watch.<br /><br />Many others have tried to imitate Brooks style of comedic humor, most notably Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, but try as others might, they simply cannot compete with the master. Because the one thing that Mel Brooks comedy spoofs do, that others do not, is know when to &#34;not go there.&#34; His humor is tactless, without ever being tasteless. &#34;Spaceballs&#34; remains one of Brooks best works and is certainly my personal favorite. If you love sci-fi, or if you hate it, you'll find plenty to enjoy in this film!oofs do, that others do not, is know when to &#34;not go there.&#34; His humor is tactless, without ever being tasteless. &#34;Spaceballs&#34; remains one of Brooks best works and is certainly my personal favorite.

0312370849|1.0|This book is so bad it's hard to know where to begin.    Well, I'll start with this:  All the French characters are shocked, (shocked!!!!) that Jews were rounded up by the French for the Nazis.  Please, the French were overjoyed. The Jews were gone, and the French got their stuff (the book mentions apartments, but that wasn't all, they got art, cars, jewels, everything).    Everyone is moved to tears by the sight of Sarah. Honestly, there are so many holocust stories, it's hard to feel much about any particular one of them.    Who was this book addressed to? It's not translated, so was it addressed to Americans? We know all about this chapter of French history thanks to the History channel. Maybe it should be printed in French were it will be ignored, like the signs on the street.     What would have been a very good story would be about the family that took Sarah in. Why when all their countrymen were celebrating getting rid of the Jews why did these folks risk all to save one girl's life. That's the story I'm interested in. The round-up is only the prelude to the story of these farmers' courage.

I found it such a good read that I have already passed it on and have also recommended it to a friend with a 14-year old daughter as not only a good summer read but of historical signifigance in depicting France during World War II and the French people's past and ongoing issues with Jews and the Holocaust.

1416594787|5.0|Dawkins sets out to establish evolution as a fact, and does so in grand style.  If there are any deficiencies in the work, they are sins of omission:  - He talks about radioactive dating, but doesn't discuss some of the tricks that can be used to obtain precision considerably better than the 1% which he mentions.  For example, the age of the earth is now known to be 4566 million years [1].  Also, he doesn't mention dating by other means -- such as the work with sulfur 32 and 34 which pegs the oxygenation of the earth's atmosphere at about 2.5 billion years ago [2].  - He doesn't really address genetic recombination during meiosis, which is a crucial element of genetic diversification.  - He doesn't address the fact that the theory of evolution is unique among scientific theories in that it is provably correct.  Even without this, the evidence is so overwhelming that anyone who does not believe in evolution must be characterized as scientifically illiterate.    For more on this, see [3].

B001PB3RU8|5.0|I was first introduced to Florence and the Machine by a friend, who suggested I hear \\"Cosmic Love\\". Immediately I thought of a modern Siouxsie and the Banshees or The Cure's Disintegration album. But dont take that to mean that Flo is not in a category of her own. The things I love about this album is the percussion (drums drums drums), and vocals. I also enjoy the content, with references to werewolves, ghosts, and a boy who builds coffins.    Many of the tunes are catchy, and worthy of major chair dancing while driving in the car. This album has not been a dissapointment in any way and I highly recommend it.

0440243688|4.0|In this lucky thirteenth Jack Reacher novel, \\"Gone Tomorrow,\\" Author Lee Child takes the reader along with Jack in his quest to battle evil, this time the fanatic forces from Afghanistan.<br /><br />This you-are-there trip with Jack has been thrilling, hardly realistic, but isn't that what escapist fiction is about, especially the thriller genre? Jack Reacher is retired military police, a man who sold all his possessions, after early retirement, to travel the highways and byways of America. All he carries is what fits in his pockets: a fold-up toothbrush (no paste), expired passport, money.<br /><br />I had to deduct one star from my usual five-star rating for two reasons: (1) This is the slowest starting Reacher novel, almost beyond imagining, and (2) Jack and another character try to imagine causes and motivations and possible scenarios behind the suicide which Jack witnessed during the ghoulish hours of subway travel in New York. I remember in a graduate English class studying author techniques. As I was reading, I was too aware that the author was the source of thought behind Jack's proffered ideas of what caused that suicide. A reader should not be thinking of the author's role in a suspense novel! Plus, taking almost one-third of a novel to get really into the plot was not the best idea Child has ever had. Fortunately, Child keeps enough suspense going to entice the reader to stay.<br /><br />But, man! After that one-third rather slow build-up, bam! Roller coaster! Prepare to brace yourself, Reader, for Jack Reacher then shows that fine form (physically and intellectually) for which he is so famous. Basically, the novel can reduced to these words: politics, secret missions, powerful agencies, fanatic terrorists, torture, murder, mayhem. When Jack gets involved, expect mayhem!<br /><br />Now, ahem, my objections to Jack Reacher. Although my 89-year-old mother loves Jack Reacher, I find him a little off-putting. He \\"irons\\" his clothes by putting them between the mattresses and will wear those clothes until he needs new ones. Although he is a homeless person in one sense, as he tells one character, that he's not really homeless. He travels at will, never committing to any one place. This travel is, of course, the author's way to get Jack into a new situation and novel. When Emerson exhorts us not to let things control us, Jack takes this concept and masters it!<br /><br />All in all, the Jack Reacher series is well worth the read--if thriller is your genre and if you can commit to reading an entire series.clothes until he needs new ones.

B002ZG98J6|2.0|The books are great, with a nice darker edge than the Potter series, rousing adventure, and are just flat-out fun.  The movie, however, dumps a lot of the best stuff from the books, dumbs the story down, and makes it all much more... well, I want to say \\"much more for kids,\\" though I suppose the books are meant to be for kids as well, but the \\"disneyfication\\" of the movie really turned me off.  I was so excited to see the film, but had to force myself to watch the second half, cringing all the way.  The under-10 crowd may really dig this flick, but otherwise, I'd say to skip it and pick up the excellent books.
B001R4KQDE|5.0|Sin City is one of my favorite movies. I looks and sounds good on DVD and even better on Blu-ray.
032147404X|5.0|this book came recommended to me and it met all of my expectations. It was easy to read and understand I loved it.
0439023483|3.0|I borrowed this from my \\"niece\\"/Soul Sister Caitlin C., who absolutely adores this trilogy and inspired me to read it based solely on her insightful rave review. A good work of post-apocalyptic fiction for pre-teens that strongly reminded me of books from this genre that I loved \\"waaaay back during The Cold War\\", when no one seemed quite certain that the Russians loved their children, too, and seeing War Games in the theater seemed somewhat of a generation-confirming experience (Z for Zachariah by Robert C. O'Brien comes to mind, and also, somehow, in a very different vein, the unforgettable masterpiece The Grounding of Group Six by Julian F. Thompson). The Hunger Games is harrowing, violent and heartbreaking, but any literate, feeling pre-teen should be gifted this inventive book. For young women, especially, there's much inspiration to be found in the book's heroine, Katniss Everdeen, who's as smart and sensitive as she is blessedly talented with a bow and arrow, and undaunted by the hardships of day-to-day survival in post-North America's totalitarian \\"nation\\" of Panem. I think there's an age when kids first grow wary of \\"the future\\", and this novel satisfies that innate desire to have fears aired and explored, even when they can no longer be entirely dismissed by parental units.

And you just go with the absurdness of it all. And laugh. And remember that if animals could, they would. Enjoy.<br />NOVEMBER 11.15.2014: I watched this movie the first time when I was much younger . . 67. As I am a more mature 71 1/2 year-old now. I expected to agree with the one or two star reviews that found it \\"dumb\\", \\"stupid\\", \\"mean-spirited\\", and one of the \\"worst\\" movies ever made. So whether it is my second childhood or a continuation of the first one, I loved it . . . again. I love the animals getting the best of the greedy humans. And I love Brendan and Brooke together. I hope they do it again. This movie is just for fun. The 'green message' gets through, but it's still about laughing.
B00000G3AZ|5.0|Austen DVD's hold an irresistible pull for me. I bet I can't watch just one.  Although some adaptations are more appealing than others, I found the Paltrow version of Emma, a 19th century romantic British romp, delightful.  Wonderful set decoration, costumes and lush scenery are a given.  The remaining cast members (esp Toni Collete's Harriett)are the completion to a magical Austen film.  Of course, I purchased one for a friend who is also taken with all things Jane.  Marvellous! Highly recommend!<br /><br />If you are a Jane-O-Phile these are my fave adaptations of some of her other works.<br />[[ASIN:0800141660 Sense & Sensibility (Special Edition)]] That garnered an Oscar (perhaps 2) for Emma Thompson and the ever drool worthy Colin Firth adaption of Jane's [[ASIN:B001E2JNA6 Pride and Prejudice [Blu-ray]]].<br /><br />Enjoy Jane's wonderful works!
0385340990|3.0|The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society chronicles, in a series of letters, the lives of residents of (and visitors to) the island of Guernsey after the island's liberation from its German occupation during World War II.  The book's characters are witty, noble, patrician, eccentric, unbearably cute, and sometimes beautiful.  The characters have suffered bombing, starvation, sundered families, confiscated property, executions, death camps, and the observation of Todt workers.  With the exception of Remy, these experiences don't seem to have touched the characters' lives.<br /><br />One doesn't do manual labor for forty years and remain Dawsey.  One doesn't starve and remain Isola.  One doesn't observe people being worked to death as a form of extermination and remain Mrs. Maugery.  Ms. Shaffer, perhaps, is not acquainted with the effects of brutal mistreatment.<br /><br />One doesn't come to know things from reading books.  One must \\"know things\\" to write them.
0800141660|5.0|Okay, okay, okay I KNOW I buy anything remotely Jane Austen.  I can't help myself.  I think I need a 12-Step program.

Kate Winslet, Hugh Grant and Alan Rickman are no slouches either starring alongside Ms. Thompson.  It is a wonderful British romantic romp that always puts a smile on my face.  I hope it does yours, too.<br /><br />May I take this opportunity to persuade you to enjoy [[ASIN:B00005MP58 Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E, 1996)]] and [[ASIN:B00000G3AZ Emma]].

0471267554|5.0|I learned about the Paleo Diet from a friend who had recently a heart operation.  It was so good for him that he suggested it to me.  I was not sure what it was all about so I purchased the Paleo Diet book.  The first reading was a little winded with all the reasons why the diet works but when I got to the end, I knew this could work. I followed the book suggestions and wow! the results are great. I read the book again to better understand why this all works. It is easy to follow once you get going. The web site is good for more ideas on what you can do. The only problem I have sometimes is eating out or at family outings but I keep at it.  I lost ten pounds the first two weeks and still going strong.  As recommended in the book- exercise helps a lot too. Read this book- you'll really benefit from its clear but sometimes winded reports.

B002VZC9CY|1.0|WTF????  Natalie Merchant waited years to release this album and it is a huge disappointed.  It is a hodge-podge of different types of music, but it is simply not very good.  Much like Joaquin Phoenix should stick to acting, Ms. Merchant should stick to that distinctive sound that made her one of the great voices in progressive rock.  I have given this double CD several listens.  If I want to hear zydeco music, then I will listen to a zydeco artist.

Jesse Schell does a remarkable work in walking you through all the steps and mind set you need to be in in order to comprehend all the stages of game design. the book in written in an every day simple language, and is very easy to relate to. No big mouth breaking words that you have to look up in the dictionary in order to understand what they mean. Plain and to the point, filled with lots of great examples that anyone can relate to.    The book gives you the insight of the way people think, regardless if you are a game designer or not, its a must.  11 out of 10 stars.    must read (and buy of course).
B003405MF6|5.0|I see alot of folks here do not approve of Jeff Beck's adventurousness & that he doesn't make the same album twice. Reminds me of the man who made me want to pick up the guitar in the first place, John McLaughlin. Like Jeff Beck, John McLaughlin was & still is continually evolving. John McLaughlin has gone from bebop jazz guitar (\\"Extrapolation\\", \\"After The Rain\\", etc.), to rock (\\"Devotion\\"), to electric jazz, (Miles Davis' \\"In A Silent Way\\" \\"Tribute To Jack Johnson\\" etc.), to jazz-rock (Mahavishnu Orchestra's recordings), to Indian Jazz (Shakti recordings), to flamenco guitar (Guitar Trio recordings), to classical (\\"Mediterranean Concerto\\", \\"Thieves & Poets\\"), to electronic jazz (\\"Floating Point\\", \\"Industrial Zen\\") & he has NEVER gotten stale, boring, or predictable. THIS is the mark of a dedicated musician as opposed to an artist who re-records the same album over & over & just puts a different album cover on it, then watches the cash roll in. The same holds true for Jeff Beck. Sure, he could keep re-recording \\"Truth\\" & \\"Beck-Ola\\" to please Led Zeppelin style blues & metal fans. He could keep re-recording \\"Blow By Blow\\", \\"Wired\\", & \\"There & Back\\" to please fusion fans & \\"shredders\\". He would sell a hell of alot more albums & make a hell of alot more money too. But, then again he'd be boring & predictable too. This CD has not been out of my player much since the day it was released & gets better with each listen. He could have picked a better soul singer than Joss Stone like maybe Tina Turner, but I just block her out & listen to Beck's guitar. Finally, for those here calling this \\"elevator music\\", the guy is what, 60 - 65 years old? Name me ONE guitarist his age, McLaughlin excluded, who could record an instrumental as driving, emotional, & powerful as \\"Hammerhead\\"! Every time I hear this song I picture GOD (The real GOD, not Eric Clapton) playing the guitar! \\"This is \\"Birds Of Fire\\" material here! I think that is the real problem for the naysayers here though. They expect a whole album of \\"Hammerheads\\". Variety is the spice of life & Jeff Beck NEVER disappoints in this realm! For the naysayers here, remember there is always AC/DC (nothing against them, they're good at what they do) or ZZ Top (ditto). I'll take adventurous & eclectic over retreaded glory any day! Jeff Beck, like John McLaughlin, is a \\"guitarist's guitarist\\" & a true musician, not a spandex clad clown playing the same song over & over again with the only difference being the song title! The music world needs more Jeff Becks! If I buy only one CD this year I made an excellent choice! Thank you Jeff Beck!
B000002UYZ|4.0|Beatles' music is always fantastic! Quality of this CD is excellent, even if is clearly an analog remaster. Price is a bit high respect my expectation. CD Case is nice, since is suitable for 4 CDs but used for a double CD set. It looks like a treasure.  I recommend to purchase this CD to all Beatles fans who want to listen a really good collection of songs. I suggest the second album (1967-1970 (The Blue Album) )as well.
0143144448|4.0|To use author Daniel Suarez's phrase, I am an \\"awed primitive.\\"  OK, maybe not totally primitive, but I'm not a gamer and my tech knowledge only goes so far. But I do know a rousing story when I read one, and the first half of Suarez's DAEMON had me transfixed.<br /><br />A DAEMON is a computer process that runs in the background and is not under the direct control of the user.  At the start of the story, computer genius Matthew Sobol has recently died of a brain tumor. Sobol was the head of CyberStorm Entertainment, a giant online gaming network, and it becomes apparent that he left as his legacy an incredible series of daemons with far-reaching effects. The  early parts of the book contain protracted play scenes from a CyberStorm game called \\"Over the Rhine,\\" a \\"massively multiplayer online role-playing game\\" or MMORPG. As Sobol's posthumous power builds, the gaming sessions are echoed by battles between law enforcement agencies and ... well, Sobol's Daemon. People are recruited to serve the Daemon's purposes, and their stories are threaded through the book along with the stories of those battling against the Daemon.<br /><br />The book loses a bit of its focus about halfway through. By that point the Daemon is gaining sway and the story becomes more allegorical; that's not a bad thing, but the handling of the characters becomes erratic. People come and go. The ending is really more of a beginning: society as we know it is gone, but what will take its place? The symbolism becomes even more pronounced, with the resurrection of a main character.<br /><br />In spite of these issues, both the technology and the allegory made for a fascinating read. The writing is smooth and full of unexpected fun; for example, a woman placed in the job of her dreams by the Daemon muses: \\"Her boss WAS an undead automaton from hell, but no job was perfect.\\"  There is a sequel, and I'll be reading it very soon.<br /><br />Linda Bulger, 2010
1857151488|4.0|Thomas Hardy's \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" seems to be a moral allegory.  In a moment of drunken callousness, young Michael Henchard sells his wife and daughter to a genial sailor. When he awakes from his drunken stupor Henchard sinks deep in regret, and swears not to touch the bottle again for two decades.  He searches for his family, and unable to locate them he stumbles into the town of Casterbridge where he develops a successful farming business, becomes mayor and the pillar of the community.  Eighteen years later, when his wife and daughter find him the single and temperate Mayor of Casterbridge makes haste in reclaiming his lost family, and it seems it's all well that ends well.<br /><br />At the same time a young dashing Scotsman Donald Farfrae enters Henchard's life, and the Mayor is determined to make Donald his acolyte.  It seems that the two have much in common, but Donald proves he is in fact the Mayor's polar opposite.  Whereas Michael can be both generous (he pleas with Donald to remain in Casterbridge to work for him) and stingy (he fires Donald after dancing with his daughter Elizabeth-Jane), loving and brutal, brooding and quick to anger, Donald is the model of the proper Christian businessman and husband.  Donald understands, forgives, tolerates, and endures all of Michael's impetuous insults and attacks, and he is finally rewarded with Michael's lover, daughter, business, and mayorship.<br /><br />But ultimately Michael Henchard is the protagonist of the novel, and while he is certainly petty, provincial, and proud his fall is both epic and poignant.  Michael had eighteen years of quiet prosperity in Casterbridge, but the novel makes no mention of it at all, and Michael must endure one tragedy after another.  It seems that Michael's undoing is that he thinks and feels too much.  He is quick to anger and proud of mind because he is first to love and steadfast in his loyalty; in comparison, Donald Farfrae seems cold and calculating, slowly and methodically building his reputation at the cost of Michael's.  Yes, Michael did fire Donald, but Michael had urgently pleaded with Donald to stay in Casterbridge and given him experience, connections, and a reputation:  if Donald had truly been good and loyal he would have left instead of staying to compete with Michael.  And then there's Lucetta who was engaged to Michael but eloped with Donald:  this one act proved the irreversible destruction of Michael's fortune.<br /><br />If this is a moral allegory, and ostensibly it is nothing but a moral allegory it is not certain what is being said.  Should we really aim to be like Donald Farfrae who is cold in his generosity and calculating in his fair-mindedness?  And yes there really isn't much to be said for Michael Henchard's pride and anger, but there was also something concretely good and stubbornly noble about the man.  He was also capable of reflection, and in the end he sought to do what was good, even if it meant disappearing forever.  Look under Donald Farfrae's smooth handsomeness, and you'll discover guile and duplicity.  Look under Michael Herndon's rugged vehemence, and you'll discover love and goodness.  Michael Herndon has wronged so he seeks to do right.  But having never done wrong does Donald Farfrae know the difference between right and wrong?<br /><br />\\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\" marks a revolution in rural England, as the Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution finally begin to set in.  Calculating reason and Christian piety seek to overturn the rural tempers and superstitions that have dominated the England countryside for so long, and so Donald Farfrae must inevitably triumph over Michael Herndon.

Eventually, he can \\"jump\\" into a bank vault.<br /><br />Goodbye, work!<br /><br />Eight years later, he finds that he is being pursued, slow but surely, by a group of people dedicated to purging the world of these abominations.

B001KMB6X2|1.0|I'm a Vin Diesel fan and I was really disappointed with this movie. Bad story, bad lines, and bad fight scenes.
B000IJ79WU|2.0|I DVR'd Superman II to watch with my son.  I saw Superman II with my uncle in theaters when I was a 9-year-old.  I had no idea of the controversy surrounding the Donner/Lester \\"transition.\\"  Having viewed the Donner cut without any expectations - I can say the original, in my view, is far superior.    Many interesting scenes which were pretty cool - the arm wrestling scene, the townspeople attacking (man being raised by finger beam), some of the dialogue - were removed.  I feel the additions were pretty lame and a tad sappy.    I liked the original music when the bad guys were out, and call me crazy, I liked the noises the large bad guy would make.  Although kind of ridiculous, I liked the final fight scene including the teleportation and the infamous \\"S super wrap\\" that transiently incapacitates Zod (I believe).  I feel that it gave a sense that the thee would not have been able to conquer Superman despite their numerical superiority.      The silly humor removed felt appropriate for a comic themed movie - and it makes kids laugh.  Seems senseless to take it too seriously and pull it out.    In sum, I felt the some of the action was removed and replaced with romance and redundant Brando scenes.    I want the first version back!

045122499X|5.0|I LOVED this book, savored every moment, was sad when it was done, and wish there was a third sequel. The characters are wonderfully developed, the plots and sub plots are so beautifully intricate, it's like a tapestry. I could not put it down.
1595141715|5.0|First and foremost, I will say this isn't an easy book to read.  It's not the structure but the topic that makes it tough.  As a teacher who works with at-risk kids, I think Asher definitely knows how to write a young adult book that readers just don't walk away from, at least not without realizing the story has left a mark.  The characters are realistic and by the end of the novel, you realize that you won't forget Hannah, and that you've probably known someone like her.  Thirteen Reasons Why accomplishes so many things, but the best is probably that it forces readers not just to face what is difficult and painful in life but also to take another step and think about how to live so as not to become become one of those thirteen reasons for anyone.

0142410373|5.0|Matilda Wormwood is no ordinary girl - at the age of three she taught herself to read. Since then, she has been devouring books just as other children devour candy. Books fascinate the little girl since she delights in discovering new worlds and meeting new and amazing characters. However, her parents don't seem to appreciate Matilda's vocation as they are too preoccupied with watching TV and scamming other people. Thus, when the little girl finally attends school, she is happy to have found a friend in her kind teacher, Miss Honey, who immediately recognizes that Matilda is a special child. But when Miss Honey tries to speak to the headmistress regarding Matilda's outstanding learning abilities, the cruel and frightening Miss Trunchbull doesn't believe Miss Honey, since she despises children. As Matilda discovers that she possesses even greater abilities, the little girl is determined to use her extraordinary tricks in order to defend the helpless and to fight for justice.    Matilda is such a wonderful and delightful book about a young girl with amazing abilities and a great sense of justice. This lovely book is packed with charm, intelligence, warmth and magic and I loved everything about it as Matilda delivers some very important messages to everyone out there! Matilda is a brave young girl who is ready to fight for justice at all cost; she is not afraid of anyone and is willing to do everything in order to help those who are weak and who cannot stand up for themselves. That just shows how great this little girl is and others really can learn a lot from her. I loved Matilda's courage, her enthusiasm for books and her drive for knowledge and I think that she sets a perfect example for other children.    I must admit that I have watched the movie Matilda quite a few times without even knowing that the book existed. But when I checked out Roald Dahl's books, I discovered Matilda and I was eager to read it, as I love the movie. And I am so glad that I had the opportunity to read this beautiful book, as I think that it's even better than the movie. Matilda is now one of my favorite books and I can't wait for my daughter to grow up so we can read this book together.    When I finished reading this book, I was very sad, as I wanted to read more about this little girl and her adventures. Actually, I was so sad that I had to hug this book a few times! Luckily, Roald Dahl has written many books, and I plan to read some of them in the future.    Matilda is a charming story about friendship, courage and justice, and I highly recommend it to everyone book lover out there and to everyone who wants to read a book with a positive and conscious theme.
B0035V35P8|5.0|Having rented Ninja Assassin completely on a whim (there was nothing else to see at the time) I didn't really know what to expect-but from the blood soaked first couple of minutes to the huge explosive finale, I found myself constantly having to scrape my jaw off the ground.    Ninja Assassin is a rare movie in that even a seasoned movie veteran like me who thinks he's seen it all could be shown a new thing or two.  I'm not usually a fan of ultra violent, blood soaked gore fests-but I'll make an exception here.  The blood and nastiness is warranted to really give the audience a sense of just how deadly the Ninja Clans in this film are.  Movies like these are also rare in that every single frame and every line of dialog seem to be brimming with confidence and TLC.  Obviously this was given a LOT of TLC from the director and everyone involved.  This films just absolutely reeks (in a good way) of style and class.    Surprisingly, the movie that Ninja Assassin reminds me of most is the original Terminator.  Like that film, the characters find themselves being pursued by a lethal enemy who will stop at nothing to kill them.  One is the protector the other the protected and the odds are not in their favor.  That's where the similarities end however, because honestly-the Ninja Clans in this film make The Terminator look like a complete wuss in comparison.    It bears repeating that this film is all about style.  Style, style and more style.  It's slickly done, the music is loud and fitting, it's fast paced, dangerous and thrilling.  The fight scenes are all high stakes and deadly and even the protagonist is not immune to receiving a beat down.  It's refreshing in a time of remakes, reboots, movies based on tv shows, etc to see something so fresh and original come along.  This is a great movie!
B000E5N62U|5.0|This is more than a Donald Fagen solo record,  it is more of a Steely Dan record sans the great Walter Becker, as it is literally the whole Dan touring/recording ensemble backing Fagen...that said, while it can't help but bear a resemblance to the Dan, the arrangements are free of the rock edge that distinguishes the Steely Dan sound...the atmosphere is really an updated version of \\"The Nightfly\\", Fagen's brilliant 1982 solo debut. All the meticulous imaging and fine attention to sonic detail of Steely Dan records is present, but the grooves on \\"Morph the Cat\\" are looser, saucier...the kind of thing that comes from loads of touring, and this is one crack team of players having a hell of time...Surprisingly for a Fagen record, many of the tunes are vaguely autobiographical, the focus on mortality and life in his hometown, post-9/11 New York City.  Highlights include the ultra-elegant \\"What I Do\\", which is a dream conversation between Fagen and Ray Charles, and the quirky funk of \\"Brite Nitegown\\", a clever tale of close encounters with the Grim Reaper. Like Fagen's other solo work, this record is birthed in pure R&B and jazz, and avoids rock territory almost completely...in fact, \\"Morph the Cat\\" sounds a whole lot more like a Prince record than a Steely Dan record (seriously...sans the Purple One's vocal acrobatics and penchant for both sexual innuendo and proselytizing)...the mood is lively and light-hearted and the horn arrangements are absolutely magical... Mr. Fagen's sense of humor sparkles, easily sharing the spotlight with his own prodigious and inimitable musical talents, as well as those of this truly remarkable ensemble...hopefully, another timeless Steely Dan record will emerge soon!
144867185X|1.0|Rubbish, that has been discredited by history, if not scores of economists.  This bum, contrary to some of the reviewers here, was discredited following the stagnation of the 70's, and puzzingly is being embraced again.  The pursuit of something fresh and novel and \\"progressive\\" trumped, in Keynes' mind, sound principals and irrefutable historic fact.  If you want to see the success of Keynesian economics, just see for yourself the rubble created from nearly all of the 20th century, from the early Progressive era of WWI through today---the Great Depression, the steady inflation since the 30s, the boom-bust cycles whipsawing more wildly with each cycle...  And in contrast, observe the Austrian Economics at work during the Depression of 1920-21 when President Harding resisted the siren song of deficit spending and under-consumption theory, and instead cut gvmt spending, opend-up free trade, cut tax rates (especially corporate rates)---and the Depression ended in 18 months.  Coolidge continued these great policies, and voila!---we had the roaring twenties, the greatest era of expanded standard of living, not just for the US, but for the entire world. Before the wild hey-day of Keynesian deficit spending and ready money and credit, America practiced essentially the Austrian Economics practices (although the theory wasn't articulated yet) and it begat the greatest era of increased standard of living in history---even greater than Great Britain of the 19th century (following her repeal of the Corn Laws' severe impediments to free trade).<br />I agree with the one reviewer, that if everyone read Henry HAzlit's \\"Economics in One Lesson,\\" with its clear, concise writing to the layman, then they would never again feel that the subject of economics was uncomprehensible, dense and mysterious. I would suggest a great political philosophical text as well---Frederic Bastiat's \\"The Law,\\" which is the political science equivalent of Hazlit's great classic, in its brevity and startling clarity.larity.

B001PPLJIQ|5.0|It's been awhile since I've been totally overwhelmed by a movie.  Having seen THE READER (several times, along with all the extras in this DVD), I remain officially dumbstruck.  A flood of emotions sweep over me when I think about, or discuss, this moving portrayal of guilt, shame, turmoil, anguish, remorse, tormented love--and reclamation--set in post-WW II Germany and based on Bernhard Schlink's internationally acclaimed [[ASIN:0307473465 novel]].  The story reflects Germany's relentless guilt, pain, and denial, as the succeeding generations come to grips with the horrors of its Nazi past.  Or, better yet, doesn't come to grips.<br /><br />And how is this struggle allegorically portrayed?  An affair, a summer fling in 1958, between 36-year-old Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet) and 15-year-old Michael Berg (David Kross as the youth, Ralph Fiennes as the man).  The affair is doomed from the start, yet for one fleeting summer Hanna and Michael are the fulcrums of one another's lives--especially when Michael, either before or after their lovemaking, reads to Hanna.  And he reads everything:  literature, plays, poetry; and Hanna is so very moved.  Why?<br /><br />The affair ends abruptly, and Michael moves on with his life.  As a law student he signs up for a seminar studying a war trial now taking place--and Hanna is one of the defendants.  Beforehand, Michael was firmly in agreement with his law school peers in their condemnation of the generation that was either duplicitous, or looked the other way, as Nazi atrocities were committed.  Now, he's torn, because before his eyes is the woman he once loved--a proud, stubborn woman willing to pay any price to hide her shame--and Michael, at the cost of haunting regret, does not reveal information that would aid Hanna.  Subsequently, Michael is distant, aloof, tentative, unemotional, with all his relationships--even his relationship with his daughter.  As Hanna ages in prison, Michael reaches out to her in the only distant way he knows how:  He reads books on a cassette recorder and ships the tapes to her.  The story moves on to its tragic conclusion--yet we are given a glimpse that maybe, perhaps, Michael is moving towards his own reclamation.<br /><br />Kudos to director Stephen Daldry for bringing such a complex, tragic, and cerebral story to the screen.  The cast is superb, especially Kate Winslet; this, by far, is her best role.  Extra features include interviews with the cast and crew, along with a very humorous vignette depicting Winslet's ordeal each day sitting in a makeup chair being aged more than 30 years (Winslet's wry humor definitely shows this lady has her feet firmly on the ground).  THE READER will have you talking and thinking about its haunting story a long time; a must-have for all collectors of quality cinema.<br />--D.

There is a bit of a learning curve to this program and it's exercises, but that's to be expected with anything new. These exercises and their many variations should keep us interested and making gains for a long time. Mark's approach and philosophy to fitness is new and refreshing, and it really makes sense. It departs from the conventional ways of thinking. You can't expect different results while trying the same things again and again.
B0016OM3TU|4.0|If you don't love jazz -- I mean LOVE jazz -- you probably won't get much out of this movie.  There's not really much of a STORY per se.  The cinematography is beautiful and the performances are wonderful to watch, especially jazz legend Dexter Gordon in the lead role (and a small but frenetically funny cameo by Martin Scorsese toward the end).  But what this movie is really ABOUT is jazz -- straight-ahead, pre-fusion, bop-heavy, swingin' jazz.  And not just the music, although there's plenty of that.  The film is also about the romance of jazz, embodied in the tiny, smoky underground club in Paris; the dingy rooms and corridors of a fleabag hotel, the city streets at night, booze, southern cooking, humor, sadness, love, loss.  It's required viewing for anyone who loves jazz and/or anyone who's interested in how jazz and jazz musicians have been portrayed on film, from \\"The Glenn Miller Story\\" to \\"Paris Blues\\" to \\"Mo' Better Blues\\" to \\"Bird.\\"

B002UO73Z4|4.0|This is a great package with the original album and a DVD.<br /><br />Thirty years after its release, the album itself is no mystery. London Calling is a timeless classic. Even today, it sounds fresh, lively, and relevant. Not many other records from the late 70's and 1980's can make this claim. The band pushes way beyond its punk roots, yet still keeps a sharp political edge to the lyrics.<br /><br />The DVD is mostly interesting for including footage of the band in the studio--you can see for yourself how crazy Guy Stevens was--and videos for London Calling, Train in Vain, and Clampdown, as well as a Don Letts documentary.<br /><br />So, 4 stars. If the DVD had additional live footage of the Clash from the period, this would be a 5 star package. If you're a diehard fan or a completist, look around for the 3-disc 25th Anniversary Edition. It has a full disc of demo versions and most of the video that's in the 30th Anniversary Edition.
B002ZCDR88|5.0|I have been a fan of Natalie Merchant since her days with 10,000 Maniacs.  Her new album, Leave Your Sleep, is more than one of her best albums...it is one of the best albums I have heard from anyone for the past few years.  My prediction that this will be viewed as her best work in the years ahead.    The music is simply sublime as she moves from jazz, to blues, to chamber music, and on and on.  The more time that one takes to listen to it's entirety - the more that you appreciate the vision of the entire project.    I would highly recommend this album to anyone who simply appreciates excellent songwriting, strong performances, and a finely crafted set of songs.

B003405MF6|5.0|Listening to Jeff Beck's mastery of the Strat, the way he simultaneously pushes down on the bridge with his palm, pulls up on the tremolo bar, and bends into notes with perfect pitch and control; his mature use of orchestration; the creative guitar voicings... well, to me it lends more credence that there might be aliens from musically advanced civilizations living amongst us than any Area 51, Roswell, UFO, probing accounts, lost time, and alien autopsies combined. And the voice of the lovely Miss Stone just makes it that much cooler.
B00275EGWY|1.0|I knew all about the award for best picture when I dove into this movie, \\"The Hurt Locker.\\"  I was hoping beyond hope that it wasn't a political win, like another yawn-fest, \\"The Last Emperor,\\" was so many years ago...and my hopes were shattered like fine China on the Thanksgiving floor.  I kept wishing something would happen remotely reminiscent of a storyline or at least some kind of purpose or maybe even a small lesson in morality.  But no sooner did I cross my fingers did I begin rationally contemplating \\"mortality\\" rather than \\"morality.\\"  By 1/3 of the way into the film, my eyelids grew heavy, my breathing became more shallow, and my mind began to race into the land of dreams, wrought with images and things that had much more \\"adventure\\" appeal.  I fought back the urge to sleep, though, always anticipating that moment where the ramblings of the story would all come together and scream out \\"Best Picture!  Best Picture!\\"  But like a pre-sneeze that draws you to the edge but fades away before relief, this movie NEVER came to any type of fruition.  It was like random pieces of many stories that were spliced together in a fatal attempt to try and achieve some semblance of a movie.  And what in God's name were those soldiers doing out there performing endless duties without any command?  Also, what were they doing with all that liquor?  Soldiers don't have access to that, and if they do, its frowned down upon to consume it.<br /><br />HOLLYWOOD PROPAGANDIZED NONSENSE, AND A POLITICALLY ATTRIBUTED AWARD.  I would like to have seen what the U.S. population would have chosen had they picked between \\"Avatar\\" and \\"The Hurt Locker!\\"  I guarantee that it wouldn't be this flop of a movie!

0393072231|5.0|I love to read anything written by Michael Lewis, because of his unique ability to write the concurrent stories of a particular market and the real, unknown people in the story with such eloquent precision.  Moneyball was about the development of saber-metrics, while telling the story of Bill James, Billy Beane and his inexplicable Oakland A's.  The Blind Side was about the evolution of the Left Tackle, correlated with the uncanny gifts of Michael Oher.  The Big Short is about the lunacy of layered speculative investments and the failure of the complex, synthetic financial instruments, while telling the story of the unknown hedge-fund managers who were insightful enough to predict the collapse.    Please don't look for a comprehensive textbook of the financial world, or all encompassing villification of financial managers or the subsequent bailout, because neither were the intention of the book.  However, from beginning to end, The Big Short did exceed my expectations that it would be insightful, informative and entertaining.    One of Lewis' themes is that there is no man behind the curtain in the market.  To paraphrase one of the hedge fund managers in the book, \\"we just kept wondering when the grownups would step in.\\"

B000E5N6LG|4.0|Wyatt Earp may be the most famous lawman ever to grace the Wild West, thanks in large part to [[ASIN:0671885375 Wyatt Earp:  Frontier Marshal]], an earnest biography transcribed largely from his own account.  Certainly he has long fascinated filmmakers, who have put him on the screen in such movies as John Ford's [[ASIN:B00005JLUH My Darling Clementine]], [[ASIN:B00008CMR1 Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]], and [[ASIN:6304711905 Tombstone]].  Most critics seem to think the last is the best, but I have a sneaking preference for this Kevin Costner version (he co-produced it, and buddy Lawrence Kasdan co-wrote and directed), perhaps because it's essentially a biopic: instead of concentrating, as the other three do, on the one defining incident of Earp's career, it attempts to trace the incidents that brought him there.  Much of the story is told in flashback while Wyatt prepares for his famous gunfight.  We begin in Iowa, where 15-year-old Wyatt (Ian Bohen) and his kid brothers Morgan (Scott Paul) and Warren (Oliver Hendrickson) are running the farm owned by their father, lawyer Nicholas (Gene Hackman), while their two older brothers, James (David Andrews) and Virgil (Michael Madsen) are off serving the Union in the Civil War.  (No mention is ever made of a half-brother, Newton, by Nicholas's first marriage, who also wore the blue, and a fictional sister, Lou (Alison Elliott) is added to the family, while real-life sister Adelia, born when Wyatt was 13, is renamed Martha (Mary Jo Niedzielski).)  Wyatt longs to do the same, but his father won't allow it.  After the older boys return home, Nicholas decides it's time to move on, to California; en route Wyatt sees his first shootout--and is literally sick.  Seven years later he's freighting supplies for the railroad and refereeing prizefights, in which latter capacity he is challenged to a gunfight--and wins by hurling a pool ball at his opponent.  Returning to Missouri to study law under his grandfather (Giorgio E. Tripoli),a judge, he revives a Dante-esque romance with Urilla Sutherland (Annabeth Gish), marries her, loses her to typhoid within a year, and goes on a nine-month drunk that ends when he steals a horse and is bailed out by his father.  Knowing he'll hang if he stays in the East, he goes on to buffalo hunting and meets the Masterson brothers, Bat (Tom Sizemore) and Ed (Bill Pullman), then accidentally finds his calling when, in Wichita, he's roused from his sleep by a drunk's hoorawing of the town, overcomes him when the local marshal won't, and is made a deputy.  From there he's recruited to a similar office in the booming cowtown of Dodge City, which he \\"tames\\" with his anti-firearm ordinance and the help of brothers Virgil and Morgan (Linden Ashby), and while on a mission to Texas meets the tubercular Georgian dentist/gambler \\"Doc\\" Holliday (Dennis Quaid), who for reasons of his own takes to him deeply--and Wyatt to him, despite his father's maxim that only family counts (\\"Everyone else is just strangers\\").  At last, convinced that he'll never get rich working for other people, Wyatt--by now acknowledged as the leader of the family despite his position as literal middle brother--takes his brothers, their wives (Catherine O'Hara, JoBeth Williams, Betty Buckley), and his own common-law wife Mattie (Mare Winningham) to Tombstone, with Doc and his paramour Big Nose Kate (Isabella Rossellini) tagging along for the ride.  Here he crosses swords with Sheriff John Behan (Mark Harmon) and the Clanton-McLaury \\"cowboys\\" and meets Behan's woman, Josie Marcus (Joanna Going), who leaves the sheriff for him shortly before the fight.    Though the exact cause of the enmity between the Earps and the Behan/Clanton/McLaury axis is never clearly explained (it's suggested that the Clanton and McLaury families were stagecoach robbers and rustlers of Mexican cattle, and that Behan preferred not to try to confront them, while the Earps found their conduct intolerable), the gunfight itself is recreated with close fidelity, and the whole look of the film is very gritty and dusty, as the West probably really was.  The friendship between Wyatt and the Mastersons, and later Wyatt and Holliday, is very well done (Quaid does a particularly good job of bringing his character to life).  And unlike most cinematic versions of the Earp legend, this one goes on to show what happened after the gunfight--the Earps holing up together for fear of mob action, their hearing and the dismissal of charges, the ambush of Virgil and Morgan by the survivors of the cowboys, and the pursuit of the latter by Wyatt, Doc, Warren (James Cavaziel), and several deputies.  (A closing crawl tells us that members of the cowboy faction continued to die \\"mysterious deaths\\" for years after the battle, as well as giving some information on the later lives of the Earps.)  The soundtrack by James Newton Howard [[ASIN:B000008MWC Wyatt Earp]] is suitably epic and majestic.  Though sometimes a bit slow, this is an example of what the modern Western could be if filmmakers were willing to take a chance on it more often.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Based on a true story of young man adopted by a good family and rising from his position in the hood to the top. Truely inspiring.
B001M5UDGS|4.0|Neill Patrick Harris, perhaps most wellknown in his role as Barney Stinson from the sit-com \\"how I met your mother\\", is - in the words of Barney - awesome, in the lead role as Billy, aka Dr Horrible. The title role is a super villain wannabe. In order to impress \\"Bad Horse\\" - leader of the \\"evil league of evil\\", Dr Horrible must commit an oustanding crime.  At the same time he must win the heart of his love interest Penny, a girl he has met at the laundromat, but at the start of the story not yet dared to speak to. The task is not an easy one, mostly due to his arch Nemesis Captain Hammer, the most respulsive super hero since, ... well ever. A minor role is played by Simon Helberg - known from Big Bang theory - as the moist man. He is Billy's close friend and a rather pathetic super villain, who \\"at his most bad ass makes people want to take a shower\\". The story is really funny, with lots of good songs played frequently throughout the rather short story (43 minutes). If you are familiar with the super hero genre, you will likely appreciate the humour even more. The main singing performaces are made by Neill Patrick Harris, Felicias Day (as Penny)and Nathan Fillion (Captain Hammer), who all are capable of competing well with most pure musical artists. While the story is indeed a short one, the dvd comes with lots of special features, where the most impressive one is a whole new set of good songs, where many of the actors with smaller roles gets the opportunity to show off their vocal skills. While lot of the content has been freely available on both youtube as well as the sing-along blog's own website, their is still plenty of extra material to justify buying this dvd.
B003A03RRU|5.0|This is a review for the Kindle version.     The table of contents, yes it is really is there, is nicer than the   over version(s) that I have previously bought.     So far I have found no formating errors.     And the use of font sizes looks better than other version(s).    Both of my 20 something year old sons and myself are enjoying  reading this together. My wife is about ready to join in too.     Nice to be reading Sherlock Holmes again.   And how are you going to beat 99 cents!    This is what Kindle is all about!

B002ZFQD04|4.0|I love all of Madonna's shows, but nothing ever rivaled her Blonde Ambition tour until I saw this. As soon as it opened, I knew it was going to be different, but how different was something else. Madonna absolutely outdid herself on this tour, & I can see why she went a second round with it. She had phenomenal dancers (no surprise there) & a show that was visually incredible. And what she did w/ the old faves was wonderful! But what I love most is how much she really takes the audience w/ her - & her later shows really show her \\"wooing\\" her fans throughout. She's more comfortable in her own skin than I've ever seen her & it really shines through in this show. I would highly recommend this dvd - not only to fans, but also to folks who aren't typical Madonna fans, because I know they would enjoy this concert.

0756405890|3.0|I had trouble picking a star rating for \\"The Name of the Wind\\", but ended up picking a 3, though it should really be more of a 3 1/2. I picked up this book on a whim because of the cover art, and I ended up buying it because of the prologue. This line is one of the most evocative lines I've ever read in a fantasy novel:    \\"...the patient, cut-flower sound of a man waiting to die.\\"     However, there was a problem with the book. The prologue was excellent, but unfortunately, I ended up feeling like the prologue was the most exciting part of the book. At the end of the 700 pages, I was left feeling like I had just watched a very long preview and had not yet SEEN anything to get me really into the story. Kvothe's main problem as a heroic character is that he lacks a heroic flaw. Even Beowulf had a heroic flaw--he had a hunger for glory that was hazardous to life and limb. Aragorn carried the taint of Isildur's greed for the ring. Arthur schlupped his sister. The list goes on.    That being said, I think Kvothe is a different kind of hero. He reminds me of Howard Roarke in a superficial way (genius redhead saying 'To hell with you!', anyone?). Besides that, Patrick Rothfuss wrote in his blog some time ago that he is trying to do something with his story that has never been done before in terms of structure and pacing. Thus, maybe we should not be thinking of Kvothe in the traditional sense of the fantasy hero. I don't think he's meant to be treated as one--since for most of the book he's got more brains than balls, in the literal sense, and distinctly lacks the \\"pluck\\" that usually distinguishes a young hero in the making in such books. When the book worked, I got that dreamy sense of time passing in a surreal world--the exact way I felt when I read literature like \\"The Unbearable Lightness of Being\\" or King's \\"Dark Tower\\" series. When it didn't work, I felt like I was reading a Harry Potter book. The book's main flaw was the jarring shifts between the two. The heroine, Denna, also left me feeling completely uninspired.     To be fair, I don't feel like I can adequately judge \\"The Name of the Wind\\" without reading the next and still unpublished book, \\"Wise Man's Fear.\\" This book may be a case where the first installment of the trilogy doesn't mean a whole lot because we have yet to see the nexus where it all comes together. Maybe it would have worked better if all three were published at once, or if you could print a book with all three parts in one volume. Alas, kids, that is not how the publishing business works, so thus we have \\"The Name of the Wind\\", which very well may be like \\"Attack of the Clones\\" in the context of the trilogy--the beginning volume that everybody is doubtful of until the next two come out.

B000EWBKK8|5.0|While this movie isn't the typical action flick many expect of Nicolase Cage, it is an exceptional movie nonetheless. It has a very cerebral feeling to it and really makes you think about your own opinions of the Gun restriction vs rights debate. Regardless of where you fall on this debate it is a movie worth watching.

0425218929|4.0|I received this book from a pen pal because I was looking for new books to read.  The book was great but hard to get into at first.  Kay Scarpetta is a caring and intelligent well rounded character.  I am trying not to write a spoiler.  I can say that it kept me on the edge of my seat and I was completely surprised by the ending.  I like books  that have a surprise ending much better than ones that are so predicable.  Kay Scarpetta is the chief Medical Examiner in Richmond, Virginia.  The book moves fast but not so fast that you get lost.  I learned so much while reading this book, too.  I gave it five stars because it deserves it.  No I want to read other Patricia Cornwell's books about Kay Scarpetta...
0307276902|5.0|I had heard all the controversy about this novel but I wanted to read it for myself.  What all the controversy blocks out is how much GOOD this novel/non-fiction (who cares which it is?) can do - how it can help those who have addicts in their lives, how real it is.. how important this book is, and how important this book SHOULD be.. everyone who has any kind of addict in his or her life should read this book.. and if you are an addict you may want to read it too, to find out that you are not alone, your experiences are not as unique as you think, and that there is a possibility of hope..

0753801728|3.0|This is a classic book that is part of \\"Oprah's Book Club.\\"  I gave it three stars because I do see some merit in the book.  It has been translated from the original German text.  It is well written yet the plot seems vague and loosely formed.  The style of the author somewhat reminds me of the style of The Virgin Suicides.  I know that this book is being turned into a movie, probably thanks to Oprah.  The author gives the reader some play in how we will interpret the book.  The style is different that what I'm used to but I definitely see the merit of The Reader.

B0015DROBO|3.0|Although an intriguing story, about 1/3 of this book could be eliminated and make it much more worth the read.<br />I knew the answer to the missing niece before the middle of the book, and perhaps that made it more laborious to get through the mindless banter and too detailed descriptions.

Some movies have an alternative motive, and normally you can continue to watch the movie and enjoy without a second thought.

This whole notion that we (modern America) is somehow destroying the earth or that we are the cause of all the problems is complete GARBAGE! IT IS FALSE!

B00328R21C|4.0|Nice Landspeeder!<br />Luke's Landspeeder is a nice small size set that is a good build and great playability for kid's or the AFoL recreating the famous Jedi-Mind Trick on the Stormtroopers in Mos Eisley plus excellent mini-figs!<br /><br />PRO's...<br /><br />- Overall sleek, well designed speeder. Has the right feel, proportion and shape from the movie.<br />- Nice color scheme with tan and dark red accents throughout.<br />- Left engine detail 'exposed' like the one in the movie.<br />- Hidden trunk/compartment in rear. Lift the back engine to reveal a space for the lightsabers, etc.<br />- Brick built Sentry Droid has a nice simple/effective look and is attached to 2 clear cylinder pieces on a clear base simulating it's floating.<br /><br />MINI-FIGS are just excellent. Luke with new 'wig' and brush-metal lightsaber handle. Obi-Wan as well has a brush metal lightsaber handle. Stormtrooper with laser pistol, black shoulder paltron also has a neat backpack with grey lightsaber handles as containters (use the extra black stud on top of one of the saber handles and the extra antennae from the Sentry Droid on the other handle to give it a better look and disquise the saber handles better). Great looking C-3PO and R2-D2 figures. Note on the box cover photo, they list the Sentry Droid with the other mini-figs but it's not a mini-fig but neat brick built droid.<br /><br />CON's...<br /><br />- Luke's hair seems a bit too long. Kinda' like the one from the Star Wars DK book exclusive.<br />- For some strange reason, Obi-Wan doesn't have a hood nor cape/cloak.<br />- Rear compartment too small for lightsabers. Need to take apart saber and handle to fit them properly.<br />- Bland looking cockpit.<br />- Sentry Droid NOT a mini-fig. A true min-fig must have a unique sculpt or print pattern.<br />- Another Stormtrooper mini-fig with orange shoulder paltron needed here.<br /><br />Overall I recommend this set for the young Lego builder. It has neat figures and a wonderfully designed Luke's Landspeeder. Slight mod's here and there on the Landspeeders cockpit and perhaps add more room in the rear compartment can improve the kit but regardless, this a must get for any Star Wars fan and good selection of 5 min-figs!

B001KQZ7I8|5.0|Viktor Frankl's Man's Search For Meaning lays the foundation for all of his other works as well as for his brand of psychotherapy, Logotherapy. For me it was one of those books which influenced my life forever and a book I go back to and read again.  Based on Frankl's own experiences in Hitler's death camps and on the blackness of the Holocaust in general, it offers hope. It would be hard to read this book without changing one's life for the better. Frankl was a psychiatrist, but he was also a man who suffered deeply and turned that suffering into something positive.<br /><br />Elisabeth Skoglund, author of Divine Recycling
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I was lucky enough to hear \\"Little Lion Man\\" on the radio, and thank god I bought this album based on that song, cause the rest of the album more than lives up to that catchy, soulful, folksy tune. This album is hard to explain, its got an old timey irish/english sound too it, with the acoustic guitars and banjo playing, add in the rough nature of the lead singers voice, and the energy and synergy of the backing vocals and you just have something truly amazing and new. Best new band out today by far.
B002ZG99G8|5.0|I had no knowledge of the comics that this movie was based on, so I really went in with no expectations. For me, having no expectations is a great thing as it leaves me free to just enjoy the movie. Even though the movie opens with comic book graphics, it still manages to feel fresh. The action scenes are edited in a shaky manner that attempts to raise your excitement with freeze frames that reflect the panel style of the original comic book. Also, The Losers thankfully lacked the family friendly feel that Iron Man and so many movies lately ooze.<br />Overall, it's a fun movie, with an easy to follow sequential plot. Sometimes it's nice to watch a movie you don't have to think about, and you'll get a few chuckles out of it. Plus, the soundtrack is almost another cast member, one that I'm a big fan of. Actually, now that I think about it, the soundtrack uses a bunch of the songs off of the Glee soundtrack.... hmmmm...<br /><br />I learned the following things from this movie:<br />Countries and cities of interest are labeled so as to be easily found from the air.<br />The man in charge can often be identified by a sports or suit jacket. 2nd in command may wear a vest.<br />A helicopter and a magnet can pick up a heavy armored truck.<br />When forming an \\"offensive perimeter\\" people only look up and not 20 feet away.<br />Geeky guys always wear interesting T-shirts.<br />People who have just had sex walk in slow, stuttering movements.<br />Holt McCallany may be an illegitimate Baldwin brother.<br />Surprisingly, hot chicks lie to hairy guys and double cross them.<br />First person knife fighting is essential to any good plot.<br />The best way to stop a plane is with a flaming motorcycle.<br />You can disarm a bomb by duct taping the detonator.<br /><br />Memorable lines:<br />\\"I gave you the hit him in the face nod, not the throw him off of the building nod.\\"<br />\\"We don't need seat belts, the G Force will hold you in your seat.\\"<br />\\"Clay and his unit?

B001OQCV2E|5.0|2012 presents for your point of view just what a natural disaster affects the world as we know it.  We progress from personal, to national, to world reaction to a natural disater that changes the world as we know it.  We progress from the personal, to the national, to the world reaction.  We see projected on the screen the type of person who thinks only of himself;  the type of person who thinks that money entitles them automatically to the best of everything;  and, the type of person who merely performs anything that is required of him for everyone without the expectation of money or fame - a hero.  The only action that takes place that is just slightly unbelieveable is when John Cusack stays under water an extraordinary amount of time without breathing and then appears to his loved ones as if nothing happened.
B000FGGE7C|2.0|Well, I went into this movie expecting nothing more than a silly action movie, however I came out with some very important life lessons.<br />1.  When ever surrounded by a circle of enemies, up to 700, ducking and spinning will cause them to all shoot and/or stab each other.<br />2. If the end of a movie is lacking in luster or tension, simply turn off the lights and light your sword on fire.  This will immediately cancel out any previous flaws in the movie.<br />3. If you look good naked in the beginning of the movie, there is no need to act for the rest of the film.<br />4. You know that it is a quality film when it takes almost half of the movie for you to figure out that the main characters are vampires, as evidenced by showing their protruding fangs a lot.<br />Hope this helps you make up your mind about this movie.  Was this based on a comic book or something? I got the feeling that there was a whole bunch of back story that I was missing.

B001F3FUK6|4.0|Superman Returns has had a controversial run this far on video.  The standard definition that Warner Brother's released first, was a jaw-dropping disaster (even as regular dvd goes).  The compression problems, the color reproduction, the banding and aliasing...ugh.  I had been bummed out by this having seen it in IMAX 3D where it looked positivelt luminous.  It was a flagship release for HD DVD, and the problems continued there and with it's first Bluray release in 2006.  The picture and sound were enormously problematic.  WB wisely kept track of the complaints much like Sony did on the first release of The Fifth Element. This release looks and sounds terrific.  It's not perfect, but it's not perfect in a way most people will notice.  There still is evidence of digital noise reduction (DNR), which is a fancy way of saying the picture has been smoothed out to remove compression noise and film grain.  I'm fine with the absence of compression noise, which is a technical flaw, but I love film grain because it is what lets me know it has been sourced from the original print, and it renders detail second to none.  This print still looks gorgeous for the most part.  Color and black levels are generally excellent, albeit muted, which is more to do with Bryan Singer's vision of the film.  X-Men has a similar look.  The horrible technical flaws which were so disappointing in the standard definition DVD version are gone, and this is an exciting, often beautiful print.  Some of the murkier scenes really are more to do with Singer's muted pallette.  The sound has been upgraded as well with Dolby TrueHD and LPCM.  It is an exhilarating and pulverizing soundtrack.  The jetliner rescue is just awesome.  Ambient surrounds, music and dialogue are all supber.  I loved the iconic flight between Supe and Lois.  The special effects look luminous and the music reproduction is superb.  I know there are some gripes, but this is the version to have and it is a \\"must upgrade\\" if you have theSD version.
034547581X|5.0|The movie was very good but after reading the book it appears that the movie left out the slaughter and bad luck the troops had on their way back to camp.  I spent two years in the Army in the early 70's and I thank God almost every day that this war was near ended when I was in.  The one thing that you can take away from books like this and those about Korea and WWII in the Pacific is that we can't seem to get our hands around the mentality of the enemy.  Unlike European \\"gentlemanly\\" war with a code of honor, these enemies were more like our \\"make war a living hell\\" Sherman and Grant.  Vietnam should never have been lost but we were on the road to fighting politically correct wars much like we are doing now in Afghanistan and Iraq.  During WWII we learned that the only way to defeat the Japanese was to make war so bad that they wanted to quit.  Fire bombings, nuclear bombs, whatever it took.  We lost those lessons in Vietnam and left our boys stranded stragglers for years, calling them every name in the book instead of respecting the work they tried to do.  We've now become more \\"patriotic\\" in our thinking but our gutless leaders are still concerned about making war what it is, a living hell to the vanquished.  Sorry, just mad.  This is a great book, well written and like all non-fiction books about what war is really like, a bitter sweet pill to take.  Buy it, you won't be disappointed.
1423113381|3.0|I preordered this book on my kindle so that it would come out at midnight the same day it came out because I was so excited when I heard that the author of the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series was coming out with another book, but about the egyptian gods. My friend and I waited FOREVER for this book. Well, I have to say, it is soooo not as good as the PJO series. I mean, maybe my expectations were a little high, but I don't think so. The book just didn't seem to have very much new stuff in it. All of it was reused. The wording. . . the same as the PJO series and everything funny seemed to be in the same style. It seemed a little \\"Old hat\\" if you know what I mean. I will not be buying the next book in the series. The first one was a waste of my money.
0380730405|5.0|Books like Rebecca remind me from time to time what quality literature really is. Sometimes I forget, buried under stacks of entertaining but often poorly written popular fiction.<br /><br />At first, Rebecca is strangely reminiscent of another favorite book of mine - Jane Eyre. The main character is a young, innocent, poor girl who falls in love with a rich older man. The happiness is so near, but the shadow of the man's first wife stands in the way of it. A family secret, a haunted mansion, a deranged servant, and a fire are also major players in the story.<br /><br />I've said it before, I personally don't mind borrowed themes, but only if done right. A talented writer can reinterpret and reinvent an old story, add new layers to it, and Daphne du Maurier does just that. The book is beautifully written, it is haunting, it is suspenseful.<br /><br />I also think it takes a gifted writer to make readers get attached to a character as insecure, jealous, and timid as the second Mrs. de Winter. Daphne du Maurier succeeds once more. The main character is very compelling and her fears are palpable. I found myself sharing the heroines insecurities (after all, why shouldn't she question her husband's feelings toward her if he treats her like a child, a pet and doesn't make an effort to let her know where he stands in regard to his first wife?), being scared of and intimidated by Mrs. Danvers, and taunted by the memories of the first (possibly superior) wife.<br /><br />Rebecca is simply a great book all around, deservedly a masterpiece of English literature and from now on - a new favorite love story of mine, to be treasured and kept near Gone With the Wind, Jane Eyre, Pride and Prejudice, Wuthering Heights, and The Thorn Birds.

It's romantic, funny, dark, with danger and sadness but is hopeful. And for me, the musical score just tied it together. Composer Andrew Powell of the Alan Parsons Project fame, teamed up with producer Alan Parsons to write a clasical/rock music score with orchestral interludes that hits and brings out the enhanced emotions that the move unleashes.

That is what they do, so stop pretending that they should be YesELPcrimsonbuggles. They are Asia.<br /><br />3) They are not as good as the 1980's.<br /><br />In 1982 the critics hated even the debut hit \\"Asia\\" because it was too much Pop and not enough Prog. These guys have gotten better with age. Wetton and Howe are both better than ever.<br /><br />Additionally, the \\"prog snobs\\" should hate it. In fact, they hate most everything that has melody, harmony or sounds good. Make no mistake this CD is well written, well performed, pure rock ear candy.<br /><br />If you are an Asia fan, you already have the CD. If you are a casual fan and can't decide...buy it NOW! The music is classic Asia with better than ever sound quality. Listen with headphones and be prepared to be carried off to pop/prog heaven that only Asia can deliver. It just sounds good, check it out.<br /><br />Wetton is singing better than ever, and as always the driver with his cutting bass. His amazing voice has gotten even richer. You cannot mistake the Steve Howe sound, and it is evident on every track especially \\"Emily\\" where the Fender slider is played flawlessly by the master. Palmer is spot on as always and because of the mix really cannot be appreciated until you don the headphones. Downes fills the canvas behind Howe Wetton and Palmer. Downes, as always, is awesome on this CD.<br /><br />On any CD I look for 2 to 3 strong tracks. Omega delivers 5! All 5 are airtime ready, but won't get any. The haunting \\"There Was A Time\\" features Wetton and has a Court of the Crimson King sound and is the best \\"Proggy\\" song on the CD. \\"Finger on the Trigger, \\"Holy War\\", and \\"Listen Children\\" would all be hits if these were the 1980's. That said ALL TRACKS ARE VERY GOOD. Buy this CD. NOT The DOWNLOAD. GET THE REAL SOUND. (Rip it only if you must jog)<br /><br />***** Track Ratings*****<br />1. Finger on the Trigger *****5<br />2.

1423101472|5.0|The Last Olympian is a great finish to the Percy Jackson series.  Similar to the other books in the series, The Last Olympian gets right into the thick of the plot from the get go and keeps your interest throughout.  However, you should expect another teen read with a lack of in-depth character or plot development.  Overall, it's a very good read that will make the time fly and keep you wanting to know what's going to happen next.
B000002J2F|4.0|When this album was originally released in 1980, it seemed interminably long (55:11) for a single LP. Today of course, there is an unwritten rule that almost every new release MUST be the equivalent of a double-record set, so length is no longer an issue. In spite of the fact that this album contains two serious clinkers (\\"Heathaze\\" and \\"Please don't ask\\" are both blatently solo material and should never have been included), this really is one of the best Genesis albums. If one takes into account the songwriting, atmospheres, and instrumental performances, Duke's overall strengths lose nothing when compared to albums such as Selling England by the Pound, A Trick of the Tail, and Abacab. While musically speaking it's mostly upbeat and up-tempo, Phil Collins' divorce cast long shadows over the lyrics. There is a somber austerity in the delivery of the cathartic vocals in the midst of the pervasive wall-of-sound din that make this a Genesis album like no other, and one I never tire of hearing despite its shortcomings.    When looking at Duke, many people focus on the hit \\"Misunderstanding\\" (Toto, anyone?) and the increasing number of \\"relationship\\" songs. The real highlight, however, is the unlinked suite, originally intended to run continuously on one side of the album. \\"Behind the Lines\\", \\"Duchess\\" (which Tony Banks always cites as one of his all-time favorites), \\"Guide Vocal\\", \\"Turn it on again\\" (a minor hit in 13/8), \\"Duke's Travels\\" (which contains the last traces of the older Genesis swirling keyboard textures), and \\"Duke's End\\" were all performed together on this album's subsequent tour, and are all among the strongest material the band has ever done. To the best of my knowledge, the storyline and/or themes have never been elaborated on, and it has never been explained why the suite was dispersed among the rest of the album's songs. Another highlight is the forgotten masterpiece \\"Man of our Times\\", where Phil howls out a cryptic Mike Rutherford lyric and absolutely bludgeons his drums into utter submission.    Aside from the previously-mentioned clinkers (and I should mention that \\"Misunderstanding\\" and \\"Alone Tonight\\" only just barely qualify as authentic Genesis songs), there is another problem with this album: the sound. Even with the best remastering technology money can buy, one can't change the fact that this album was recorded with an overly bright bass response, huge multilayered keyboard chords, blistering cymbals, thundering drums, piercing guitar tones, and roaring bass pedals on almost every song. Turning the volume up to 10 (as the performances merit) will endanger the possibility of having normal hearing for the rest of your life, but also risk any breakable items that are in close proximity to the rattling walls. The original analog tape this album was recorded on is completely overwhelmed and this will unfortunately affect your listening experience. The band did recognize this problem and proceeded to a much more stripped-down approach with the following album, Abacab. Future albums were recorded digitally and this would never again become an issue.    So yes, this is a classic but with conditions. Please also note the first use of a drum machine on a Genesis album, setting the mood for the magical \\"Duchess\\".
B000BRBA8S|5.0|At the core of `2046' (the sequel to the ravishing `In the Mood for Love') lies that provocative question.  Can one truly love another and receive the same burgeoning love in return?  One may quickly respond in the affirmative, but one must really sit back and question what their idea of love really is.  When watching `2046' it almost because too obvious that no two people can love one another in the same way, thus proving the point that no true form of love is reciprocated.<br /><br />Sobering, I know.<br /><br />In `2046' we once again follow the character of Chow Mo-wan (thankfully played once again by Tony Leung).  The film takes place a few years after the affairs recorded in `In the Mood for Love', this time focusing on Chow's affairs with a number of women.  2046 is a hotel room number.  We first see this room when Chow accompanies an old acquaintance, a beautiful woman who is later stabbed by a jealous boyfriend.  On a whim, Chow offers to rent out the room, only to take the room next to it, 2047.  Over the next few years the room 2046 becomes somewhat of a symbol for Chow's determination to find love.  Through his interactions with three women (a card shark named Black Widow, his landlord's daughter, Wang Jing-wen and a beautiful prostitute named Bai Ling) we discover many sides to Chow but also discover the root of this film.<br /><br />No two loves are the same, thus no love can truly be reciprocated.<br /><br />2046 thus becomes the focal point of a work of fiction Chow writes to reflect his own emotional feelings.  2046 becomes a year, a year where everything stays the same, a year where many people travel to regain lost memories.  2046 represents the love that Chow felt for Su Li-zhen (his love portrayed by Maggie Cheung in `In the Mood for Love').<br /><br />While I found Tony Leung to be truly effective, I also found him to be a canvas on which his female co-stars painted their elaborate pictures of self expression.  Gong Li, Faye Wong and the brilliant Ziyi Zhang were all phenomenal here.  Zhang especially is all sorts of Oscar worthy here.  It's a shame that the performance getting all sorts of Oscar awards buzz that year was her weaker `Memoirs of a Geisha' performance.  Here she is utterly astonishing, carrying the emotional cavity of her character without every losing the flirtatious quality that made her mysteriously engaging.  Wong also holds her own VERY well, creating a woman who is young and naïve yet enticing.  Li is always marvelous, but what she does here with such little screen time is unforgettable (that breakdown against the wall...OMG).<br /><br />While I don't think that `2046' is as strong as `In the Mood for Love', I must say that this is a perfect compliment.  It takes that films burning desire and amplifies it with luscious sequences that burn themselves into our minds.  Director Kar Wai Wong's stylistic approach to his work is in full effect here as he creates unforgettable imagery that perfectly compliments the emotional gravity of his story.<br /><br />Pain has never looked so inviting.Zhang especially is all sorts of Oscar worthy here.

B00328G4V6|3.0|This is Jimi Hendrix, tracks that would have fit perfectly onto the albums released in his lifetime.  I was disappointed by hype that said \\"shows Hendrix going in a new direction.\\"  Well, no, not a bit.  Exactly the same level of distortion, exactly the same riffs, exactly the same voice, same trippy but usually nonsensical lyrics:  exactly the same Hendrix.  The one difference is that I would say he is clearly more confident about his voice than in his early work.  His voice is still what it is, though, not a great one.    I had a hard time rating this.  If you're a Jimmy Hendrix fan, this would be a five-star release, and do rush right out and get it.  If you're not particularly, if you appreciate his skill and acknowledge his influence on the rock genre but don't particularly like his sound, this is just more Hendrix, easy to skip.  I confess I'm in the latter group.  Were I to put all his work on my MP3 player and shuffle it, 45 minutes in, it would qualify as torture.
B00288KNLS|5.0|Last year was rather wonderful when you consider the smart and engaging animated films that were released.  Between the Oscar winning `Up', Anderson's crack at animation, `Fantastic Mr. Fox' and the ghoulishly fantastic `Coraline', you have a spectacular year in this field that reigns supreme as the best of the decade.  While probably my least favorite of the three, `Coraline' is still one of the better films of that year and a definite must-see for any film enthusiast.<br /><br />In tone, this film is far different than the other two I mentioned.  In fact, all three films are so different, and I think that is another reason why this year was so great in this field.  We were offered a variety of films that excite and entertain and appeal to different sides of our cinematic taste.<br /><br />`Coraline' is dark and moody.  The production design here is simply flawless, brilliantly capturing the mood and feel of the film without going so overboard as to appear clunky and campy.  The attention to detail, whether it be with the characters or with the surroundings, is astonishing to look at.  Above all else, `Coraline' is a visual feast.<br /><br />Still, looks aren't everything.<br /><br />`Coraline' tells the story of a bored little girl.  Having just moved to an old house with her work obsessed parents, Coraline finds that she has nothing to do and no one to do it with.  Her parents are so confined to their work that they disregard Coraline as seemingly unimportant and her only companions are either crazy (the circus fare she lives beside) or annoying (a strange kid named Wybie).  When Wybie finds a doll that resembles Coraline, things start to change.  Coraline finds a secret door that eventually takes her to an alternate world where she has `other' parents, perfected variations of her own.  Coraline loves being in their company, but when they attempt to make her a permanent part of their lives things turn a tad ugly.<br /><br />The emotionally chord behind `Coraline' involves the struggle to find balance in that parent/children relationship.  On both ends we can find ourselves working against unity.  It is apparent that Coraline's parents don't consider her feelings enough (they seem almost harsh on the outset) but it is also apparent that Coraline is your average selfish teenager (or pre-teen).  Sometimes we have to take a step back and see things through the eyes of our parent or our child in order to find that unity; meeting halfway so-to-speak.  Coraline learns that the hard way, but better late than never.<br /><br />Visually stunning and emotionally profound, `Coraline' is smart and charmingly creepy.  It is not a film for everyone, and some children may find it a tad scary (some adults may even find it a tad scary), but that is the point of the film.in that parent/children relationship.

B003HC8ITI|1.0|Saturday afternoon - Matinee showing of Alice in Wonderland.  I had seen the 1951 Disney production of the same name, and I had some hopeful expectation that, now, in 2010, we might enjoy that light and humorous story again, but with updated animation, sophistication, and more contemporary cultural sensibilities.  After a week of long and demanding hours at work, I was enjoying a sunny Spring afternoon in town, and I had decided to amuse myself by going, as I used to do in quieter and more innocent days, many years ago, to a Saturday matin&eacute;e, with all of my accustomed associations of inspiring adventure.<br /><br />I left after a half hour into the film.<br /><br />I believe that my loss of interest was in part a result of the fifteen minutes or so of trailers before the movie started.  Morris Wolfe, analyst of contemporary culture, in the 1970's, referred to JPM's (Jolts Per Minute) as an important factor in the marketability of entertainments.  Now, after having been subject to the visual, auditory, and physical bombardment of those fifteen minutes of trailers, I was thinking that, in 2010, the marketability factor had been accelerated to MJPS -  Mega-Jolts Per Second.  By the end of those trailers, I felt thoroughly beaten down into my seat, never to recover, until eventually I found my way again out into quiet daylight.  As the smash-bash-roar-boom of the trailers subsided, and the more peaceful introduction to the feature film - Alice - began, I found myself fatigued and numb.<br /><br />Then the movie: It started pleasantly enough; however, in the early minutes of the script's unfolding, it seemed that the film was intent upon introducing a young audience to a variety of the more common, uninteresting stereotypes.  Immediately we were introduced to a physically unattractive and personally unpleasant suitor, to a dictatorial mother-in-law, to a caricature of a spinster aunt hopeful of marriage and so an object to be ridiculed, and so on.  Yawn.<br /><br />Once Alice followed the White Rabbit down into Wonderland underground, the story disintegrated entirely into a stream of stock, gratuitously-violent, animated action-flick sequences, much of which was entirely an introduced fabrication and had nothing to do with the story as written.<br /><br />After seeing this mess, I believe that the production companies use the same basic animation sequences repeatedly, in film after film, just re-programming their computer graphics to change the appearance of the characters and settings.  We might as well have been watching movie versions of computer game superheroes battling intergalactic monsters.  Who cares?  Nobody over thirteen, I doubt.<br /><br />What a wasted opportunity!  That a story with such potential to be presented with subtlety and gentle humour should be made into a technically run-of-the-mill mass-production mish-mash of shallow gimmicks!  It gives one reason to despair once again of any hope for quality in popular entertainment.<br /><br />Lewis Carroll, in spiritus, to protect our young from the woeful impression that a cultural classic such as Alice in Wonderland teaches value in gratuitous violence and shop-worn stereotypes,  might wish to take out an injunction, or sue to shut down this thoroughly compromised, but also uncompromisingly mis-representative denigration of his work.<br /><br />I didn't like the film.te Rabbit down into Wonderland underground, the story disintegrated entirely into a stream of stock, gratuitously-violent, animated action-flick sequences, much of which was entirely an introduced fabrication and had nothing to do with the story as written.

The book flows extremely well; the character development wonderful.<br /><br />This particular story is about a young woman named Libby, who is the lone survivor of a brutal killing, where her two older sisters and mother were murdered. Libby escaped thru the bedrm window and fled into the woods. It was January in Kansas so Libby lost a finger and some toes from frostbite. She later testified against her older brother \\"Ben\\" and accused him of murder, which he was convicted.<br /><br />Fast 4ward to the present. Libby is in her early 30's. She's a loner, moody, selfish, depressed, and a kleptomaniac. She has lived off of a charity fund for the last 20 some years, but people have since forgotten about Libby - the lone survivor of bloody massacre. Her money has run out and she is desperate for more. The idea of getting a real job, of functioning in the real world scares her to death.<br /><br />Out of desperation she decides to take a man named \\"Lyle\\" up on a strange offer. To come and speak with members of the \\"Kill Club\\". A club that obsesses on gruesome mass murders and tries to come up with theories on who-done-it. The members all believe that Libby's brother is innocent and try to convince her of this. They offer to pay her cash to travel around Kansas and Missouri speaking to various players from the past that may be involved with the murders. Libby is sad and desperate enough to do it.<br /><br />So the book begins with her heading to her brother's prison. A brother she has not spoken to in 20 some years. Thus a huge can of worms is opened. The rest of the book follows Libby thru a few weeks of searching out various players. With each person she finds the questions get bigger, the mystery evolves. Meanwhile the author allows you to see thru Ben and their mothers eyes \\"Peggy\\" on that fateful day and night of her death. Inching you closer and closer to the truth.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys murder mysteries or thrillers. Even physiological horror.

0634022296|5.0|For those of us who own good acoustic guitars and can play a bit, this book is terrific. It simply shows you the chords for (I think all) of the Beatle's tunes in keys which mirror the records. The chords are \\"friendly\\" voicings for acoustic guitar, the chords that bluegrass players and dorm-room folkies play routinely.     My only quibble is that the book does not indicate the number of measures for each chord; rather, it is assumed that you can already sing the songs, and that you know \\"how the songs go.\\"

B0021L8V1G|5.0|Amazing movie especially as far as sequels go! Downey did a perfect job, although I don't think there is anyone in the world who would doubt that he would be anything less than perfect in this film. The chemistry with Pepper was great, which is rare in movies-- even more so in comic book movies. Personally, I thought Terrence Howard being replaced with Don Cheadle was an upgrade. The banter between Rhodes and Stark was fantastic. Mickey Rourke did not disappoint as Whiplash. Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer was a home run. He almost steals every scene he's in. I was particularly impressed with his role in this film. All in all the cast was great. I attribute this to the brilliant direction of Jon Faverau. The story was clever and unique thanks to the genius who wrote the screenplay for \\"Tropic Thunder\\" Justin Theroux. All around great movie. Absolutely recommend it to anyone-- not just comic book people.
1400052173|5.0|I found the book a remarkable read. The author encapsulated the life of Henrietta's family and a daughter's desire to learn more about her mother and her cells despite not having benefit of higher education. It also gave insight to fear of family members not wanting to know or understand the gift the mother's cell had given the world through her death. It was unfortunate that her gift was not able to provide medical assistance for her family.    While unfolding this story, Skloot told the journey of the cells and shared the legal arguments over ownership of tissue samples which still appears to be an issue today.    Enjoyed the read so much that I purchased other copies and gave them away.
B002ZCDR88|5.0|Natalie Merchant is a rare phenomenon.  An independent artist of long-standing commitment and self-direction in the areas of  her interests - with an extraordinarily set of high standards for all she produces.  This double CD set is the quirky product of  both the constraints and freedoms of time spent with her baby, and the soaring possibilities of someone who financed herself a multi-media artistic and intellectual endeavor that a studio would never have gotten behind (although now she apparently has a two CD deal initiated through this effort).      She has put children's nursery rhymes (none familiar) and poetry to music- each   piece involving different musicians with a 24 hour time frame in which to manifest her vision into reality. Along with an 80 page book to illuminate. All I can say is that although the concept (and often the words) seems simple the resulting pieces will reveal themselves over time to possess a richness and depth that will fulfill any Natalie fan, of which there are legions. And  for those not familiar with her long history, from lead singer of 10,000 Maniacs at age 17 til today at 40, who might have a baby or young child - here's hoping that somehow you run across this double CD as children's music, and expose both you and your children to this deeply rich, pure, clean soul - Natalie Merchant!

By modernized I mean they changed the characters dramatically from the old legend so that we, the people of the 21st century, can relate to and sympathize with. This show is definitely not for Arthurian purists, but it's an addictive fun watch for those of us who like to suck up to fantasy tales with handsome gallant princes and magical beasts.     Merlin the protagonist became the dorky dweeb with a kind and responsible heart instead of the all-wise, all-knowing old gray wizard we knew about. He's the your-average-geek with elvish ears, high cheekbones and mystical blue eyes. Prince Arthur is the typical kind of school bully, who also looks very much like a high school jock (although obviously much older), with record-setting sexist blond hair of any Arthur in any on-screen I've ever seen (and believe me I've seen quite a lot). Morgana is the fashionista with attitude, or, in modern terms, the perfect feminist; she's beautiful, she's a fighter, and she's not afraid to speak her mind and constantly go against daddy tyranny (what girl wouldn't look up to her?) and finally Guinevere is the down-to-earth schoolgirl who also can stand up for herself. Lancelot is the down-to-earth sweet guy that'd be your kind of perfect date.     So basically, the addiction comes from the fact that we see these kinds of people every day. It's almost the Merlin version of Shrek, slightly less cheesy. But the good news is that these actors all know what they're doing. The cast is composed of mostly brand-newcomers but they are indeed very talented, especially Colin Morgan (who plays Merlin), and Bradley James (who plays Arthur), both of them thankfully have most of the screen-time. As the show moves on we discover that Merlin isn't as geeky as he looks, and Arthur can very much be princely when it matters. Those two steals the show, and their chemistry--some call it gay some call it bromance--however you interpret it, is torching.The older cast is not bad either. Dear Giles from Buffy turns into his dark side. But you can't quite state whether he is good or evil. Mostly what you can say is he's \\"wavering\\" like any sort of politician with massive power. Gaius became the mentor of the show, not only mentoring Merlin but Uther also. Well, you always need a good mentor to get the show going, I guess.     The show is with many plot holes, something they need to work on for future seasons. but season two is definitely better in terms of character development--their strongest quality with this show    So with all that's said, I'm going to start the \\"rant\\"--the one thing that I think the show can do without:  The cast choice of Gwen  The problem:  I'm sorry to say this but Angel Coulby is really a miscast. Casting her as the future queen of England is wrong on so many levels that it's distracting to say the least. Many have complained that the actress is, let's face it, simply not attractive to match for the magazine model Arthur. Some people have tried to defend her by accusing perfectionist--that it's good that they casted people without perfect looks. Puh-leaze, why then make Arthur a hottie? Other people say she is pretty you're just used to European beauty. Even if that's true (believe me it's not, she wouldn't have been any prettier if she were white), it's still such a pain to have to hypnotize myself into denial of her (un)beauty.      But I do have to say that this is not the main problem I have with her. My problem is the fact that the maker of the show is trying to do the overkill Cinderella story (which in my opinion is not only a naive way of looking at relatinships, but believe me it never works) WITH race. They casted a whitest white guy you could find, with blond hair blue eyes, and attempt to match her with a black girl. The whole message is literally screaming out: \\"hey look! WE ARE NOT RACIST! and oh, if you even dare say anything bad about the cast choice, you are just a racist!\\" This REALLY isn't necessary, every time I look at Gwen the first thought that popped into my head is not her unattractiveness, but \\"HEY THERE WEREN'T ANY BLACK PEOPLE IN MEDIEVAL GREAT BRITAIN!!!\\" Making Guinevere a black girl is as ridiculous as making her Asian, or Native American, or Indian. What's worse is that, if the writers follow the original Arthur tale with Arthur and Guinevere and Lancelot, which they do seem to, Guinevere will eventually betray Arthur after their marriage. Then the whole racism issue simply backfires.        I have mentioned above regarding disdain of the Cinderella story that the writers chose with Arthur and Gwen and that it's a naive look of relationship (as many re-tellings of the Cinderella story have pointed out). Why? because realistically speaking, relationships last longer when the two people have more things in common than the commonly misguided and false stereotype: \\"the opposite attracts.\\" Because youth/beauty, passion, and romance will eventually die out, and what's left is partnership. If the husband and the wife can help each other out in career and in family life, the relationship tends to last longer. Which is why people from different social classes rarely will get along, especially not back then when the gap is so huge--Princess Diana ring any bell? And surprise the blackness of Gwen landed her a maid. In fact, I predicted that this is what the writers are going to use for an explanation of the break-up between Gwen and Arthur, and we are all suppose to sympathize with them-that when they are married the reason why Gwen ran away with Lancelot is because Arthur had to always put country first and she would feel out of place. Which can only make it even more cliched and unbearable. In fact, this is the reason why the romance between Arthur and Gwen is such a forward leap and unconvincing to say the least, as many have already pointed out. Do they really have ANY common language or chemistry? I think not.     Yes yes Iknow it's just a show and not historic documentary, it's still not an excuse, and I still have my freedom of expression, so deal with it.     Overall it's an enjoyable show, and if what I pointed out above is not something that bothers you, all the better.
B002C2XXJY|4.0|Good music at a really low price and after listening to this CD, I liked it. The title song is what is the best on the CD. I'm looking forward to future cd's by Demi. Definitely, recommended to anyone who likes pop-rock!
B002N8A14M|4.0|The Griffin iClear arrived quickly and well packed.  While it is advertised for the Nano 5G, my earlier generation nano fits the case well enough for use - the face controls are slightly occluded, but functional.  I am using a set of Sony headphones with a 90degree plug and not experiencing the connection difficulty some other reviewers had.  The case is not waterproof, but keeps the nano far enough from my body and the band that sweat damage is not an issue.  The armband fits well and has room to grow or shrink (21inch bicep); it is elastic enough to stay in place without discomfort.  I have yet to wash the armband, but it appears that the hook side of the velcro will be fully engaged by the pile side and won't be snagging clothing in the wash.  Bottom line - easy to use, great value and I would definitely buy it again.
B000L3CHC0|5.0|This is a great Watch, and I guess that a good vendor. Everything was on time as they said, even sooner and in perfect condition.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|It didn't look funny.  The previews were just \\"meh\\".  I mean, c'mon, the guy from the Soup?  And Chevy Chase?  He hasn't been funny in decades.<br /><br />But I gave it a chance, and I'm very glad I did.  The show is quite awesomely hilarious.  From the snarky and mean (but of course with a heart of gold) Joel McHale to the befuddled (and thankfully reigned in) Chevy Chase, to the downwright weird Danny Pudi as Abed, the Sheldon-like (Big Bang Theory) movie-obsessed and socially awkward savant, there's a great group of people that will make you laugh.  The rest of the study group (I'll switch to character names b/c I'm too lazy to look up the actors on imdb): Shirley, Britta, Annie, and Troy are also pretty funny.<br /><br />The crown jewel is, of course, Se&ntilde;or Chang, the Asian spanish teacher.  He's hilarious.  And I love how everyone (including Chang) calls him \\"senior\\" Chang (rather than the correctly pronounced \\"sen-yor\\").<br /><br />There are a ton of little touches here and there that add to the depth of the show.  Shot in the grittier non-sitcom style and with a surprisingly large number of \\"background\\" characters (Dean Pelton the gay chancellor who so wishes he was running a *real* college, Star Burns who has, well, sideburns the shape of a star, et al...).<br /><br />My review turned into just character name-dropping, but there's so much funny stuff to write about each one of them (again, me: lazy).  I just can't get enough of the show, watch it!
B002TL0S46|5.0|In 2006, i wrote a scathing review of the remix album, it wasn't what I expected from my favorite group. Yesterday I bought the IPod version of this album (why pay for the greatest hits again)? I just started to listen to some of the remixes, Mea Culpa, The Gravity of love, wow, what an improvment and I haven't even heard the rest. I wish these folks would put out an album every month. They are so unique. If you haven't gone to be with someone you really care about when you go to bed without listening to MCMXC A.D., you and she/he are missing it completely. Get this one whether on Ipod or here, you won't be sorry.
0307269981|5.0|While I enjoyed the first book, it seemed to drag on with lots of set up and didn't really pull me in till the middle. The Girl Who Played with Fire had me from page 1. The characters are amazing - you love them, you hate them, but either way, you care about them and need to know how their lives play out. The mystery, as with the first book, is smart and creative and keeps you guessing till the end. I can't wait for the 3rd book and am saddened every time I think of what an amazing author the world has lost.
1423113381|5.0|First off let me say, this was a present for my 10yr old son, but after \\"glancing\\" at the first few chapters I was hooked! I read the whole book in a day~it was That Good!  My son was not a fan of reading until he found the P.J. Series. I read them as well, it was wonderful to discuss them with him.  HE would read during the day & I would read them at night...then the next day it'd be alot of \\"I can't believe that!\\"  \\"didn't see that coming did you?\\" etc   For a mother of 3 boys it was very nice to have a \\"secret common interest\\". The Red Pyramid is just as good.  Also, I found the writing style very intersting, and not at all hard to follow. Great book! Only problem is waiting a year for the next one
B00382S9V4|5.0|The latest version of the Steve McQueen classic.  This is a very well done update of this cat-and-mouse game.  Both Brosnan and Russo are radiant in their roles and play off one another beautifully. This is a very enjoyable movie, the Blu-ray is excellent although this is not a film that really needs it.
B001OQCV6A|4.0|As a devotee of the Sherlock Holmes novels, short stories and Jeremy Brett TV serials, I couldn't even picture Robert Downey Jr. as the Great Detective. If anything, he seemed better to play Watson and let Jude Law take the lead. But I suspended disbelief and bought the DVD and am very glad I did. The experience is very similar to a Trekker who resists director JJ Abrams' 2009 version of Star Trek with young new faces as Kirk and Spock. But that worked, too. It's not your father's Star Trek and not your grandfather's Sherlock Holmes. But director Guy Ritchie gave us enough of the Holmes canon to satisfy and plenty of new twists to entertain. Thumbs up.
B003E48AYC|5.0|This movie is so awsome and original!!!!!!!!! love it, so fantasy, adventure, action, peril and suspense. Totally fantastic, Tim Burton.
B000P0J06K|1.0|What an awful movie!  This is an insult even to the somewhat silly original Batman TV series.  At least the Batman I grew up with was motivated by and expressed noble ideals -- not just revenge, or childhood trauma, or a twisted sense of self-righteousness.  And he was always in control of his emotions and knew what to say, unlike this peculiarly neurotic version, who goes from extremes of cool confidence and rationality to wishy-washy sentimentality, to downright bizarre fits of vicious temper.<br /><br />In this movie, Batman and Bruce Wayne don't even look like they could be the same person.  As another reviewer pointed out, Wayne is a rather short, unattractive guy with a personality disorder.  (Also, what in the world happened to Robin?  You won't even hear about him in this movie.)<br /><br />The Joker, although well played by Jack Nicholson, is WAY over the top.  His pre-Joker persona is a mean guy with a huge ego and certainly amoral, but the similarity ends there.  He later behaves with much more perversion and cruelty than the original, so much that I think this movie should have been R-rated.  Kids under the age of 16 simply should not see the gory things he does to people for fun.<br /><br />Speaking of kids, there are many PG-13 movies that are OK to show to 10-year-olds if you can caution them about an occasional bad guy, language or immodesty.  Not this movie.  Don't even think of showing it to a pre-teen.  Not only is there a fair amount of bad language that is unnecessary, and the specter of Batman's sudden descent into a casual sexual relationship (even with a beautiful girl, it's still embarrassing); the violence is egregious, scary, perverse, often nonsensical, and overdone.<br /><br />The original Batman might well have fallen in love with and kissed a beautiful woman, but he was also a gentleman and would not have slept with her on the very first date (at least not if kids might find out about it) - and then hung from the ceiling for a bit before moving to the sofa during the night - and then walked out on her for a funerary rite!  Bizarre and troubling behavior, to say the least.<br /><br />I am very sorry I bought this DVD, even though it was dirt-cheap.  (I am going to be a lot more careful about Amazon reviews from now on.)  If you're looking for a good comic-book superhero movie, get \\"Superman\\" instead.  It's a much better movie, especially for kids.the night - and then walked out on her for a funerary rite!  Bizarre and troubling behavior, to say the least.

068987474X|2.0|Ladies,<br /><br />Even though the book does make some decent points here and there, I really hope you will not make it into any kind of \\"live by\\" code.  According to the authors, any time a guy takes a little too long to make a move, or take it to the next level, or does not call you all the time, or you're not having enough sex, its all because he's not that into you. Well you just took 80% of the guys off your list.  And the only ones left are the ones that know the game in and out, have no problem picking up women and probably have no intentions for a long term relationship anyway.  In short exactly the types you are trying to avoid.<br /><br />The author Greg gives an example that he calls his wife 4 times a day because he can't live without her, and if your guy doesn't call you all the time to tell you he loves you then he's just not that into you.  Are you kidding me??????  First of all, not all guys are the mushy sensitive types and a lot of us just do not enjoy talking on the phone about nothing.  That does NOT mean they are not into you.  Second, it's ok to call your wife 4 times a day, but if you will call a girl that you are just interested in, or just started going out with 4 times a day, you give out a vibe of a clingy, jealous, controlling mess waiting to happen to say the least.<br /><br />Another thing I want the women to keep in mind is 50% of guys don't really know what the hell they are doing. While you are there with your girlfriends analyzing his every move, there is not really much to analyze.  You are asking yourself why he didn't call yet, while we're being told by books for guys and by our friends not to call the next day because she will think you are too needy (see the problem here?).  So no, its not that I am not into you, its just I am trying to navigate this mine field called dating world without taking a wrong step and blowing it with a girl I really like.<br /><br />The book does not really offer any advice to women that send questions and stories (I am not sure if those stories are real).  Paraphrased story: \\"I went out with a man, slept with him but he never called me back even though he said he would.  Is something wrong with me?\\"  Answer by Greg: \\"No, he's just not that into you.  Keep looking because there is that perfect man out there somewhere who will love you and appreciate you for the hot stuff that you are\\"  Mmm, how about telling the truth so she knows exactly what's going on. I'm sure a reply like this would give her a better insight into where she's going wrong \\"Yes sweetie, it is you.  How about next time you wait until the third or fourth date to sleep with a guy and see if that helps.\\"<br /><br />I think that women might get a distorted picture about men from this book.  Yes, some obvious common sense signs should be always looked for to realize when the guy is not into you, but in most cases give a guy a break and a benefit of a doubt.<br /><br />Yes may be he is actually busy and not just saying that because he doesn't want to see you.  Yes may be he did just got out a bad relationship and wants to take it slow. And no, there is absolutely nothing wrong with a woman asking a guy out; its your life, would you just rather just wait around until a guy you like asks you out or just come up to him and ask him if he would like to get a cup of coffee sometime and see what happens.<br /><br />I really don't think that a comedian (Greg) and a 45+ years old woman who has never been married in her life (Liz) are qualified experts on relationships.  When Liz was asked in an online interview why she's still single she said \\"I guess because I haven't met the right person yet.\\"  I'm sure writing off every guy that does not perform to the standards of your \\"code\\" might have something to do with it.those stories are real).

B003405MF6|4.0|Jeff Beck rarely disappoints. This is another good album by what I consider to be the best British guitarist out there. He just gets better and better. His originality is just incredible. Lately, he seems to have developed a knack for picking songs with lyrics and changing the lyrics into instrumental voices that only he can capture. Somewhat reminiscent of what Santana did with Supernatural except Beck is still Beck. I've often said he does not need a singer. Buy it you won't regret it.
0307455874|5.0|This is a very good read written by a man who is both articulate and thoughtful. The Audacity of Hope is Barack Obama's look at the United States and what makes up the country and it's issues.<br /><br />The book is an easy read full of interesting observations and at times it is quite thoughtprovoking especially when discussing the issues faced by Blacks in America. Some of the passages on The World Beyond our Borders are downright frightening.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|This seson is even better than the first one. In this seson we get to see more action, peril, drama, battles, friendship and a bit of romance between Richard and Kahlan. Plis dont make this series disapear, Continue makind all the other sesons. This is the only tv series that i love soo much, plis abc continue with a third seson dont make us legend fans be disapointed, We need more!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0007PALZ2|5.0|Over the years, film producers and directors have tried to explain/use time travel in films. J.J. Abrams, creater of \\"Lost\\",\\"Fringe\\" and the new reboot of \\"Star Trek\\" has put time travel in these three projects and has done a great job. Time-travel can be very complex and confusing but if done right it can make for a great film.    \\"12 Monkeys\\" is about convict James Cole (Bruce Willis) who is sent back in time to get information on a deadly virus that wiped out the majority of the human population. When sent back, he is sent back to far in time and ends up in a mental institution where he meets Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) and Jeffery Goines (Brad Pitt). While at the mental institution, Cole tells Dr. Railly that he is from the future and about The 12 monkeys. She like everyone else thinks he is \\"nuts\\". Cole eventually goes back to the present day.   Realizing that Cole was sent back in time to early, his supervisers sent him back again, this time to the correct year. Now, in the correct year, Cole once again runs into Dr. Railly and Jeffery Goines who is the leader/founder of the 12 monkeys. Dr.  Railly remembers him, and realizes after seeing the WWI bullet in his leg that he is indeed from the future and believes him.    This may sound confusing to one, but the film does a great job of explaining things.  If you like a movie about time-travel, Science fiction or a film that makes you think. You will enjoy \\"12 Monkeys\\".

1439153663|5.0|THE KITCHEN HOUSE<br /><br />It's 1791 and a young and terrified orphaned Irish white girl, Lavinia,  ends up living on a tobacco plantation.  She has no memory as to how she has ended up here; all she knows is that she knows nothing -- not who she is, where she is, where is is from, or if she has a family and if so, where are they?<br /><br />Thus starts out easily one of the best books I have had the pleasure of reading.  Lavinia is rescued from her horrible ordeal on a ship travelling from Ireland.  Having met with tradgey on the ocean crossing, once Lavinia makes land fall she is rescued and taken to Tall Oaks by Captain Pyke who is the owner of this beautiful place.<br /><br />One would think that the Captain would take in a little and young white child to be raised as his own with his family, but Lavinia is put to work as a slave.  She is sent to live with the other slaves who work and live on the plantation.  She is nursed back to health by Mama Mae and Belle. Slowly but surely as she regains her strength, Lavinia grows to love the slaves and they become her own family.  While not mistreated by the Pykes, she is still just another little slave girl to Captain Pyke and to his wife, Miss Martha.<br /><br />The story is told by two main characters -- Lavinia who loves her new family not caring that she is white and they are black.  Mama Mae, Belle, Fanny, Sukey, Ben, Papa, Uncle Jacob and many more slaves, all care and totally love Lavinia and look out for her.  They are all one big happy family.  Belle is the other main character who tells her side of the story from the slavery point-of-view.  Both Belle and Lavinia's stories are honest, painful, compelling, and make this book the page-turner that it is.<br /><br />But life is not a bowl of cherries for those living and working on plantations in the late 1700's.  Rankin, an employee on the plantation, is a mean, cruel, heartless drunk and uses his power over the slaves.  He makes their very existence miserable, using and abusing the women and beating the men for whatever reason he deems necessary.<br /><br />The Captain and Miss Martha have two children, little Sally and Marshall.  Lavinia is kept a respectable distance from these children, yet their lives will become intertwined and involved as the years pass by.<br /><br />Life on the plantation is never dull.  The story is full of twists, turns, ups and downs.  We read about murders, mayhem, love, secrets, births, deaths, drug and alcohol abuse, love affairs, shocking and revolting conditions put upon the slaves, and much, much more.  Sometimes the story line was so exciting this reader could not turn the pages fast enough.<br /><br />I was cheering Lavinia and her black slave family on from the very start.  Their warmth and love for each other was equal to their devotion and loyalty to Miss Martha and the Captain.  The characters were life-like and convincing and certainly people you would love to have known.<br /><br />Lavinia's arrival at Tall Oaks changed the lives of everyone who lived there, some for the better, some for the worse.  Her story, along with the story of all the other folks who lives came true on the pages of this book, are ones well worth reading about.  This book comes highly recommended.<br /><br />Thank you!<br /><br />Pamting the men for whatever reason he deems necessary.

0140067477|5.0|This book is a delightful little read - it aims to put Taoism in practical and friendly terms by looking at Whinnie the Pooh, and succeeds at this.  The writing style is engaging and makes for a fast read.  If there's any down side, it's that sometimes a slight bitter tone from the author comes through at.  But all in all it's a very worthwhile read; I've read it twice and have recommended it to several friends/family.

0671027344|5.0|This fantastic book should be a must-read for every high school student. Chbosky's novel is only 213 pages, but in that time he manages to make the most cynical reader cry and the most depressed reader laugh. Constructed as a series of letters to we-don't-know-or-really-care who, we are introduced to Charlie. He is smart, introspective and quite certain he will be a high school loser. After two seniors take him under their wings, Charlie finds it more difficult to fly under the radar. This novel about what it means to be a friend and how humans process pain--even when we don't know it's there.

0812973992|3.0|I enjoyed the book but don't understand some of the superlative reviews found at this site. It's a beautifully written book but very, very dark.
141690977X|5.0|I found the book informative and quite correct in how to interpret the way men act when they are involved with women. One of my daughters had already read it, the other had not(I wish she had also read it and, at least after seeing her situation spelled out, had the courage to act on the advice from the book).

B003ELOQCA|5.0|I watched this show when it was broadcast live on utube and it was absolutely hands down great. I actually liked some of the songs more so live then the actual recording. The recording quality as it was broadcast was exceptional and I think it is probably becuase of the technology behind the scenes used during the concert. U2 utilizes 2 mixing boards one for edge and bono and one for larry and adam. I was amazed the clarity and sound for a live broadcast show. This show is truly amazing to see and is worth the cost. If you are a fan of U2 music you will enjoy this show. Do not bother with the live from slane castle or mexico concerts. vertigo show and Live from boston are very good also but this one is top of the pops baby!
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I just wanted to add my warning about the Chinese bootleg copies of the set. I bought one and the seller was very good about a refund and it was difficult without opening the box to know it was a fake, although the ink on the back panel was faded. As soon as you pull the CD covers out, you'll know you've been burned. The sleeves are thin and cheesy, the covers themselves are badly glued, and, worst of all, the discs are STEREO. My guess is that any new set priced under 100 bucks is a fake.

B0011UJMK2|3.0|Set at the end of the Stalinist era in 1953 Russia, Tom Rob Smith's \\"Child 44\\" is a thriller that is at its best making real an Orwellian world of double speak where blind obedience smothers any sense of free will.<br /><br />The state creates its own reality and constructs its own logic. If you are a suspect, you are guilty because the state does not make mistakes and therefore does not suspect those who are not guilty.<br /><br />Imagine living under justice system where if your spouse or someone in your family is suspect, you become a collaborator unless you agree to corroborate. You live in a society where \\"to stand up for someone was to stitch your fate into the lining of theirs.\\" The golden rule becomes: trust no one.<br /><br />This is the Kafka-esk backdrop for investigator Leo Stepanovich Demidov, a decorated Russian war hero and rising member of State Security, who is ordered to look into the death of a young boy whose body is found in a Moscow train yard. The State has ruled the death a horrible accident but the boy's parents believe their child was brutally murdered. Leo is sent to convince the parents that fate and not treachery led to their son's death.<br /><br />It becomes apparent to Demidov that the boy's death isn't an isolated incident. The inspector learns of other cases with gruesome similarities. In each of those deaths, the young victim is found with a string tied around an ankle and their mouth stuffed with dirt or debris. Despite being warned off by his superiors, Demidov pursues unanswered questions until ultimately he is treated as an enemy of the State and exiled to a country village. Still he continues to seek the truth.<br /><br />It's at this point well into the second half of the novel that the story falls apart and veers way out of control with events and situations that warp any sense of credulity. An extended scene in a boxcar transporting Demidov and his wife Raisa is especially far-flung and verges on the wacky with the feel of a comic book shoot-em-up. The book at this late point is crying out for an editor. Just how many times, for example, can a character \\"clamber\\" up, down, headfirst, underneath or around something before the reader says enough, already with all the clambering.<br /><br />When the author is in control, \\"Child 44\\" is engrossing and provocative. It vividly creates a tightly enclosed world where tyranny subverts hope and possibility of human interaction. It's a thrilling story when it's working. But when it jumps off the track, it's a wreck. That's too bad. There's much promise that in the end goes unrealized.his late point is crying out for an editor.

B002VPE1B6|1.0|As an avid movie collector and having an extensive collection of movies in my library (I have over 200 titles on Blu-Ray, DVD and LaserDisc), I have never been so disappointed in the quality of the content on a disc as I was with this one. I knew this was not a `Special Edition' or 3D version. (Personally I thought the 3D in the theater was more of a gimmick that was more of a distraction and took away from the movie, but that is just my opinion.) I preordered this disc and was eagerly awaiting being able to see it on my home theater setup without the distractions of people's cell phones going off, people talking, kids throwing popcorn etc. The one good thing I can say about this disc is they didn't include any of the typically annoying trailers for other movies at the beginning, so I guess that is a plus. After watching the movie and went back to the top menu, I found no bonus material. Then I thought they may have put in on the DVD, so I popped that in and realized it had nothing either. That was a major disappointment to me.<br /><br />In the past when I was transitioning from LaserDisc to DVD, I was pleasantly pleased that a majority of DVD discs came with some `Bonus' content. On LaserDisc, bonus material was not very common and was usually only available on special editions because it required additional discs to store the content which of course made them more costly. When DVD came out with vastly larger disc capacity, bonus material was pretty much a given and studios began putting the time and effort into producing the DVD's with lots of bonus material.<br /><br />When I started buying Blu-Ray, the trend was identical to the DVD in including a decent amount of bonus material. With Blu-Ray's huge capacity, there is absolutely no reason why studios would opt to not include any bonus material except for pure greed! I still think overall the transfer was very good but I wish I had waited and bought the special edition when it came out.
B000EQH2QK|5.0|Shakira is a wonderful lyricist, This album is one of the best written i've heard in a long time and it's filled with wonderful beautiful reflective ballads. I guess the reason all these people gave her mixed reviews is because they were excpecting to hear a Hip shaking Romper of an album due to the worldwide smash single \\"Hips Don't Lie\\" and the salacious album cover.  Instead we find here a wonderful mixture of pop/rock diddies that send tingles up and down your spine due to the sweet melancholy and rawness of her voice and the sincerity of the lyrics.    I applaud Shakira for making an English album full of actual music instead of crossing over to most of the trash that plagues American mainstream radio these days.    I absolutely love this album and enjoy every minute of it. Every Lyrics, Melody and dulcet Harmony.    Thank you so much for this album brilliantly written album Shakira!! I Love you!    My Top 5    1. Your Embrace  2. Don't Bother  3. Dreams For Plans  4. How Do You Do  5. Costume Makes The Clown    This album is not for the weak minded, Approach it with an open heart and you will be rewarded.  Phenomenal. A Must Get!!
0060254920|5.0|Maurice Sendak's book, Where the Wild Things Are, is one of his finest piece of work.  I loved the illustrations and the use of humanistic  features on his characters.  The story if full of imagination and wonder and lets the reader into a world of fantacy and concludes with a bit of reality.  It is a true classic of children of all ages.
B000T05R90|4.0|Just looked up Wikipedia for album details and...annoyed. Seems there was a 2nd 40th anniversary edition of this album, which had three cds. Turns out I've got the 1st anniversary edition, with two discs. My cd contains a mono version of the album and on the second disc a stereo version. Honestly, I wasn't thrilled that I was 'forced' to buy the album with a mono disc on it and listening to the mono I'm still as unthrilled about it as one can be. What's the point? Having said that, the 2nd anniversary cd sounds more interesting...the third disc has out-takes, alternative versions and their first singles (in mono). That sounds better than what I have, but it still has the pointless mono version of the original album.  The sound quality on the stereo cd is excellent and well done. My only gripe is for the way the song \\"Pow R.Toc H\\" was handled...for an extended period you hear just a piano playing and only on one side of your speaker/headphones. It doesn't sound stereo at all. It sounds like faulty mono! That's the only stuff up from my point of view...could have been done better for that passage.       To the album...really, it would be quite easy to give it 3/5 for the - at times - childish lyrics and tunes...or the musical meanderings which border on the absurd or obscure. However, it has to be said, this is one Hell of a listenable album, which makes rating it difficult. Songs become catchier on further listens. For that reason, I'm leaning more towards giving this album 4/5 than 3/5. Since I'm the kind of person who has to listen to a cd if I bought it, I was 'forced' to listen to the mono disc. Basically, I've listened to this album more times as a result of there being two versions of it, than I otherwise would for cds I listen to in order to review them here. At no point has it become a chore to listen to this album. There are albums I score higher than this that I would be more reluctant to listen to often than this Pink Floyd debut. If you like whimsical pop, psychedlia, experimenta etc. then definitely check this album out. It's a tragedy that Syd Barrett became afflicted with mental health issues...his schtick on this album was intriguing, and it would have been interesting to see if he could have developed and become more polished as an artist.      Best track:      Flaming - whimsical, fantasy lyrics...sort of English theatre folk music. Has cool female backing vocals. There's a harpsichord type instrument and what sounds like a bicycle bell later on. Don't mind the melodies in this and the vocals and guitar strums.      The rest (in album order):      Astonomy domine - N.A.S.A. type radio chatter and effects at the start. Arty lyrics and very English singing. Crisp sound quality, e.g. drums.  Unlike Beatles stuff I've heard (pre remasters), there really isn't a issue with the 'faux' stereo...the stereo quality is good to my ears.    Lucifer Sam - bassy, moody organ. Bit menacing. About Syd's cat, presumably. Sort of jaunty track with catty noises on the guitar.     Matilda mother - features the organ and I don't mind its melody and that of the vocals. Arty/fantasy lyrics...bit obscure. Has some harmonies and some silly sounding high notes one time, but generally the song is pleasant in general at times. At the end, the vocals are percussive.     Pow R. Toc H. - has some experimental percussive vocal noises....kind of like scat. You hear a scream on this song which sounds similar to what Pink Floyd would do later on their classic album \\"The wall\\". This is the track which has the faulty mono sounding passage featuring the piano. A misjudgement, in my view. Anyway, the piano sounds jazzy. Features the organ. I don't mind the guitar notes. Has some unintentional  distortion...don't think you hear it on the mono version of the album.    Take up thy stethoscope and walk - tinny drums open up the track. A jammy type track...listening to the mono version of this song, the jam seemed quite Doorsy...but maybe that should be vice versa.  Bassy, with American sounding vocals, perhaps.    Interstellar overdrive - a 9:40 minute long instrumental. Starts off with a conventional rock sound by the album's standards, then goes jammy...you could view that part as being self-indulgent. At times you hear annoying 'chicken' noises being played on the guitar for a while. Might be glitchy for a bit, a bit before three minutes in, perhaps. Psychedelia. There are some annoying 'widgy widgy' sounds near the end of the track (I mean the sound bouncing from one speaker to the next...trying to sound 'cool' or something). You don't get that schtick on the mono version of the album though.    The gnome - childish lyrics, whimsical and absurd. Nice strumming and later you hear a xylophone type instrument, I think.  Comes across as the kind of song Ringo Starr would have sung with The Beatles.    Chapter 24 - slower track, obscure lyrics. Pretty keyboard playing...bag-pipey at times?  There's a little distortion on the left hand side of the speakers.    The scarecrow - interesting drumming on this track...starts off as a percussive piece with keyboard.  The keyboard style reminds me of MGMT's debut album...similarly simple keyboard melodies. More childish type lyrics (you can view these lyrics as being of the sort an adult would read to a very young child). Outro has some symphonic isntruments...viola or cello perhaps.    Bike - carnivalesque music with childish lyrics. Pipe-organ features, perhaps. Harpsichord type instrument too. Piano. The chorus seems unrelated to the verses as the verses seem unrelated to each other. As a result, the chorus stands out more. Whereas \\"Interstellar overdrive\\" had chicken noises,  this song has geese-like noises. The outro is a soundscape.      Recommendations:      Cream - Wheels of fire. Also has some lovely songs which have a children's story book feel to them. An all time great album.    MGMT - Oracular spectacular. Has some simple yet catchy keyboard riffs. Interesting album overall.
031606792X|5.0|I loved the characters so much it couldn't have ended better. What a wonderful story.
0307454541|4.0|Stieg Larsson wrote a trilogy of books all surrounding one mysterious, eccentric girl: Lisabeth Salander.This fact, though, is not clear at the onset. The reader first becomes in engaged in the novel because of corrupt Vanger family.<br /><br />Harriet Vanger disappeared decades ago, and her rich uncle is sure that someone in the family is guilty of foul play. He hires journalist Carl Mikael Blomkvist to discover the truth, and Blomkvist accepts because he has no other choice. He has recently been indicted for slander, all because he wouldn't reveal a source. Blomkvist travels to an isolated town in northern Sweden to solve the case, but, of course, he can't without Salander.<br /><br />Salander is unlike any mystery character that I have ever met before. She appears sporadically in the beginning of the book, but her scenes are so engaging that you long to know more about her than the author tells. Salander has to endure more than just solving a murder, and the crime that happens to her is very difficult to read about.<br /><br />All in all, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a fascinating book, and one that I am sure many will enjoy.
B0035WTE2U|1.0|AC/DC has never been a band known for selling out but they do it here big time!    Now I'm not naive enough to not realize that, these days, CDs are dead and you've got \\"spread the brand\\" and so on. But this album is totally absolutely pointless. Except as a cash grab.    As a long time fan I gave them the benefit of the doubt because the album was not a greatest hits package, it didn't have a single new song to entice fans with a library of CDs to buy songs they already have. And, most importantly, the album served a second function as it tied into the Iron Man 2 movie.    WELL, IT DOESN'T!    You hear 2 and only 2 of the 15 SONGS on this CD in the film! Shoot To Thrill at the very beginning. Highway to Hell over the end credits! AND THAT'S IT!    Let me repeat, YOU WON'T HERE THESE SONGS IN THE FILM!    This renders this \\"tie-in\\" nothing BUT a cash grab and I thought the band was better than this. I wonder, actually, how associating themselves with a movie they are not part of even helps \\"spread the brand\\". As you don't hear the songs in the movie, folks are not likely to come out of the theater humming any of them. This rip-off could just as well have been called AC/DC Avatar or AC/DC Shrek. There is no blending of anything here.    Cheap, rip-off, cash grab... terms I never thought I'd associate with my favorite band.    So, if you're a long time fan, you don't need this album. If you're an Iron Man fan, you don't need this album. Bottom line, unless you've always been curious about the band and want to pay to hear songs you can hear free on youtube, then shell out the big bucks and listen away.    Great songs! Cheap gimmick!

B0016K40KY|5.0|I was in my teens when this film hit the big screen. I recall watching it in a theater on a hot summer's day. By the end of the movie, I was well and truly parched, and when I hit the pavement in 100 degree plus temperatures, I was wishing I'd brought a canteen full of water! It was a stunning movie in the early 60s and decades later it still is. Back when VHS was king, I had a huge home entertainment center with the latest technology. I spaced my large speakers way out on either side of the set and enjoyed listening to the camels bray from right to left. Well, like a lot of other folks, I'm upgrading to HD TV and Blue-Ray. Yep, I still have legacy equipment that works just fine, and I can't bear to send it to a landfill, so I have various set-ups in various rooms for guests and party poopers who don't want to watch what I do. I'm waiting for this to come out on Blue-Ray, hopefully with two or three discs at a reasonable price. For those who are bitter about Sony winning out with Blue-Ray, there are numerous Blue-Ray players out now at an affordable price that also upscale regular DVDs. If you began watching SD TV on CRT sets, you won't mind at all. I recently purchased a 9\\" portable DVD player for my wife, and was disappointed to find it didn't support Blue-Ray. However, the option to pick up affordable two-disc sets (one Blue-Ray, 1 normal DVD format) allows the use of legacy machines and loan the DVDs. I know, you end up with extra clutter to track and store, but it's an option. I use an analog to digital converter with my computer to transfer VHS and other formats (including the old RCA capacitance disks) to DVDs. Picture quality is bearable with an upscaling DVD player. I can tweak the sound using an included software package, if I have to. I'm not a techno-geek, either. If you love classic movies and want to utilize legacy media, it's pretty easy. It does take some extra time though, so if you're a plug-and-play type, this is not for you.    As for the sour grapes reviewers who think the movie isn't true to Lawrence's character, give me a break. Go sulk amid the \\"Seven Pillars of Wisdom,\\" and remember that this is entertainment, not a documentary. For that, visit the History Channel. For those of you who want to see a really special film, fire up your widescreen HDTV, crank up the volume, have a lot of pitted dates on hand, and plenty of fluid. Keep the sunscreen handy. It's damn hot out there on the Anvil of God! Cheers and good viewing.    May 2010 Update - Well, after setting up the new 42\\" LCD and Blu Ray player and being wowed by Avatar (not the story or script, but the visual quality), I went online to see what was out there on Blu Ray, and have to agree with the folks who are bitter about Sony - for this reason - I took a look at all the junk that's out on Blu Ray, and the crap that's just being released (minus a few worthy entries), and am PO'd that Lawrence still isn't out on Blu Ray. I don't know what the licensing or ownership issues are (if any), but if Sony's sitting on this one, someone ought to kick their butts. I'm not spending money on \\"Beevis Falls in Love, Drinks Beer, Belches, Passes Gas, and Gets the Beautiful Girl,\\" all in glorious Blu Ray. What a waste of time and money most of this dreck is.

0671688782|5.0|We purchased \\"Holding Time\\" by Martha Welch on a recommendation from a counselor.  Our son, adopted from China a year ago, had been struggling to get over a hump in emotional development.  The suggestion was a good one.  Welch describes discovering the power of holding working with autistic children whose behavior dramatically improved with holding and who were able to go on to lead perfectly normal lives.  Her theory was that holding could provide increased attachment and more stability in the mother/child relationship for \\"normal\\" children as well.  Story after story demonstrate more fruitful relationships and better behavior with less need for corrective responses. She has used it with her own children.  I am not even done with the book yet but have already seen huge advances with our emotionally unstable adoptive son.  Welch's views are secular but also hold true to Biblical perspectives.  It saddens us to think that the book is out of print already.  We am so glad that Amazon cooperates with sellers who still have this.
1433502402|5.0|When my 10+ yr old Life Application Study Bible came apart at the binding, I decided it was time to get a new Bible. I wanted to switch from NIV to the ESV because of the great things I had read about the accuracy and readability of the translation. I'm very happy I made the change.<br />After owning this new Bible for a month, I have nothing but great things to say about it. The quality is as expected and I anticipate years of use without trouble. The study notes and book introductions are great and I find the overall setup pleasing.
