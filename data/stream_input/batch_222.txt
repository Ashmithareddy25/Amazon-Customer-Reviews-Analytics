B000003BEV|5.0|Listen...if you've NEVER, EVER purchased a Stone's cd in your life, don't buy this one quiet yet! No other album they've ever put out sounds anything like Satanic Majesties and does not reflect the Stones general sound. So if you've never listened to any of their albums, and you listend to this and for whatever reason didn't like it, more than likely you would never bother w/ the Stones again and you would be missing out some other really great music. If you already own some Stones cds than by all means I would reccomend you to pick up this one.<br />Satanic Majesties Request is not a bad album at all! I was born almost 20 years after its release (mid-80s) so if I can listen to and actually like it, im sure someone else more familar with psychedelica would love it!  It does sound sorta dated (most psychedelic albums do) but thats kinda the fun part. Satanic Majesties has this real rockin edge (esp. Citadel) that the Beatles Sgt. Pepper's lacks. The Sgt. Pepper's album was..~Deep~ this isn't. It got negitive reviews because it wasn't ~mind-expanding~ but I don't think something has to be mind expanding to *sound* good.<BR>The best songs are Citadel, 2000 Man (which is probley the best and most underrated on here!) 2000 Light Years and She's A Rainbow.   Sing This All Together (See What Happens)  has hardley any lyrics and details an acid trip, I guess...not a bad track overall:) There's a few songs like Sing This All Together and In Another Land, that im pretty sure would almost be illegal today for somebody (my age) to be caught listening too, but I don't care! On With the Show, and The Lantern which make absoulty no sense, but are just fun to hear. Regardless of what most reviewers are saing, I think Satanic Majesties describes the whole psychedelic 60s experience way better than any other record of 1967. Sgt.Pepper's was really organized and controlled, Satanic Majesties is a complete trip! Totally disorganized! Its actually a great record ya know? and if your anEXPERIENCED Stone's fan, then buy it!
0441172717|5.0|The main problem every science fiction write has to face is to completely outline a futuristic world without being obvious about it. Even historical novels face a lesser problem; the worlds they describe are at least partly known to the readers. It takes quite a balancing act to tell a story and describe the future at the same time, both plausibly enough to achieve a suspension of disbelief, and in enough detail to fire the imagination of a true sci-fi buff.<br />I thought Asimov had done it brilliantly in the Foundation series - told a great story and at the same time shown us a future universe. (though I felt he faltered after the first three). I read many other books describing different futures, but never really came across another rounded, complete universe description. Star Wars had it, but it was a movie. <br />Then I read Dune. The one thing that struck my dazed brain at the end of the novel was the sheer complexity of the worlds described here. Somewhere down the line in a complex tapestry of what I can only think of as a period drama was a futuristic universe of incredible richness. Here it all was - incredible landscapes, unheard of technology, well-rounded characters and incredibly dramatic situations. And it had one thing that Asimov lacked - religion. <br />A true future universe is always going to have some component of religion and mysticism; Frank Herbert evokes this in fantastic ways by borrowing freely from Islam and other religions to give a texture to the political plots that really elevates Dune to classic status. <br />The only complain I have; I bought the collected volumes, and its far to fat to read comfortably in bed.
0743424425|5.0|I don't know what I can say about this book that 200+ reviewers haven't already said, but as a life long horror fan, I have to say this is probably the most frightening horror novel I've ever read. It set a new standard for the genre and no one has surpassed it since, including King himself, in my opinion. It is an unforgettable journey into madness and supernatural horror. When I turned the last page, I felt as though I had just washed up on the shore of the river Styx. If you are one of those people who have put off reading it because \\"you've seen the movie\\" then I implore you to pick it up. It's an experience you'll never forget and a modern classic.
B0000033P2|5.0|Lo digo esto porque siempre me he preguntado que habria pasado con estos seores si no se hubieran unido, Greg Lake era famoso con Crimson, Emerson mas o menos con The Nice y Carl Palmer con Arthur Brown, asi que al unir sus talentos crearon una de las grandes maravillas musicales de los setentas, gozando de la fama maxima junto con otros mounstros progresivos como Yes y Genesis entre otros, asi que para muchos esta es la obra mejor realizada por este trio de genios que llenaban estadios y auditorios y que eran capaces de hacer giras gigantescas, algo hoy mas raro de ver, asi que la fusion de talentos como la inspiracion sublime de Lake ayudado en muchas veces por el gran Pete Seinfield que Robert Fripp se dio el gran lujo de desechar, increible, Emerson para muchos el mas grande organista de todos los tiempos, capaz de fusionar el rock con el pop y la musica clsica aparte de ser considerado siempre un showman, y el gran Carl Palmer que siempre combinaba habilidad con potencia y a la vez fineza a la hora de tocar su bateria, todo en una union perfecta que duraria ocho aos y daria la vuelta al mundo, de este album Endless Enigma y From The Beginings, es de lo mejor, o Jerusalem, para muchos criticos el mejor disco de este trio perfecto.
B00000J7J4|3.0|This CD is mostly overrated. If you want real Santana, check out the following CDs. There are remastered imports at the end of the listings for many of these top rated CDs. Inner Secrets, Shango, Marathon, Zebop, Freedom, Beyond Appearances, Spirits Dancing In The Flesh, Blues for Salvador, Milagro, etc. The latter Santana releases are just as good as the early gems. Santana has grown by leaps and bounds since the Black Magic Woman days. I encourage you to get a remastered (import) copy of this. Amazon just listed all of the remasters for these, but they are listed at the end. These should be up front, because many people will miss out on the limited releases of these. The early CDs to get are as follows: Santana 3 (remastered), Caravanserai, Amigos, Oneness (Silver Dream, Golden Reality) and the live 2 CD masterpiece Moonflower.
B000002GA8|5.0|Todo seguidor del buen rock arte debe haber escuchado o tener algun disco de este seor, cuya fama se la debe en parte aunque el no lo acepte completamente, a la majestuosa banda britanica Yes, pues junto a este grupo creo clasicos insuperables y discos bsicos dentro del movimiento del rock progresivo y porque no decirlo de la musica de la nueva era, para muestra esta el incomprendido Tales From the Topographic Oceans, siempre odiado por Rick, asi que debido a este espectacular album, se decide de lleno a lanzarse como solista en una carrera que lleva ya 30 aos y que ha estado lleno de exitos y fracasos, sim embargo Journey es la produccion por excelencia de Wakeman, si ustedes se han fijado ha sacado muchos albumes recopilatorios en la que parte de este disco siempre est, o en las giras es parte del repertorio obligatorio de este maestro, que jams fue superado por otro tecladista en Yes, por lo que para estos ultimos siempre fue un eterno problema reemplazarlo ya que nunca se encontr a alguien tan talentoso y fenomenal, quizs el unico que se le acerco fue Patrick Mouraz, asi que si notamos la mayoria de seguidores de Rick han sido fans de Yes o visceversa por lo que ambos establecieron una carrera paralela y hubo puntos de union que no siempre fueron felices como en el caso de Tormato o Keys to Ascencion ,  aunque otros si lo fueron como el reencuentro del Going For The One o del Criminal Record, asi que si usted es o ha sido un Yeshead deber tener como parte de su coleccion esta magnifica obra que ha a mi gusto de ver fue lo mas espectacular que hizo este seor junto con el Criminal Record, todo el disco es excelente, los coros y la orquestacion es perfecta asi como la parte de guitarras y percusion asi como el inconfundible Moog de Rick Wakeman, con este album este maestro olvid la pesadilla que signific su ultimo trabajo con Yes y lo catapult a la fama, por lo que lleg a ser considerado el mago del rock.

B00000DGUG|5.0|okay it's amazing to me to find people say this is garbage. I never wrote a review but I have to for this one. and how can people say &quot;pay special attention too...&quot; or&quot; this ths best song&quot;. these are amazing beyond words from front row to Your Congratulations. I love all of them all the stories she tells<BR>and the pictures she paints in your mind. if you guys just wanted her to just be angry like on JLP go listen to Coutney love or something.and I'm glad that her new alabum &quot; Under Rug Swept&quot; have the same maturaity she developed on this one.<BR>I can't wait for another album from her. an album that makes you think and listen carfully not just to rock your empty heads back and forth to empty angry words. and I don't mean that JLP were empty angry words. there were great songs there like frogiven , mary jane ,you house and alot more
B000002OX7|5.0|This is the Who's finest work and one of rocks greatest albums. from the... kicking Baba o'Riley to the classic Behind Blue Eyes, you cannot go wrong with this one.  A rock and roll gem!!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Fabulous film. The script is terrific and Guy Pierce (remember Priscilla, Queen of the Desert?) is a very credible troubled nut case.<br />Instructions:<br />1) Watch it the first time<br />2) Think about it... &quot;oh yes!&quot; you exclaim<br />3) Watch it again<br />4) Watch it in reverse order (must have DVD)
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I am finding that those that get the film love this movie, and those that don't hate it and find reasons why it is bad that have nothing to do with the movie.  One reviewer said that it's like Donnie is taking bait.  He is, and he's supposed to.  See, Donnie is a typical highschool student with a not so typical life.  He's being visited by a 6ft rabbit with a reptilian feel to the face, and he's finding out about time travel as well as going through the motions of highschool in 1988 (great soundtrack by the way).  Along the way we meet a self help guru who well... isn't Tony Roberts by any means, a bible thumping teacher, his psychiatrist, his parents who are the coolest parents, and his two sisters as well as his new girlfriend who just moved into the neighborhood.  They are all there for a reason and they like Donnie feel something, but don't know what.  The commentary by the director/writer and Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko) is great, and the lost scenes are well... amazing.  Why a few made it to the cutting room floor I don't really know.  The two trailers are great (the second one you have to go to the Special Features, then &quot;Philosophy of Time Travel&quot;.  Hit the right arrow key till you get to Appendex B and hit the up button.  That will highlight an arrow and with that you hit enter.)  We also get to see the original infomercial for the selfhelp series, and several TV spots (But not as many as on the Fight Club DVD) and more.  Many people are wondering why it didn't get wide release, well I guess that there is one reason... but I can't say because it would give something about the movie away but feel free to email me to find out my opinion on that.  Anyways, you either get it or you don't.  No middleground here.  You love it your you hate it, but you won't stand in the middle.
B00005PJ6M|5.0|The first movie had me in stiches, but Bogus Journey had tears rolling down my face! The sequel doesnt simply see the guys getting up to the exact same antics, instead we have a new journey and new hillarious characters, in the shape of The Reaper and Station, coupled with the old familar characters. So much funnier than the first.
0451160916|1.0|As a devoted fan of horror genre, i couldn't die without reading Stephen King. After all, he's considered the greatest horror writer of all times, and i thought any of his books would be an incredible experience about the art of scaring people.<br />After reading The Shining, though, i desmissed him as a writer. This wasn't a horror book, but the story of a man, a drunkard, his entire life put in 400 boring pages. It's not a horror story, it's the story of a man trying to fight his addiction, and how he failed.<br />It is set in a haunted hotel, though this is never fully developed. there is no idea why the hotel wants the boy, Danny, who has a power called 'shining'. As for Jack, no one know how he's caught by the hotel, whereas Wendy is just a pointless character.<br />There is never horror, though King makes the reader expecting it every in turn of page. That's good, it's suspense, but sometimes is should come with a real display of horror, something harder than a hive of wasps.<br />Then, there's the climax. Jack, totally controlled by the hotel, coming after his family. It didn't work with me. and how the hotel finally loses, it was one of the worst deux ex machinas endings i've ever seen. And they're not rare.<br />King's greatest strenght lies in his characterization skills, how he imagines entire lifes. Too bad that's all he knows how to do. And even though it works in superb books such as The Green Mile, it fails in horror books.<br />In a crime, it's not the detective's life that matters, but the crime itself. In horror, i don't care about who's getting scared, but rather why and how.<br />All in all, i don't recomend this book to anyone. Still, if you're not convinced, don't just take my word for it. Get it free in a library, read it, and then decide. Everyone has a different taste.
0425179877|4.0|Oh, yeah, Gene, this is how a book on the program should be written.  A satisfying mixture of people, events, and technical information that kept me reading from start to finish.  As a child of the program (my father worked for the space program from 1956 until 1970 and loved every minute at Cape Canaveral/Kennedy Space Center), I found myself looking for names of people I knew or asking my dad &quot;did you ever meet...?&quot;.  I highly recommend it to whoever is interested in early American space flight.
B00005R2M3|4.0|What impressed me most about this album is the songs are entirely made by her. Overall her music is a nice crossover album something like Shania Twain, Christina Aguiella and Alanis Morissette mixed. Whenever Whenever is better performed in Spanish version as other reviewers say. Underneath Your Clothes is excellent ballad with great hit potential. Te Dejo Madrid shows her inclination for rock music. Maybe collaboration with finest producers, say, Matt Lange may show better extract of her appeal.
B000007UFO|5.0|To the record company-- this album needs to be re-released in the US!!!<br />As a dedicated listener of post-punk new wave music during the golden days of KROQ in Pasadena, CA (late 1970's until early 1990's), the Simple Minds stood out as the perfect balance between aggressive guitar rock and smooth synthesizer melody. Hearing this album (and also Sparkle in the Rain) was like finding your favorite toy from childhood. New Gold Dream falls on the more melodic side of the Simple Minds. The Simple Minds missed their calling as film composers-- their instrumental tracks are among some of their best compositions.
B0000524E5|4.0|When I first saw the trailer for Coyote Ugly I didn't expect it to be so innocent. I guess you can say I expected it to be like Striptease or even Showgirls but instead Coyote Ugly  is sort of a light and pleasant movie. It's mostly about following your dreams, so if you're a parent that's worried about your teenager seeing this film, I wouldn't worry much. It's surprisingly cute and isn't made as a source of T&amp;A like you'd expect.

Hearing this album (and also New Gold Dream) was like finding your favorite toy from childhood. Every single track was a gem. I listened to this album five times when I found it again. To the record company-- this album needs to be re-released!!!
0790738139|3.0|Probably the best thriller of all, well performed with quite an interesting screenplay (although slightly unoriginal) L.A. Confidential is, however, bound in a cathegory where there are no good movies PERIOD. Thrillers are all unrealistic and clearly serving a propaganda agenda. What are their subliminal messages for which they have been continuously sustained: streets are bad and a democratic judicial system could no longer deal with these exceptional circumstances. Let's see for example the HIGHLY RECURRENT story of a policement who already knows who's the criminal but the over-democratical system will help him go away and avoid prosecution. Instead, we are made to believe illegal practices (such as beating the suspect or sleeping with it, if she's a female, which keep in mind it's a form of bribery and is severely punished) are better and more efficient. Instead we have the image of an all-knowing bully who takes \\"procedures\\" under his own hands. What these movies avoid is that in real life, you don't know who's the criminal and only prosecution will conclude whether the suspect is guilty or not. Policemen are no heroes, as the IRS and any other democratic institution in our country. The only reason they are payed for is to protect law abiding citizens from getting harmed. Anything that goes over these clearly defined attributions is utterly illegal, dangerous and un-democratic.<br />The only foreseable purpose for these productions is to instill the prejudice that governing under a state of emergency (where police is militarized and politicized, thus serving no longer the citizen) would better solve the exceptional problems this country has to deal today (Arab terrorism, child crimes, bad streets and so on)...
B000063CPL|5.0|This record is much better than \\"live at donington\\" and \\"a real live/dead one\\". The crowd is amazing singing every single song. The songs of the brave new world album sounds great, except \\"dream of mirrors\\", where the crowd is so loud that you cant even hear the guitars solo (but only this part, the rest of the song is ok). The most surprising song is the \\"sign of the cross\\", where Bruces performance is brilliant (much better than Blaze). \\"The evil that men do\\" and \\"the trooper\\" sounds incredible in this record, really good!!!. The only song that id rip off is \\"sanctuary\\", it sounds great, but I think that they should play another song like \\"aces high\\", \\"fallen angel\\"... <BR>If you are an iron maiden fan, buy it now!!! if you dont it is an excellent chance to know the best metal band of the world. Up the irons!!!!
B00005Y228|4.0|...to the U.S. charts that is.<br /><br />a nice, more modern sounding follow up to her hats-off-to-disco \\"light years\\", this one's all dance, top to bottom, not a single red light (ballads) in sight...well, there's one - burnin' up, starts off real slow till you get to the chorus that drops on you so hard you'll never know what hits you.<br /><br />it's been \\"fever\\" in the mornin' and \\"fever\\" all through the night ever since ;)
B00004Z459|3.0|this is overall a good cd. it is worth the dollars.  i gave it a 3 stars because #11 is so horrible it brings the cd down.  I would have given it a 4 without it.
B000058983|5.0|Arthur Lee was at the forefront of the LA movement, that included The Byrds, Buffalo Springfield, and later, The Doors. This album, unlike some contemporary efforts, still sounds fresh on all fronts. The range of sound, from acoustic to very hard rock, is a reflection of the mastery of the artists involved. This is musicianship of a caliber that is really not found anywhere near a radio or MTV screen extant today. Within a span of two or three years, these artists poured out a panoply of sound that will live on into one era after the next, and I am not exaggerating here. Give the samples a listen, and if they do not convince you, you are tone-and-soul-deaf. A definite best-buy in terms of 60's music, or any other era, for that matter.
0671799320|5.0|This book is just wonderful. First, I couldn't put it down. At over 500 pages that meant a couple of very late nights. But it is so well written that it holds on to you.<BR>And what it is about - the entire history of the oil industry. And it's all there, laid out clearly and in order and showing how it all ties together.<BR>This is basically a perfect example of how all history books should be written. And proof that you can write an exhaustive history and make it thouroughly enjoyable to read.
B000002UEB|5.0|Nothing like a band who can make you care about people and places that don't really exist.  I'm certain that more than one person has said this, but Mindcrime is the album that made Queensryche my number one favorites.  Man,,, thinking about it now still gives me goosebumps. Geoff Tate has such a powerful voice, and there is such synergy between all the musicians.  I can't believe Queensrych is not everyone's favorite....
B0000584V3|5.0|If you are a fan of hardcore, death metal, but also a fan of slower, melodic industeral metal then Opeth is the perfact band for you. Even though most of the songs on this album are around 8 to 10 minites + in time, it never gets lame. Unless your expecting all the songs to stay hardcore all the way through.<BR>Songs like The Harvest never get heavy, but are very good never the less.
B00003CY6M|5.0|Ok ladies and gentlemen, many of us know already a woman's view on this quirky romantic comedy.  So I've decided to prepare a quick guy's view and why we would want to see it.  We are introduced to the stars of this year's most underrated romantic comedy as they are shopping at bloomingdales and accidently reach for the same pair of gloves (fate???) and end up in a coffee shop, falling in love over a cup of coffee, cozy as the snow drifts down on a beautiful NYC around christmas time.  The perfect date (lasting a few hours), ends with them ice skating and parting ways, without any way of reaching each other, saving a twist of fate.  She writes her name and number on a book (Love in Time of Chlorea) and he writes his on a five dollar bill, and they both leave it to the eventual wheels of fate.  Flash forward a few years later and both of our stars are a short time away from their wedding and still in love with the stranger from a few years ago.  They race around frantically to find each other and I'm not ruining the ending, so read it.  It was a great movie with stellar performances from the stars, supporting cast and yes, Jim's dad is a clerk and steals a few scenes.  But I said it was a biased opinion, because as a guy, I saw it on a date (my first date with her) with a girl.  I had the greatest time with her (theatres), and I too fell in love with her, so thats why it's a biased opinion.  So as a guy, if you get this for your girl, and you don't enjoy it at all, I guarentee she will, it's well worth it, I loved just spending the time with her (dont get popcorn for this one, trust me on it).  Well take it easy guys, hope you enjoy the movie!
0312979479|5.0|Agatha Christie's AND THEN THERE WERE NONE should be very close to the top of any mystery fan's &#34;must read list.&#34;  The novel concerns a group of ten previously unacquainted people who are lured via various pretexts to Indian Island, a resort home off the coast of Devon--and are promptly accused by their unseen host of having escaped punishment for past crimes.  Cut off from the world and fighting rising panic, they scramble to unmask the killer even as their number is reduced in macabre accordance with the &#34;Ten Little Indians&#34; nursey rhyme displayed in rooms throughout the house.<br /><br />Agatha Christie was already famous when AND THEN THERE WERE NONE (also known under the title TEN LITTLE INDIANS) was published--but this book put her career well over the top: nothing like it had seen before, it proved a sensation, and writers and film-makers continue to use Christie's basic idea to this very day.  Some critics argue the novel is mechanical rather than organic, but I say if this is mechanical, let's have more of it!  It is truly a can't-put-it-down, non-stop read, a spectacular turn by the genre's single most celebrated author.<br /><br />The success of the novel inspired Christie to adapt it for the stage, where it was a tremendous success, and there have been several film versions (most notably the 1940s Rene Clair-directed AND THEN THERE WERE NONE) over the years.  If you know the story only from stage and film versions, however, you are in for a surprise.  Christie felt the novel's conclusion did not translate well to the stage, so she re-wrote it--and most film versions follow the stage script, not the novel.  But whether you've seen the play and films or not, get ready for a shock!<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer
078322799X|5.0|And I thought \\"The Sixth Sense\\" was scary! But boy was I wrong! \\"The Frighteners\\" is a truely more gory and exciting wild ride from Peter Jackson.  And with Michael J. Fox, it makes it even better.  This film as some pretty intense special effects in it that will blow your mind away.... In \\"The Frighteners,\\" we meet this guy Frank Bannister (Michael J. Fox) who believes in death for a living and tries getting rid of the distrubing poltriguiest. There's just something about this movie that chilled my bones with the wonderful perfomance by these actors.  If it weren't for Robert Zemeckis and Peter Jackson, this film wouldn't be as heart pounding, edge-of-your-seat excitment! Wonderfully well done!
B000050XEI|5.0|I am stunned by how moved I am by this album, and by Enya. I have really never enjoyed anything but classical music, and have never had the slightest interest in any \\"new age\\" music or culture. Enya is simply the most wonderful performer I've ever heard, in any genre. Listening to her is like suddenly learning there is a beautiful new color in the spectrum, after almost 50 years of life! The intense feelings experienced by listening to this album are equal to falling in love for the first time. I only wish I had more superlatives to devote to Enya. Trust me, you should buy this album if you would know something of Heaven.

B00004YZFR|5.0|It is spooky watching the guy in the lime green suit the whole movie knowing that he is going to get stabbed in the end. Also notable is watching the guy on stage having a bad acid trip and then get thrown off the stage by a Hells Angel
0748662529|5.0|&quot;No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency,&quot; introduces the reader to &quot;Precious Ramotswe, citizen of Botswana, daughter of Obed Ramotswe who died because he had been a miner and could no longer breathe.&quot;  Instead of calling her Precious Ramotswe, everyone commonly addresses the story's heroine as Mma. Ramotswe.<br />We read about Mma. Ramotswe life growing up and that of her father who worked as a miner and later became a prosperous cattle owner.  When her father passes away, being the only child, Mma. Ramostswe becomes the recipient of a sizable amount of money.  She decides to use the funds to establish what will become the first detective agency in Botswana (in the southern part of Africa).  This decision will make her &quot;the first and only lady private detective in the whole of Botswana...&quot; When others scoff at or try to dissuade her about the idea of female detective, Mma. Ramotswe deftly points to the well-known mystery writer, Agatha Christie who solved many mysteries through popular characters such as Hercule Poirot and Miss Jane Marple.  <br />This portly, intelligent and amusing woman is an unlikely character, in an unlikely setting - Africa. But why not?  There are mysteries to be solved everywhere and by anyone.<br />Mma. Ramotswe's cases are amusing - they range from imposters, missing husbands, lost children, to stolen property and more.  What is interesting is the way the premier lady detective solves her cases and handles herself in particular situations and with others.<br />Author Alexander Mc Call Smith, who is also a law professor, was born in Zimbabwe (southern part of Africa) and educated in that country as well as in Scotland.  He successfully captures the true essence, mannerisms, greetings and culture of Africa and its characters that are proud to come from that continent.  <br />In addition to Botswana and South Africa, other countries such as Ghana, Nigeria (countries in West Africa), Lesotho, Mozambique, and Malawi (countries in the southern part of Africa, not to be confused with South Africa) are mentioned as well.  If you are unaware of these countries, it is a nice learning experience.  <br />After reading &quot;The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency,&quot; you'll feel as if you've been to Botswana and solved a few cases, yourself!    Read it, you'll enjoy it!<br />Fafa Demasio
B000002C1W|5.0|There may be no Floyd album that has gotten more negative attention (aside from the Roger Waters solo album The Final Cut) than A Momentary Lapse of Reason, and most (if not all) of it is really undeserved.<BR>In 1987, with yet another lyrically ingenius singer out, Pink Floyd were back with David Gilmour at the helm. And for A Momentary Lapse of Reason the remaining members of PF had something to prove, and they did so with force. What we have here is classic Floyd, and like with most of their albums we have so many fantastically trippy songs to only they could have done. Gilmour can come up with lyrical revelations that may not be Waters level but don't disappoint, and certainly proves his worth as a top notch guitarist. They haven't lost their ability to create great new melodies or lyrics on songs such as Learnint to Fly, The Dogs of War, and Sorrow. Oh yeah those who accuse this of just recreating Floyd's classic sound and not being anything new or revolutionary should listen to Dark Side, Wish You Were Here, and this one back to back, then decide. Plus if this album were released were released by anyone whose name wasn't Pink Floyd it would be recieved far better. But because its PF and Roger Waters isn't there it needs to be Dark Side all over again. (Well guess what. It ain't gonna happen.)<br />However I must say one thing. It is hard to call this a Pink Floyd album. Lets face it, David Gilmour's fingerprints are all over this, having written or co-written every track on the album (And none of the tracks were co-written with his fellow Floyds) There are only two official Floyd members, with Rick Wright limited to studio musician status. So those who refuse to call this a Pink Floyd album may be right. But it is a great, GREAT, David Gilmour album, and should entertain any PF fan who isn't to cynical and close minded.<br />In conclusion this was a refreshing step forward for Pink Floyd, as they left the dark, moody Roger Waters days behind, and proved they were still one of the greatest rock bands on the planet. No the album isn't perfect, and no it isn't among the classic albums of the '70s, but so many artists would spend lifetimes without ever reaching this level of quality. So while beginning or casual Floyd fans should go straight for Dark Side or Wish You Were Here, the dedicated fan should certainly have A Momentary Lapse of Reason.

Reading this book made me aware that I am not alone...even if she lives all the way on the other side of the world! Shopping is the same everywhere! My favorite line: &quot;Everyone would be so much happier if they could just wear a new outfit everyday.&quot; So true!!
B00005JKQX|5.0|I am a huge fan of Russell Crowe; I guess I'm biased.  But thousands upon thousands of positive reviews can't be wrong, can they??  Crowe's performance as Nash is flawless.  He should've won the Academy Award.  I mean Denzel was good.  No, I take that back.... Superbe is more like it.  But Russell's performance as John Nash was just better.  This movie actually has something to say.  Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris, and Christopher Plummer also turn in noteworthy performances.  Regardless of what the Academy voters feel, A Beautiful Mind is a terrific movie that everyone should see.  It only goes to show just how diverse of an actor Russell Crowe is and how great a future he has before him.  He's off to a great \\"start\\"!!!

B000060P79|5.0|Simple Plan is the best band ever.  This is not one of those bands who puts out one good song on the cd, i bought the cd and i can listen to the whole thing throughout with out skipping any songs in the process.  I even joined the street team.  BUY THEIR ALBUM NOW!
B0000640VO|5.0|For some reason, even though I'm not a very big fan of movies I have to read, they usually end up being my favorites. This is the kind of movie you want to snuggle up next to the person you love, grab a tub of popcorn and start a roaring fire. This may have the appearance of a chick flick (I guess it is in most respects.), but both genders can enjoy this film greatly. When I saw this in the theatres, the whole audience was roaring. I even laughed out loud several times. This has got to be one of the funniest movies ever made. I laughed (I don't think it made me cry.), hoped and prayed during the whole movie.<BR> The most inspiring stories are those where insignificant people are shown to be significant in the lives of others. Amelie is one of those stories of how one insignificant, beautiful (and I do mean beautiful) waitress can inspire and touch the world around her. There is some mild language, sexual content and humor and brief nudity. <BR> This is a must-see. Audrey Tautou's eyes alone make this movie worth a fortune. Love it, see it, buy it.
B00005A1PR|2.0|I'm sorry, I really wanted to like this album...god after reading all the great reviews I wanted to LOVE it. &quot;Video&quot; is really, really good. &quot;Brown Skin&quot; is fairly adequate, and &quot;Ready for Love&quot; is pretty. But the rest of the songs really lack the catchy vibe, and upbeat tempo that I love. If you like slow songs, and guitar playing-which she is excellent at, than try this album, but if you love Lauryn Hill, stay away. The two can't even be compared. They are both so talented, but in totally different ways. &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; will forever be my favorite cd. India.Arie is incredibly talented, but it's just not my thing, and I totally wasn't feeling her.
B00004BZ0V|5.0|This is a good collection of their music that you probably remember. If you like the Clash, this is a good CD to own. Most of the songs on it, I've heard before.
B00005LOUP|4.0|While Ron Howard is one of the best directors of our time, Jim Carrey is surely one of its most gifted actors. While he hasn't yet mastered the subtleties of dram, he is like human Play-Dough, easily able to mold into the most unusual of characters. The Grinch, while an odd, even uneasy character, may be Carey's most challenging role to date, due in large part to the mountain of makeup the transformation requires. Within the green fur and facial prosthesis, Carrey literally becomes the Grinch, enough so that Dr. Seuss's own widow personally approved of the production.<br />The unexpected treat in this film is the sweet on-screen relationship between the Grinch and Cindy Lou Who, played perfectly by 6-year-old Taylor Momsen. While Carrey is a delight to watch in his crazed Grinch routine, by the end of the movie even the Grinchiest of people will likely feel their hearts growing three sizes. While perhaps not a holiday classic, &quot;The Grinch&quot; will take an honored place in our Christmas viewing traditions, and should be a welcome addition to any DVD collection.
B00004Z459|5.0|Limp-Bizkit, Pop, Crap. Things never to confuse HYBRID THEORY with. Fact of it is, it is about as original as the come. I can see where a few Pokemon geeks might take a glance at crawling and run, and I agree. However, when one actually listens to the cd they find out that it is very different. All the songs on the cd are very diverse and obviously took Linkin Park much time to produce. Not to mention the portion of songs you may consider, \\"rap\\" are not rap but rather more like flowing. You will never find lyrics from Hybrid Theory on a Master P or Ludacris cd(For those who aren't sure, those are rap cd's). Hybrid Theory hits hard and fast as a \\"Classic\\" cd that is very original. This cd a must buy and anyone who likes bands such as System Of A Down, Incubus, etc., will surely not be dissapointed.
0790729725|5.0|Martin Scorcese delivers one of the best movies about organized crime ever made in &quot;Goodfellas,&quot; due in large part to the intense portrayals by an excellent cast. Ray Liotta is completely believable as Henry Hill, an Irish-Italian who becomes a key player in the New York mob. He is befriended by other mob insiders -- Jimmy (Robert DeNiro) and Tommy (Joe Pesci), both of whom give Oscar-caliber performances. The pace of the movie is so frenetic that you may begin to feel your pulse rise, particularly during the climactic buildup near the end. In addition to gritty performances, the groundbreaking cinematography in &quot;Goodfellas&quot; makes this a visual treat for the eyes. The only negatives are the sometimes overwhelming violence and language, which are realistically and graphically portrayed but still sometimes hard to watch. Even so, this is one of the best movies to be released in the past half-century.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I was hooked on the books the first time I picked one up about 2 years ago.  I think I looked foreward to the movie coming out at least as much, if not more, than my children.  I was not disappointed.  I have listened to \\"experts\\" talk about how disappointing it was to have the movie follow the book. I watched the movie hoping and expecting it to follow the book. The book was the reason I wanted to see the movie.  The direction and the acting was wonderful.  Everyone did what I went to see the move for--they brought the book to life.  I am sorry that some people couldn't accept the movie for what it was - a vastly entertaining, exciting, and magical 2 1/2 hours.  I can't wait for it to come out on video, and am certainly looking foreward to The Chamber of Secrets coming out.<BR>(As well as the 5th book!)
B000002H2H|5.0|What can I say, this album by Metallica truly rules. This is my 2nd favorite album by the band, only beaten by \\"Master of Puppets\\". \\"Ride the Lightning\\" is an awesome album, with great riffs, lyrics that make you think, and some very well-placed melodies. From the first palm muted riff of \\"Fight Fire With Fire\\" to the last note played on \\"Call of Ktulu\\", this album offers so much, and is sometimes overlooked.  I view \\"Ride the Lightning\\" as underrated, as it deserves more credit than what it recieves. <br />I simply love raw power and emotion of this album, it just gets me moving, and it paints a wonderful picture in my mind. Music to me is like a good book, it takes my on an adventure and lets my imagination roam free. <br />This album's title track takes me into the mind of the man about to be executed, and the feelings portrayed in \\"Trapped Under Ice\\" make me feel as though I'm in the freezing cold waters, below the ice with my companions unable to hear my cries, as I begin to ponder if I will live or not with the last few seconds of the air in my lungs.<br />This album is so vivid and powerful, and it's amazing to look at the transistion that the band made between \\"Kill 'Em All\\" and \\"Ride the Lightning\\".

6300213803|5.0|Star Trek II has always been my favorite Trek film, but has also become one of my all-time favorite movies.  It is a very well-done film from good acting, to great action and special effects, to the whole idea of bringing back one of Trek's greatest villains, Khan Noonian Singh.  There is always something occuring in this movie that will keep you on your toes, from Kirk dealing with the unexpected return of his old nemesis, Khan, the battle scenes between the Enterprise and the Reliant, the quarreling over a new experiment- the genesis device (which can turn a desloate moon into a pradise), to the surprising death of Spock that left fans in awe at the theaters.  There are no gaps in the plot, everything flows nicely from beginning to the end.  I just wish we could have seen Khan's attack on the Space Station Regula 1 :)  If you love, or even like Trek, or even thinking of watching some Trek - 1.  Buy the Original Series episode \\"Space Seed\\"  and then buy \\"The Wrath of Khan.\\"
6302000823|5.0|There exists (I have seen it on Italian TV) a long, original version of this great film. In it our hero seeks out and finds his lost love. It is quite compelling. I can only assume that the director was put under pressure to cut this down. The pity is that there is ten minutes spent on the sequence of sharing one print between two cinemas; time which would have been better spent on preserving the original outcome of the love story. And the distributors would have been happy too, the length being the same. Who knows, maybe the director was content with the released version. This film still remains a great classic, however, and contains one the best scores ever written. Anyone have a copy of that long version?
B000063CPL|5.0|This is one amazing live album!!! The quality is perfect and the songs are magic. This along with Kiss Alive! are my favourite live albums.

B00005V9HH|5.0|Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects is a brilliantly crafted thriller that leads the viewer through a roller coaster ride of twists and plot turns.  The film marked the breakout of Kevin Spacey and helped him become a big star and win the first of his two Oscars.  The cast is full of superb actors including Gabriel Byrne, Benecio Del Toro, Kevin Pollack, Pete Postelwaithe, Chazz Palminteri, Giancarlo Espinosa and elicits a strong performance from the normally cringe inducing Stephen Baldwin.  The interplay between Mr. Spacey and Mr. Palminteri is the centerpiece of the film as the story unfolds in a flashback manner.  Mr. Palminteri is a cop who is grilling Mr. Spacey regarding a drug deal gone bad aboard a ship.  Throughout the story, the name of the mysterious Keyser Soze comes up and it is the identity of Mr. Soze that adds suspense and intrigue to the plot.  The ending is a true surprise and you really don't see coming even the clues are there all along. The Usual Suspects will keep you on the edge of your seat.
B00005ATQH|2.0|Having read the book, I naturally wanted to see the film. Unfortunatly, I have very few good things to say about the film adaptation. I was wholly disappointed with this film, especially since Nabokov wrote the screen treatment.  I'm not a big Kubrick fan, but I have enjoyed most of his movies. This one, I'm afraid, is not worth bothering with. The direction is rather sketchy with odd black-outs denoting chapters or segments of the film. The sudden naration of Humbert's diary is ill-conceived and the acting is over the top too often.<br />The characters are mere skeletons of what they were in the novel. What made the book so paralyzing was taken out. One is made to sympathize with Humbert rather than hate him. Lolita, on the other hand, is shawn to be a temptress and not as a child who is forced into Humberts cruel world.<br />Unless one has read the book or is a die-hard Kubrick fan, stay away from this film.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Hey, first I think I should tell you a bit about myself before going on. I'm Kayla, and I'm 14, just so you understand if you can't understand what I'm typing, ok? <BR>Being a number 1 fan of all the books, from Silmarillion to Unfinished Tales, the movie(and will be movies)-I have seen it 5 times, and will be more times to go, the soundtrack was out of this world. I am a great fan of Enya, I collect soundtracks and just listening to the sample songs on this website brought me straight back to the movie, and the book. Listening to Enya sing Elvish, listening to those orchestratel pieces of music with no words, is just like a trigger, it sends me to the scene in the movie, and sends me to the chapter in the book where it happened, and for me it combines all the things that I love: music, reading those books, watching that movie (which I never get tired of watching), soundtracks, etc. The way the music flows into the song, I feel that by just listening to the soundtrack, you can know what's going on in the movie, or book, if you just pay attention to the notes played and the beat. It'd be a great gift for Christmas, Easter, birthdays, or just celebrating the soundtrack or the day of the week! Buy it now!
B000003TA4|5.0|The simple fact that hundreds of bands have tried to copy Nirvana - without success - shows its unique strength and resistance to become just another dump-and-wast-band. Because Nirvana is like a God, many try to overcome its master, but no one succeed. In their masterpiece and firework Nevermind, a sense of draining and xenophobia cracks through. It is almost how you can feel love-hate because of its anxiety and bitterness. But all this feelings that are put together in Nevermind are yet o.k. Why? Well, the rebellness and youth-overthrowing-the-system kind of tension - makes this record to a no ending road to paradise. To me. And millions of other people all around the globe!
0201626632|5.0|This book is filled with extremely valuble advice and stories for scientists at any stage of their careers.  When I first started reading the book I'd never heard of the author, and didn't really trust the things he said.  But after I'd gotten partway through the book, Dr. Feibelman had won me over by his keen insights into science and the sociology behind it.  For instance, he casts a disparaging eye toward those who, when given a 7-minute conference talk, proceed to waste a minute blabbing on about their 'outline' for the talk.  Wow, that's great!  I hate that, too!<br />The rest of the book is filled with insights that Dr. Feibelman has garnered over his career, the rules of the game that are never explicitly mentioned anywhere but that everyone expects that you know.  This book provides the both the tools and the inspiration you need to succeed in a scientific career, and is an interesting and fun read to boot.<br />The day after I finished this book I received _Science_ magazine in my mailbox, and I'll be...if he didn't have a paper in there.  I now know who Peter J. Feibelman is -- a good author with good advice for young scientists and a man who practices what he preaches.
0743216458|5.0|Stephen Ambrose does an excellent, craftsmanlike job of piecing together the memories of the men of Easy Company, 101st Airborne. In 'Band of Brothers' he recounts the 18 months or so from the formation of Easy Company under the disciplinarian Herbert Sobel, to their disbandment at war's end. To many, the fact that men can accept death in such an uncomplicated way is puzzling, yet many books that have been written from the soldiers' perspectives indicate that this attitude was prevelant to all fighting men.<br />One of the telling moments for me was, I believe, when Lt. Col. (later Gen.) Harry W.O.Kinnard said of the Battle of the Bulge, \\"We never felt we would be overrun. We were beating back everything they threw at us. We had the houses and were warm. They were outside the town, in the snow and cold.\\" Every surviving member of E company kept copies of that newspaper story with comments which could best be translated as \\"What battle was he in?\\"<br />To me, this shows that Ambrose really did get the soldiers' take on the war. The trenches, the deaths, the cold, the hunger. If I may make one small criticism it is that, in places, he relied TOO much on the soldiers' memories... he talks of E Company's 'triumphant capture' of Berchtesgaden (Hitler's Eagle's Nest). History says he is wrong. In fact the French, under orders from General Leclerc, but against the orders of deGaulle beat the Americans into Berchtesgaden by almost a full day. The differences in recollection may well come from the fact that the Americans were first into the sections of Eagle's Nest they considered important - the French, led by an engineer called Bernard de Nonancourt had gone straight to the wine cellars to reclaim their half-million bottles of captured wine! Difference of priority - difference of perspective!<br />Band of Brothers is an excellent account of man's inhumanity to man; of men's love for their fellow men, and of mens' sacrifices for mankind. It is also an interesting perspective on the actions undertaken by Easy Company during the last 12 months of the war in Europe.
B00005JKEC|2.0|Although the filming and acting is good,...The language is terrible and unnecessary, and almost made the film un-watchable for me.  The movie doesnt have a point.  For the first hour you wonder were it is going, and then the ending doesnt really resolve any of the subplots that I saw 'sort of' develop.  Also you have seen this before a hundred times.  Basically a waste of plastic.  There are many other movies worth renting.
0060977493|2.0|The God of Small Things is a Booker Prize recipient &amp; I hoped that I would enjoy it as much as the many raving reviews said I would. Unfortunately, I did not find this to be a book that I enjoyed. The book was well written and full of a lot of lyrical/poetic prose. This is a book that requires much focus and concentration and despite my best efforts, I can't say that I enjoyed it. The novel, set in India does flashbacks from past to present around an Indian family. Rahel &amp; Estha are twins, born into a family that owns a pickling company. Most of the story is set during the 1960's and portrays a life of deep poverty and sadness. Through flashbacks from the past as well as current information, we learn the painful history of this family and the secrets that destroyed it. I had hoped to gain a better understanding of Indian culture, but personally felt the author only grazed the surface of this issue and never felt I got to really know or understand any of the characters. This is a book that I may have enjoyed more reading it in an English class to gain a full appreciation and understanding of the writing. While many may love this book, I don't think it's for everyone.
B00005MP58|5.0|I recently bought the Special Edition DVD set and I love it. Having owned the VHS version a couple of years ago, I was very happy to see a vast improvement on the clarity &amp; quality of the movie.  Furthermore, I like the &quot;featurette&quot; of behind-the-scenes footage, showing the making of this mini-series. Excellent buy!  Too bad, however, that the &quot;featurette&quot; does not pay much heed to Jennifer Ehle ('Elizabeth Bennet').  She has done a wonderful job in the lead role, and without her, Colin Firth may have not quite worked as Mr. Darcy.  As is, however, they make a great on-screen pair.

B00005QK3W|4.0|Well, the verdicts are now out. Everything from \\"best album McCartney has ever recorded\\" to \\"complete disaster.\\" The truth is somewhere in between. There is some average filler i.e. \\"Tiny Bubble\\", and some total [junk] \\"Spinning On an Axis\\".<BR>However, when McCartney hits the target on this album he does so in a significant way. \\"Lonely Road\\" and \\"From A Lover\\" are powerful worthy songs that let the listener know precisely where McCartney has been over recent years. \\"Loving Flame\\" and \\"Magic\\" stand alongside the best that he has ever written, both containing tightly controlled but awesome power, the hallmark of his best work over the years.<BR>\\"Freedom\\" is simple but it plays its role in the \\"Give Peace A Chance\\" mode and it would sound great in a packed stadium. The best moments on Driving Rain put the power back into pop and extend the honest conversation that McCartney has been having with his audience for many years. If you listen to this album and don't know where he has been recently (emotionally and geographically) then you aint really listening.
B00005UKKF|5.0|Yes, pop star Britney Spears has another DVD out this year. Besides past \\"Live and More\\", \\"Britney The Videos\\" and \\"Time out with...\\". This one takes the taco. Britney performs her \\"Dream Within A Dream\\" 2001 tour LIVE at the MGM Grand Garden Arena - November 2001. The MGM has seen its share of great artists. Barbra Streisand held her Millennium Concert there.<br />This concert is spectacular for all Spears fans. The choreography, the back-up track, the special effects, and the whole thing. Britney performes hits from her 3 albums \\"...Baby One More Time\\", \\"Oops!...I Did It Again\\", and \\"Britney\\". Britney has never disapointed me, and for that, she has millions of fans. Recently her little mishap in the UK didn't help for her persona, but, who can blame her. I'd be the same way!<br />\\"OOPS!...I DID IT AGAIN\\"<BR>This number opens the concert. It is naturally lip-sunc, but if you listen closely you can hear Britney sing a little. It's a great start.<br />\\"(YOU DRIVE ME) CRAZY\\"<BR>Remixed. Britney usually opens with this number. She tackles this one with tuns of dance moves and all pure Britney.<br />\\"OVERPROTECTED\\" <BR>The newest single for the USA. This is performed as the album version. This is my favorite track off of the \\"Britney\\" album.<br />\\"MEDLEY:\\"<BR>a) Born To Make You Happy<BR>b) Lucky<BR>c) Sometimes<BR>This Medley basically gets rid of the \\"...Baby One More Time\\" and \\"Oops!...I Did It Again\\" album hits. It's nice to have a Britney medley!<br />\\"BOYS\\"<BR>This is a FUNKY song. It's a R&B-type dance track. Britney is very sexy.<br />\\"STRONGER\\"<BR>One of my most favorite songs. The dancing is increadible!<br />\\"I'M NOT A GIRL, NOT YET A WOMAN\\"<BR>Britney sang A LITTLE BIT on this track. It's very beautiful.<br />\\"I LOVE ROCK 'N' ROLL\\"<BR>This is more fast than the album version. It's funky.<br />\\"WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE ME\\"<BR>The Britney-Justin song, since they recently broke up I'm sure she's not very thrilled about it. I like what it has to say.<br />\\"LONELY\\"<BR>This track or \\"Boys\\" is bound to be a single off of the album.<br />\\"DON'T LET ME BE THE LAST TO KNOW\\"<BR>My absolute favorite Britney song. I wish she would have performed it because she can perform the hell out of it!<br />\\"ANTICIPATING\\"<BR>A Disco-type track. It's in a CRAYOLA type of background.<br />\\"I'M A SLAVE 4 U\\" (Encore)<BR>Very sexy and better than the album version. It's like the MTV Music Awards 2001.<br />\\"...BABY ONE MORE TIME\\" (Encore)<BR>This BIG-WET encore. A nice end to the show!<br />For the retards out there that think Britney won't be around for a long time...THINK AGAIN. She'll always be around. I LOVE YOU BRITNEY!
B00001OH7J|5.0|Photo Finish is perhaps the late Rory Gallagher's finest album.  Strong from the beginning to the end, the tracks are filled with energy and the enthusiasm of musicians who love what they are doing.  For this album, Rory went with a three-piece band, reducing or eliminating keyboards, and pushing his guitar sound up right up front.  Long time bass player Gerry McAvoy, and drummer Ted McKenna complete the musical trio.  The sound is harder and grittier than previous albums like &quot;Calling Card&quot;.  The music definitely has a &quot;live&quot; sound, with Rory making heavy use of a flanger.  This recording contains some of Rory's fastest up-tempo tunes.<br />Known primarily for playing traditional blues, Rory breaks out of that box with some straight rock tunes that rank among his best songs ever.  &quot;Shadow Play&quot; is a masterpiece, with some nice cord changes and a perfect solo.  &quot;Shin Kicker&quot; is another song sure to get you moving.  &quot;Cruise On Out&quot; is probably the fastest tune Rory ever recorded.  The light-hearted &quot;Last of the Independants&quot;, is a fun &quot;mobster&quot; story song.  &quot;Overnight Bag&quot; is a soulful mid tempo number with a fine Gallagher vocal.<br />Even on the slower bluesy numbers Rory keeps his sound electric, sticking with his strat. No acoustic numbers this time out. &quot;Fuel to the Fire&quot; is a highlight, pure electrically charged  blues, melodic and filled with emotion.  On &quot;Cloak And Dagger&quot;, Rory is having so much fun he takes a couple of solo breaks, the second features some tasteful slide.  As for the extra tracks, &quot;Early Warning&quot; is a nice up-tempo addition, and &quot;Juke Box Annie&quot; is a throwback blues number that is unlike any of the other songs on the album.<br />Continuing to produce the best music of his career, Rory's next two studio recordings &quot;Top Priority&quot; and &quot;Jinx&quot; followed in the same musical direction established here, more of a rock sound than blues.  Both are fine recordings, but neither has quite the fire or raw energy of Photo Finish.<br />Rory was very unpretentious, a &quot;blue collar&quot; blues player, who took to the stage usually wearing just jeans and a flannel shirt.  Playing from the gut, pouring his sweat into the music, he was largely unknown, except to a small group of loyal fans.  He has passed on, but his spirit lives on in his music, and I will always be appreciative of the influence he had on my own modest efforts on the guitar.re of a rock sound than blues.

0385474547|4.0|I found this book a extraordinary and profound piece of literature.  It taught me many ways of the Ibo people in Nigeria.  Many of their traditions and cultures were learned and taught as well as the effect of European imperialism. It tells a simple story of a man, Okwonkwo, and how he lived his life through many unexplanable emotions.  Anger dominated him because of all the things that were done to him and his people.  How many of the horrible things done to him to change who the Ibo were affected him.  While telling the story Achebe seemed to put a profound and ironic way of how life was and still is for some of these people and what the domination of some men could do to other men and drive them to unexplainable things.
6305090564|5.0|Don't be afraid to admit that you like this movie.  Deep Rising is a terrific monster flick that delivers all that can be expected of a film of this type.  You get thrills, chills, kills and more than a few laughs.  The computer generated creature from the depths, is an ugly and vicious man-eater, that manifests itself in several different forms throughout the film.  A twisting shiny gray mass, with numerous slimy looking tentacles, capable of great speed.  This terror from the deep devours its victims with zest.  All in all, a very cool looking monster, and a formidable opponent.<br />The human cast is not bad either.  Treat Williams as \\"Finnegan\\" is a steady, likeable leading man, delivering some incredibly silly lines with an engaging smirk on his face.  Pickpocket Famke Janssen, is dynamite in a red dress, and handles a gun like a pro.  Comic relief is provided by Kevin J. O'Connor as \\"Joey\\", a character you will either love or hate.  Anthony Heald as \\"Canton\\" the pompous ships owner, provides the \\"weasel factor\\".

B00005RIKD|4.0|As others have mentioned, the performance on this live CD took place on September 11, 2001. As a result, it has a somewhat somber, introspective tone and doesn't include some Sting/Police work that might otherwise have been used, but seemed inappropriate in light of that day's events.<br />The result, though, is a joy to listen to and worth putting on repeat in your CD player. The songs have all been re-worked to be more jazzy in their arrangement and instrumentation and several songs seem to have been given a complete overhaul.<br />My only criticism is that two songs that were shown being rehearsed on the DVD weren't included on the music CD -- Mad About You (from the Soul Cages) and Desert Rose (from Brand New Day).
6304981635|5.0|Shortly after completing work on his fourth film, Enter the Dragon, legendary martial artist and actor, Bruce Lee died unexpectedly in his sleep.  Immensely popular in Asia, Lee believed that his new film, backed by Warner Brothers, would be his crossover vehicle into the mainstream American film market.  Released after his death, Enter the Dragon achieved worldwide acclaim, and Bruce Lee was elevated to almost mythical status by his legion of fans across the world.<br />Of course what distinguishes this film is the fight scenes.  Choreographed by Lee, most of the fights are short and sweet.  If you get hit, you get hurt.  Lee had said that most of his real life fights were usually just seconds long.  This blitzkrieg style of fighting, is a totally different from what was common practice.  Making a clear case, for the effectiveness of concentrated and focused action.  And the action is spread around among all the actors.  Lee does not \\"hog\\" the fight scenes, letting the anticipation build, making his scenes really special.  \\"The battle with the guards was magnificent\\", to quote Han.  The final contest with Han in the room of mirrors may not be completely logical, but it is visually stimulating, and an interesting technical achievement.<br />The special edition 25th anniversary DVD includes a few additional scenes that were cut from the original release.  They provide a little more background about Han, the Shaolin renegade.  Not crucial, but nice to know.  Among the extras, is a short documentary featuring Bruce Lee interviews, a featurette about the making of the film, as well as a series of short clips of the recollections of Lee's widow.  Very informative stuff.  Finally, if you read through the notes about the history of martial arts films, you will note that the actor Lee fights with in the film's opening sequence, is none other than Sammo Hung.  Nice backflips, Sammo!<br />What else Bruce Lee could have gone on to do on screen, we will never really know.  Enter the Dragon is a classic in the genre, and should be part of the collection of any martial arts fan. This is a film that can be watched and enjoyed again and again.w.

The movie unfolds backwards as you watch it so that, by the end, you finally figure out how it's all started.<br />The writing on this movie is excellent and, like The Sixth Sense, it's one of those flicks you'll want to watch again and again to really try to make sense of it.

B000002LUB|5.0|When it comes to musical collaborations, you never can tell what will happen.  Ronnie James Dio's previous work with Black Sabbath produced two fine studio albums, one \\"Heaven & Hell\\", is usually rated by fans as one of Sabbath's best.  After leaving the group, Dio went on to a long and successful solo career.<br />Long hailed as one of metal's most powerful vocalists, Ronnie rejoined his former bandmates to produce an under appreciated metal masterpiece.  Dehumanizer, is a powerful collection of music, with minimal filler material.  Compared to Sabbath's recent recordings featuring Tony Martin's vocals, the music here definitely has a harder edge.  Dio has ways been acknowledged as an outstanding songwriter.  His contributions in that department take the level of quality of this recording above the typical Sabbath effort.  No other Sabbath vocalist could give us songs like \\"I\\", \\"Too Late\\", and \\"Master of Insanity\\".<br />Tony Iommi, a heavy metal legend and creator of dozens of classic riffs, seems truly reborn here.  His playing, while maintaining his signature tone seems to be exploring areas he has not been in before.  The riffs are some of the best he's come up with in some time.  The tone is raw, with some wide mood and tempo swings.  \\"After All The Dead\\" is slow number, the opening notes of which just drip evil, setting up a heavy groove.  \\"TV Crimes\\" is \\"speed Sabbath\\", played at an upbeat tempo favored by Ronnie in his solo work, the song rocks, and has a killer Iommi solo.  \\"I\\" is a powerful heavy duty number featuring major wah wah usage.  \\"Master of Insanity\\" has an \\"electric\\" edge, and a pounding groove that suits Dio storytelling vocal style.  There are also two versions of the powerful song \\"Time Machine\\", both are great, but the Wayne's World version seems tighter, and the lyrics work better.<br />Geezer Butler's bass is not particularly prominent in the mix.  And Vinny Appice's drumming is serviceable rather than flashy.  So Ronnie Dio and Tony Iommi really do dominate the sound.  Will Dio ever team with the Sabs again?  Who knows?  What can be said is that this particular short-lived reunion produced one of the heaviest and best Sabbath recordings ever.ony Iommi really do dominate the sound.

As a mother of three I say this story has a fantastic storyline.  children both young and old will love this movie.  It is the first time a movie has stayed so close to the books storyline.  I highly recommend getting this movie if you have children or even if you are a kid at heart.
B000059ZLH|5.0|Last week, I had the opportunity to see DT perform in CT.  The next day, I bought the DVD on amazon.com.  Well, I ... watched it that night.  I was quite blown away with the production of this concert.  The sound quality is excellent -period!  They did alot of split screens, showing bass, keys, and guitar doing melodic runs together, which was nice to see.  Occasionally though, some angles were not in synch with (for example) a guitart solo.  The additional 1-hour of live footage was a treat.  Alot of show for the buck.  A great buy if you have big screen TV and a good sound system. A must have for any DT fan.
0425152251|2.0|The consensus of reviewers seems to be that Sophie's World fails as a novel but succeeds as an introduction to philosophy.  I found the book to fail as much as an introduction to philosophy as it does as a novel.  In fact the book is not an introduction to philosophy at all but an introduction to the author's take on various philosophers, which is a very different thing.  It is as if an author presented an introduction to classical art that consisted of a book of his sketches of the Sistine Chapel and the Mona Lisa, or an introduction to classical music that consisted of a tape of him humming a few bars of Beethoven's Fifth or the Messiah.  Great artists, musicians and philosophers are great precisely because they do what they do so much better than we ordinary mortals do.  This is not snobbishness.  The snobbishness consists in thinking that by distilling Plato's philosophy into a few paragraphs one can communicate Plato's philosophy as well as or better than he did.  This is an acceptable procedure only if an author makes it clear that what he is doing is necessarily inadequate, and does it in such a way that the reader is encouraged to read the philosophers themselves and not rely on a distillation.  An introduction should whet the appetite for a philosopher, not satisfy it.  A good example of a book that does just this is G.K. Chesterton's book on Thomas Aquinas.  Read Chesterton on Aquinas, then Gaarder, and you will see just how inadequate Gaarder's approach to Aquinas is.<BR> Gaarder's \\"summary\\" approach to the philosophers results in some unintentionally hilarious moments.  His take on Plato consists almost entirely of a lecture - one of the longest in the book - on Plato's theory of Ideas.  Many pages later, when discussing Hume, Sophie has this to say:<br />\\"Your philosophers are always talking about 'man' and 'humans', and now here's another treatise on 'human nature.'  It's as if this 'human' is a middle-aged man.  I mean, life begins with pregnancy andbirth, and I've heard nothing about diapers and crying babies so far.  And hardly anything about love and friendship.\\"<br />Plato, of course, was deeply concerned with love and friendship and wrote some penetrating work on the subject in the Symposium, Lysis, Phaedrus and other dialogs.  The trial and death of Socrates as written by Plato in the Apology, Crito, and Phaedo may be understood as an extended meditation on the true meaning of friendship.  How can someone have been \\"introduced\\" to Plato yet think that no philosopher up to the time of Hume ever talked about love and friendship?  Because in this book we get Gaarder's Plato, not the real Plato, and Gaarder's Plato is only interested in what Gaarder is interested in, specifically the theory of ideas. He is but a shadow of the real Plato and is well-deserving of Sophie's scorn, as are all the other cardboard-cutout philosophers that fill the book.  The danger is that a reader will think the washed-out Plato we get in Sophie's World is the real Plato and be deterred from reading Plato himself.  There is no indication that Sophie herself has any interest in reading Plato.  Why should she?  As far as she knows, Plato is just a quaint old guy with some mildly interesting but ultimately irrelevant thoughts about eternal forms.  It would have been far better if those brown envelopes Sophie discovered contained some actual Platonic dialogs rather than mediocre summaries of them.  The same holds for most of the other philosophers in the book, and the reader would be well-advised to read the philosophers themselves rather than Gaarder's (or mine, or anyone else's) summaries of them.  Kierkegaard wrote better than anyone who writes about Kierkegaard.<BR> A minor but irritating feature of the book is Gaarder's elevation of contemporary feminist ideology to what amounts to a philosophical first principle.  The end of Gaarder's lectures usually consist of a thumbs-up or thumbs-down on the philosopher in light of contemporary feminism, regardless of what came before.  Aquinas was bad because he didn't think women could be philosophers.  Plato was good because he thought women might be.  We might agree with Plato against Aquinas, but as philosophers we should not accept feminist ideology uncritically anymore than we do Plato's theory of ideas or Aquinas's proofs of the existence of God.  It is precisely the vocation of philosophers to sniff out these cultural givens that are \\"obvious\\" to everyone and put them under rational scrutiny.  Socrates did it to the ancient Greek's uncritical acceptance of mythology.  I wonder if he would do it today to Gaarder's uncritical acceptance of feminism?
0393312836|5.0|Can you program an orange, which is appeeling on the outside and full of juicness on the inside, to behave in a clockwork manner. The novel, A Clockwork Orange, firmly states \\"No!\\"  <br />Although the main character, Alex, is ultraviolent in manner and his horrorshow activites make readers cringe, it is his choice to behave in this nature, no matter how shocking it may be.  Once he becomes programed to behave according to the laws and moral restrants, then he becomes a tool and is manipulated to the point that he is less of a human being.<br />I'm not going to go into any more specifics of the novel because they have already been firmly stated by previous reviewers.  However, I will say that I have not seen the movie version of the novel and frankly do not see how it could acturately portray the author's true intentions without the twenty-first chapter.  The final chapter makes the novel, in some sense, an allegory of youth and shows that people are not clockwork--they are not machines that solely follow the forces of good or evil.  Instead, people are living beings who do not necessarily follow a set path in life.  <br />A great book.  I only wish that I hadn't burned through the whole 192 pages in two days.
B00005QG9J|5.0|i wish i could rate this cd 10 stars because i would. this is by far the most musical cd of all the rock cd's i have. incubus goes from the very mellow and enjoyable- mexico, to the hard hitting-just a phase and others. i bought the cd because i was looking for that different sound that i heard on wish you were here. i got the cd and before i even played it- i admired the lyrics. there just seemed to be so much behind those lyrics. then i put the cd in-and i almost died right there. i loved it. it is one of those cd's you can listen to the whole thing-straight through and not have to wade through a bunch of songs that are there only to take up space. this cd is different from all the other incubus cd's. none of the cd's are the same. they have been through so many different styles and tried so many different things. that's what makes listening to this such a pleasure. the musicianship that goes into incubus is amazing. you really should buy this cd. it is a classic in my mind. i love it.

0385503954|5.0|Winner of Britain's 1998 Booker prize for \\"Amsterdam,\\" Ian McEwan narrowly missed winning again for \\"Atonement,\\" a novel of breathtaking reach and grasp, power and subtlety, as perfectly structured as a Michaelangelo sculpture. Last year's Booker winner, Peter Carey's \\"The True History of the Kelly Gang\\" is a fine, entertaining, really good novel, but not a patch on \\"Atonement.\\" It's difficult to reign in the hyperbole in discussing this masterful, riveting, incisive book, but I'll try.<br />The story is told in four very different segments. The long first section is set on the Tallis family's comfortable country estate in 1935. At its center is Briony Tallis, 13 when the story opens, 77 at the novel's close. The second section jumps to 1940 for a graphic, heartrending depiction of the rout at Dunkirk from the viewpoint of Robbie, a family prot&eacute;g&eacute; and gardener's son, and the third returns to Briony, a trainee nurse in a London hospital, awaiting the Dunkirk evacuees. The last section, narrated by Briony, reflects on the past from the vantage point of old age.<br />As the story opens, Briony, the youngest of three children, and a prolific short story writer, has turned her hand to playwrighting to celebrate the coming visit of her older brother, Leon, and involve some cousins displaced by their parents' impending divorce. But complementing Briony's vivid imagination is a passion for precision and order and directing the recalcitrant, even manipulative cousins, into her meticulous vision proves an unwieldy challenge. \\"The self-contained world she had drawn with clear and perfect lines had been defaced with the vague scribble of other minds, other needs; and time itself, so easily sectioned on paper into acts and scenes, was even now dribbling uncontrollably away.\\"<br />While she is wrestling with this frustration, Briony views an incomprehensible scene from the window: her older sister Cecilia disrobing and jumping into the fountain while her old childhood friend, Robbie, looks on. The scene spurs Briony's imagination while the cousins rouse her ire and finally she abandons her play, ticket booth, posters and all and runs outdoors to take her frustrations out on the shrubbery. Wit and despair spark off one another in McEwan's acute portrayal of childhood intensity.<br />\\"It is hard to slash at nettles for long without a story imposing itself, and Briony was soon absorbed and grimly content, even though she appeared to the world like a girl in the grip of a terrible mood.\\"<br />But, tiring of her heroic fantasy with the nettles, Briony returns to herself, more freighted with melancholy than before. She decides to stand on a small bridge until something happens. With perfect irony, McEwan foreshadows disaster: \\"She would simply wait on the bridge, calm and obstinate, until events, real events, not her own fantasies, rose to her challenge, and dared to dispel her insignificance.\\"<br />The reader knows disaster is coming, but what, exactly, remains a mystery. Given Briony's dramatic capriciousness, it could be anything from murder to adolescent embarrassment. We know only that it reverberates down the years through Briony's life. And when at last it stands revealed in all its naked avoidability, McEwan jumps abruptly, jarringly, into the maelstrom of war and defeat.<br />Where the second section pins the reader in the horror and immediacy of Robbie's every intense moment, the first section roves from one viewpoint to another, riffling through the thoughts and feelings of each character and reflecting the characters in each other's eyes. There's competent, diplomatic Cecilia, flustered and preoccupied with Robbie's stiff behavior, and her mother, Emily, half bedridden, ineffectual and given to fusses but with a sense of herself as the matriarch with an internal finger on the pulse of the entire house, the cousins' bewilderment and insecurity, Leon's easygoing malleability, his tycoon friend's desire for a war to ensurethe success of his coated chocolate bar and ardent Robbie's class uncertainties and intellectual confidence.<br />Psychologically nuanced, there isn't a wasted word, though the writing is not spare. Every sentence furthers the reader's understanding while moving the characters forward in their own groping self-actualization and misapprehension. At the core it's a novel about atonement, about forgiveness and unforgivability, about how some things cannot be undone. It's also a novel about love and war, emotion and intellect, society and the often clueless world of one's own head, childhood and adulthood and the gulf between. It's a novel about the process of writing, of imagination, of misunderstanding. It's an ambitious beautiful book, which succeeds on every level.

B00003CXI1|3.0|I realize I could be tarred and feathered and run out of town for giving Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone only three stars, but please let me explain before you take up the brush and choke a few chickens.<br />I'm a huge Harry Potter fan. I was into Harry from the first book. In other words, the hype didn't compel me to read Harry. It was actually my mother. She read the first book and told me to go find it. I did. And it wasn't easy, let me tell you. Book stores at the time weren't stocked to overflowing with Harry Potter merchandise.<br />It took me a little while to get into the first book (for some reason, I had to keep reading and re-reading the first chapter before I \\"got\\" it), but I soon developed Pottermania. I bought every book as it was published (I even waited in line at a local bookstore when the fourth book was released at midnight), plus all the books on CD read by Jim Dale and I even purchased the British versions of the books via Amazon.com UK.<br />The CDs are amazing. Jim Dale is a master storyteller who performs all the voices flawlessly. (See my reviews of the CDs for more information.) I couldn't bear to get out of my car a time or two as Dale read the books. I was totally and completely engrossed.<br />So when I first heard that they were making a movie of the first book (with a movie per book planned), I was both excited and quite skeptical. I didn't think any Hollywood version could match the Harry Potter I created in my mind, fueled by Jim Dale's skillful readings and characterizations.<br />Well, I was right. But not because Hollywood took liberties with Harry Potter (the way they did with, say, the first Lord of the Rings movie); rather, because the movie was such a literal adaptation that I felt myself growing ever more bored, waiting for what I knew to be the next scene.<br />Admittedly, Daniel Radcliffe is a perfect Harry Potter. But other characters didn't fare so well in my opinion. Malfoy, for example, wasn't leering and sneering enough. (And he didn't sound like Jim Dale's portrayal of him in the CD versions.) Snape wasn't sinister enough. And I wasn't bowled over by the movie version of Ron Weasley, either.<br />And -- horror of horrors! -- I thought the Quidditch match as filmed by director Chris Columbus was a snooze-fest. Worse yet, it wasn't how I pictured it to be. Or, maybe it was EXACTLY how I pictured it to be. I don't know. All I can tell you is that I wasn't amazed or thrilled with the Quidditch playing in the movie.<br />I know most Harry Potter fans thought the literal adaptation was being faithful to J.K. Rowling's books. But I thought the adaptation was so literal that I knew what was around every corner. It was as if I was watching a Harry Potter documentary, rather than a feature film.<br />As I watched the movie, I kept thinking two things: (1) This is a movie, and (2) My imagination is so much greater than this movie.<br />By the first point, I mean that I couldn't suspend disbelief long enough to get into the movie. I was always keenly aware it was a movie, a movie made from my favorite books. Again, it felt like I was watching a documentary of the Hogwarts school student.<br />By the second point, I mean that the sights, sounds, smells and experiences of the Harry Potter books already HAD a place in my mind. This movie didn't add to them; in fact, the movie detracted from them. It simply couldn't compete with the Harry Potter I safeguarded in my head.<br />So where does that leave me regarding the DVD release of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, and -- more importantly -- the rest of the movies planned for each book?<br />Sadly, I don't think I'll be buying the DVD. It just doesn't stand up to repeated viewings.<br />Plus -- and this is the truly sad part -- I don't think I'll be watching any more of the movies as they're released. There's simply no point in doing so.<br />The Harry Potter I know and love already lives -- in my head.<br />And that's where I'd like him to remain.
B00003CXXO|3.0|An interesting mix of very good sci-fi that works, and very high concept that doesn't.<br />The Kubrick-Spielberg mix has resulted in the film's greatest flaw -- its uncertain tone. Is it \\"hard\\" sci-fi, like \\"Blade Runner?\\" Is it Spielbergian fantasy like \\"E.T.?\\" Or is it, at its heart, \\"Pinocchio?\\"<br />The result is as mired in identity crisis as something like Disney's \\"The Black Cauldron\\" -- technically excellent, but ultimately unaffecting and confusing.<br />Despite Spielberg pulling every heart-tugging scene out of his bag of tricks, and some infectiously sweet performances by Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law, we can't totally bond with the characters because we can't identify with the movie as a whole.<br />It's not terrible. It's certainly watchable, at points it's likeable and Spielberg is always good at evoking an emotional response from his audience.<br />But on the whole, it's somewhat like what would have resulted if someone had asked \\"Charlie Brown\\" creator Charles Schulz to finish a Monet. It would come out alright, but not exactly be an effective mix.

0790734850|5.0|I admit, I have not yet read the book by James Ellroy, but I am planning on it. I couldn't resist. Anyway, all I really can say about this film can be summed up in one word: incredible. The writing is expert, the colors are gorgeous, the story spellbinding and the cast! Just look at the cast list! You've got nothing short of brilliant performances from Guy Pearce, Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Kim Basinger, Danny DeVito and James Cromwell! I'd have to say that this is one of the best noir films I have ever seen, right up there with 'Chinatown'. The film centers on the brutal killing of six innocent people at a resturant called 'The Nite Owl'. There are three cops involved in the investigation in one way or another, and each is troubled in their own way. First there's Detective Lieutenant Ed Exley (Guy Pearce), who's forever been in his father's shadow although he is tainted by the fact that he only seems to care about his career. There's Wendall 'Bud' White (Russell Crowe), who witnessed the brutal killing of his mother by his drunken father, and can best be described as a bomb threatening to explode. Finally there's Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey), a guy who gladly sets up movie stars and then arrests them for fame on the cover of the 'Hush Hush' magazine. All see themselves as rivals for one reason or another, but for the case they're taking on now, they must unite. The movie also features James Cromwell as a head cop who might not be what he seems, Danny DeVito as the snivelling writer of 'Hush, Hush' and Kim Basinger playing a Veronica Lake look alike hooker. All of them never cease to surprise you. There's everything in this film and everything in this film is enjoyable. Every time I watch it, I discover something new or find something new I enjoy about it. It's one of those movies that grabs you and doesn't let go, and it does this with relative restraint. You don't even know it's happening. It's incredibly involving. The film does feature some violence, but it'snothing that cannot be handled. Overall, I can say with confidence that 'L.A. Confidential' is one of the best films made in the 1990's and definately one of the best modern film noir.
B000002LIM|5.0|This was the first score album I ever purchased and it remains a firm favourite of mine.  This for me is Elfman`s finest composition and the most consistant of Elfman`s scores in terms of listening enjoyment with excellent themes and melodies playing throughout the score.  An essential soundtrack and also a good introduction to anyone who is unfamiliar with Danny Elfman`s work or new to the film soundtrack listening experience.
B000002B7U|4.0|The naysayers can pretend to know, but the fact remains that The Ultimate Sin is really the last Ozzy solo disc that can be said to possess any heavy consistency to it. Driven by Jake E. Lee's notoriously blazing riffs, Randy Castillo's volcanic drumming and Ozzy's trademark whine, The Ultimate Sin is an example of 80's hard rock done right.  Tracks like \\"Secret Loser,\\" \\"Lightning Strikes\\" and \\"Fool Like You\\" destroy any of the solo stuff he's done in recent history (despite present guitarist Zakk Wylde's amazing abilities).  In the annals of Ozzyology, The Ultimate Sin takes third place only behind \\"Blizzard of Oz\\" and \\"Diary of a Madman.\\"
B00003CY6L|5.0|I throughly enjoyed watching this movie. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time wanting the two to meet each other again! I suggest watching this movie when feeling depressed because it will surely raise the spirits of everyone and make you laugh.  The movie is also great to watch with friends.  I cannot wait to see the movie again when it comes out!!!
B0000025RI|5.0|What more can we say about Michael Jackson? He IS and will always be the King of Pop. Come on. Who else has sold 45 million albums? Only michael has. I absolutly love Thriller. From, Wanna Be Starting Somthing to Lady in my Life, every single song speaks volumes. They are, and will always be classics. I don't think we can say any different. The lyrics, beat and movements are perfect. Just how the artist wanted them. Some times I will just be sitting there,and no matter what mood I can always find a Michael Jackson song that will fit my feelings at that momment. And to tell you the truth, it feels good. His new album Invincible is also an exceptional one. I mean who can move or even come close to him? Ever since I was a little girl, I have have always listened to Michael Jackson. I grew up on him. Everyone in my family likes him too. I don't blame them for always popping in Thriller, or Bad whenever they felt like it. I love the way Michael sings. Expecially the way he sang on Thriller. Who else could beat that? Certinly no one I know, or probably anyone I'll ever know. Michael will, and always will be the true King of Pop.
B00005QZWJ|5.0|It truly brings the magic of the Lord of the Rings to your home. It varies from the fun-loving fiddle tunes of hobbits, to the beautiful laments of the elves (those are my favorite). The amazing beaty and grace, sorrow and joy of the elves is made skillfully into ear-soothing music. It captures the intensity of the Mines of Moria, and the sadness in the fall of Gandalf. I love the adventure in the traveling pieces.It is SOOOOO worth the money! I haven't stopped listening to it since I got it! It takes you on an amazing journey through Middle~Earth. A Beautiful ensemble, Howard Shore is a true genius.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|I have read several reviews that said that &quot;Donnie Darko' is difficult to classify; indeed, it is composed of an exotic blend of sci-fi, horror, teen angst, and comedy, all seasoned with bits of physics and philosopy, While not a perfectly realized film, it is the kind of movie that many people, myself included, wish there were more of. These are ones that pose challenging or interesting questions, then ususally leave it up to the viewer to come up with answers. Often, there are no real answers, of course, but the thought process is definately stimulated. I appreciate that. I suppose that &quot;Donnie Darko' is best recommended to people who do not like pat answers. <br />This is the story of a boy who is suffering from some major mental problems. He hallucinates, often seeing a hideous, man-sized bunny rabbit which commands him to commit all sorts of anti-social acts. He thinks he can see a sort of time travel path leading people on to whatever is next in store for them. He believes the world is about to end. Is Donnie insane, or has he stumbled upon some truith about existence? Is he a victim of the American upper-middle class lifestyle, one which truly does have some 'Alice Through the Looking-glass' elements to it, or is he more highly evolved than those around him? Did the world, in fact, end, as Donnie foresaw? An Edgar Allen Poe quote came to mind near the film's end: &quot;Perchance everything we see or seem is but a dream within a dream.' <br />What I can't describe here are the visuals, which are fascinating. Perhaps it was just my imagination, but it seemed as if every scene had a slight dream-like quality to it, implying that everything I was seeing could be either a memory or a fantasy about some future event.<br />Richard Kelly has the right stuff to become a major new force in movies. I have been convinced of Jake Gyllenhall's tremendous acting skills since 'October Sky', another highly recommended movie. <br />NOTE: I gave 'Danny Darko' four stars. My real rating is 4 1/2. I had a problem with the path and development of one character [Roberta Sparrow], and this prevented my giving it 5 stars.
B000003S0I|5.0|It's now been over two years since I first heard Larks' Tongues in Aspic, and it's still probably my single favorite album of all time.  It's a complex, challenging, dark, and utterly beautiful album that changed the way I thought about music, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone with even a passing interest in progressive music.
B00005614M|5.0|This album was a great bridge between the bebop that Miles played with Gillespie/Parker and Duke Ellington/Claude Thornhill big band style music. This became cool jazz, with Gerry Mulligan at the helm, who was a large part of this disc. Mulligan helped arrange much of this material, along with Gil Evans. This was the beginning of a great period between Miles Davis and Gil Evans. The remastered version makes for an even clearer look at great art.
B00005OMTT|5.0|(The path of excess leads to the tower of wisdom. - W. Blake)<br />I always knew that Enigma was an incredible band I just never knew how much until now. All I owned before this was their latest full-length release \\"The Screen Behind The Mirror\\". Almost two years went by before I considered buying something else by them and that's when (to my good fortune) \\"LSD: Love Sensuality Devotion\\" came out which contains all of their biggest hits such as \\"Sadness\\" and \\"Return To Innocence\\", along with new favorites (to me, that is) \\"T.N.T. For The Brain\\", \\"I Love You, I'll Kill You\\" ... (love the title!) ..., \\"Principles Of Lust\\", \\"Mea Culpa\\", and \\"Age Of Loneliness\\" which has Egyptian sound styling with Middle Eastern singing. (I think...) Other highlights include their brand new song \\"Turn Around\\", which has an edgier sound compared to its usual norm, \\"Gravity Of Love\\" and \\"Silence Must Be Heard\\" which both feature the lush female vocals of Ruth-Ann (which sings in the band Olive), and \\"Beyond The Invisible\\" which bares a striking resemblance to the closing song they play in the end of my favorite fantasy movie \\"Legend\\". (Watch the movie and then listen to this to understand what I mean...) So if you enjoy gregorian style singing with heavy breathing and words of passion and inspiration amidst subtle, sometimes pounding grooves than Enigma's Greatest Hits compilation is for you. Die-hard fans are recommended to buy this simply for \\"The Landing\\" and \\"Turn Around\\" while newcomers are recommended to buy this simply because it's the perfect place to start.<br />Another good thing about this album is how all of the songs blend in seamlessly together, just like they do in their other records. It also ends with a beautifully ethereal song called \\"The Cross Of Changes\\" which reminds me of the type of music you'd find on a Elevation (various artists) cd, which I also recommend...<br />(The soul belongs to GOD but the body belongs to us. - Rasputin)
0553573403|5.0|A Game of Thrones is the first volume in a series six books. I took a chance and bought the first two volumes at the same time -before I ever read a review of the books and I have honestly never regretted this act. A Game of Thrones introduces the reader to a vast history of humanity, inhumanity and everything in between. The book(s) is full of captivating characters, both horrific and heroic. Encounters within it's pages shape the history of the world and the reader is spoiled in every possible way when it comes to delivering an intriguing plot.<br />You will never know what hit you - but suddenly have to flip back several pages to reread the unfolding events you just saw, heard, smelled and tasted through Martin's wonderful prose.<br />There is little left to say. Martin has created a masterpiece and to try and explain all the good parts of this book(s) will surly take as long as the 700+ pages of the book(s) itself.<br />Make sure to check these series out...Enjoy!
B00005JKED|1.0|...that this film received anything other than a Turkey of the Year Award, much less the Oscar nominations. Between the offensive black stereotype portrayals, the blatant gaping plotholes, and the outrageously unrealistic action climax this was the worst film I saw in 2001. It's nice that Denzel got recognized for his rich acting career, but this wasn't the film to award and is ironic that it is his most one-dimensional stereotypical role.
0790733900|5.0|COOL HAND LUKE stars Paul Newman as &#34;Cool Hand&#34; Luke Jackson, a lonely man sent to prison for cutting off the tops of parking meters and not knowing why. Newman has had several memorable roles, but his turn in COOL HAND LUKE is one of his best and my favorite of Newman's movies. The movie is filled with unforgettable scenes (Lucile washing the car; the egg scene) and lines (&#34;What we got here is failure to communicate.&#34;). The film has a great supporting cast and George Kennedy won an Academy Award. The movie can be described as a typical 1960s antiestablishment rebellion movie. However, the film is much more than that. At its core is a story of humanity shrouded in Christ-like imagery. In many ways, the film is a Christian parable (but without the dashboard Jesus sung about in the movie). A fun movie, well worth watching.
0800141806|5.0|In March 2002, Denzel Washington was awarded his first Best Actor Academy Award. It was a little late in coming. A myriad of roles in films like \\"Bone Collector\\" and \\"A Soldier's Story\\" were all Oscar performances. But perhaps his best was in \\"Philadelphia\\".  1993's \\"Philadelphia\\" is the brutal, uncompromising story of a hot young lawyer, fired by his firm for being gay and contracting a virus. The principal attorney charges that \\"Andy brought AIDS into our offices\\". A heart-rending, spell-binding expose of prejudice and bigotry in 20th Century America, \\"Philadelphia\\" is really a horror film, where the monster is you and I. We're guilty. We shun the homosexual and bar the AIDS victim. We extend little mercy to society's modern \\"lepers\\". Do you doubt it? Then pick up this marvelous DVD. In \\"Philadelphia\\", Tom Hanks won his first of 2 Academy Awards. Directed by ace Jonathan Demme, it features Antonio Banderas, Joanne Woodward, the late Jason Robards, and movie director Roger Corman. The award-winning soundtrack includes haunting Neil Young songs and music from Bruce Springsteen. The DVD has no chapter stops, no bios, no trailer, and no featurette. In fact, \\"Philadelphia\\" has no extras at all. That's OK. This 125 minute classic movie is all you need. Maybe more than you can take.

0812550706|4.0|Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card is an excellent, futuristic novel.  The youthful yet complex protagonist, Ender Wiggins, is an intriguing young boy who, at the age of 6, has been taken away from his family by choice to pursue his worldly duty.  Ender is taken to Battle School in which he is prepared to battle and defeat the \\"buggers\\", Earth's most feared attackers.  Ender is a social pariah who strives for acceptance from both his peers and superiors.  He thinks that the only way to gain acceptance is to succeed in Battle School; however, this feat is not as easy as it may seem.  The game in which Ender trains is actually the tactics in which the military uses to defeat the \\"buggers\\".  Ender does have special talents, but the reader is definitely aware that he is just an \\"average\\" boy.  He, as any other young boy, has obstacles such as bullies, loneliness, and confusion, to overcome.  By using his intellect, Ender conquers all of these obstacle.                                  <BR>     Card does a magnificent job in explaining the \\"buggers\\" and showing the necessity of the Battle School.  This novel makes one wonder what extent, we as humans, would go to prevent harm and difference.  We have seen how we deal with difference:  slavery, genocide, and prejudice.  What would occur if the entire human race was in danger and under attack;  would every difference be ignored and the major similarity, humanity, be focused upon?  We'll never know unless we encounter such a problem.  I would recommend this novel to anyone who wants to read an interesting yet intriguing novel.  I really enjoyed it although I'm not really fond of \\"sci-fi\\" novels.
B00004XQ83|4.0|Yes it was a great movie.  Yes it's loaded with great get back to basics bluegrass music.  No, it's not CD digital quality!<BR>  The only reason I gave it a 4 is just because it has a lot of good music.  But I was surprised at the low quality sound.  Maybe they were trying to get the authentic old time recording sound, but the sound quality is way below par for a digital CD.  It sounds like they took an old 78 LP, cleaned up the scratches and burned it onto a CD.  The highs are tinny, the base is muffled and unclear, and the stereo separation is minimal at best.<BR>  Methinks since it was such a hit and everyone was requesting it, so they rushed it out the door, poor quality and all.....
B0000634EV|5.0|Whew, where to start? First off, if you're a fan of the first album, you're going to like this album. It's definitely a bit more progressive at times, but still has the same alcoholic, depressive, blissed-out, southern metal vibe flowing through it. If you've never heard Down, and you're a fan of Black Sabbath, Eyehategod, or Pantera, odds are you'll love this album. This album is so head and shoulders above any of the horrible nu-metal bands that are so popular these days. I don't really want to describe the music too much, I think it should speak for itself. If you want to download some songs before you buy it, may I suggest listening to Lysergic Funeral Procession, Stained Glass Cross, Learn From This Mistake, and New Orleans is a Dying Whore. That should give you a pretty good understanding of what the vibe on the album is like. Oh, and if you are new to real metal check out these other bands: Soilent Green, Eyehategod, Satyricon, Emperor, Darkthrone, Morbid Angel, and Death for starters.
B00005T7I6|4.0|DICK TRACY is not a great movie. However, nor is it a bad movie. It's just a decent, good movie. It appeals most to boys, and is basically a toned down version of the of the blow-em-up cop movies of the modern era. Nevertheless, there is a romantic element that appeals to girls (besides the usual love story there's also Tess' tortured soul over her love for Tracy and a desire for a \\"normal\\" life; and there's also the love triangle with Breathless Mahoney).<br />The plot of the movie is fairly simple. Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino) is slowly taking over the city, picking off rival crime bosses and forces others to join his gang. His only problem is that Dick Tracy (Warren Beatty) is always hot on his tale. Then a new villian, The Blank, arrives in town and makes a proposal that Big Boy can't refuse.<br />The costumes and scenery are bright and colorful and look like a Dick Tracy comic strip come to life. Beatty does a decent job at both acting and directing. His Tracy does seem a bit emotionless at times, but that's the way Tracy is: he's a perfect cop who shows hardly any emotion.<br />Madonna doesn't do too bad of a job as Breathless Mahoney. Her acting isn't nearly as bad as the critics complained. She had all the seductivity of Mahoney, but seemingly not enough of her intelligence (a flaw she corrected in EVITA).<br />Stephen Soundheim wrote the movie's songs and won an Oscar for one. The musical score was composed by Danny Elfman and is quite reminiscent of BATMAN (I kept waiting for the bat signal to come on because the score is so similar). Also, the makeup is fantastic (see how many Hollywood stars you can find behind the silicone and latex wonders).<br />Overall, though the movie is somewhat outlandish, it is stylish. DICK TRACY isn't a thinking movie, but it is an interesting one. It proves to be an enjoyable piece of mind candy that doesn't take too long to chew.

C'mon!) and I couldn't stop laughing during the video for the Party Hard song (lol with WK headbanging while the words &quot;PARTY HARD&quot; are being strobed behind him that was hilariously bad) This is boring, tasteless music, and it brings back the days of the 80s. Pass this up, but I must say it makes a great coaster.

While I wasn't too into his music back in the day, I am much more now because the Pop music world has just gone down hill.  From such classics as &quot;True Colors&quot; and &quot;Against All Odds&quot; (Also check out the incredible remake by Mariah Carey) to my favorite song of his &quot;Something Happened on the Way to Heaven.&quot;  He truly had a great mix of lyrics and music.  He will always be remembered as one of the best singers/writers in history...hands down.  I reccomend this collection to anyone who enjoyed Popular music when it was GOOD. I give this a grade of A+!!

B0000027RL|3.0|The most popular album by a band I really like isn't exactly my favorite but what can you do? huh? Stop comparing Nirvana to pearl jam and then liking the other and then hating the other, Nirvana and PJ are very very different, Nirvana had a more punkish sound and then pearl Jam was very stadium-like. Another band who you can't compare to is Soundgarden, they are a metal band for people who don't even like metal.  The album is not too shabby but personally i think the early 90s grunge scene got too out of hand and made a few bands turn into successful giants and rock gods and then by 1994 they were unknown. If I were to choose a good PJ album stick with the later stuff, they got more musically talented and it's evident, Vs. is a tad better than Ten but it has a lot of that sound, Vitalogy, No Code, and Binaural make PJ look very good though, if you were to buy a PJ album just to see where PJ started buy this, but to get introduced to the band, start with the later stuff.
B00005JKED|4.0|This is a crisp, action thriller that focuses on one day, the training day of rookie narcotics undercover cop Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke). Jake is to be trained by veteren narcotics squad supervisor Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). Almost immediately, the viewer discerns that Jake's training day will be unlike any other day he has ever had.<br />Alonzo is an unbelievably corrupt cop, a once good cop who has lost his way. He now corrupts those cops who come under his command, all for one and one for all. Jake, the newcomer to the group, still innocent and wide eyed about his reasons for being a cop, will be a test of Alonzo's ability to corrupt the seemingly incorruptible. A series of trials and tribulations await Jake that day, situations that in his wildest imagination he could never have envisioned, all of them fiendishly and cleverly engineered by Alonzo. All of them insidious. All of them criminal. The only question is whether good will overcome evil.<br />Denzel Washington gives a performance of a lifetime and is certainly worthy of his Academy Award for Best Actor. He is at once both repelling and ingratiating as the character Alonzo Harris. His performance is charismatic, commanding, compelling, and completely mesmerizing as the narcotics commanding officer who has gone over the deep end and crossed a line that, once crossed, is final. Alonzo rules his territory and those within it with an iron hand, misjudging fear for respect. Murder and mayhem are the key words of his reign. He also seems to report to a trumvirate of corrupt police officials whom he refers to as the wisemen. Unfortunately for Alonzo, he has come to believe his own hype and bites off more than he can chew, ultimately pissing off the wrong people.<br />Ethan Hawke gives his best performance ever, imbuing Jake with a vulnerability and innocence that is believable and compelling, making Jake's struggle with his situation all the more angst ridden. It is a balance of the desire to succeed and get ahead with the instinctive knowledge of right and wrong. The viewer sees Jake going along with Alonzo at first, wanting to please his superior officer, even when some of the things Alonzo asks him to do are not only transgressions of police procedure, but violations of the very laws that they are employed as police to enforce. As Alonzo inveigles Jake to cross the line, the viewer can see the struggle within Jake take place, as shock gives way to a struggle for his very survival. The only question is whether Jake's better nature will ultimately allow him to do what he believes to be right. Ethan Hawke's a performance is  certainly worthy of its Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.<br />This is a gripping film, with a fair amount of violence. Wonderful performances are also given by Scott Glenn, a drug lord whose dream of retiring to the Phillipines is cut short, as well as by Macy Gray, who is sensational in the role of another drug lord's wife. While some of the film is over the top, it is a film that will not fail to entertain and engage the viewer.<br />The DVD is loaded with extras, providing a feature length adio commentary by director Antoine Fuqua, additional scenes, an alternate ending, two music videos, as well as a behind the scenes documentary. The picture and audio are both crystal clear. It is a first rate DVD.ahead with the instinctive knowledge of right and wrong.

B00005V3Z4|3.0|I have just seen the official website of the movie. It does give a 'scientific' explanation.<br />Now, knowing what actually happened in the movie, I can say that the idea was strikingly original, but the way it's executed is rather confusing. It could have been more clear, so that more viewers could understand it. Too bad, because the movie's theories on tangent universes are incredibly fascinating. A more experienced director would have made a classic with the same concept.

0553573403|2.0|I picked up this book with a lot of anticipation.  When I read that it is much like English history during the Wars of the Roses, I couldn't wait to get started.  After I read the Prologue, I still felt that I had made I good choice.  But after a few chapters, I was disappointed.  The book never did take off.<br />I did finish the book because I kept waiting for something exciting to happen.  It just never did.<br />The characters are flat and unbelievable.  Not only that, there are so many that I constantly referred to the appendix in the back of the book just to keep them straight.  But that didn't really help because many characters are listed more than once under different family names.<br />The reason that I gave the book two stars instead of just one is because of the writing.  It is very good prose.  In fact, it's better than most prose in today's mass market fiction.  However, even the excellent writing isn't enough to save the book.<br />I will also admit this: I rarely read fantasy.  To me, the benchmark of fantasy is The Lord of the Rings.  Perhaps I compared it too much with that story.<br />I won't be investing time or money with the other books in the series simply because there are no charaters that I cared about.
B000002UA0|5.0|Go back to 1967, The doors were making it big, and then the beatles released Sgt. Pepper and the doors and sgt. pepper made the so called &quot;summer of love.&quot; Then you have Pink Floyd who tells a bunch of psychedelic stories followed by eerie and unique sounds by drums, keyboard, bass, and guitar. Personally, the album is amazing, my favorite song is &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot; because it has a huge jam, improvisational sound that warps the mind. When I listen to that song I get tired 'cuz I'm in such a haze by all the sounds around me and the fact that the audio switches from speaker to speaker on my headphones. This album has a lot of pop ditties and sounds so unlike any other Pink Floyd you have ever heard because this was Syd's album, and what an album it was.
B00005JJX8|5.0|This is such a fine movie, but I have a question, when will we Hitchcock/Grant/Kelly fans get to see this film in DVD format?  The  stoy is amusing and fun, with good plot twists.  There is plenty of romance between Cary and Grace, but not sappy by any means.  Watch this movie and see for yourself if it is not DVD worthy.  It is much better than some of the other Hitchcock films that have relaesed on DVD!  So do us all a favor, pull it out of the vault and format it to DVD.  You won't be sorry!

He and his partner Ginger (HALLE BERRY) need someone to get them access to computer securities by hacking into main computer systems of the Gov't and transfer the money.  They find one of the best hackers on the planet, Stanley Jobson (HUGH JACKMAN).  Which they use the fact that he has been ban from ever seeing his daughter, because of past run ins with the FBI from a hacking, to giving he the possibility of a new life with her only if he does what Gabriel and Ginger want. <br />As the FBI close in not their plan the Gov't pulls out of the deal, but Gabriel will not stop the operation.  It remain in full force as Gabriel takes over.  It's kind of ironic because the operation is about being against terrorism yet but kills and terrorizes this bank in which he holds up and straps all the hostages in bombs.  He becomes a terrorist himself.  While talking with the FBI he ask them for a get away plane to meet them all at the airport and the FBI does they get in this bus that was metal wheel covers, so the tires can't be shot out which i thought was cool idea, and he takes them on their way to to the airport or that's what you think they end up making a detour and they hook up the bus to a helicopter and fly it into the city with the hostages and Stanley and Gabriel and his men.  The copter lands on the top of this building where there is an awaiting copter to take Gabriel and this men away.  Stanley gets one of the rocket launcher and shots the plane down and you think everyone is dead.  Right?  Wrong...later after everything seems to be normal you see Ginger, who was supposedly killed back at the bank, walk into a bank and transfer money from Gabriel's war against terrorism account to a different account.  Then she walks to a boat where Gabriel is waiting for her and they go off. <br />The movie was kind of weird but it kept me interested and that's the sign of a good movie.  Gabriel did get what he wanted, the bad guy did win in away.  The only problem I had with the movie was the ending, I <BR>would have liked to know what happened to the hostages. I think I would watch it again just because I want to know how Gabriel and Ginger are still alive. ...all is well that ends well~<br />Bebe
B00005KFUM|5.0|I was a little apprehensive about buying Origin of Symmetry because I felt Showbiz was a very uneven affair.  A few songs were very good, but two thirds were very mediocre.  I decided to go ahead and splurge on this CD, not knowing that it would end up my favorite CD of 2001.<BR>New Born begins the CD with a Radiohead replica intro.  Then about a minute into the song, Matt Bellamy rips into a beautiful rage.  The guitars become hard rock like and his vocals become louder and more chaotic.  This general sound permeates the whole album, but there are variations that make each song special.  Bliss has synth effects, Micro Cuts has an almost operatic vocal, and Feeling Good has jazz percussion.<BR>Other standout tracks, although every song is better than 95% of commercial radio, are Space Dementia, Plug In Baby, and Darkshines.  This is a great CD whether put on &quot;Skip&quot; or played continuously.  The reason for this is Matt Bellamy.  His vocals and guitars are similar to Radiohead without being timid, and like Metallica without being coarse or artless.  However, to pigeonhole Muse as a cross between Radiohead and Metallica would be a mistake.  They are a sound all their own, and I have enjoyed this CD many times over the six or seven months since I bought it.  This CD is a must.
B00004XOWM|5.0|One great cd from LIMP BIZKIT! Great TRAX, especially the Hip-Hop version of 'ROLLIN'-Very H-O-T!!!
B00005RY7X|4.0|After hearing &quot;Party Hard&quot; a few times and seeing the video on MTV, Andrew W.K. sparked my interest enough to go out and buy his cd.  As soon as I pressed play I was assualted by Andrew W.K.'s gruff, metal voice over 80's style rock.  And it's not hard to see that more than anything... he likes to party.  The great thing about this album is that it's just so different from what everybody is doing right now.  If you like to party, loved the 80's, or really wanna hear a great new artist with a bright future ahead of him... buy &quot;I Get Wet&quot; by Andrew W.K.
B00005N9CV|2.0|This is the first CD by Miss Krall that disappoints me. Her voice is, as always, marvelous but the screeching violins make me sick. As for the cover art, who cares? I buy CDs for the music not the pictures. She could have a plain white wrapper and if I thought the music was good I'd buy it....... O.K., she's gorgeous but that doesn't make up for the bad orchestra.
B000009O8A|3.0|I have to say that I was never really interested in this movie as I had never heard of it. I had seen it at my local video store almost everytime I went into the horror section. It's hard to forget the cover. Anyway, after seeing this movie on a list of video nasties I figured I would give this movie a try and check it out.<br />What I found was a movie that I didn't think was to bad but it has an extremely sensitive subject matter. As a matter of fact if I were a woman I would find it very difficult to watch. Four \\"Good ol'\\" boys brutally rape and torture a young woman on vacation. Needless to say she gets her revenge. The acting is not really great and I thought the four men who committed the crime were incredibly stupid. I gave this movie three stars because of how violently she kills the men. Especially the bath tub scene which was hard for me to stomach. <br />This movie was rated R. Now I don't know if there is another version of this movie but I thought the content of this movie should've got this movie a harder rating than R. This movie is Definitely not for younger viewers. It has extremely brutal rape scene, plenty of nudity, and some harsh graphic scenes. I can see why this movie was banned in some countries.
B00005NWM3|5.0|This is one of the best collections of songs I have heard on one CD.  It only contains 10 songs which is kind of like but it's very heavy on content.  It's a great CD and well worth getting...

0945353731|3.0|...Anne's diary left a lot more to be desired. At best, it helps me appreciate the fact that every life extinguished during the war had a story of its own, most of which never got told. By no means an extraordinary life, Anne's Diary, in my view is over-hyped, about a hopelessly romantic girl, who hoped for the perfect world.<br />We now know that she was killed within a year after being captured, but quite opposed to my expectaition, there is no account of day-today suffering of the common man in the hands of the Nazis. What is especially disappointing is the is a never-stopping rant of how uncomfortable dear life became for a rich girl, who was hiding with her family from the Nazis. For God's sake, that was war, and Anne was among the very few, who by virtue of the fact that her dad was rich, and well connected, got to live longer (in reasonably comfortable office-home) than many not so lucky Jews. Most of the 14-15 year olds that I know have better common sense than what Anne communicated to me in her diary.
0684833395|5.0|I credit this book with my newfound enjoyment in reading. I found that although the book has some deeper meaning about the affects of war on the human psyche, for the most part it was tremendously funny. The best relation I can give is that normally when you watch a movie or show that you find funny, you usually don't laugh at loud the entire show, however you still find the jokes funny. This book made me laugh out loud numerous times. This is a perfect book and a must read for people who want a step back from meaningful, soul searching books and to find a novel that is simply entertaining to read.
B000002H70|5.0|This is The Cure's undisputable masterpiece. It is simply perfect and transcends through time. The sound, the arrangements, the lyrics and Smiths voice will bring you to tears of joy. I bought this CD in 1989 and I continue to listen to it religiously. Its one of the best albums ever made and therefore satisfaction is guaranteed. Take it from a die hard Cure fan. You will love it as much as I do.
0375410341|5.0|...i'm astounded that a small minority find this book at all contrived and meaningless.  Chock full of coded messages, endless word puzzles and interesting word placement this book will truly entertain.  the story within the story within the story will keep you guessing and rereading to make sure you really got it all....then you realize that there is still more to figure out.  HOL is a sheer delight to read.<br />do yourself a favor and read this book.
0385505833|5.0|I bought this book because of the write up about it.  I do not care for his lawyer and trial books...I do watch when they are a movie but I'm more into the &quot;cozy&quot; type of books.  This one fits that area pretty good.  I laughed until my sides hurt.  My husband of course read it then to see what was so funny.  He was laughing out loud too. My mother-in-law who reads all those old trial stories said she'd have to read it because she didn't believe John Grisham could write this type of story.  May he write many more like this!
B000001EXR|3.0|This album was a mix of swampy guitars, and demon sounding lyrics. The album has great lyrics like \\"IT NEVER GOES AWAY\\", \\"I WILL BE THERE\\", \\"HATE\\", \\"RAIN\\", \\"JUNGLE\\", \\"MASTER & SLAVE\\", and a suprising last song by Bruce Kulick on lead vocals on \\"I WALK ALONE\\", which is a great tune. This album is pure hard rock.
B00005AXEL|5.0|Trouble in Shangri-La is definitely classic Stevie.  The best tracks on the album happen to be the ones produced by Sheryl Crow, which include: &quot;Candlebright&quot;, &quot;Sorcerer&quot; and &quot;Fall From Grace&quot;.  Crow did wonders with Stevie's already unique melodious music by turning the guitars up and re-capturing the sound that established Stevie as one of the best female rock vocalists of the 70's.  Many reviewers have compared &quot;the magic&quot; of TISL with that of Bella Donna and I would have to heartily agree.  Those of you that consider Bella Donna and the Wild Heart to be the best of Nicks's solo work will agree that TISL is right up there with them.
B00000JCOV|5.0|Nine crazy musicians from Iowa, with self-made masks, brings out the cutting edge grooves of hardcore, hip-hop, and screams of Horror. Out of these nine freaks, you will meet the reality of Slipknot. Slipknot shows its own creativity in the metal industry with 3 drummers, 2 guitarists, a DJ, a bass player, and a pumped up, freaked out, totally insane singer (no offense Corey). The album is filled with jump around songs that probably come from imagining something like \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" or \\"Halloween\\". In this album, songs like Sic, Surfacing, and Liberate will give you the screaming horror of Corey's vocals and run around, jump around guitar players. The hip-hop versions of this album would be Wait and Bleed, Spit it Out, and No Life, and all songs give this album a good twist feature. With no comparison with other bands like Korn, Limp Bizkit, Machine Head, and Fear Factory...Slipknot became a great heavy metal band that other metal heads will be craving for. It's their own kind of wild life.....I would recommend you join.
B00005RY7X|5.0|Ok ok, I know for sure this guy is pretty....odd, and his music isnt the greatest out there. But let me say, when was the last time you listened to feel good metal??? Seriously, Andrew WK does an excellant job at providing grinding beats while managing to put you in a great mood! Theres really nothing else to say about this cd, its sweet, simple, and puts a smile on my face!
B00005A46T|5.0|I believe that not one metal band has captured so many metal-head fans other than the nine headed freakboys - Slipknot. Their debut album has been platinum all across the country and the album came to all doors and hit metal fans straight in the forehead. Their newest album IOWA, has became the most anticipated heavy metal album in the year 2001. The maggots were formed in the year 1999 and the infestation continues with roaring guitars, pounding drums, and screaming vocals. With Slipknot's creativity, this album is greatly twisted with highly original songs like People=s***, New Abortion, The Heretic Anthem, My Plague, and Left Behind. For my conclusion, their assualt in this album is making a great suprising nightmare for everyone.
B000002N2P|5.0|This is the best CD Green Day has ever made, and I have Dookie, Insomniac, Nimrod, and Warning.  It is one of the few CD's out there that I'm able to listen all the way through without skipping any song.  I love absolutely every track!  This album is so good that my Dad knocked on my bedroom door to say that he liked the music that was playing!  This goes beyond youth pop and into JUST PLAIN GOOD TASTE for any age!!!  I love the use of what initially sounds like sarcasm to express truths about modern culture.  I found myself listening to the lyrics, thinking \\"They're just being really sarcastic and funny.\\"  They made me laugh.  But, they also made me think, \\"I know people who actually think that way; it's scary, but it's true!\\"  Green Day helps me open my eyes to what our society is really like.  We like to think that it's better, but it's not.  This album expresses what is wrong with society today better than any other album I have listened to, while making you laugh about it with sarcasm.  It will make you think, if you want it to.<br />As for a person who made an earlier review, here is my view on what some of the songs mean:<br />Stuart and the Ave. - as far as I can tell, it's about breaking up a relationship you wish you never started.  You want to forget that person ever existed, and you think, \\"Why did I ever like that person in the first place?\\"<br />86 -  It's about people in today's society looking down on old people trying to act young, or be in any part of modern society (86 refers to the age of an old person).  Some people seem to have the view that the elderly are too old to do anything, and the more they stay in their own little world and not bother ours, the better.  When honestly, this is a cruel way to think and to treat anyone.  They deserve to keep living their life.  Plus, they could actually have some energy left in them to benefit our society, and we could learn from their example, who knows?<br />Anyway, a long story short.  I love this CD.It doesn't get any better than this.  If you don't own it yet, you don't know what you are missing out on.  But I will warn you, the first time I played it, I wasn't that thrilled about it.  I had to put it aside and play it a few more times to let it soak in.  But once it soaked in, I couldn't stop playing it!  Dookie, Nimrod, and Warning get old if you play them too often, but Insomniac will last forever in my CD collection!
B00000099Y|5.0|With a huge break of time and concentration, Aenima is the darkest, most popular album produced by Tool. Starts out with one great opening track, \\"Stinkfist\\" which had became a great hit. It also includes \\"Forty Six & 2\\" and \\"Hooker with a Penis\\", both are great heavy songs that open up the world of fear and humor at the same time. Then the album is opened up by the 6th track \\"Message to Harry Manback\\", a recording from Maynard's answering machine for a friend staying over. With a strange backround and with chilling vocals, this track reminds us about the world we live in. \\"Die Eier Von Satan\\", is a strange intermission but gives out a hilarious title meaning \\"The Eggs of Satan\\" and the chorus being \\"...and no eggs!\\". Also, the artwork in the album is very interesting and very original. The artist Bill Hicks, a good friend of Adam Jones brings out the humor and the imagination of this band. In this album, Tool blends the depressing darkness in most of their songs with sarcasm, wonder, and humor, that makes this to be a great album. With Maynard's amazing vocals and Adam Jone's great guitar riffs, Aenima is probably the greatest, most creative, and most humorous album I've ever listened to.
B00003CXA6|5.0|We all &quot;know&quot; what happened here, but in reality we have no idea.  This is by far the best movie about the Civil War you may ever see.  Tremendously well plotted, portrayed brilliantly in the real life scenarios their characters faced, and acted out superbly, this is one great movie.  The four hours you spend watching it goes by instanteously, and at the end you will be asking for more.  If you ever get to see the director's cut, shown now and then on TNT and TBS, you will like the movie even more (yes they cut out good stuff for the theatre/DVD/VHS release).  The story is amazing, it is a must have for your collection for any movie fan.
0312243022|5.0|If you love complex, atmospheric, and literary stories that avoid pretentiousness, \\"The Hours\\" is for you.    Michael Cunningham weaves together three interconnected stories in three time periods in rather unexpected ways. Each involve the writer Virginia Wolfe - the first involves an \\"imagining\\" of Virginia Wolfe's own life during her last days as she conceives of and writes her novel, \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\".     The Hours continues, introducing two additional story lines. Throughout the book the three stories unfold concurrently. That task alone is difficult for most authors to pull off without literary trickery but Cunningham succeeds very well.     \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" is being written by Virginia Wolfe in the first story line whilst Ms Wolfe struggles with her mental health and family relationships. \\"Mrs Dalloway\\" is a novel about a single day in the life of a woman planning a party for her first lover who has just reentered her life.  It describes her activities planning and preparing for the party and the recollections it triggers of her youth and the choices she's made.    The second story line involves a pregnant, clinically depressed 1950's housewife who is reading Wolfe's novel, \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" while she is preparing a birthday party for her husband and caring for her very young son while struggling with her serious depression and sense of displacement within her own life.     The third and final story weaves aspects of the first two stories together.  It takes place in the early 2000's. In it, a woman nicknamed \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" by her very sick lifelong best friend is preparing a party to celebrate his being awarded a literary prize for a collection of his poems. The poet is connected to the second story line as well as the third in different ways.    Is this confusing?  Perhaps at first.  As you read The Hours all of it comes together beautifully. The relationships are revealed gradually and naturally through the three independent tales woven together to form a beautiful tapestry.    The Hours is an unusually memorable novel. I highly recommend both The Hours and another Cunninghams novel, A Home at the End of the World.

0679735909|2.0|After a failed attempt to read Possession ten years ago, I finally managed to trudge through it for the sake of my monthly book club.  Apparently, not much has changed for me in ten years because I hated the book then, and I hate the book now. I say &quot;hate&quot; because I cannot stand to see a potentially great storyline overwhelmed by useless (and completely boring) details.  <br />The poetry is horrible.  The characters are flat. The diaries are completely unnecessary, with exception of a few sentences here and there of importance.  Everyone I talk to claims to have skimmed or skipped over the superfluous parts of the book.  I'm sorry, but anything I have to skim or skip for the sake of finding the plot or characterizations isn't a novel, it's homework. (And rather than finding that &quot;challenging,&quot; I just find it annoying...a challenging read does not have to be tedious.)<br />I think what bothers me the most is that A.S. Byatt believed she had the creative talent to pull this off.  I was thoroughly unconvinced that the poetry in the book was created by &quot;great&quot; poets worthy of the adoration and examination given by the modern-day characters in the book.  Perhaps that is part of the satire, but if it is, it is not compelling enough to keep me interested.  <br />The book has no flow to it and actually reads like a critic wrote it.  It is dry and egotistical. I felt like I was back in undergraduate English classes being forced to read the arrogant interpretations of great literature by critics--only in this case, the great literature is missing.  <br />Similar to religious zealots who believe there is only one way to interpret the bible, critics believe that they are somehow able to crawl into the minds of great writers so they have the definitive understanding of their works. While opinions and research are necessary to promote debate, if one believes a critic's interpretation to be fact, the literature suffers. Byatt seems to want to make funof this, but she fails.<br />Honestly, I wish Byatt would recognize her limits and let a good writer handle her stories.  Possession would be a much more compelling read without the weight of the useless junk Byatt forces the reader to skip.<br />But, to borrow from Dennis Miller....This is just my opinion, I could be wrong.
0440219078|4.0|The Giver was a great novel because it always keeps you on your toes and makes you stop and think about life. It is a novel about a boy named Jonas who lives in a utopia with no differences, he is given a respected job, he is notified that in the training of his new job there will be pain it is called the job of receiving memory. In training Jonas receives things that people in the community are not given such as color, choice, memory of war, snow, sun, love and hate. Jonas is overwhelmed with painful and cherished memories and realizes that a perfect world for one person is not a perfect world for another, but he and the previous receiver of memory are the only ones that know this because the other people if the communities don’t experience choice, love or hate. Jonas finally decides to escape the community and leave all the memories to the community and the old receiver of memory.
0060082569|5.0|I just finished this book and continue to be in awe over it.  It's not just a book on war but on leadership, it greatly describes how both Lt. Gen. Moore lead his men but how each of his subordinates lead as well.  <BR>     While it never deals with why we were there it doesn't need too.  Instead it tells a story of how our troops fought together like brothers and died together like brothers.  It is easy to grasp Moore's love for his man in both the way he treated them then and how he treats them now, He not only names what most of his men did after the battle but names each man killed, where he was from, and a bit of personal history of that man.  <BR>     This books strong point though is the fact that when possible Moore lets the men who were there tell it like it was.  <BR>     I would not only recomend this book for the military types but and Viet Nam buffs, but to anyone who truly wants to know how to lead people<BR>     God Bless all those went, and God speed all those who were brough home.
B00005UQ9F|5.0|I sat down to watch Session 9 at midnight on a Friday. That was mistake number one. I was also expecting a film that was not very realistic and something that I would think could never happen. That was mistake number 2. <br />Session 9 had me jumping at every little noise in my apartment after the first twenty minutes of the film. The part of this movie that made it so scary was that the story could have been a true story. There was no supernatural power pushing people to the edge, there was no crazy person back from the dead, just someone's mind, and a freaky building. <br />This film grabs hold because it is about normal hard working people, who are not strange, but could live next door. This movie could realistically happen, and that is what makes this so frightening. <br />I also liked the Extra deleted scenes, which show an alternate story line that was cut from the movie, and the director's commentary. I would suggest picking up Session 9, just don't watch it alone at midnight!
0393312836|4.0|A Clockwork Orange is a genius piece composed by none other than the linguistic mastermind Anthony Burgess. From the beginning to the end of this horrific and, at the same time, humorous tale, Burgess recounts the adolescent happenings of a young nadsat named Alex. Using the first-person, Alex tells his teenage story of being institutionalized, and the accounts that follow his early release. The language in this book is incredible; no other author holds rank with Burgess.

For the clearest and most detailed analysis in print, look up the entry for this film in Charles Mitchell's THE DEVIL ON SCREEN, a superb film book from McFarland.  Meanwhile, both this flm and DVD deserve the highest rating.

B000002MU3|1.0|This album is weak, REM has always been a bastion for collegiate faux-intellectuals.  Until after this album, when they were picked up by post-collegiate faux-intellectuals.  Mmmm, sounds good in the old SUV with those fading memories of talking bad about Reagan at those keg parties in '88.  This album is a sad cash-in on grunge...  REM cranks up the gain on the old amps and some mistake that for power.  Please.  Their earlier albums are of course better, but not much.  If you want intellectual stimulation, go read a book.  If you want rock music, look elsewhere.

B000002L5P|5.0|Having heard first the best of/singles compilations, The Queen is Dead, Strangeways Here We Come and a number of Morrissey's solo albums, and having read of Morrissey's extravagant boasts prior to the release of this record, The Smiths was a surprise. <BR>It's so quiet, so introspective, so humble almost. <BR>It crept into my heart slowly, after repeated listens. <BR>The structure of the songs is very simple. Their strength lies primarily in Morrissey's beautiful voice and lyrics. Overall, the latter seem more personal here than on any other Smiths/Morrissey album.<BR>The Smiths is also the most haunting album, made so particularly by Suffer Little Children and The Hand that Rocks the Cradle, two beautiful but almost unbearably disturbing songs.<BR>The 11 songs on The Smiths, with the exception of the last, explore dark, sometimes unsettling aspects of love and relationships.<BR>I'm still learning and I won't call myself an expert by any means, but I can name no one who tackles personal dysfunction - desperation, insecurity, delusion, dependency - with as much honesty and with as sharp a ring of truth as does Morrissey.<BR>Other bands use garish make-up, distorted guitars and vocals and other gimmicks to shock or disturb.<BR>But The Smiths deliver a bigger emotional jolt using impeccable melody and a warm voice singing lyrics like these: <BR>&quot;... a child cries: 'find me, find me, nothing more/We're on a sullen misty  moor/We may dead and we may be gone/But we will be right by your side/Until the day you die/This is no easy ride/We will haunt you when you laugh/Yes, you could say we're a team/You might sleep/But you will never dream'&quot; (Suffer Little Children) and<BR>&quot;There'll be blood on the cleaver tonight/When darkness lifts and the room is bright/I'll still be by your side/For you are all that matters/And I'll love you till the day I die/There never need be longing in your eyes/As long as the hand that rock the cradle is mine.&quot; <BR>Listen and squirm.
079284632X|1.0|There is a lot of hype around this film becouse of the fact that Wes Craven directed it. After watching this movie I wonder how Craven ever put this movie behind him and gave us Nightmare On Elm Street. The plot is about three escaped cons on the run. A young girl is attacked by them and murdered in the woods next to there house. The killers then go the parents house to stay posing as travelers.The parents discover that there daughter was killed and they know who did it.They then plot there revenge. First is that this is a good premise for a movie, however we have seen this type of revenge movie done much better in movies like Mad Max, Rage, and in the more recent In The Bedroom. Craven's directing would get better so I am a little reluctent to dump to badly on him becouse unlike Lucio Fulchi, Dario Argento, and Ed Wood, He would get better, but that does not make up for this film. The killers are not frightening at all and the script fails halfway though the film. The score (of all things) is amazingly distracting and unneeded. The movie,mabey in the hands of Craven now, or another good director, could be a better film but until then we just have this auful movie....By the way a much better movie about parents coping and revenge was In The Bedroom. Forget this movie and go see that......

Yes i did say woman, die hard Madonna fans may always see her as a material girl but this is where Madonna decided to grow up and leave the sex-toys in the treasure chest where they belong. The title truly demonstrates Madonna's internal strength and fortitude against the negativiy of those who judge her too harshly. The majority of the songs on this record sort of bleed into each other and like the ablum title suggest may lull the listener into a deep-sleep like state. Kudos to Madonna for growing up on this record. Although most die hard fans enjoy the poppier songs of Madonna I love her romantic mature side.
B000056K04|1.0|This is a really disappointing CD.  There's barely 1 track that I actually enjoy a little bit.  Unlike under the table or crash the hit song [was no good].  And it's quite obvious that it was produced by Alanis Morissette's producer; it's completely different.  I just didn't get the feal of all the rest of Dave's albums.  That's why I give it only one star. Because compaired to all the other Dave CDs it's garbage.
B00000IACG|4.0|Usually, it's pretty annoying when a good artist releases an EP of wanky demos, four-track experiments, and outtakes, but Fugazi pulls it off well.  The tracks here are mostly enjoyable, and a few are great (the instrumental version of Guilford Fall still hits me harder than the album version).  It's also fun to hear Fugazi goof off, since they can come off as overly pious and serious sometimes.  My only warning is this: do not buy this if you are not already a Fugazi fan, because it will not give you a good sense of the band.  Start with 13 Songs, Repeater, or Red Medicine.
B000060OWV|5.0|Robben returns to his Blue-Line sound with a terrific blend of blues, jazz and funk.  Things kick off in fine form with a rockin' blues cover, &quot;Up The Line&quot;, which may now be my all-time favorite Robben Ford tune.  The remainder of the disk has a little more of a jazz sound to it, but the blues are definitely a part of the mix as well.  There's not a bad tune on the whole disk and I would rate this as possibly Robben's best work yet.  Highly recommended.
0385503954|5.0|There was a point, as I was reading this novel, where I fully realized what it was that McEwan was doing -- an &quot;aha&quot; moment. It happened for me when Briony receives a letter from a prospective publisher ... McEwan's brilliance as a writer is that he helps me, and other readers, understand the importance of fiction for the writer, and there is no book that does it better than this one. Since I don't want to spoil the realization for those who haven't read it, let me put it this way: if you write, or want to write, fiction, then read this book.<br />As to the story, there is a building menace all through part 1 of the novel, and then each succeeding part adds to the consequences of the first act. Briony's interference in other people's lives causes every other action in the book, and, in a way, this novel reads like a classical tragedy. Except perhaps, that as an audience member myself, I felt exhilarated rather than cathartic at the end.<br />I disagree with those who see this as a departure from McEwan's other work -- I see it as the logical endpoint of it. I'll be very curious to see where he goes next. Another sidenote: As much as I admired The True History of the Kelly Gang, it is a travesty that Atonement did not win the Booker Prize (yes, I liked Seiffert's work, but this is the best of the group).
B00005T30L|2.0|First off, I admire the acting in this movie a lot.  Thora Birch and Steve Buscemi carried their roles beautifully.  I'm not sure if not being familiar with the comic &quot;Ghost World&quot; affected my opinion of this movie.  I like a lot of movies that are so called &quot;uneventful&quot; films.  This film just didn't strike me in any particular way.  It wasn't really boring, but I just didn't find it &quot;meaningful&quot;.  It's one of those movies that you should rent before you buy, because there's plenty of people who seem to really adore this film, and then there's ones like me that are left scratching their heads and feeling silly for not understanding what beyond the acting and some of the art direction makes this film one you want to see over and over again.
B00005R87Q|4.0|First off, I must say I enjoyed this movie. Hey...I don't mind a goofy flick every now and then!  The car races and chases were very cool, and the cars themselves were neat, probably the real stars of the movie.  <br />I watched this one with my wife (a movie critic extraordinaire) and she commented something like: \\"I've seen this one before\\", although I knew she had not.  Then it hit me...The Fast and The Furious (TFATF) is a car-centered remake of Point Break (PB).  We had fun comparing the two films.  Here are some of the things we came up with, see if you agree or come up with anything else:<br />Brian is an undercover cop who gains the trust of Dom the ringleader of the hijacking gang (although Brian does not beleive that Dom is the hijacker).  Much the same way that Johnny Utah an FBI agent, gains the trust of Bodhi in PB (and initially does not think Bodhi is a bank robber).<br />Conveniently, in both movies there is another 'rival' gang that you are led to believe are the real hijackers/bank robbers.  In both films the rival gangs are portrayed as much more violent than the actual evil-doers.<br />Also in both films the cop/agent has a [upset] superior that wants results and is on his case. Additionally, in both films the cops/FBI hastily bust the wrong gang.  This is when the Proverbial lightbulb goes on as to the real identities of the hijackers/bank robbers.<br />There has to be a love angle in these films so...Brian falls for Dom's sister (somebody close to the inner circle of the group).  Johnny Utah falls for Tyler who is close to Bodhi and his cronies.<br />The spiritual side of surfing is replaced with car racing when Dom talks to Brian about his 10 seconds of freedom.  In the same way, Bodhi spoke to Johnny about the deeper meaning of surfing.<br />In each movie the hijacking/bank robbing was done in an unconventional manner.  PB has masked Ex-Presidents robbing banks...TFATF has the racers hijacking trucks in in a bizarre fashion.<br />There is a hot headed gang member in each film that doesn't like, and is suspicious of the newcomer.    <br />Both end with the cop letting the bad guy go free.<br />There are more similarities, but you'll have to see the movies and make up your mind.

B00005JKES|1.0|Regardless of the reason(s) for the omission of the 1st (so-called 'pilot episode') there is no excuse for the makers of this set intentionally neglecting to note on the packaging that this is NOT THE COMPLETE 1ST SEASON. My disappointment when I began the '1st' episode and it began with: 'previously on Twin Peaks...'cannot be understated. Regardless of the excallent picture and sound quality I cannot look at this any way other than with the feeling of being deliberatlely misled. Probably this being done with the intent of selling as many units of product as possible before the public should 'wise up'. If a person is okay with buying the set without the beginning that is fine, but it is cowardly and insulting for the makers/distibuters to have not been open about the omission. I returned my copy of the set immediately and would urge others to do so. If the makers/distributers have legal difficulties let them work them out prior to releasing a flawed product. I believe that it is important that a message be sent to the makers/distrbuters that it is unacceptable to mislead customers. Sincerely, Alan Henderson
6304806426|5.0|With highly acclaimed pictures, especially the kind that come with lots of awards pinned to their DVD case like this one, it is  sometimes hard to view the film with objectivity.<br />On first viewing(in the theatre)I was blown away or swept up in the grandeur of the cinematography. Like any epic it is the majesty of landscape as much as any thing else that determines our response. The story is a complex and complexly told ones and takes a lot of thinking to come to terms with. Its all told in flashback which is the only way to tell this story for only after the events have been placed in the past does the narrator gain the necessary perspective to tell it. While its happening(and we see it all unfold in those extended flashbacks) its all passion.<br />Ralph Fiennes is the archeologist who is working in the desert when the war breaks out. And Kristen Scott Thomas is the woman he falls in love with, she also happens to be married to his best friend. In the passion of their stolen moments, intensified by the wartime atmosphere, there is no time for moral judgement. Only afterwards does that part of things fully sink in. Only in the reliving of the events by telling them to his nurse Juliette Binoche does he experience the full implications of the decisions which shaped his life and the lives of those he loved. The story would not be half as powerful if it were told in the present tense as events were transpiring.<br />The desert scenery often seen from the perspective of the lovers flying over it is one of those rarest of cinematic pleasures. It takes your breath away and perfectly captures what the lovers are experiencing. It is also fitting that the tragedy of the story also involves the plane. You probably already know the story but just in case you don't.....<br />The actors are all tremendous and ultimately the addition of another character played by Willem Dafoe presents a subplot which nicely compliments the major one. Dafoe also relates his story in flashback.<br />There is a tremendous amount of moral ambiguity in the content of the story, and it is never really resolved.That annoys some but I think it lends the story a credibility and reality for that is often how things are left.  The blurring of moral boundaries as well as political ones in order to raise questions about why they are there in the first place is the stuff of great literature and perhaps  is the very essence of tragedy after all. Ondaatje writes about history bound characters in most of his books and his interesting use of time schemes and story framing allows him to put his characters in positions to comment on their own lives which has the effect of a Greek chorus comenting on mans helplessness in the face of events both external like the war, or internal like passion. Great novel and the great director Minghella brings it all to life. A lot of people don't feel it deserves all the praise it received but I think that is a natural reaction we Americans have toward massive successes. We love underdogs and don't trust popularity contests like the Oscars. But I think in this case anyway the praise is well deserved. One of the few movies that will survive the shifting trends of taste and style.>There is a tremendous amount of moral ambiguity in the content of the story, and it is never really resolved.That annoys some but I think it lends the story a credibility and reality for that is often how things are left.

B000059PPN|2.0|I was really disappointed with this clunker,the only thing in this film I was really impressed with was the acting ability of that little blond kid. Man for a boy can he scream! I'm writing  this review from memory (this is one film I'd like to forget)The film is kind of confusing,you don't know what's happening one minute to the next. The storyline is kind of quirky. There's are a few good scenes one gory and stupid. The gory scene if when the babysitter loses her head<br />The stupid scene is when daddy (I think it's the father) gets attacked by a bat, it bites his hand and he does everything to get it off, When they finally find the mad doctor/scientist whatever he/it is, it comes his time to die (of course you can't kill something that has been dead along time) but when they stab him..yuck thats when I almost lost it.<br />Don't buy this movie unless you are patient/tolerant of bad filmaking
0792156684|5.0|Titanic is predictable, sappy, overly melodramatic and filled with many movie cliches, and you want to know something?  It doesn't bother me a bit.  When I first saw this movie on its opening day I thought it was wonderful.  As its popularity grew though I found myself having a strange reaction to it success.  I started to dislike the movie more and more.  And when it swept the Academy awards I was possitive that I hated the film, probably because I'm such a huge fan of LA Confidential.  Last night I watched Titanic again for the first time in two or three years and I must say that I was surprised at how much I found myself getting involved.  I must say that I now feel that Titanic is a great movie once again.<BR>All of the things that I mentioned above, the &quot;flaws&quot; as some may consider them to be, don't diminish the enjoyment of the film at all.  I don't care how unoriginal the love story was.  It was kept simple.  THe film is so brilliantly executed, both thematically and technically, that I can dismiss these &quot;flaws&quot; with the wave of a hand.  When a film is done this well who really care about how ridiculous the love triange is.<BR>I will not waste time discussing the plot and all that nonsense.  I see so many reviews talking about the lack of originality in films.  How come when a truely daring and original film does come along (ex: Crash, Dancer in the Dark, Moulin Rouge), films that try to break conventions and give the audience something new for a change, so many people complain about them because they don't follow conventional Hollywood formulas?  A catch-22?
630469797X|4.0|This film is pretty good. I'll get right to what I think needed more attention to. First most of the zombies in the film are better dressed than the live people. Secondly the makeup (zombies) looked like assembly line makeup meaning the zombie in my opinion weren't that scarey, well there's one.<BR>Now to the positive parts of the movie, the idea is fascinating! I mean what worries would we have except staying alive? complete anarchy (good or bad). The storyline is very good some of the gore happens inside a run down tenement where the SWAT team moves in on, and yes its full of zombies.. (and some dopey live people)<BR>I won't get into detail about the gory scenes but there are some real graphic ones, also some silly scenes too with idiotic music<br />I recommend this film it does deliver for all you diehard horror<BR>buffs out there. (no nudity, even for a zombie film at least 1 could have been thrown in somewhere)<BR>thumbs up!
6304263465|4.0|Only one thing to say- why is there no soundtrack to this film?!  I am not the first to want it!!!  Anyone know of where I can get it?
B000002IWQ|4.0|...and they are successful!  After the &quot;softer&quot; material that was on _Presto_ (an excellent album) and _Roll The Bones_ (an album of good material but pretty much lifeless production), it seemed Rush wanted to prove that they could still rock out like they did in the 70s and early 80s.  It's also obvious from the groove-infused &quot;Animate&quot; that Alex Lifeson was definitely digging the grunge movement of the time.<br />So, we get an album that rocks harder than just about anything Rush did since _Moving Pictures_.  There are some excellent aggressive tracks such as &quot;Animate&quot;, &quot;Stick It Out&quot;, and &quot;Cut to the Chase.&quot;  If you were weary of buying newer Rush albums because of their mid/late 80s output - this album will definitely please you.  The heavy guitar of &quot;Double Agent&quot; harkens all the way back to _Caress of Steel_-era Rush.  The only problem with the album is with the slower songs.  Rush were never known really for their &quot;ballads&quot;, but they did write really great underrated slower songs throughout their career (&quot;Closer to the Heart&quot;, &quot;Madrigal&quot;, &quot;Different Strings&quot;, etc.).  The slower songs such as &quot;The Speed of Love&quot; and &quot;Alien Shore&quot; are pretty unmemorable.  The closer however, &quot;Everyday Glory&quot; packs a great emotional punch.<br />_Counterparts_ was a deliberate attempt to put the &quot;rock&quot; back into Rush - and it worked.  &quot;Animate&quot;, &quot;Stick It Out&quot;, &quot;Leave That Thing Alone&quot;, and &quot;Everyday Glory,&quot; can easily stand up next to Rush's best work.  The lyrics are hit-and-miss sometimes, but the good outweighs the bad, and Rush show that unlike many of their contemporaries, they know how to incorporate current musical trends into their own sound without it sounding forced.  Pick this up if you like Rush in hard rock mode.
0440217563|3.0|I have read all five &quot;Outlander&quot; novels, and must say that I feel they started to go downhill a little with &quot;Voyager&quot;.  I enjoyed the book, but feel that the &quot;self indulgent&quot; writing which becomes more pronounced in the later novels really starts to rear its head in Voyager.  Parts of the novel (especially towards the end) don't appear to &quot;gel&quot; or bear any relevance to the continuing story - particularly the &quot;Scottish serial killer&quot; sub-plot - I was a bit taken aback at the end that it didn't actually seem to have any relevance!  I felt that the book could have benefited from some fairly major editing in parts - could have lost a good 200 pages. Another ongoing theme that raises its head in Voyager is the &quot;nastiness for the sake of it&quot; so far as gratuitous violence/disease goes.  The first two books were brutal in places, but I think &quot;Voyager&quot; goes a little too far.  Some of my ambiguity towards &quot;Voyager&quot; is due to the plot, having known the characters from the first two books I found the description of the 20 years that Claire and Jamie were separated quite sad, and felt that their lives (especially Jamie's) had become a little over-soured and that the changes might be irreversable.  I also found the whole &quot;pirate kidnapping&quot; plot a little over-the-top.  Still, I did enjoy the book, but not as much as the first two!
B000002IOW|5.0|_Presto_ seems to divide many of Rush's fans.  Ironically, for a band that usually gets slammed by the critics, _Presto_ received some of the strongest reviews of Rush's career from the press.  However, fans that were thirsty for a heavier Rush sound as the eighties drew to a close might've been disappointed with the earthy, organic _Presto_.  That said, as a long time fan of Rush and all their &quot;stages&quot;, this remains my favorite album from the group. <br />As most know, after _Moving Pictures_ (1981), Rush continued to use keyboards and synthesisers until they took it as far as they could on _Hold Your Fire_ (1987), an album that contained very personal lyrics from Peart but came off slightly cold because of the dense (and sometimes lifeless) keyboard and synth sounds.  With _Presto_ however, Rush got it right.  They combined Peart's uncharacteristic personal, heartfelt lyrics with a truly fresh, earthy sound.  Gone are the cold keyboard sounds, only to be replaced by vibrant acoustic guitar work from Lifeson.  In addition, Lee's voice has never sounded as emotional as it does on _Presto_.  This is undoubtedly his best vocal performance to date.  This is really an album where all of the best qualities of Rush are successfully integrated into truly great songs.  You'll be hard-pressed to find a more beautiful chorus than the one in &quot;Chain Lightning&quot;; catchy guitar riffs are also present all over the album, most notably on &quot;Show Don't Tell&quot; and &quot;Hand Over Fist.&quot;  However, the best quality of _Presto_ is the lyrics.  There are so many gems on this album - the peak being the emotional closer, &quot;Available Light&quot; (&quot;Play of light - a photograph, the way I used to be/some half-forgotten stranger, doesn't mean that much to me&quot;).  <br />So, if you're a Rush fan and you do not have _Presto_, you're missing out on some of their best work.  Does it rock like their 70s output?  No.  Does it contain arena rock staples liketheir early 80s output?  No.  But it does contain their best songwriting, their best lyrics, and Geddy Lee's best vocals to date.  And even though some will call the production &quot;thin&quot;, the album holds up extremely well nearly 15 years after its release.
044022425X|2.0|I found \\"Drums\\" quite disappointing in the context of the first books.  The plotline has meandered to a slow trickle in places.  I have mentioned in my reviews for \\"Voyager\\" and \\"The Fiery Cross\\" that I have found Diana Galbadon's writing style in her later novels very self-indulgent, and \\"Drums\\" had a number of sub-plots that didn't seem to bear relevance to the main story.  The character of Brianna doesn't quite gel with me, Diana Galbadon mentioned in her \\"companion\\" to the novels (Through the Stones) that she found Brianna a \\"hard nut to crack\\" character-wise and I think this shows in the novel - the psyche of this character doesn't come across, and it is difficult to feel sympathy or affection for her.  Roger's character is also a little difficult to warm to, compared to those of say Young Ian and Fergus.  All in all - stick with the first three books!
0743216458|4.0|A great account from the soldier's perspective. No politics and not a lot of aggrandization of the officers or generals. How did the grunts get the job done. Read on...
0553296981|5.0|Growing up, my parents made sure that I knew what happened under the dictatorship of Adolf Hitler.  When I was about nine years old, they bought Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl.  At first, I didn't think that I would like it, but I began reading it and I couldn't put it down.<br />This is an amazing story of how anyone can try and overcome even the most difficult situations.  It can be heartbreaking at times because you see the pain that Anne and her family had to go through while they were being sought out by the Gestapo.<br />I think this should be a required book for all people to read.  It shares important and insightful thoughts from the mind of a girl that barely anyone actually knew when she was alive, yet people from all over the world feel as though they know from her diary.  This is very important and essential for any bookshelf in the world.
B0000033TE|4.0|Arguably the best EL&P album, and one of the key albums for any progessive rock collections.  Both \\"still....you turn me on\\" and \\"karn evil 9\\" are classics in more than just rock music.<br /> The album opens with \\"Jerusalem\\", a ethereal piece beautifully written, and of course, very well perform'd.. a perfect song.  Then we go into \\"Toccata\\", a fine rendition of Ginastera's 1st piano concerto, 4th movement.. i skip it everytime i listen to the cd.  Of course, Lake's composition \\"Still....you turn me on\\", holds a dear place in my heart, as i heard it often when i was growing up.  There's a reason for this.. it's a good song. (also an influence on INXS's \\"never tear us apart\\")  Then, the whimsical \\"Benny the Bouncer\\", which is a fun little romp that has feels out of place on the album.  And finally, the overlong selfindulgent \\"Karn Evil 9\\".. ahhh.. but the 1st impression (which is the bulk of the song) is very good, and also contains some very wellknown sections (\\"welcome back my friends to the show that never ends\\")...<br />overall, a very good album, a testament to what prog-rock could create.  recommended, despite its \\"short\\"comings.
B00005YTFG|4.0|This movie furthers my belief that Baz Luhrmann is on drugs.  Why?  Well, some of the scenes seem like he must've been on acid when he wrote the screenplay, and when he directed the film.  He's probably just overly imaginative.<br />This is a wildly imaginative and intriguing story of Satine (Nicole Kidman), a dancer at the Moulin Rouge, and Christian (Ewan MacGregor), a writer.  The two fall in love, but are prevented from being together by forces that they can't control.  Nicole and Ewan have incredible acting and singing talents, which make the film enjoyable, but what is even better is that they have terrific chemistry.  Their chemistry makes the movie even more touching.<br />Unfortunately, this exciting musical does have a lot of sad stuff in it, so it isn't a complete happy-go-lucky film.  It's incredible and I would love to watch it over and over.
B00005RY7X|4.0|Us hard-rock lovers have gone quite a spell without anything to be happy about. Recent rock radio has swamped us with pretentious, whiny, touchy-feely bands such as Creed and Staind and Puddle of Mudd. Andrew WK comes along and blows them all away. He has but one goal with this record: to have fun and invite us all along for the ride. Sure there's a healthy dose of pop music in the mix but fans of loud, crunchy guitars will be more than satisfied with the offerings here. Andrew seems to be heavily influenced by 80s metal since you can hear the Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, and even Iron Maiden influences on the record. If you need a more modern reference point, think Rob Zombie without the occult references and a little lighter on the synth. It's not high art by any stretch but all in all, Andrew WK's 'I Get Wet' is a fun little hard rock record.
0879302755|3.0|I already have most of the chapters in the book via articles published in Keyboard Magazine in the late 80's and 90's, so the majority of the info was redundant and just re-printed from those articles. There are some glaring omissions, such as leaving Roland out of the book except for a few pics!(?) Also, Korg received short shrift as well. I preferred Keyfax Omnibus Edition from Colbeck, although it had it's own errors as well. If you're a novice or didn't have access to those earlier Keyboard articles, this isn't a bad place to start.
B000056K04|5.0|Like the title say's, pretty good. It's not my favorite dmb album but by no means is this a bad album! I enjoy listening to to it from time to time but the some of the songs like \\"Angel\\" and \\"If I had it all\\" are pretty much throw away tracks. The best songs on here are \\"Dreams of our Fathers\\" and \\"So Right\\" It's definitely worth the $[money] but if you're new to the band then I reccomend buy \\"Under The Table And Dreaming\\" as your first cd.
B0000634EV|5.0|If you've never heard of Down before, please allow me to introduce you. Down is four boys from New Orleans (Phil Anselmo, Pantera; Pepper Keenan, COC; Kirk Windstein, Crowbar; and Jimmy Bower, Eyehategod) and one bad bass-playing mo-fo from Texas (Pantera's Rex Brown) who have come together to do serious damage to your auditory nerves. \\"Bustle in Your Hedgerow\\" is the follow up to their 1995 release, \\"NOLA.\\" I thought that album would be impossible to top, but \\"Bustle...\\" has proven me wrong. It is everything that \\"NOLA\\" was, and more. Phil spits shrapnel into your ears while Kirk and Pepper brutalize their strings and Rex and Jimmy rumble and pound your brain into submission. The only bad thing about this album: having to wait 7 years for it. If you've grown tired of that nu-metal [stuff], or if Metallica's too soft for you, but this album. Your stereo will thank you.
B00003CX9E|5.0|In June 1998, on a much-publicized list, the American Film Institute named \\"Citizen Kane\\" America's Greatest Movie, sparking a controversy that rages to this day. Since then, when people watch \\"Citizen Kane\\", they've been analyzing it and dissecting to see why it made the list. They completely have forgotten what made it so great. <br />I am one of those who think any greatest movie list is ridiculous (Though, if asked to, I would make up a list). How can you judge the greatness of movies by ranking them 1,2,3? And what would you judge them by? Entertainment or artistic value? That is why most critics, when they make \\"greatest\\" lists, rank them alphabetically. However, I believe the best way is for a person to have several favorite movies and, if they are asked what is their favorite, they can name one of those. But they should also know why. \\"Citizen Kane\\" is one of these I would name because it's so creative. Every scene is a delight to watch in terms of cinematography, lighting, sound, writing, music or acting. Almost the entire cast was in their film debuts. Orson Welles, Joe Cotton, Everett Sloane, Agnes Moorehead, Dorothy Comingore, Ruth Warrick, Ray Collins, Erskine Sanford, William Alland, Paul Stewart and George Coulouris are all excellent and most would have long, productive careers. It's difficult to name who is the best, but I think that Cotton (For his talk to Mr. Kane while drunk), Sloane (For his speech about the girl with the white dress) and Moorehead (For her scenes at the boarding house) were the best. <br />My favorite quote from the movie comes early, in the newspaper office scene between Welles and Coulouris. Here, after being asked by Coulouris \\"Is this really your idea of how to run a newspaper?!\\" Welles remarks \\"I don't know how to run a newspaper, Mr. Thatcher, I just try everything I can think of\\". As stated before, Welles and almost everyone else involved had no previous film experience, yet had been landed a huge contract to have full creative control on a movie. Much of Hollywood was envious at this and looked down upon Welles, hoping he would fail. However, Welles and company took advantage of any thing they had and doing anything and everything they could think of in the movie. No idea was too large or too small. One example was with the plot device, the last word of Charles Foster Kane called \\"Rosebud\\". <br />Film Critic Pauline Kael once called \\"Rosebud\\" a gimmick. Admittedly, this is correct. It seems to explain everything, but really doesn't explain a thing. What makes the movie's story so great though is that it gives us the inside on a rich and famous celebrity, the kind we are always interested in. Rosebud is the key of newsreel reporter Jerry Thompson (Alland), as well as ours, to unlocking the life of Charles Kane. Contrary to some statements, we really never sympathize with him during the story since he is a jerk. He uses people to his own advantage and kicks anyone around who gets in his way. Nevertheless, his story is fascinating. The screenplay by Welles and Herman Mankiewicz (Surprisingly, the film's only Oscar winner) was one of the first to take liberties in the plot. It doesn't have a linear narrative, but rather jumps from interview to interview, from event to event. Gaps made by one interview are filled by another and oftentimes a new gap is created. <br />However, there are other elements that make the film work. In addition, there is the photography of Gregg Toland (The only major team member with previous film experience), the film editing courtesy of Robert Wise (Who would become a great director in his own right), and the sound created by Bailey Fesler and James G. Stewart. One must also cite Maurice Seiderman's makeup work, which convincingly makes many of the actors look aged. In fact, some of the actors would resemble their older characters in later years (Compare Welles's appearance as the older Mr. Kane with his Detective Quinlan in 1958's \\"Touch of Evil\\"). Blend allthese elements together, allow to bake and you got a great movie. Even after 60+ years of age, the movie is still as fresh and entertaining as though it were made yesterday, just as it will be 60 years from now.  <br />If you decide to watch the movie for the first time, do not expect it to be the greatest movie you have ever seen. Instead, don't expect anything. Only expect another movie and you will get your money's worth. On the cinema mountain range, there are few on or near the same height as this one in terms of artistic and entertainment value. Sadly, many of today's teenagers aren't getting raised on films like this. In fact, when I told someone about this movie recently, he said \\"Citizen Kane? Is that a movie?\\" Most unfortunate, especially since the filmmakers of tomorrow need better inspiration than from today's good but largely forgettable movies.
0761536434|5.0|Steve L. Kent has woven one heck of a tapestry here.  \\"The Ultimate History of Video Games\\" is easily the most informative book I've ever read on the subject of electronic entertainment.<br />One of the things I enjoyed the most is that for the most part, Kent does not take sides; they are only a few heroes and even less villains.  The only people who are portrayed as evil are those who would censor video games at the cost of the First Amendment.<br />This book is for everyone, rather you're writing a thesis on the subject or are simply (like me) a lifelong fan of video games.<br />Highly recommended!
B00005A1VG|5.0|Acclaimed by many as the definitive adaptation of the Robin Hood story, \\"The Adventures of Robin Hood\\" is a wonderful film that is likely not to age over the years, with fast paced and exciting direction by Michael Curtiz (Angels With Dirty Faces, Casablanca, Yankee Doodle Dandy) and a great cast to boot: The charismatic Errol Flynn as Sir Robin Hood who is impossible to dislike (He smiles in about every scene, for one thing), the beautiful Olivia de Havilland as Maid Marian, Claude Rains as the despicable Prince John and Basil Rathbone's haughty Sir Guy of Gishbourne. <br />At the time in 1938, this film was produced for a then massive $2,000,000, making it the \\"Titanic\\" of its day. This permitted, in addition to the top notch cast, for first class production values. The sets are amazing and creative, enough in fact that they received an Oscar. Awards also went to the film editing and the exciting film score of Wolfgang Korngold. The movie looks good on the VHS edition I saw it on, except for some grain and lack of clarity with the color. Sometimes, it looked a little washed out (Then again, it was the late 1930s and the infancy of color). Hopefully, this movie is at the top of the list for films Warners needs to give DVD treatment. After seeing their work on \\"Citizen Kane\\" and \\"North by Northwest\\", I eagerly await the results.
B000059MEK|5.0|A beautiful record. More than a compilation of songs, discovery is a journey into the beautiful world created with synths, vocoders and samples by the French duo. The record, influenced by 80s electronic music, dwells in the greatest aspects of such music. Much more concise and developed than their previous album, daft punk have managed to deliver a creative and innovative radio friendly album. You may never get tired of most songs.
0380002930|5.0|After reading Watership Down, I think your perspective on the other creatures who share our planet will change: Never again will a rabbit be just a rabbit. A moving, heartwarming story of courage, a fight against oppression, and yearning for freedom. This is a story that never grows old, whether told about rabbits or man.
0804106304|5.0|The Joy Luck Club is a beautiful book about, as you can tell from the other reviews, the relationships between four Chinese women (Suyuan, Lindo, An-mei, and Ying-Ying) and their American daughters (Jing-mei, Waverly, Rose, and Lena- respectively). In the beginning, Suyuan has died, and her daughter is now to take her place in the little \\"club\\" her mother and these other women have formed. She has also found her long lost half sisters in China (left behind by her mother 20-35 years ago), who are expecting to see their mother come to China to see them, for they do not know that she has died. As each of the women see Jing-mei try to think of a way to break it to her sisters that their mother has died, their stories begin to unravel, as well as their daughters'. Lindo was seperated from her mother at the age of 12 to be wed to a mean, teasing husband and in the process, a cruel, unrelenting mother in law, but escapes the marraige cleverly. An-mei leaves her grandmother's house to go to her mother's husband's house, where she is 4rth wife and looked down upon. Ying-Ying was abandoned by her husband and became severly depressed. Suyuan had to leave her two baby daughters on the side of the road in hopes that someone would find them because she tought she would die while running away from the Japanese. They all came to America, in hopes of raising daughters free from sorrow. The result was daughters who did not understand their mothers' tribulations and sorrows and now make the same mistakes, and in some cases, have become their mothers. Beautifully written in soft but powerful words, I recommend this book to anyone. Trust me, it's not just any mother daughter book.
0385503954|3.0|This book has been hailed as a masterpiece but I found it a bit disappointing. Sometimes I wish the 'hype machine' would go away ... I found the first part of the novel to be too long, a lot of build up that I don't think was necessary. The story itself is a good one and does leave one pondering truth and lies and how our actions affect others ...
6305878323|2.0|I hear there are two versions of Mary Poppins' DVD going around - a single layer and a dual layer version.<BR>I unfortunately and unknowingly bought the single layer. Middle of the movie, it stops dead, an animated hand appears showing a disc being turned over and you have to leap up and flip your disc for the movie to resume. This is almost sacriledge in any movie but to do it in Mary Poppins is a crime. It kills the flow and destroys the magic. It should be clearly marked on the label if you have to flip your disc.<BR>So be warned all: check if you are getting the dual layer version on any long movie. If not, do not buy it.
B00005A46T|5.0|OK. I´ve been sitting here for 15 minuetes trying write this review, but I got to say it´s really hard. I´m a Slipknot fan(maggot)and I want to put down what I got to say about Slipknot.<BR>But sometimes things like that can be hard, and by hard I meen telling what I feel about things inside. But I´m going to try to put down my feelings about Iowa, let´s just hope this isn´t going to be too lame...<br />There are alot of bands out there who start really good with one ore two song. Limp Bizkit had Nookie,Break Stuff,Faith and My Generation. KoRn had ADIDAS,Blind,Falling Away From Me and Faget. It´s the same with Marilyn Manson, Mudvayne and Slayer. But after they became famous things started to get sour, the bands stopped making any efford on the their next albums. <br />But where they failed Slipknot succeded, their first album was in my opinion great. It was really complexed and Slipknot were trying alot of things and really making something different, that was what I liked about it, it was complex and unique.<BR>I had my doubts when Iowa came out but they soon dissapeared. Iowa is completely different and much more focused album than the first one, and thats a good thing. Alot of bands are stuck in the same old sound but Slipknot try to make their sound different. <br />I´m not going to write my opinion on each song, that´s simply too hard. Plus I think each and everyone should have their own opinion on the songs, and what they mean. But I think their all great and you just set the CDplayer to RANDOM and enjoy the music.<br />Slipknot also wear boiler suits and masks that adds to the whole sicness thing, it looks really cool but my opinion is. To hell with the coverups and the masks. I care about the music!!!  <BR>But to make it short, Iowa is a REALLY good album. And in the future Slipknot will be remebered...<br />(Sorry about my spelling)
B00004TRD8|4.0|James Cameron's follow-up to its lower-budgeted predecessor, &quot;Terminator 2:  Judgment Day&quot; features a pumped-up Linda Hamilton teamed up with a reprogrammed Arnold Schwarzenegger to protect Edward Furlong as an LA bad boy who will one day save the future.  Whoa... time travel movies make me dizzy.<BR><br />Yep, this time, Arnold's the good guy.  He's still a steel-skeletoned leather-jacketed mesomorph from the future, only now, he has a soft and cuddly side.  It's uber-mom Hamilton, as Sarah Connor, who muscles her way through the action.  She starts the film in the nut-hatch, where she's like a chick Hannibal Lecter with a benign agenda, but the same results.  And no wonder she's so violent:  this time, she's got to battle the freaky liquid metal T-1000 (Robert Patrick as the worst cop ever!).  T-1000 wants to cut Furlong's puberty short either to spare us endless reports of his future misdeeds on &quot;Entertainment Tonight,&quot; or to prevent him from destroying the crazed supercomputer that tried to wipe out the world.  Either way, it's up to the good guys to keep the kid alive.<BR><br />Cameron mixes characterizations as sharp as the glass that explodes all over this movie with some knock-out violence and stunt sequences, plus some shocking-for-its-time CGI work into a sci-fi action fest with a steel fist and a tender heart.  Say what you want about Arnold- he's got chemistry with Furlong.  Yeah, the big guy works well with kids.  And Hamilton is full of a mother's love; she just expresses it by stabbing people and shooting them.  As for &quot;T2&quot; itself, it's super-slick, gun metal blue, goes off like a rocket and never lets up.  Pure entertainment at its finest.<BR><br />If you enjoyed the movie, you'll definitely want the &quot;Ultimate Edition&quot; DVD, because it's got more features than the T-1000 has transformations.  Commentary, deleted footage, the trailers, the screenplay.  Storyboards.  A collector's booklet.  And the movie itself ina sweet widescreen transfer.  I can't go on... I'm exhausted.<BR><br />Which is how you'll feel after watching &quot;T2.&quot;  But in a good way, like a day at an amusement park.  This is one flick that proves big, loud action movies don't have to skimp on the smarts or the love.
038533348X|5.0|\\"Cat's Cradle\\" is another brilliant novel by Kurt Vonnegut. A science fiction satire/tragedy/love story/dysfunctional family saga, \\"Cradle\\" is narrated by a writer who had set out to write a book about the day the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan. Ultimately he gets involved with the colorfully warped family of scientist Dr. Felix Hoenikker, a weapons technology researcher. The narrator's quest takes him to the Caribbean island republic of San Lorenzo and to an encounter with Bokononism, the remarkable religion that has been outlawed on San Lorenzo. And driving much of the story is the secret of Ice-Nine, a scientific discovery with horrific destructive power.<br />Above is the bare-bones outline for a richly-peopled, tremendously imaginative exploration of human arrogance and frailty. \\"Cradle\\" is filled with brilliant motifs and details. From the San Lorenzan dialect to the details of Hoenikker family history, the book is a wonder. But possibly the best part of the book is Vonnegut's rich realization of Bokononism: its scriptures, rituals, and lexicon are intriguingly revealed throughout the book.<br />\\"Cradle\\" is full of unforgettable scenes of both horror and whimsy, all brilliantly capture by Vonnegut's amazing prose. For a compelling companion text, try Octavia Butler's \\"Parable of the Sower,\\" another sci-fi novel about a fictional religion.
B00005JKYS|5.0|Vietnam Veterans can finally say \\"They got it right this time\\".  We Were Soldiers is based on a true story and does a great job of telling that story in part.  Although the film is mostly about a three day battle that the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry fought in the Ia Drang Valley and does not bring to light the complete battle which was fought by almost the entire 1st Cavalry Division, it does capture that battle realistically.  The truth is that we were not the drug abusing, baby killers portrayed in other war films about Vietnam and our enemies were not a bunch of rag-tag pajama wearing idiots with guns.
B00005JKED|4.0|\\"Training Day,\\" directed by Antoine Fuqua, is a police/crime dram that takes place in a single day on the mean streets of urban America. But the \\"one day\\" motif is not a gimmick: this aspect of the film succeeds perfectly. Denzel Washington plays a veteran cop who has himself become a criminal offender, and Ethan Hawke is the impressionable young cop whom Washington's character seeks to corrupt. Thus, \\"Day\\" is something of a modern-day morality fable.<br />Both Washington and Hawke have earned praise for their roles, and they do make a compelling screen duo. Washington creates a character who is truly vile and hateable, but I found his performance a bit stagy at times -- it had too much of a self-conscious \\"Look, Ma, I'm acting!\\" feel. I thought that Hawke actually gave the far stronger performance, but this may be because ultimately his character has a far more interesting developmental arc than that of Washington's. The two get solid backup from an eclectic supporting cast; I was particularly impressed by Snoop Dogg as a small-time criminal.<br />\\"Day\\" is a suspenseful, gripping film helmed with real power by Fuqua. There is a genuinely ominous, threatening feel to many scenes. While the film succeeds totally as a crime thriller, however, I felt like it could have been more; it raises serious issues about crime, justice, power, and morality without, I felt, offering any new insights. Still, skillful direction and powerful performances make it well worth one's while to get some \\"Training.\\"
0767853636|5.0|I loved this movie when I was younger! I even had an &quot;Annie&quot; hairstyle after the movie came out! I watched this movie about a month ago for the first time in several years.

You must see it!
B00005JKMO|4.0|Overall I was impressed with \\"Ali,\\" the biopic of legendary boxer Muhammad Ali. Director Michael Mann brings to vivid life many episodes from the life of the man formerly known as Cassius Clay. However, for me these episodes did not add up fully; I felt like the film did not attain the true epic stature it aspired to.<br />Nonetheless, \\"Ali\\" is a compelling and entertaining film that combines superb production details, a fine cast, and other noteworthy elements. Will Smith and Jon Voight have both earned much rightful praise for their respective performances as Ali and sportscaster Howard Cosell. Smith will, in my opinion, never again be seen merely as an actor for \\"popcorn\\" flicks: in Ali we see the triumphant breakthrough performance of a dramatic leading man. Voight's total transformation into Cosell is amazing; if I didn't know beforehand that he was playing the role, I don't think I would have recognized him. Although Smith and Voight seem to have gotten most of the praise (and award nominations!), I would like to personally celebrate Mario Van Peebles for his portrayal of Malcolm X. I found his to be a very moving performance.<br />Perhaps Ali's life is simply too big to fit into a movie; maybe an extended miniseries would have made a better vehicle by which to tell his story. As a student of comparative religion, I felt in particular that the story of Ali's Islamic faith was not explored enough. Still, \\"Ali\\" the film is an impressive achievement, and well worth seeing.
B00005YTFG|5.0|Moulin Rouge is a dazzling presentation of color, art, dance, music, and cinema.  Ewan Macgregor and Nicole Kidman are phenomenal in this film, and both deserved Academy Awards for their performances, as did director Baz Leuhrmann.  The story is about the love between Christian, the penniless writer, and Satine, the star of the Moulin Rouge, which is blocked by the duke who desires Satine for himself.  The research that was put towards this film is beyond human belief (along with the accuracy), the bohemian lifestyle is portrayed respectibly, and the movie is an all out 10.  Rent it, purchase it, fall in love with it.  Moulin Rouge is truly the greatest film of all time.

Shrek is one of those movies that you can watch hundreds of times (and with my two year old I have)and see something you missed the first time. Shrek has a wonderful soundtrack also, it brought back a lot of older music, but made it new for the younger generation. To this day when &quot;I'm a Believer&quot; comes on the radio my two year old screams out &quot;SHREK&quot;. This is a wonderful family film that accomplishes soo much, keeping my two year old entertained for a couple of hours. The end.

B00005AFMT|5.0|originalmente esta alineacion trabajaria bajo el nombre del album, osea discipline, en el trabajan como siempre el maestro Robert Fripp, el recuperado Bill Bruford y dos musicos muy respetados en el ambiente musical quienes habian trabajo con Frank Zappa y Peter Gabriel, osea los seores Adrian Belew y Tony Levin. A mi gusto la mejor alineacion de todas las que ha tenido el rey carmesi en un disco con un estilo menos complicado y enredado influido por la escena musical de la epoca, acordemos que eran los aos ochenta, por lo que el disco tiene claras influencias pop y funk sin dejar de  lado la maestria de sus miembros en un disco mas relajado alegre pero con grandes ejecuciones como el caso de Matte Kudesai o Frame by Frame o mas elaboradas y vertiginosas como Thela Hun, en el que Adrian Belew poco a poco logra imponer su estilo propio a pesar de tener el problema de tratar de superar a los mounstros que lo precedieron como Greg Lake o John Wetton, sin embargo al final demuestra su gran calidad en cada una de las canciones a la vez que integra un elemento nuevo a la produccion crimsoniana, que es la de cantante y narrador ademas de poner un toque de humor a cada una de las composiciones, en vivo lo ha demostrado y no solo como cantante sino como guitarrista, que tambien lo hace muy bien, de esta tercera fase crimsoniana la mejor produccion aunque los otros discos tienen canciones de excelente factura como three of a perfect pair para mi la mejor cancion de esta era crimsonian y un verdadero clasico. Larga vida al REY CARMESI.
0451191153|3.0|The book was thought-provoking, to say the least and I agreed with much of it. Maybe even most of it. However, Rand had no respect at all for the environment or for anything at all that might stand in the way of 'progress.' The 'good guys' were all cold fish, except, apparently, in bed. Speaking of which, I could not suspend my disbelief enough to accept that Howard Rourke would be anything but dismal in the sack. Good thing Dominique was open to a good rape scenario.
B000003S0P|5.0|El rey se ha caracterizado por muchas etapas musicalmente hablando, y este disco pertenece a mi forma de ver a la segunda, osea la etapa mas rockera y seria por ratos subersiva como dicen algunos, pero que tenia una de las alineaciones mas completas y extraordinarias del rey, osea Fripp, Wetton y Bruford, es un disco pequeo si se mira desde el punto de vista de la duracion o el numero de canciones pero gigante en calidad musical y potencia, representa la culminacion, el equilibrio perfecto de esta etapa que se inicio con el extrao Larks, Tongues And Aspic y siguio con Starless, que son realmente discos muy raros,. Aqui Mr Crimso, osea Robert Fripp, crea un disco de insuperable fuerza y energia uniendose a los talentos indudables de John Wetton y Bruford, creando uno de los discos mas extraordinarios creados por King Crimson, sino oigan la cancion Red un ejemplo de calidad y poder musical, con esto termina la segunda etapa del Rey Carmesi, larga vida al rey.
0375507507|5.0|WOW! What an extraordinary book! Alexandra Fuller was grow up in rural Central Africa during the civil war in Rhodesia (and now Zimbabwe). This book described her childhood in Africa--her daily life (being White and lived life in Africa), two brothers and one sister died when they were very young, a nervous breakdown mother and a always-not-at-home dad, fired a rifle when she was only eight or nine years old... and more. I enjoy Fuller's written style and her unsentimentality in the book. I like this book not only because of Fuller's &quot;unusual&quot; childhood, but also the rich historical information about Rhodesia/Zimbabwe in the '70.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|This is my all time favorite movie.The best Garland film even standin up to films like OZ. It's amazing, and happy. It's a love story of the girl next door- the boy next door who fall in love in the early 1900's. It's packled with humor, and all sorts of family issues. Above all it's filled with the beautiful Garland, and the ever- handsome Drake. <BR>A sure winner, and I can't wait for it to be released on DVD. The only movie I have seen more than this one is Robin Hood- disney- and that's only becasue when i was five i watched nothing but. This is a movie you can't be disappointed in. It joins the talent of Minelli, and Garland, and will always be a hit on my list.
0800141660|2.0|I was quite disappointed by this film, especially after Pride and Prejudice, Emma, and Persuasion had served up such great Austen adaptations.  The whole film feels insipid and feel good, much like the performance of the pertetually stuttering buffoon that is Hugh Grant.  The screenplay lacked clout, the direction was workmanlike at best, and the costumes and wigs seemed specially made to make everyone look as unattractive as possible.<BR>Even the performances were not all that impressive with the notable exceptions of Kate Winslet and Alan Rickman, who were both excellent.  Imogen Stubbs, Imelda Staunton, and James Fleet were quite enjoyable too.  But as for the rest:  Emma Thompson was about 20 years too old to play Eleanor, and she came off as tired, wan, and unengaging.  Hugh  Grant is always far better when he's playing nasty, or at least smarmy characters, (An Awfully Big Adventure, Bridget Jone's Diary) while Gemma Jones was a bit of an anti-character as Mrs. Dashwood, and Hugh Laurie simply looked a bit lost (Staunton and Stubbs were stealing his scenes).<BR>Frustratingly bad, and it shouldn't be.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Both Morning View and Make Yourself took awhile to grow on me.  Luckily, albums like this seem to have an enduring strength and hold up remarkably well after many many listenings. :-)  Morning View is indeed a bit quieter on the whole, although tracks such as Nice To Know You, Under My Umbrella, Blood On The Ground, and Circles are excellent louder songs.  <BR>The album is about half softer and half harder songs, and many songs are themselves a combination of the two.  I find the mix very interesting and never have to skip any tracks.  My favorites are... actually, almost all of them are my favorites. ;-)  I absolutely love Just a Phase, Nice to Know You, Echo, Wish You Were here, 11am, Warning, Blood on the Ground... and all the rest of them.  I find the tranquil Aqueous Transmission to be an incredibly cool experiment for the band.<BR>While Make Yourself contains a couple of my VERY favorite songs, Morning View is, in my opinion, stonger as a whole than the former.  Incubus is extremely creative, talented, and unique.  They're not afraid to take chances and they've once again hit right on the mark.
6304346107|3.0|Although this adaptation (one of three) of Jane Austen's novel is faithful to the plot and general mood of the book, it is not the best of the filmed versions.  It could be, but for the central character.  While Gwyneth Paltrow made Emma a generally nice person who was just a little inexeperienced and meddlesome, Kate Beckinsale makes the character genuinely hateful.  Emma is mean; she is a snob; she is not someone you would want to know.  She is also remarkably cold.  Mark Strong as Mr. Knightely does a good job.  He is closer to the right age than Jeremy Northam, and although he appears to be constantly angry, it would be difficult not to shout at this Emma whenever you saw her.  Samantha Morton is a far superior Harriet Smith to Toni Collette's bumbling idiot, and Olivia Williams brings a lot of depth to Jane Fairfax.  Generally, this is a very well done adaptation, but Beckinsale is seriously miscast, and it mars the whole picture.
6304383827|4.0|1996 saw two excellent adaptation of Emma--the BBC version, and this one.  While the television version has a sharper sense of humour, this is the more enjoyable of the two films.  Gwyneth Paltrow is charming as Emma, she makes you appreciate the characters faults without making you actually hate the character.  Jeremy Northam is very dashing and charismatic as Mr. Knightley, so it's easy to forgive the fact that he is far, far too young (he's supposed to be 16 years older than her, and looks, 5, tops).  Other standouts in the cast are the ever-oily Alan Cummings as the very oily Mr. Elton, and Sophie Thompson, who brings her brilliant comic timing to the role of Miss Bates (real life mother Phyllida Law is along for the ride as the practically comatose Mrs. Bates).  Less successful is Toni Collette, whose Harriet Smith is incredibly annoying as she is over-the-top silly, and drags the rest of the cast's more delicate approach into near-slapstick.<BR>However, that's a small qualm for so enjoyable a film, the type you watch many times, whenever you need a break.
0553573403|5.0|When I began to write this review, I thought I would make a list of the top reasons A Game of Thrones impressed me. I sat there thinking about it for about three minuntes. When this amount of time had elapsed, I decided that numbering the list would be impossible, as I kept thinking of more and more impressing things. So here they are, in no particular order:<br />The writing style. This book flows, as would be expected from an author of Martin's experience. Moreover, it's proselike, but not in the way that Tolkien is prose. It's blunt, hard writing that still manages to be poetic.<br />The characters. A good author will let you identify and care about the characters. However, character rapport can often take the whole book, or the whole series, to accomplish; Martin makes you care from the first chapter onward. You feel horrible when Bran falls from the tower; you feel as frustrated as Arya. But Martin does not make his characters angels or gods (or complete demons). While there are characters who have better motives than others, they are all very human, and make human mistakes. Even the evil characters have more than one dimension, and you can often identify with them. (Cersei may be cold-hearted, but by golly, she loves her children).<br />Martin's use of history. A Song of Ice and Fire is based loosely on the War of the Roses, something that you recognize right away. But Martin definitely does not limit himself to history, and it makes for a more interesting series. (Would you really want to read an entire series that followed entirely the York-Lancaster succession quarrels?)<br />Martin's world building skills are top-notch. He manages to take a often-used fantasy setting--the middle ages kingdom--and give it a new twist, instead of dragging out the same old ideas developed by players of Dungeons and Dragons decades ago, and he also takes a hint from Tolkien and leaves magic in the background, making it a mystery instead of explaining his take on the magic system.<br />I could go on and on (and on) but I won't. I will say that it you are a reader of fantasy, and haven't read this book yet, you are not only missing a really good read, but the chance to witness the making of genre history. A Game of Thrones is an instant classic.tem. <br />I could go on and on (and on) but I won't.

044022425X|5.0|This is the fourth book in a story that begins when our protagonist enters a circle of stones and falls two hundred years into the past. All four books are incredible, but this fourth one is a mesmerizing, can't-put-down book.  It's amazing how Diana Gabaldon sews all of the books together. Having fallen two hundred years into the past, Claire Randall falls in love, deeply, with a Scottish Highlander by the name of Jamie Fraser. Forced to make an agonizing choice to stay in the past or return to her husband, the decision is finally made for her when Scotland goes to war with England, and she escapes back through the stones, narrowly escaping death, leaving her lover/husband behind to face a certain death. Three years have passed since Claire first fell into the past,but she knows she must go, for she is pregnant. Drums of Autumn begins in her present time, where she meets historian Roger Wakefield. Knowing Jamie Fraser to have died on the battlefield in Scotland, she now comes with her grown daughter Brianna to Mr. Wakefield for some research on what happened to some of the rest of the folks she knew and loved back \\"then\\". She had returned to her husband Frank in present day time, but he has since died. They had raised Brianna together, with Frank thinking Claire delusional every time she tried to tell him her story. Now with Brianna grown and Frank dead, Claire, a physician, asks Roger Wakefield to research a list of people she had known in the past, claiming just curiosity of Scottish history. Anxious to know what happened to her many friends and in-laws, she is shocked to know how many, almost all, died on the battlefield, but an even more shocking discovery leads her to tell Briana and Roger Wakefield the whole story. Now Claire must make a wrenching decision, and what she does now will alter Brianna's future forever, and change Claire's life in a way she never thought possible.  I could not put this book down. I finished it in the care, and it was so good thatI didn't notice until after we'd driven off we had not been stopped at a stoplight, but by the police! (Routine check). This author is gifted, this book and the entire series of books is a must-have.
0440219078|5.0|Ok if people say it is innappropriate for children, they are overprotective mothers with no life. People don't understand it, your stupid. Or I'm just smart. This book isn't about killing or suicide, that just comes along with ignorance. Every single person in Jonas' community is completely ignorant and has no Idea that they are a subject of being controlled. They don't understand death, so they kill when the time is needed. This book makes you feel good that you live in a better world, people read this book and hate what they do or what the book says, the book sends a message and it is about that message not suicide.
B00003CXC6|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo6U7MLKD0UOQ9]]** UPDATED NOV-11-2012: ADDED REVIEW OF 2012 CRITERION BLU-RAY **<br /><br />Criterion's 2012 Region-A Blu-ray of RASHOMON is the result of a 2008 digital restoration of the 1951 Japanese classic.  The original negative of the film was destroyed in the 1970s.  The next best surviving material is a 1962 35mm print, which was used for this restoration.  The print was digitally scanned at 4K resolution in 2008, followed by a frame-by-frame digital cleanup.  The result, as presented on the 2012 Blu-ray and its corresponding DVD, is an improvement in terms of better-looking black and white level, less flickering, a little more picture on all four sides of the screen (about 30 pixels more on the left and right sides, and less on top and bottom), and, of course, more details on the high-def picture on the Blu-ray.  The cleanup of the blemishes and scratches yielded a very nice picture, but then the old 2002 Criterion DVD looks pretty clean already.  One major improvement from the old DVD to the new Blu-ray/DVD is the audio.  As I wrote in my original review, the 2002 DVD sounds very hissy.  The 2012 Blu-ray/DVD, however, has that remedied big time.  I uploaded a video clip comparison (see comment section for the link) so you may listen for yourself.  The new editions have very little hiss.  But the underlying audio is still showing its age.  Dialogs are still not the crispest, even though a high bit-rate LPCM 1.0 is used.<br /><br />The 2012 Blu-ray & DVD include all the old bonus features, and a booklet with all the essays found on the 2002 DVD.  On the Blu-ray, all the video extras are presented in hi-def 1080i picture, even though the source material seems to be originally in standard-def (hence, upconversion).<br /><br />Two new bonuses are on the 2012 Blu-ray/DVD.  An 16-minute audio-only piece contains a 1961 interview of actor Takashi Shimura by film critic Gideon Bachamann, with Donald Richie serving as the interpreter.  And an informative68-minute featurette reunites many crew members almost 60 years after the film was made, while offering many first-hand details about the making of the film.<br /><br />** REVIEW OF 2002 CRITERION DVD POSTED APR-02-2002 **<br /><br />RASHOMON, Kurosawa's classic existential masterpiece, is Japan's CITIZEN KANE.  It offers some rather profound insights on the human condition while also being a technical and artistic tour de force.  Like KANE, RASHOMON also uses a nonlinear, fragmented narrative to show the multiplicity and unfathomability of human nature.  With an engaging murder mystery as its basis, RASHOMON should please film enthusiasts and novices alike.<br /><br />The restored video transfer on this Criterion DVD edition makes the film look as good as new.  Blemishes that used to be on older video releases have been digitally cleaned up.  Sharpness and contrast, while not spectacularly good, are excellent (to provide a point of reference, it looks much cleaner than Criterion's SEVEN SAMURAI DVD).  The original Japanese mono soundtrack is rather hissy, however.  A cleaner English dub track is included, but voice acting is sub-par (actually, in my opinion, terrible; in one instance, it is even out of synch with the action).<br /><br />The analytical audio commentary by Donald Richie is well-rounded, covering the themes, photography, acting, editing, and music of the film.  The booklet includes English tranlations of the two short stories that inspired the film, and an excerpt from Kurosawa's autobiography that pertains to RASHOMON.  In a 16-minute excerpt from a Japanese documentary about the film's cinematographer, various camera techniques used in the film are revealed.<br /><br />This DVD is encoded for Region 1 only.  For those who keep track of things like this, Criterion has only made a handful of Region 1 DVDs, which include ARMAGEDDON, BRIEF ENCOUNTER, CHASING AMY, THE DISCREET CHARM OF THE BOURGEOISIE, GIMME SHELTER, THE HIDDEN FORTRESS, HIGH AND LOW, KWAIDAN, NOTORIOUS, THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC, RASHOMON, THE ROCK, SAMURAI I, II, and III, SANJURO, SEVEN SAMURAI (second printing), THE SHOP ON MAIN STREET, THE VANISHING, and YOJIMBO.
B00005V3Z4|3.0|I've seen this film and yet I don't know that I can definitively tell you what it was about - - and that's the worst news, because this film is really good.<br />I'm sure this film was made on a small budget, but there isn't anything small about the aspirations of the director, writer, and the cast and production staff.  This is a high quality film with a dynamite script.<br />Part \\"The World According to Garp,\\" part \\"Evil Dead,\\" and part \\"American Beauty\\" this film is really indescribable in the best sense of the word.<br />Donnie is a troubled boy who needs to be medicated...Only when Donnie is medicated he sees and hears a demonic version of \\"Harvey\\" the rabbit.  Donnie's life becomes a series of strange encounters that he is witness to/or is he responsible for?  Donnie starts to fear the latter of the two.<br />\\"Darko\\" makes me think that I caught a conversation in the middle without knowing the beginning or end.  I don't like a steady diet of films of this nature, but I was apparently in the mood for this one and I found it very satisfying as it left me wanting to rewatch the film and see if I'd really understood it.
B00005J73X|5.0|Thank God this band is still around.  The guys from Jersey still have it.  Each time I listen to this album I remember why I liked them the first time I heard them in the 80s.  They are the finest bar band in the world.  Listening to this album it is easy to see that the energy of the band's youth is still with them.  There is a joy and a freedom in the way they play.  You can feel that same energy coming from their audience.  The live cuts here reach back to their early days and quite honestly its hard to tell the difference in enthusiasm between the classics and the new songs.  This band will become an American icon.  The group is still the same - the same hard working musicians that have stuck through the best and worst of times together.  I'll be with them as a fan for as long as they put keep cranking out the tunes.
B00005RYLE|5.0|First and foremost I'd like to say if your a fan of Evil Dead then this really needs to be in your collection! I know the price is a bit high but it's worth it. This DVD is crystal clear and has many extras. Extras include commentary by Bruce Campbell in which he describes his character and how they did some of the special effects. The cover is also awesome it's the coolest cover I've ever seen. Even my friends, who are not fans of this movie thought the cover was cool.<br />As for the movie. It does not contain a strong story, however great special effects and some good ol blood and gore make up for that. 5 young people go to relax in a secluded cabin in the mountains of Tennessee. When they discover a tape recorder in the basement they are curious to see what is on the tape. Also in the basement they find Necronomicon (Book of the Dead). Upon playing this tape they release the evil dead and all hell breaks loose. Bruce Campbell(Ash) turns from a quivering wimp into the hero. <br />Evil Dead was very controversial upon it's release. Still to this day it is one of my favorites and worthy of anyone's horror collection. It's a pure classic.
0385486804|3.0|I had heard so much about this book that I had to read it. I also heard Singer/Songwriter Ellis Paul perform a song he wrote about the book. Also, I have a CD by &quot;Eddie from Ohio&quot; that mentions McCandless.<br />The facts of the story are fascinating and it stirs noble themes while entertaining you as well. McCandless definitely had a &quot;book worthy&quot; life. The author however strays off into unrelated things often. He embellishes for two whole chapters about himself - interesting but not related enough. I often got the impression that he was trying to make the book longer than it needed to be.<br />Nevertheless, the book is great.
B000007T1M|5.0|It's rare for a band like System of a Down to come along, but nevertheless they are here, thank God for that much. While they are not as good as Tool (well, actually no band is as good as Tool) they kinda remind me of how Tool works inside their music. Like Tool, System hides their messages behind clever metaphors and such. What I really like about System is that most of their songs are really short, yet they can produce out a superb song in that short time frame. They can even get a song done in a minute, and it will still be enjoyable to a lot of fans, which they have done before (example, Storaged). So without further ado, here is my summary of all the songs on this awesome cd.    Suite-Pee - definitely a good way to start out the cd, really good guitar work.  Know - I really like the drums on this song  Sugar - if anything their most popular song, cool lyrics too  Suggestions - I love how Serj changes his voice on this one  Spiders - The softest song on the cd, nice vocals    Ddevil - Probably the funniest song on the cd  Soil - I throughly enjoy Serj's screaming towards the end  War? - Amazon forgot to put this one on the tracklisting (shame, shame). Nevertheless, this is a neat song.  8. Mind - It's cool how it starts out like a porno-like song then just jumps into the heavy stuff.  9. Peephole - sounds like a circus song, but good  10. Cubert - Serj's screaming is really hilarious in this song  11. Darts - Really weird lyrics, but highly enjoyable  12. P.L.U.C.K. - Without a doubt the heaviest song on the cd. I don't think there is any other song by System where you can hear Serj screaming for the longest time. Dr. Malakian (sp?) helps out with the vocals.    Note: Two idiots decided to say my review was unhelpful...aww because I reviewed a good band instead of your beloved Hannah Montana? Get a f**kin life seriously
B000063CPL|5.0|Iron Maiden shines again with a live record that matches, if not surpasses the glory attained by their masterpiece Live After Death. I don't know what record Mr. Woods was listening to, but it wasn't Rock in Rio.
0871137380|4.0|Great book, better than the movie. My only  beef is, like many movies, it has a curious lack of continuity even though it is told chronologically. In many places it would be much more coherent with some links like &quot;Meanwhile, across the street ....&quot; or &quot;From the Somali position, they saw what happened next ....&quot; or &quot;Five blocks south of the crash site, the convoy...&quot; The reader constantly asks &quot;What?&quot; ...&quot;Where are we?&quot;<br />Some of the most suspenseful sequences in the book only stand out on rereading because the writing style doesnt highlight how events unfold.<br />It's a terrific book, and the descriptions of the action are harrowing, but it is written as a report. You need to reread it to grasp all the action and the big picture. The first reading is 5 stars, but the rereading is only 3 stars as the reader wrestles with the chunky narrative style which feels like William Styron on a bad day.
B0000640VN|4.0|We went last night to see Kate and Leopold. Our family enjoyed it, and quite frankly cannot understand why so many people have been negative with this movie. As my daughter was in line with her father to get popcorn, people were saying Do not go see it.<BR>We thoroughly enjoyed it and would say to go and have a nice time. There is almost no swearing, and thank God there is not the sexual stuff, that most of us parents have to view. This is a movie that parents and children can see together. A+ per my 9 year daughter, my 12 year old daughter said this is a family movie. *Hugh stole the show, Meg was just okay in this movie, her brother played by Breckin Meyer is funny and of course Liev Schreiber is always joy to watch. Thumbs UP!
0060934700|5.0|Neil Gaiman's place on my personal \\"favorite authors list\\" is cemented firmly by _Smoke and Mirrors_, a versatile collection of his short stories and narrative poems.  There is a wide variety of \\"types\\" of story here, from fantasy to horror to mystery to wildly hilarious comedy.  I liked almost all of them.<br />Neil Gaiman's two finest gifts are (1) humor, and (2) truly scary horror that gets under your skin rather than just grossing you out with gore.  He flexes his humor muscles with such outstanding fare as \\"Chivalry\\" (the story of an old woman who buys the Holy Grail at a thrift shop), \\"We Can Get Them For You Wholesale\\" (about hit men with discount rates), \\"One Life, Furnished in Early Moorcock\\" (about a young boy and his love for fantasy novels), and \\"Shoggoth's Old Peculiar\\" (believe it or not, a *funny* Cthulhu story, about strange towns, getting drunk, and Things that live under the ocean).  <br />As for horror, there is the story in the intro, \\"The Wedding Present\\", which is sort of a \\"Marriage of Dorian Gray\\", plus several other standouts including two of the narrative poems, \\"The White Road\\" (a montage of Bluebeard tales) and another, whose name I forget, about a woman who is vanished by a magician and _never reappears_.  Truly creepy and hauntingly sad as well.  <br />I could sit on this computer for another hour listing good stories from this collection; however, you'd do better just to buy the book.  If you like psychological horror, dry humor, or anything of the sort, you'll love this.
0375707972|5.0|Michael Berg is confronted with unspeakable Nazi war crimes his former lover, more than twice his age when he became involved with her as a teenager, is accused of committing. Now an adult completing law school, he attends her trial as a student observing courtroom law.  Powerfully effective is the question that Hanna, a former SS guard, puts to the judge inn response to his pinning her down regarding her responsibility in selecting prisoners to be sent back to their certain death at Auschwitz.  She demands, \\"I...I mean...so what would you have done?\\"  Can the reader render inconsequential the war time obligation to obey orders of authorities and superiors, a refusal of which could result in being put to death? Presented from Hanna's perspective that her actions were job related (guarding the many women prisoners locked in a village church) the question when posed the next time, \\"What would you have done?\\", is haunting.   Hanna's testimony suggests that she and the other female SS guards didn't unlock the burning church for fear of personal consequences should the prisoners escape. By not acting, the guards caused the death of all but two of the women locked inside.  But what of those bystanders, the villagers at the scene who didn't dare to challenge the five women guards?  How did their inaction answer the question, \\"What would you have done?\\"  The answer, cowardly or calculated, forever clinging to their consciences is, \\"Nothing\\".  And is my answer a resounding, emphatic insistance that I would have acted to save the prisoners regardless of inevitable execution for defying the state, for failing to allow the SS to\\"do their job\\"?  Am I too cowardly ,calculated or coldly careless to openly oppose murderous antisemitism?  If so, my answer to Hanna's question, \\"What would you have done?\\" is the same shameful answer given by so many ordinary folks in the Nazi party, German army, concentration camps, German government bureaucracy, persons living beside Germany's railroad tracks, persons nearby the Jewish ghettos......all those \\"just plain folks\\" choosing not to become involved.  My answer, unless I'm willing to risk my life, is the same answer that allowed wartime Germany's horrific atrocities to continue unchecked.  If I am truthful, my answer is also, \\"Nothing\\".
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I first heard about this movie as a review for the up and comming DVD release (now released) and found the idea of it interesting, with giant twisted bunnies, time travel, a  crazy motivational speaker, and lots of sub plots (LOTS of sub plots).  Upon watching it I was completely engrossed with this movie.  I watched it twice in a row (thats how engrossed I was) and liked it even more the second time.  I have seen this movie referenced as horror, but it is not.  Some parts of it may be a little overly intense for little kids, but in no way is the intention of the movie to frighten or shock.  It is one of those movies that you end up thinking about for a long time afterwards.  I found the soundtrack lingering in my mind too.  I would DEFINITELY recomend seeing this movie at least once or even twice (there is a lot going on and you can miss a lot with only one viewing) so get your hands on a copy!
B00005QGAZ|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this album! I recently became a huge Michael Jackson fan, and this was the first album I bought. One of my favorite components was the never-before-released verse of the Vincent Price rap for Thriller. Billie Jean is one of my favorite MJ songs, and not only does this have the song, but it has the original demo recording! This album is a real treat for any Michael Jackson fan!!!!!!!
0821221841|5.0|This whole series (The Camera, The Negative, &amp; The Print) are highly recommended for anyone seriously interested in learning more about photography and improving their skills. If you're not interested in that, then the books are probably still worth adding to your collection just to see all of Adams's stunning images.
0380733358|5.0|This was the novel that gave Follet star quality status in publishing circles.  Not only was it a best seller but it also was adapted into a movie, starring Donald Sutherland.<br />Here are some reasons to read THE EYE OF THE NEEDLE:<br />(1) PRECISION: you like reading about cool, precise heroes or anti-heroes or villains who are painfully precise in their plans, the best at what they do and are totally &quot;stone cold.&quot;;<br />(2) WWII BUFF: you love to read about the &quot;big thrills&quot; of WWII; this has it since the German spy discovers D-Day plans and tries to get back to Germany to warn the High Command (i.e. his tap was taken after he was shortly exposed);<br />(3) TAUT THRILLS: if this turns you on, Follet is right up there with Forsythe, Higgins and other masterful spy thriller novelists.;<br />(4) MOVING LOVE/LUST TALES: Follet has always been unusually good at the subplot love stories in his tales; the intimacy level is higher than some people encounter in their real lives; the details of the lovemaking is hot.  I still remember, at one point, the female interest asks the male love interest why he never married and he replied to something along the lines as: &quot;I never loved any woman enough to marry them.&quot;; and<br />(5) LOTS OF COMPLICATIONS FOR THE CHARACTERS: especially for the villain who seems to overcome almost all of them.<br />Follet also does a good job of centering the story on the villain so that you like him and then switching over to another character later.  The transition works for a number of reasons but saying more would spoil the story.
B000000OQY|5.0|This album being a mix of Live rock songs and Acoustic Ballads, is a fine contrast although usually only half the CD should be listened to in the particular mood. The opening 4 (Live) are fantastic rock songs that get you going. The Next four are a little more varied Patience is beautiful, One in a Million is lyrically \\"different\\" and not for the easily offended, as is also the Inlay card, where lyrics were, amusing stories (\\"LIES\\") of Sex Scandles invilving vicars and amongst other things some Soft-Core Pornography. Listen to for the songs buy it for the PORN!
B00005YTFG|2.0|Seeing this movie once was enough.  I loved the costumes and art direction and the movie deserved its Oscars for those.  What I didn't like about the movie was that the director couldn't seem to decide whether it was a campy spoof or a serious musical.  It ended up being neither, which made it weak.  I did like the cast, but didn't like the music - it didn't fit and was distracting.  Some great ideas were there, but I don't think the picture put it all together.  Maybe that's why Luhrmann wasn't nominated for best director and why it didn't win best picture.<br />Previous reviews have described this as one long MTV video.  I think that is a fair description.  It would have been much better with original music, a better story and without a frantic pace that assault's one's senses.
B00005TT77|3.0|This is a fun CD of generally good efforts put in to great songs.<BR>MOST are well done. Rufus Wainwright sounds like he could have been a Beatle. Ben Folds sounds like he needs to buy one of those &quot;perfect pitch&quot; programs so he can cease his habitual &quot;scooping&quot; up to discover the intended note. What an insult he is to Beatles music - but fortunately he only gets to butcher one song. All the rest are pretty cool. Buy it - you'll like it!
B00005OAIE|4.0|What does it take to create a John Mayer in the lab? You'd take the song-writing of David Gray.  You'd then add a bit of Ben Folds sense of humor.  Finally youd add a little of the ballad writing profciency (especially on the last track, St Patrick's Day)of Barry Manilow.  Yes thats right. I said Barry Manilow.<br />Enjoy!
B00005A46T|2.0|You can play all the guitars on this cd with one or two fingers.  There's like 9 people in this band, so you'd think they could play something technical.
6305128952|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. It has a nice love story that isn't to mushy, all the actors/actresses are wonderful and the story line keeps you interested.  It's not just for horse lovers. <br />The DVD is wide screen which I personally do not like, if you view on a computer DVD it is in a small box. I own DVD and VHS in this movie, I love it that much.  I recommend it to everyone.

0064407667|5.0|After catching sight of this in my title in my school it looked cool and so I read it and aftr that I was hooked. This one is the best to date in my opinion. It is lots of fun. The author of this seirse tells you that it is the worsed book in the world so course you want to. BUY THIS!!
0807282375|5.0|i have read this book 3 times already and i love it! for me it is easily one of the best books i've ever read.i mean some people might say that it goes too slow or its too descriptive but its a wonderful story and it just entranced me.its very well written and i'll say it again.its a WONDERFUL book.
B000060P79|5.0|When i saw first saw Simple Plan back in december of 2001 i wished i had heard of them sooner. Their music was so awesome, a great mix of punk and pop with catchy lyrics. I knew they would eventually create an amazing album and No Pads, No Helmets... Just Balls is it! The lyrics in songs such as &quot;One Day&quot; portray exactly how most teens feel. I love Simple Plan's music because it makes all the bad things seem alright. Definately get this album.. it rocks!
B00005QHPQ|5.0|I bought this CD for the sole purpose of his new hit single 'escape&quot;. I usually don't buy a whole cd for one song but I did this time. I was not let down at all! I never have seen enrique at a concert or on TV but after this CD I am a huge fan! I like the whole CD. there are a few songs that aren't quite &quot;catchy&quot; but they are good enough. i never skip a track while listening. My favorites are don't turn out the lights, Love 4 fun, and One night stand. &quot;Escape&quot; has been put on the backburner even though it was the song I originally bought it for. The best CD I have heard in months.. and will probably be in the CD player non stop for a lot more!! Please take my advice and buy it!!
B00003CXPJ|3.0|This movie was almost too painful to watch, like America's funniest home videos, when you know the kid is going to knock a home run straight into his father's jimmy sack, it hurts, you know it does, yet still you watch.  This movie is a straight kick in the mental croch, yet it is almost impossible to turn away from it and watch something more intellectual like Airplane! or a rerun of Jerry Springer, the black homosexual midget clans man or something.  Is my point clear enough yet?  The movie is a must watch if you are into stupid humor and wasting your time, watch it on a rainy day when you don't want to go outside and smell the sewage in Jersey.  Though I might add, that the entire southern section of California might not want to view this title, you may take it as a serious movie.
B00003CXI1|2.0|This movie, while yes it had magnificent visual effects and stunning imagery, relied solely upon that.  The acting was horrible, particularly by the boy playing Harry Potter himself.  The entire time he didn't show any resemblance of emotion and entirely lacked dimension.  Not to mention that with all the cuts and edits of the book there is next to no character development for anyone but Potter himself.  Furthermore, in comparison to the book, they cut and rewrote sequences, vital to the story that ultimately resulted in the book and movie versions being to completely different stories.  Instead of developing Dumbledore, Hagrid, or any number of the supporting characters, or ACCURATELY portraying their forray into the Forbidden Forest, or accurately portraying the ending itself, or the sequence with Fluffy, they made 15-20 minute sequences of lone visual effects for the quidditch match.  Not even all of the quidditch matches, just one.<br />Overall, this movie was just an asinine insult to any true Harry Potter fans.  I would've gladly traded the entirety of the visual effects for an accurate storyline.  They chopped, sliced, and diced the book to death, entirely rewriting sequences that leaves you wondering why something is happening, and why it's not even SIMILAR to the book.  The only reason it got 2 stars from me is the visual effects.<br />If you're looking for a true life version of the book, hope that the second movie is better.

B00004WG2X|4.0|I read the book of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" before I ever saw any versions of it on screen and after reading \\"Mansfield Park\\" by Jane Austen (terrible book! You'll want to slaughter Fanny) can appreciate why most people enjoy P & P the most. Elizabeth was easily my favorite character because she is witty, has her faults, and is playful and fun. I didn't fall in love so much with Mr. Darcy who seemed a bit of a stick in the mud, but by the end of the book when they married I had plenty of warm, fuzzy feelings. Still, Mr. Darcy wasn't the most likable, so when I bought the more recent version and watched it, I was like WOW! 'Cuz not only do you like Mr. Darcy, you fall in love with him thanks to Collin Firth's superb acting. In the older version, however, David Rintoul played him a little too stiff and uppity. His portrayl is closer to that of Mr. Darcy than the dreadful Laurence Olivier version (Mr. Darcy is far too \\"perky\\" in that one). Still, even in the book, Mr. Darcy at least smiled every now and then; here he's as morose as a corpse. Jane in this version is prettier than Elizabeth as depicted in the book, which is better because I didn't find the Jane in the more modern version that pretty although I think the actress in the A&E version did a better job of portraying Jane's character. Comparing Elizabeth Garvie's performance and Jennifer Ehle's to determine a favorite is very tough. Garvie's performance is probably closer to the book as is the rest of the movie, but Jennifer Ehle's Lizzie is more playful, like Elizabeth is described as. I didn't really see Garvie as \\"playful\\", but she still did an excellent job. All in all, this version was just a whole lot more boring than the Firth/Ehle one. In that one I was hooked from beginning to end, but this one I found I just didn't really care one way or another. Mainly I just watched it to note the differences between both versions and the novel. This version is closer to the book, but all in all the version with Jennifer Ehle and Collin Firth is my favorite. There's such chemistry between the two main characters, which was lacking in the older one, so while it's all right, the BBC/A&E venture captured my heart more.
0812548094|5.0|I was wondering if Goodkind could pull off in a 2nd novel what he had started with his terrific 1st effort in 'Wizard's First Rule' but I must admit, he did a mighty fine job with 'Stone of Tears'.  Personally, I felt it was about 95% as good as book #1, but that is still high praise indeed since WFR is easily one of my all-time favorite Fantasy novels.<br />'Stone' picks up immediately where WFR left off...Richard has defeated the horrific Darken Rahl -- who turns out to be none other than Richard's own Father -- and has found a way around<br />the magic of the Mother Confessor, Kahlan...all is well in the Land...right?  Not for a second.  Within moments of the opening page something has escaped from the Underworld, which is supposedly impossible -- but nevertheless, it happens, almost killing Zedd.  Uh oh.  Meanwhile Richard &amp; Kahlan are reunited with the Mud People preparing for their wedding when three unwelcome women show up and spoil the party.  They claim to be Sisters of the Light, come to save Richard from himself and to teach him how to govern his Gift.  At first I thought this seemed rather hokey, but Goodkind manages to make it absolutely riviting.  Without spoiling the plot too much, Richard reluctantly agrees to travel to the Old World in order to learn more of this Gift he was born with, all the while acting as if he is a prisoner.  It is a long trek to the Palace of the Prophets in the Old World, and we get to know a lot more about Richard and Verna, the last of the three Sisters of the Light that came to find Richard.  Goodkind gives us the impression that this is indeed a very long journey, but he also fills the quest with adventure and danger every step of the way.<br />After arriving at the Palace of the Prophets, Richard is stunned to realize that it is expected to take many YEARS in order to learn all that the Sisters of the Light expect to teach him, maybe even HUNDREDS of years.  A spell has been cast over the Palace which slows time for those within, allowing them the time to study and learn all that it will take in order to become a Wizard.  This of course is unacceptable to Richard, who views life without Kahlan to be no life at all.  In addition to all this Kahlan is experiencing an adventure of her own.  In the Palace is also the place where we first learn of Emperor Jagang and his ability to invade the dreams of his servants turning even a few of the Sisters of the Light into Sisters of the Dark (not unlike the Dark Side of the Force).  There are those within the palace who desperately wish for Richard to fail, at the same time there are a few who are slowly discovering that Richard just might be someone of incredible importance to the history of the world.  Goodkind has crafted what I consider one of the best<br />Fantasy tales ever told with his first two books, and although<br />book #3 is slightly less entertaining, the series overall is MUCH stronger than most available today, and better than most available at ANY time.  In short, 'Stone of Tears' is a tremendous addition to an already Fantastic Fantasy series.  Buy it.  Read it.  Enjoy it.

B00005OAIE|5.0|I feel that this albulm is one of those few works where you can listen to it all the way through and not have the desire to skip over any of the tracks.  It is nicely laid out and and the band makes the albulm a fully congealed and viscous work.  The opening track, \\"No Such Thing\\", transports the listener to a time when they were so desperately stifled by the pressures of making ridiculous choices during their final year of high school.  These choices were supposedly going to be the major decisions of their lives and placed many unnecessary stresses onto people.  The majority of tracks on this albulm have a theme that is highly relatable to what an individual is either currently going through or has gone through and for that certain songs such as \\"My Stupid Mouth\\", \\"Back To You\\", and \\"83\\" resonate such a strong chord.  This albulm brings an artist of great talent and even greater potential to light.
B00001QEBQ|4.0|Mulan fits well in the long line of Disney's princesses who make us laugh cry and sing.  She was a welcome addition after a long getaway from the happy go lucky princess story line.  not only did she keep up the high par of romance and adventure, she broke boundaries that disney had not yet crossed.  an adventure where the princess was not only a heroine of the story line but a heroine of her entire country.  kudos to Mukan and kudos to disney.  An absolute MUST WATCH film.
014118213X|4.0|I expected Jane Austen and got a very pleasant surprise.  Forster uses his characters and their relationships and a launching pad for more philosophical and sociological ruminations.  And not in a contrived way, but in the almost intuitive way our own interactions with the people we meet stimulate us, provoke us, and stretch us.  <BR>   And as far as I know, this book is one of a kind in that it treats people with no imagination with dignity and respect.  Most of us are aware there is some kind of division in the world between artists and businessmen, and the division has shown up often enough in literature sure enough.  But as all producers of fiction are by necessity on the artist side of the division, businessmen are usually the villains, evil at worst and stupid at best, and artists, are, quite naturally, the heroes.  Forster is uniquely wise enough to peer into the enemy camp and see beauty and value.  <BR> My feel is that Forster's characterization at times surpasses his writing ability.  This is more praise than criticism; his vivid imagination is able to conjure and follow characters that his pen finds difficult to put on the page. They move and live and act in ways he is unable to fully explain or account for. And when was the last time you were able to truly capture all the complexities, intricacies and contradictions of a real person with the rudimentary elements of pen paper and alphabet?  That Forster's characters defy characterization may be a contradiction, but in my book it is high praise.    <BR> And the way Forster often philosophizes might annoy others, but I do enjoy it.  There is a passage early in the book about Beethoven's Fifth Symphony that is thinly costumed to make it fit within the frames of the book, I love it for what it is -- a brilliant exposition on a distinct piece of music.  --...<br />Some quotes I enjoyed: <br />\\"It is the vice of a vulgar mind to be thrilled by bigness, to think that a thousand square miles are a thousand timesmore wonderful than one square mile, and that a million square miles are almost the same as heaven.  That is not imagination.  No, it kills it.\\"  (23)<br />\\"What is the good of your stars and trees, your sunrise and the wind, if they do not enter into our daily lives?...Haven't we all to struggle against life's daily greyness, against pettiness, against mechanical cheerfulness, against suspicion?  I struggle by remembering my friends; others I have known by remembering some place--some beloved place or tree--we thought you were one of these.\\" (112)<br />\\"England was alive, throbbing through all her estuaries, crying for joy through the mouths of all her gulls, and the north wind, with contrary motion, blew stronger against her rising seas.  What did it mean?  For what end are her fair complexities, her changes of soil, her sinuous coast?  Does she belong to those who have molded her and made her feared by other lands, or to those who added nothing to her power, but have somehow seen her, seen the whole island at once, lying as a jewel in a silver sea, sailing as a ship of souls, with all the brave world's fleet accompanying her towards eternity?\\"  (138)<br />\\"The business man who assumes that this life is everything, and the mystic who asserts that it is nothing, fail, on this side and on that, to hit the truth.  \\"Yes, I see, dear; it's about halfway between,\\"  Aunt Juley hazarded in earlier years.  No; truth, being alive, was not halfway between anything.  It was only to be found by continuous excursion into either realm, and though proportion is the final secret, to espouse it at the outset is to insure sterility.\\"  (153)<br />\\"Love and Truth-- their warfare seems eternal.  Perhaps the whole visible world rests on it, and if they were one, life itself, like the spirits when Prospero was reconciled to his brother, might vanish into air, into thin air.\\"  (181)<br />\\"But man is an odd, sad creature as yet, intent on pilfering the earth, and heedless of the growths within himself.  He cannot be bored about psychology.  He leaves it to the specialist, which is as if he should leave his dinner to be eaten by a steam-engine.  He cannot be bothered to digest his own soul.\\"  (219)<br />\\"She could not assess her trespass by any moral code; it was everything or nothing.  Morality can tell us that murder is worse than stealing, and group most sins in an order all must approve, but it cannot group Helen.  The surer its pronouncements on this point, the surer may we be that morality is not speaking.  Christ was evasive when they questioned Him.  It is those that cannot connect who hasten to cast the first stone.\\" (246)

The music is incredibly well written and truly shows the pain hedwig has gone through on her long journey to the stage.  You follow her from East Berlin to Junction City, Kansas.  Along the way you meet some interesting characters and hear some great fun music.  Enjoy the best rock musical ever written.
0156421178|5.0|Written with passion, verve and brilliance, this is Orwell's personal history of his time fighting in the Spanish Civil War.  A liberal leftist in the old sense of the words, his dedication to political liberty compelled him to put his life on the line for the ideals he held dear.<br />And a harrowing experience it was.  Orwell shows how the forces of the Republic were themselves split along idealogical lines and eventually became totalitarian as the war progressed.  The atrocities on both sides, the deeply felt values of his anarchists and the political intrigues of an increasingly crumbling republic are all highlighted.<br />Read Orwell.  Read this, his essays and his novels, not just the popular 1984 or Animal Farm.  His one one of the great voices of the early-mid twentieth century.  A contrarian, a liberal leftest and an anti-totalitarian.  Homage to Catalonia is one of the most gripping tales of the twentieth century by one of it's most shining minds.
B00005OAIE|4.0|John Mayer is a great artist. To me, not only does he have some comparisons with Dave Matthews, but also to Dashboard Confessional. My favorite songs on this CD are &quot;My Stupid Mouth&quot; and &quot;Love Song for No One&quot;...but every song seems special for its own reasons. I have to wonder why he skipped a number 13 track though.
B00004Z459|2.0|I've been wanting to review this album for a while now, but I just couldn't quite figure out what I wanted to say about it.  Now I've got it.  I must admit, this is a well-made album.  Linkin Park takes a sophisticated and eclectic approach to the genre, and does a pretty good job with it.  They blend rap, rock (there's no metal to be found here), and some techno rather effortlessly, and it all just fits together.  The musicians are all pretty average (except for Brad Delson, who is well below), but they do what needs to be done.<br />However, the reason I give this only two stars is simply because I don't like it.  I'm not a fan of this genre, and I have pretty much no desire to listen to anything like this.  But, I do see that they do this quite a bit better than most of the other people out there.  They manage to create a sound that is mostly their own, and they even write pretty decent lyrics, a rarity in this genre.  The vocalists work very well together, also.  Chester is no Geoff Tate or James LaBrie, but he does ok, and Mike Shinoda is a really good rapper, especially for a white guy.  I'm not personally a fan of rapping, but I know what it takes to be good at it.  The best songs here, I'd say, are &quot;A Place for my Head&quot;, &quot;Forgotten&quot;, and &quot;Pushing Me Away&quot;.  &quot;In the End&quot; is ok, but way too overplayed.  But then, I don't listen to anything that plays it, so to quote the song, &quot;it doesn't even matter&quot;.  The only really bad song is &quot;One Step Closer&quot;, because it sounds like every other numetal band out there.  That, and on the chorus to &quot;Papercut&quot;, the guy sounds too much like Fred Durst, which is of course a very bad thing.  Everywhere else, they have a sound all their own.  The only thing I really hate about this album is the turntables.  I could probably give this album 3 stars if not for that.  I understand that turntables are a big part of hip hop, but I don't get why.  They don't really do anything, and I can't stand the sound of them.  They really need to do away with that.<br />Yep, ditch the turntables and get a better guitarist, and you've got something pretty good here.  But as it is, I don't care much for this.  If you're a big fan of both rap and rock respectively, this is something you really need to get.  Otherwise, I don't know.  If I listened to this after Limp Bizkit's &quot;Significant Other&quot;, it would sound brilliant, but if I listened to it after Dream Theater's &quot;Scenes from a Memory&quot;, it would sound pretty worthless.  I don't know.  Decide for yourself.o anything, and I can't stand the sound of them.

B000002J09|5.0|Led Zeppelin IV, the finest Zeppelin album and one of the most distinctive, unique, powerful and moving rock albums of all time deserves more than the 5 stars that I have given it here.  Being a huge classic rock fan and having listened to all of Zeppelin's material, I must say that this is a must to anyone's collection. ...  I am only 16 years old, but I am proud of the fact that I will never fall into the world of unimaginative modern pop trash that is coming out today.  If you really look into music and respect the talent and musical intelligence that goes into an album like this, you will realize we may never see an album of this quality again.  I strongly urge you to give this album a try, you won't regret it.
B000063CPL|5.0|If \\"Brave New World\\" wasn't a good enough indication that Maiden is back with a vengeance, I cannot think of a better one than this.  I'm sure there will be plenty of argument as to whether or not this album is as good as \\"Live after Death\\", so you know what?  I'm not even going to discuss it.  One thing for sure is that this is certainly their best live album since that one.<br />What we have here is nearly two hours of excellent live metal.  The new album, \\"Brave New World\\", is well-represented, with 6 of its 10 songs on here, done to perfection.  Many of the old favorites can be found here as well, such as \\"The Trooper\\", \\"Hallowed Be Thy Name\\", and \\"The Number of the Beast\\", and they're as great as ever.  Heck, even the Blayze Bailey songs sound great.  But really, the only bad thing about them was Blayze, anyway.  Hearing Bruce sing \\"The Clansman\\" is just awesome.  You can just see William Wallace charging across the field, can't you?  \\"Sign of the Cross\\" is well-made, but that instrumental section is just way too long.  Yep, an awesome live album.  However, there is one problem.  There is NOTHING from \\"Somewhere in Time\\" on here!  Not one song!  How could they not include \\"Wasted Years\\", or \\"Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner\\"?  I was really disappointed about that, but oh well.<br />Everything that actually is here is perfect.  The musicians all play very tight, and Bruce further solidifies his position as one of the top metal vocalists.  The crowd is very lively, and you can tell they're having a great time (why are foreign audiences so much more enthusiastic than American ones?  What's the matter with us?).  And, once again, we have Bruce screaming \\"Scream for me, Brazil!\\".  Yep, you've heard that before.<br />This is just what I needed.  The best album to come out this year, and one of the best live albums period.  I'm sure Megadeth's live album is a good one too, but there's just no comparing it to this.  Now all we need is a new studio album.<br />Up the Irons!!!>Up the Irons!!!
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This is a terrific film, brilliantly directed, with a great cast. Not what I would call a perky flick, but if you like movies that are 100% captivating and stories that are compelling, you should check out this film.
B000062Y98|5.0|Well, I was curious to see how they could ever make a follow-up to the amazing &quot;Nightfall in Middle Earth&quot;, but it would appear that the hard work payed off.  Blind Guardian spent a LOT of time on this album, and that is audible in every note.  Destined to make the biggest, most intricate songs ever made, Hansi and the boys make a strong comeback.  They didn't quite reach the heights of &quot;Nightfall&quot;, but then I really didn't expect them to anyway.  That's an album to be reckoned with.<br />The overall sound is very similar to that of &quot;Nightfall&quot;, with the mostly slower pace and the multiple vocal arrangements.  It doesn't really have the same feel as &quot;Nightfall&quot;, but it has that same grandiose air about it.  &quot;Precious Jerusalem&quot; gets everything going with its big choruses, and lightning fast solos.  There are some great ballads here, such as &quot;The Maiden and the Minstrel Knight&quot;, and &quot;The Age of False Innocence&quot;.  &quot;Punishment Divine&quot; is a throwback to the old days, hitting fast and hard.  &quot;And Then There Was Silence&quot; is probably the highlight, a 14-minute ode to the Iliad, with multiple layers, and some dynamite vocals.  &quot;Mies del Dolor&quot; is probably the biggest surprise of the album.  Originally called &quot;Harvest of Sorrow&quot;, this is basically just a Spanish version of that song.  Yeah, that's right, Hansi speaking Spanish.  You have to hear it to believe it.  Great song though, with very nice acoustic guitars.  I would liked to have heard some Spanish style licks in there, but you can't have it all, can you?<br />One thing I noticed about this album is the lyrics.  They seem to be writing more meaningful stuff now, rather than just fantasy type stuff.  &quot;Nightfall&quot; was their first step toward more emotional lyrics, but it seems they really spoke from the heart here. Often, the fantasy elements are symbolic of a more profound idea, which I think is a very good thing.  But don't worry, there's still plenty of fantasy elements here as well.<br />There's just no denying how well-made this album is.  It's a very big production, and nearly perfect.  I'm not real familiar with the Queen album of the same name, but I don't even have to hear it to know it can't compare to this.  Nothing against Queen, they are an excellent band,  but BG is in a league they could never hope to touch.  I don't really recommend this to newcomers of the band, check out the older stuff first, but once you're a fan, get this.  It is bound to be one of the strongest releases of the year.y good thing.

B000001FI7|5.0|No matter what genre of music you're into, if you have taste in music, you will respect Portishead as gifted and intelligent artists and love the album.<br />With the exception of &quot;It's A Fire&quot; where Beth's voice gets a bit too irritating and the mediocre &quot;Wandering Star&quot;, but the other songs are so good that those songs don't effect the overall quality of the album. &quot;Mysterons&quot; sounds like the soundtrack to a 1950's sci-fi spoof while &quot;Sour Times&quot; begs to be the theme song of a James Bond movie. Jazz influences are evident on &quot;Strangers&quot; and &quot;Pedestal&quot;, and the band reveals a softer edge on the R&amp;B-ish &quot;It Could Be Sweet&quot; where Beth pours her feelings into every syllable especially when she sings &quot;try a little harder&quot;. On &quot;Numb&quot;, she sounds depressed and as if she's teasing at the same time and I like how she sings &quot;reveal what I could feel&quot;. The producer, Geoff Barrow, is able to make &quot;Biscuit&quot; sound like a hip hop, jazz, and old school soul song all at the same time. &quot;Roads&quot; and &quot;Glory Box&quot; are the best songs because they are simply perfect. &quot;Roads&quot;, with its lush strings was made for scenes in a movie where something emotional has happened or someone is making some big journey or revelation and &quot;Glory Box&quot; has an outstanding closure.<br />Each song has little details that move the song up one notch. This came out in 1994 but it is still in a league of its own when compared with most of the stuff coming out today.
B00005K3OT|4.0|This movie was about bringing out the fun in everyone's life.  I enjoyed the subtle hints and jokes here and there.  All in all, this was a tasty film to watch but not overly pleasing to the mind and eye.  It could have been a little bit better.
0380817683|5.0|There are lots of books out there - both fiction and non-fiction - about people dealing with drug, alcohol and other addictions.  But Marian Keyes approaches this fairly familiar terrain with unusual wit, intelligence, and humanity - a winning combination that makes Rachel's Holiday hard to put down.  <BR>   This is humorous social commentary with depth.  Entertainmentwise, it's in that rarified league populated with comic gems like Sophie Kinsella's Shopholic duo, and Dorothy Samuels' skewering of America's crazy celebrity obsession in her novel, Filthy Rich.  But don't be surprised if you also shed a few tears.

B00005V9QJ|4.0|Prior to this, I have not actually watched or heard a full Sade concert. I have been a fan for a while and was very pleased that Sade is releasing a live concert CD.<br /><br />The wild fans cheer with each Sade number, and not to mention how great this 40-ish soul bird sounds. She's hot. what's even hotter are the songs. From the breathtaking 1st number Cherish The Day to oldies such as Smooth Operator and Jezebel and newer stuff suchn as By Your Side, you know you havent heard anything like this yet. The old songs take on a new dimension, making them as relevant as they were 15 years back. Sade sounds terribly soulful and her stage charm is irresistable. She doesn't say much but her lo-tech-hi-style show promises to be fun too especially when Sade take to the floor and dances quite admirably.<br /><br />Her costume change also brings on her funkier edge, where she performs the very funky Flow from Lovers Rock. The rock rocked every part of it. Her backup singers and band are pretty cool too, sychronizing with her seamlessly on each number.<br /><br />The only grouse: this is only 13-song long.........but hey there's the DVD with additional tracks..........
B00004XQ83|5.0|I saw the movie before I heard the soundtrack on CD.  The movie in my opinion does absolutely no justice for the soundtrack (although the movie wasn't horrid by any means). The songs are fun, deep and they stick to yer ribs. A must have for any music fans collection.  <BR>   Of course you can hear a record quality on some of the songs but for me that only added to the experience. You can't expect digital sound out of everything you listen to especially out of old recordings.  Music would be boring if it were all digitally enhanced.  I get the childhood feeling of sitting at my great-grandmothers feet and listening to her pick her banjo when I listen to this disc. To me that's the best feeling in the world.
B00005ATQD|5.0|If you blink, you'll probably miss something.  It's a shame such a great movie like this one was terribly misunderstood.  If you are someone who enjoys movies as an &quot;escape&quot; from reality, but who doesn't like to be challenged by thought-provoking films, skip this one!!  Eyes Wide Shut is a dark, mysterious, spooky, and strange movie.  It's ending is not one of those neat and tidy, happily ever after conclusions either.  It's up to the viewer to decide what was reality and what was the fantasy.  Is the whole movie someone's dream, or just the masked ball?  Why did Alice's &quot;nightmare&quot; that she described almost match the masked ball perfectly?  Was she there?  After watching this movie, you will definitely be asking many many questions.  Unfortunately, there are no definite answers. I'm a huge fan of Kubrick and thought this was one of his best films, aside from A Clockwork Orange, of course!!  Anyways, great performances by Tom and Nicole.  Who would've thought they wouldn't still be together!?!?  I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys movies that rise above the norm, or who likes to think about them after.  A truly great film, but often misunderstood and overlooked.
B000002JS6|4.0|BACK IN BLACK is fantastic. But, as Bon SCott was capable of making every single AC/DC album with him into a classic, Brian Johnson, a third-rate singer, had so much luck that his debut in the band was so successfull, otherwise, he would not last long...<BR>Johnson is a greta guy, but a lousy singer and lyrics writer.<BR>So, the success of BACK IN BLACK made the band think that they had a great singer in hands to replace Bon, but that was not true. The proof is thatm afer 1981s FOR THOSE ABOUT TO ROCK, the quality of AC/DC records dropped significantly.
0783240503|4.0|Amazing is the first word that comes to mind. The songs are so catchy that every time I watch it I catch myself humming them for the next 3 days.  The characters are very well cast, and very funny. The choreography and staging was very well done. Bravo!<BR>My only gripe is those awful blue girls in the Pharoah scene. . .they look disgusting. Get rid of them, and put a little more clothing on Mrs. Potiphar and her girls, and I think this would be a a 5 star musical, and one that I would even aspire to audition for myself sometime.

All that arsenal at the disposal of one foolish singer called King Diamond, who, for this album, wrote some of the most pedestrian satanic lyrics ever. Seldom have I heard such a quantity of [junk] coming from the mouth of a singer. Other than this, his screaming only served to make Fate lose a lot of potential fans and buyers.<BR>FIVE STARS FOR THE MUSIC.<BR>ZERO STARS FOR THE SINGER.
0393307050|4.0|I gave this series a try after being very much dissapointed with reading Dewey Lamdin's &quot;This King's Coat.&quot; I would say without hesitation that this novel is far superior in almost every way.<br />The characters are well drawn, the writing excellent, though at times it was so dry that it was hard to follow. Unfortunately, I had already ready the first installment of the Alan Lewrie series, so I feel that much of the explanation of how ship-life ran was more of a review for me.  <br />There are a few downsides, though. Most of all, it seemed to lack a moving plot, and seems to focus instead on setting the stage for some grand adventures. The conclusion, however, seems to fit very nicely in to the story, and I look forward to reading the next book whenever I have time.
B000063CPL|5.0|Let's get one thing straight. Bruce is NOT a liar.<br />There are NO overdubs on this live album. While it was being mixed in New York by Kevin Shirley and myself, Bruce was in London to my knowledge, or wherever he was, it's not an issue except to say that he couldn't overdub anything if he wasn't there!<br />What HAS happened is that I made an executive decision to cut and paste with a computer to put back in, his LIVE on the night vocals into parts where where he was getting the audience to sing on some choruses on some lines on their own. The reason I did this is because in the cold light of day it sounds better with him back in there because sometimes the audience were either out of time or not quite loud enough. So I simply cut out parts of his vocal on the line before and pasted it into the next line which was possible because it was a repetitive part. <br />I find it amazing that people would question this band's integrity and indeed go as far as accuse someone of being a liar. Supposed fans like that we don't want, as far as I'm concerned we're better off without people like that. If you don't like what I've done with the album, don't buy it. Simple!
B00005JKQX|5.0|The film A Beautiful Mind was wonderful. One of the best movies ever made.Russell Crowe gave the best performance of his career to date, and the supporting cast was amazing. <BR>  Ron Howard brilliantly directed the picture, and was able to bring audiences as close as possible to understanding schizophrenia by making the alluisions John Nash suffered from visible to us. This makes it possible to truly comprehend to a greater degree what he had to live with. <BR>  I strongly recommend this film to everyone. It is a must see movie!
B00005JKED|1.0|This COULD have been an interesting exploration of ethics, race, and the war on drugs. Instead you get a very miscast Ethan Hawke (who still does a good job) as an unbelievably naive cop, and excellent performance from Denzel that is nevertheless one-note evil. You could walk away from this movie thinking that Black and Hispanic people are violent and evil and that white people are either highly moral, or if they are corrupt, at least not murderers. I don't like that message. This movie also has one of the WORST ways to save a hero I have ever seen: the old coincidence at the last minute. Trust me, this alone ruins the film. The stupid shootout at the end only confirms that the writer had no idea how to truly deal with the important issues the film raises.
079073804X|5.0|The movie that launched the most controversy the world had ever witnessed! This film, based on the 1971 novel by William Peter Blatty, was released on December 26th, 1973.......only to shock and terrify anyone who dared to see it. Upon release, the film went on to break box-office records, garner 2 Academy Awards and countless nominations, and show the world what had never been seen before. This film depicts a successful actress whose daughter's body has been possessed by the Devil himself. The daughter, played by Linda Blair, is changing for the worse every day as the Devil grows in her. Ellen Burstyn plays a powerful role as the mother, Chris MacNeil. She received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress and did Linda Blair for Best Supporting Actress. The film holds intensity up until the shocking exorcism scene, performed by Jason Miller and Max Von Sydow. The film is a true masterpiece of the horror genre and the best among the AFI's 100 Greatest Movie List. Avoid the sequels.

Two other IFP winners were &quot;In the Bedroom&quot; and &quot;Memento&quot;, both shut out by Oscar. What do you make of that?
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This movie is pure genius.  I have to admit it caught me off guard the first time I saw it, but there's no doubt that Baz Lhurman has created a masterpiece.  &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; has now become one of my favorite movies of all time.   Not only is it a great story, but it is a visual feast accompanied by a great soundtrack.  <BR>And as for the DVD, they have done a great job.  Beautiful presentation and all the extras you could hope for.<BR>...don't doubt, get this NOW!  You won't regret it.
B00005JKED|4.0|\\"Training Day\\" is a film that takes any preconceived notions that you had about the buddy cop film and rips them to shreds. Not that this film was ever trying to be or ever seen as a \\"buddy cop\\" film but something about the movie still seems to go against every other cop film we have seen. It contains the themes and ideas of such gritty, realistic cop films as \\"Serpico\\" and \\"The French Connection\\" but manages to kick it up another notch.<br />The film follows the first day on the job of a rookie cop in LA, played very well by Ethan Hawke. For his first day on the job he is going to be riding around with an old pro of the area called Alonso who is played by Denzel Washington in one of his best roles in a long time. Sounds pretty standard so far and with that description one might decide to settle in for a two hour film of the old pro teaching the hot headed rookie a thing or two while they solve a case. Don't count on it. Alonzo is about to take Hawke's character straight into to bowels of LA and show him that Alonzo is worse than most of the hardened criminals on the street. The entire film takes place on this first \\"training day\\" and the amount of stuff that happens to Hawke's character is amazing. I won't say all that happens but it is a hell of a first day.<br />The film works because it is great on many differant levels, the first of which is the screenplay. It is a great story with rich and vibrant characters that take some standard cliches, such as the dirty cop and the new guy, to the absolute extreme. Through their actions and conversations we slowly see the ins and outs of these characters and by the end of the film we can finally see what they are all about. Also the plot itself is great with everything from intense standoffs to exciting gun fights to revealing conversations. The second great thing about the movie is the acting. Ethan Hawke is great as the new guy. He adds a subtle side to his character and he is a pleasure to watch as he tries to comprehend the world that he has just been thrown into. Washington comes to the screen as a corrupt, fast talking hustler with a secret side to him and we can't help but believe every minute of it. This is his best role since \\"The Hurricane\\" and the Oscar was richly deserved.<br />The last great thing about this movie is the directing. The film feels gritty and the colouring is great. There  is a certain amount of style added to the film that raises the film from good to great. There is an obvious sense of story and character here and it is this sense that ties the whole film together and makes it work.<br />Not an absolute masterpiece but still a very exciting and extremely interesting film that feels very fresh and original.  Definatly a must see for anyone...nd the world that he has just been thrown into.

B000002J1S|5.0|I just finished reading many of the 117 reviews for the Lamb album on this site, and I concur with most of them -- it is a stunning work that has stood the test of time. But here's the BIG question: Are the Generation Xers and Yers listening to this album -- and the other early Genesis albums we all love? Or is this music going to peter out when all the Baby Boomers who grew up in the 60s and 70s begin to die off? I have a daughter now in college and I know many of her friends. I know what they listen to and it isn't Genesis. Too bad, hugh? They know all the Beatles' work, and the (bad) popular music of OUR time, but they don't listen to Genesis. If you're younger than 25, and you think you're hip -- then buy this album. And if you're younger than 25 and you know some music that rivals this Genesis classic (after you've gotten to know it well), then please, let me know because I haven't found IT.
B000002L75|5.0|\\"Some Great Reward\\" is one of Depeche Mode's best earlier albums and is also one of my favorites by them. Favorite five tracks: \\"Something to Do\\" (#1, quick and on speed--one of the few fast songs on here); \\"People Are People\\" (#3, preachy but catchy lyrics); \\"Stories of Old\\" (#5); \\"Master and Servant\\" (#7, fast-paced s/m fetish fantasy); and \\"Blasphemous Rumours\\" (#9, typical DM gloom-and-doom about death and religious cynicism).<br />I enjoy most of Depeche Mode's music because they are bleak and depressing, but when they add cheesy love ballads like \\"It Doesn't Matter\\" and \\"Somebody\\", it really ruins the dark, brooding effect. Other than those two, the rest of the songs on here make this CD worth owning if you're a true Depeche Mode fan.
B000001FY9|5.0|let me start off by saying that i can't think of anyone in their right mind who doesn't love this album. what not to love? bob marley continues to touch the very hearts of people with his inspirational music and manages to bring smiles a plenty to people from all walks of life. legend could not be more necessary than now what with all the mass confusion of everyday life and all the melodrama we go through on a day to day basis. it's no wonder that this man has inspired so many musicians and artists as probability suggests he will live on through the ages and continue to inspire all who are willing to listen or open their hearts. if you need that extra bit of energy or a boost here and there, legend is the cd you must have in your collection. this may be one of the few albums you will be listening to as long as you live. bob marley music can be played at any given time in the day and you will always feel the energy, the inspiration, and brilliant insight which he offers us so gracefully. long live the legend !!!
1572701188|4.0|Northanger Abbey was a good novel to read.  It's not too long or short.  It is very funny.  Catherine, the main character, in the first is described fabulously as what you could call in these days as a ruff and tumble girl.  However, Northanger Abbey's ending is disapointing.  Nothing really is solved (opposite to other Austen novels)Catherine's marriage just brings in more upcoming problems.  So the ending is like a cliff hanger.  Some of it is rather spooky like when they actaully get to Northanger Abbey.  But, if you expect this to be a horror novel; it is definetely not.  Some parts maybe might be called scary, but its not a scary book as a whole.  It may be a bit creepy in some parts but mostly not.  Moreover, I liked this book.
0441172717|4.0|Since its publication, Dune has recieved an impressive reputation in the SF community.  If you expect this work to be the greatest novel ever, you'll probably just be dissappointed.  On the other hand, if you just expect it to be above-average science fiction, you'll get what you're looking far.<br />Dune is set in the far distant future, when a single emperor rules all of humanity and various Houses govern individual planets.  The main character is Paul of the House Atreides, which has recently been sent to govern the planet known as Dune.  Dune is important for political and economic reasons because it produces a special spice that is necessary for interstellar travel.  As others have already stated, Dune is one of the most remarkable and original worlds ever created by an SF author, featuring a parched and hostile landscape populated only by rugged &quot;Freemen&quot; and gigantic sandworms.  However, I should also warn that Herbert's explanation about the relationship between the spice, the sandworms, and Dune's climate is a bit cryptic (as a matter of fact, a lot of this book is tough to comprehend), and you may need to reread some passages many times before you understand what is being said.<br />The plotline of the novel is very intricate and suspenseful, and you will want to keep reading to find the outcome of the battle between Paul, the Freemen, and a rival house.  However, Herbert cannot right a decent battle scene, and the numerous fight sequences lack any suspense.  Also, the strange dreams and premonitions that Paul experiences throughtout the book are poorly written and overdone; most of them should have been left out.  Still, Dune is overall an engrossing read, and you won't regret buying it.
B000002BYD|5.0|I grew up listening to Pearl Jam and it wasnt until recently that i decided to buy some of their newer stuff. I cant describe how good this CD is. ive been going through some rough times in my life and this CD has been with me the whole time. i can relate to certain songs on the CD and because of that this CD will always mean something to me no matter when i hear it. Pearl Jam still rocks!! BUY IT!!
0064407667|4.0|i bought this book the other day because i thought it looked interesting. i am generally a fan of the macabre.<br />and i did love this book. i will have to get the rest now!<br />the three baudelaire children are made orphans, when their parents are killed in a massive fire. they are sent to live with the cunning Count Olaf, who has this strange obsession with eyes... and getting his hands on the childrens' great fortune.<br />but after reading this book, i can only wonder why it is reccomended mostly for kids late in their elementary school years... i'm sixteen and i found the book haunting. it was extremely witty, and made me laugh on several occasions; snicket has a great -- and delightfully dark -- sense of humor. but i could not imagine myself being aged 12 or under, and reading this book...<br />i have the unnerving habit of getting my hopes up at all the wrong times. can you believe that, despite all the many warnings on and in the book, i still secretly hoped for a happy ending? lol, neither can i. but if you are consistantly optimistic and cheerful.... snicket is right. perhaps you are better off reading some other book ;)<br />ah, hear me ramble.<br />so! in short!:<br />it is a very well-crafted book, which you should read if you can handle misfortune, and have the money to fork over for the rest of the series because you WILL get sucked in and want to read them all ;)
B00005YW4H|4.0|None of the other reviewers mentioned Norah's piano work, so I thought I'd give the artist some credit. Norah accompanying Norah is really nice! I bought this album hoping for some upbeat jazz numbers. The first time I listened to it I was a little disappointed. Some of the country tunes are not my cup of tea, but Norah does them so distinctively and so beautifully that...well, I'm hooked. Let me tell you a secret: Norah can sing anything. It really doesn't matter what the genre is. I can't wait for her next CD.
B00005B4GU|1.0|Where do they find music critics? Certainly not where normal people hang out.<br /> I can't believe that I let the words of some stranger talk me into spending actual money on this droning, hideous noise. I think a good rule of thumb is that if a CD gets a good review in the rock press then STAY AWAY! <br />I'm not sure there is a category that fits Amnesiac. Maybe somber electronica? It's really hard to identify a true musical structure in some of the songs. Those who praise this album probably think of this as being groundbreaking, but to me it just seems contrived and talentless. I am reminded of the story of the Emperor''s New Clothes because I can't imagine that the folks who champion this CD really can stand to listen to it. I think they must feel that liking Radiohead makes you cool somehow.<br />Keep in mind, gentle reader, that I'm not somebodys grandpa writing a review trashing \\"that newfangled music\\". I was REM's biggest fan for years (Green and earlier) and I love John Hiatt and Sister Hazel as well, so my musical tastes are pretty broad. I just didn't hear much music on this CD.<br />Dull, boring, plodding. pretentious...how else can I say it? I've been buying music since 1977 and I honestly can't remember buying a worse record. Thank goodness for Amazon auctions so at least I can find somebody to take this stinker off my hands.
0380002930|5.0|I will keep my review short and sweet, as I have read the other reviews and they sum up the jist of what I've got to say.  On the cover of the book it states, \\"Everyone who can read english should read it.\\"  I agree whole heartedly.  The book was great.  Richard Adams' ability to write from the perspective of a small woodland creature amazes me.  I never thought i could be inspired by a character that was a rabbit, or other animal for that matter.  This book was easy to read, funny, and when finished it leaves a warmness in your heart.
630469797X|5.0|Dawn of the Dead really isn't much of a scary movie with it's mono sound track and 70 fake make-up effects. Now owning this in my own collection I have seen Dawn almost a million times and I have changed my thoughts on it everytime I see it. It stays with you and I think is the best zombie/horror pictures ever seen (including it's original Night of the Living Dead). Good charactorization, plot values are the same as the original ,but sometimes differ. In Night they made the zombies are a nightmareish blood eating monsters, Dawn mades the zombies almost lifike and almost a man without a soul.In dawn there are no easy way outs, its down to the bone. Gratatudes to George A. Romero for this zombie classic. I'm telling you this movie should not be watched once. see it 10 times if you have to. The more times you see it the movie,the more times you will appreciate it. I love the charactors in this movie. I won't tell you anything about it because I'm afraid I might spoil it. Take my word its worth watching!
B00005QZWI|5.0|All too many film soundtracks consist of The Big Theme and loads of could-be-pretty-much-anything-filler. This is different. There is a whole range of themese relating to characters and situations, and they are interwoven and displayed after the manner of the motif system, pioneered by Wagner in (appropriately enough) his Ring Cycle. There isn't a bad track on the CD.<BR>My only complaint is about some of the other reviews which refer to the \\"Irish\\" nature of the Hobbits theme. Humbug! Tolkien based the Shire on an idealised rural England of his childhood, and the Hobbits are his representation of the English yeomen and farmers he lived among as a boy. To anyone who knows the differences between the various styles of music in the British Isles \\"Concerning Hobbits\\" is quintessentially English, and reminiscent of compusers such as Elgar and Vaughan Williams.
0393317552|5.0|Guns, Germs and Steel is one of the most enlightening books I have ever read . It talks about a major factor on the development of human societies, which is the environment.

B00003CXTG|3.0|I saw this in the movies the weekend it came out, and I was so disappointed. I was expecting something really engaging. Instead I got \\"Pearl Harbor\\", a movie that isn't about Pearl Harbor at all, but a silly ass love triangle that takes up about 70% of the film!<br /><br />The storyline itself was predictable with the Affleck/Beckindale/Hartnett vapid love triangle, while the Pearl Harbor attack is used as a backdrop...so much of a backdrop, that you had to wonder if this was what this movie was about. You didn't have to be a genius or even a psychic to know how it was going to turn out. I can see that Michael Bay was trying hard to capture the magic of James' Cameron's \\"Titanic\\", but he failed miserably. At least with \\"Titanic\\" you were able to connect with the characters; in \\"Pearl Harbor\\", you don't give a damn about what happened to any of them. Ben Affleck is a truly horrible actor, WHY give him the lead role? That should have been a warning sign that this movie should have been avoided like the plague.<br /><br />The special effects of the Japanese attack were the only thing worth checking out; they lasted for about 30 minutes and were amazing, which is why I gave this movie 3 stars. But the rest of the film will nauseate anyone over the age of 16, so don't say that you weren't warned yet again. Why did Cuba Gooding, Jr. consent to be in this movie and in the film ads? His appearance was wasted. He had no interaction with any of the other cast members, except when Beckindale, who played a nurse, bandaged him up after a fight and after the attack, looking at each other from across a room. He had about three of four lines in the entire film. I know he was supposed to be portraying Dorie Miller, a cook who shot down a Japanese bomber in the attack, but his role was really not important to the plot. Watching this movie, you'd think that African Americans had no role in fighting this war whatsoever, which is historically inaccurate.<br /><br />In addition to Cuba's appearance, Dan Ackroyd and Jon Voight are reduced to making cameos in this film and it makes you wonder if they are hard up for money, because they both had only a few lines to speak in this awful monstrosity and then you didn't see them anymore. Alec Baldwin fared a little better than Ackroyd and Voight; at least he got more screen time.<br /><br />\\"Pearl Harbor\\" did make a lot of money, yes, but that does not mean it was good. It is an insult to every last person who died on 12/7/41 and to the folks who actually lived through it. If you still feel that you have to see this, PLEASE don't buy the DVD or even rent it - wait to watch it on cable. You're paying for the service anyway!d and Jon Voight are reduced to making cameos in this film and it makes you wonder if they are hard up for money, because they both had only a few lines to speak in this awful monstrosity and then you didn't see them anymore.

B00003CXCS|4.0|This may be an ominous way to begin a review of the efervescent \\"Sound of Music\\", but it's true.  The 1965 movie's incredible box office success inspired Fox and other studios to make big budget family themed musicals, most of which flopped miserably with audiences (just remember \\"Doctor Dolittle\\" with Rex Harrison, and \\"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\\", to name a few).  \\"The Sound of Music\\" was Hollywood's last gasp at successful family themed musicals, before the genre was recreated with the grittier and more adult \\"Cabaret\\" in the 1970's.  After that, there was no going back to \\"raindrops on roses\\" and \\"larks who learn to pray\\", although attempts were made over the years.<br />Even in its time, \\"The Sound of Music\\" was heavily criticized for its insipid musical numbers and dances as well as the sentimentality of the situations and dialogue.  After all, good and evil doesn't get any more clearly represented than by nuns and nazis!  Many critics at the time sadly longed for the heyday of creativity and craftmanship of the Astaire/Kelly/MGM partnership which had gone defunct in the 1950's.<br />Nevertheless, \\"Music\\" was an enormous success, and is a marked improvement over it's Broadway source. Director Robert Wise opened up the operetta-like story with location photography, a reworked screenplay with rearrangement of key songs and the  elimination of others from the Broadway show.  <br />I saw this film as a 10 year-old at Radio City Music Hall on its 10 year anniversary.  Seeing and hearing Julie Andrews trill the opening song on the mountain and in widescreen was a moment I shall never forget.

630469654X|5.0|This is a classy movie. Michelle Pfeiffer and Rutger Hauer are in their prime; Matthew Broderick is darling at that age and is a continuing friend to both of them. I loved the look on Rutger Hauer's face when Phillippe called her \\"Ladyhawke\\". <br />The characters actors were excellent. You will hate the Bishop for lusting after Isabeau. The monk was someone you trusted right away. The scenery, especially the hawk flying over the lake, was exquisite. The music, though not my style, fit the mood perfectly and it lasts with you long after the movie is over.  All the actors, animals, music, scenery fit... and added up to one classy movie. An emotional and moving experience you should not want to miss.
B00000K31Q|5.0|There's something about this movie that makes me rank it as the best teen-movie I've seen so far, and as one of the best movies I've seen ever.<BR>I'm not sure what exactly it is... Maybe it's the very graphical (and funny) Dr. Stratford - the girls' dad... Maybe it's the whole Shakesperean look and &quot;feel&quot; of the whole feature... Perhaps it's the character of Kat, which I adored... Or maybe it's the liberal policy of the Padua High School, which did remind me a bit of the High School I went to (here in Greece), but also of something I never had...<BR>Whatever it is, I can't pin it down. However, watching this movie as a whole (...again and again), makes me sure of the 5 out of 5 I give it.<BR>Either you're a teen-movie fan, a casual romantic (or not) comedy viewer, or even simply a Shakespeare fan, this movie is highly recommended!
B000063TNH|5.0|I think this viewer is mistaken when he/she  says people don't know good film anymore. The fact that \\"viewer\\" is looking to fast forward shows he/she misses some of the point of the film. The film is supposed to be slow and meticulous because only then can Soderbergh show just how painful and prolonging the process of drug use can be. The script is very inovative to juggle three plots around simultaneously AND keep them interconnected. And yes the characters are haunting, especially Catherine Zeta-Jones. It is absolutely bone chilling to see a pregnant woman demand the killing of another person to save her husband from Jail. THIS IS FILM MAKING AT ITS BEST.
B00005Q66T|4.0|I love this CD, and since I don't have all the Madonna albums from the 90's, it's great to have a collection of random samplings over the past 10 years in Madonna history.  I always listen to this CD and it is always in my CD changer, but one thing comes to mind, Where are the rest of the hits.  What happened to &quot;American Pie,&quot; and &quot;Nothing Really Matters,&quot; which are two of my Madonna faves.  Others like &quot;You'll See&quot; and &quot;Rain&quot; are availible on her Greatest Ballads CD, &quot;Something To Remember&quot; so I am not upset about the explusion of those songs.  Besides these bad points, GHV2 is one of my favorite CD's and has other hits that make up for those expulsions like &quot;Music&quot; and &quot;Take A Bow&quot; and &quot;Deeper and Deeper.&quot;  Overall this CD is worth the money!

B00005OAA6|4.0|I was really excited to find my favorite spice girl released a solo album.  I quickly got the album and it was a lot of work to experience.  I listened through all the songs resisting the fastforward button hoping to find something I liked.  True their are some really cute songs like: Not Such An Innocent Girl, Midnight Fantasy, and Watcha Talkin' Bout.  I was hoping she would make an album with more emotion.  It sounds like every thing else made in the early and mid 90s.  <br />I gave it such a high rating since I really like her voice,  which never got enough time on spice girls songs. <br />She can make nice music though.  Her song with Truestppers &quot;Out of Your Mind&quot; is proof, it's my new favorite song.  <BR>I really hope she finds some good writers and producers for her next album. <br />To sum it up her album is just a missing link to a spice girls song.  There is just something missing on the album.

Even though the album didn't even make GOLD status to me this album has good tunes. The album is a mix of pop, opera, rock, heavy metal and pop. There are masterpieces on the album like \\"Just A Boy\\", \\"Under The Rose\\", \\"Dark Light\\", \\"A World Without Heroes\\", \\"Mr. Blackwell\\", \\"The Oath\\", \\"Escape From the Island\\" and my favorite \\"I\\". You buy the album and you will be happy.
B000060MY6|5.0|The feeling I felt after walking out of the cinema was something I had never experienced before.I knew little of the film before seeing it and had never seen any of David Lynch's work.Having no preconceptions and an open mind allowed for a cinematic experience that left me buzzing with excitement,confusion and amazement for hours after the final credits rolled.I was so impressed that I returned to the cinema the following afternoon for a repeat viewing and discovered even more about the film.It gets better with every viewing and is therefore an essential purchase.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This is a gimmick story.  This is not necessarily bad...there are a lot of great gimmick stories.  In this case, the gimmick is that the movie moves in an essentially backwards fashion.  <br />But as with any great film, things are never that simple.  First of all, the gimmick is essential to the story and not just an experimental device; told in a linear fashion, this would not be a very rewarding experience.  Also, this is not exactly a backwards story.  Instead, it oscillates back and forth toward a midpoint.<br />This is a movie that demands your full attention, but it all makes sense in the end.  It illustrates the importance of writing with movies, and it is no surprise that if it could only get one Oscar nomination, it would be for screenplay.  If you enjoy clever suspense stories, this is highly recommended.

B00005O5CM|3.0|Legally Blonde is a comedy that pokes fun at the lifestyles of rich California girls. A few years ago, a little jewel of a movie called Clueless gave us a much funnier and more insightful look at these young ladies. It's probably still around your video store. The immensely talented and likable Reese Witherspoon stars in Legally Blonde. She portrayed a much more determined and funnier girl in Election, one of the best teen comedies ever made. This doesn't mean Legally Blonde isn't enjoyable. It means it's lightweight entertainment. It makes you smile a lot rather than laugh. It does have the distinction of being rather sweet and lovable [thanks to Ms. Witherspoon] in a year of mainly cynical and gross-out comedies. <br />Elle Woods [Witherspoon] has it all. She's rich, adorable and popular. So is her boyfriend, Warner [Matthew Davis]. Her sorority sisters at her Los Angeles college think Warner is about to propose marriage. Everyone is ecstatic. Instead, Warner, who is about to go to Harvard Law School, dumps her. He says she doesn't fit into his plan to be a US Senator by the time he is thirty because, frankly, she's just too blonde. He needs a girl who's more East Coast Establishment, like a Kennedy or a Rockefeller. In real life, a young woman would be thankful to have seen her boyfriend's true colors before it was too late. But this is the movies, so Elle decides she will become the girl he desires. She applies to Harvard herself, and actually gets accepted. Off she goes to Cambridge with her little dog, Bruiser, and a Bekins truckload of furniture and fashion accessories. There, she discovers she's still too blonde for Warner, who now has a brunette girlfriend. That's okay. She a Southern California girl, and nothing is too big of a challenge for one of those. Her optimism and sense of self are too great to be undone by much of anything or anyone. <br />Legally Blonde plays like an old-fashioned star vehicle. The entire movie revolves around Ms. Witherspoon tothe point where the other actors have little to do except play second banana to her. While she certainly is an interesting enough actress to be the center of attention, I suspect the situation arose because of weaknesses in the script. There are other very talented players here, in particular Holland Taylor, Jennifer Coolidge and Ali Lartner, but their characters either aren't well developed or are too little seen. This type of satirical comedy works best when the lead has at least one strong character to work off of. One of the elements that made Election work so funny was that Witherspoon's ruthless character had a powerful adversary in that of Matthew Broderick's.<br />One of the movie's strongest assets is its costumes. Witherspoon has over fifty costume changes. These range from the outlandish to the bizarre to the fabulous. At the points where the movie dragged a bit, I was kept alert by wondering what on earth the star would appear in next. All this attention to clothing is appropriate because the focal point of Legally Blonde isn't about the legal profession. It's about what's fashionable. The emphasis here is definitely on blonde rather than legal.
B00000K3UU|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS THE ALL-TIME BEST ADAM SANDLER MOVIE. IT STARTS OUT AS A LAZY, WORKING ONE DAY A WEEK BUM WHO ONE DAY A FIVE YEAR OLD SHOWS UP ON HIS DOORSTEP. THE KID IS HIS ROOMATE'S WHO IS IN CHINA. NOW WHILE HE'S GONE HE TAKES CUSTODY UNTIL THE FATHER GETS BACK. SO HE HAS A LOT OF FUN WITH THE KID. HE GOES TO THE PARK, HAS GREAT TIMES, BRINGS HIM TO SCHOOL, TEACHES HIM HOW TO DO THE SLEEPER HOLD, PEE ON A BUILDING, ETC. THIS MOVIE IS GREAT!
B000000993|5.0|This is TOOL's darkest persona.  This has got to be their best cd in their 10+years of the rock industry.  I bought this cd along with Cold's 13 Ways to Bleed On Stage, but this, my friend is a hell of a lot better!  The opening song \\"Intolerance\\" is very confrontive and heavy(I love Maynard's screams)and almost sounds like a total style all of their own.  In fact, it IS all of their own sound!!!  NO other metal band out there has the exact capability to create such an original piece of hard rock.<BR>There is a new metal band out there that's trying to copy TOOL, and that atrocious band is Earshot.  DO NOT buy Earshot if you think they're TOOL, because they're NOT.  They should die out!!!<BR>Tool should happily go on with their rock stardom and not worry about a thing.  The drum work is perfect, the bass EXCELLENT, and<BR>the riffs dark and heavy.  The 2 hit singles \\"Prison Sex\\" and \\"Sober\\" are big highlights.  Prison Sex seems to tell about a man <BR>raped in prison and not remembering exactly what happened.  Sober <BR>tells about people trying to start their life over again or drink and sleep forever.  All of the songs on here are excellent right up to the hidden track 69: Disgustipated.  This tells about the omega of the midwest, is the creepiest track on the CD, and unleashes TOOL's malicious darkside.  This CD is well worth your time and money, and if you don't own them, I recommend getting TOOL's 3 latter albums, AEnima and Lateralus.
B000003TAW|5.0|Weezer's debut effort, the self-titled but often coined \\"Blue Album,\\" should be an essential in any music lover's collection.  Lead singer Rivers Cuomo cleverly crafts 10 songs with heavy guitars and oh-so-catchy hooks.  I have never met a true rock fan who doesn't own this album or at least swear to be looking to pick it up.  Plain and simply an amazing achievement in rock and one for the ages.
B0000039PW|5.0|The Notorious man does it again and even after his death he is still rolling. I loved this album. great single like \\"Big Poppa\\" really get me hip hopin'. I hope the Notorious one is proud of himself as he looks up or down from wherever he is. May he rest in peace.
B00000AF98|3.0|In 1987, KISS released their 4th non-makeup album \\"Crazy Nights\\". This album has great contributions on the lyrics by Eric Carr and Bruce Kulick. Of course Gene and Paul write most of the songs but with Eric and Bruce helping to co-write this album came out with smashes. \\"Crazy Crazy Nights\\", \\"Reason To Live\\", \\"Turn On The Night\\". This album is an all-time classic.
0446678430|2.0|THE BOOK RELIES MORE ON COMMON INFORMATION AND ALWAYS GOES BACK TO WHAT HIS RICH DAD HAD SAID WHILE HE WAS GROWING UP. IT HAD A FEW ITEMS THAT WERE O.K.,BUT WITH 335 PAGES IT SHOULD HAVE SOME IDEAS. THIS IS MY SECOND BOOK THAT I HAVE READ BY MR. KIYOSAKI<BR>AND IT IS NOT REALLY MUCH DIFFERENT FROM \\"RICH DAD,POOR DAD\\"<BR>I REALLY BELEAVE THAT HE SHOULD HAVE HIS RICH DAD WRITE A BOOK<BR>BECAUSE HE ALWAYS USES HIM AS HIS REFERENCE.

B00005JKYS|5.0|Although \\"The Deerhunter\\" will always hold a special place in my heart, I must say that \\"We Were Soldiers\\" is the finest film on the Vietnam War to date. How reassuring to see humane portrayals of men in arms--of men who make a career of service and devotion to country, whether American or Vietnamese. If, like me, you've grown weary and wary of war films that depict officers as inept or gung ho, soldiers as bewildered, misled, and demented, you will enjoy this film. As one whose father served in that war twice, it touches a cord. This is also the first film to show how the families must cope with daddies in combat. The scene between the Gibson character and his youngest daughter is poignant and reminiscent of Stewart talking to his sick daughter in \\"It's A Wonderful Life.\\" No Hollywood glitz and distortion here. Neither is there too much lecturing and political statement making as you see in the Stone and Kubrick films. Even the drill instructor is believable in his role. The focus, to be sure, is on the officers of these men. The film is not without moments of humor but the pathos pervades it. The scenes of Gibson reviewing history books on the French fiasco in Nam in the 1950's and Custer's Last Stand are eerie and instructive. THIS IS THE ONLY 'NAM FILM that shows the actions of a single military offensive from start to finish. Gibson is superb in this role despite what others have said. He is visceral but also contemplative--a delicate balance worthy of academy award consideration. This film will get overlooked by the academy because it is too thoughtful for a war film but don't let yourself be deprived of its endearment and lessons, and stirring but not exaggerated portrayals. These are real men thrust into unreal circumstances. Although the Vietnamese perspective is brief and appears a token gesture of concern, the commander of their forces is a good counterbalance to Gibson's--he, too, is well-reasoned, not demonic. The scenes of the housewives awaiting news from Nam are also unforgettable. Two arms up!from Nam are also unforgettable. Two arms up!
B00005RFAI|4.0|i loved this album!i know i should of given it a 5,but the only reason i didnt iz cuz i havent listened to all the songs yet!but all i can say is that when i first heard p!nk,ya i thought she wuz pretty cool,but nothing special.that wasn't until i heard this girl,and darn,she can sing.not only does she have a unique and powerful voice,she has smart lyrics that touch u deeply and make u think.no doubt about it,this girls' somethin' special!!!
B00005YTFG|5.0|One of the best movies that has come along in the last few years, Moulin Rouge met all of my hopes, and went far beyond.  The DVD edition is awsome with behind the scenes info, cast pictures, costume designs, and many documetaries, it will keep you entertained for hours.  Long Live Moulin Rouge!!!
0385486804|4.0|I felt that Krakauer's &quot;Into the Wild&quot; left the reader twisted.  Both longing to experience the freedom that McCandless, the focus of the book, felt.  But it also leaves you with a longing for family connection, and the pain cause by the severience of those connections.
B000002R0R|4.0|1977's The Missing Piece was basically the first Gentle Giant album many of their fans turned the backs on. To me, I never really thought the album was all that bad. Most of the album is very straightforward and song-oriented, but I am more blaming the record companies here, as they were looking for a sound for the band that might sell a few copies. But at least it still has a '70s sound. There are some great songs here like &quot;Two Weeks in Spain&quot;, &quot;I'm Turning Around&quot;, and &quot;Who Do You Think We Are&quot;. The band was responding to the punk rock explosion with &quot;Betcha Thought We Couldn't Do It&quot;, which the band tries to be punk, but you know they're actually a prog band. &quot;As Old As You're Young&quot; is one of my favorites, Kerry Minnear sings here, and has that same medieval sound the the band was so known for, even though the compositions were simpler than before. &quot;Memories of Old Days&quot; is clearly the album's best piece here, and the most progressive, which comes to show that the band really didn't want to leave their prog sound totally behind, it was more the idea of the record companies. I never really thought The Missing Piece was something GG should be ashamed of, but it's still a good album despite the rather simple compositions. Of course, start with any of their previous albums first.
B000000NN4|5.0|How one can doubt that Albedo 0.39 is one of the best albums Vangelis has ever published? Mixing now with then, tomorrow with today, it makes you think listening to Alpha and \\"flying\\" listening Pulstar and Nucleogenesis Part 1(Vangelis always use to give greek-rooted names to his songs). Being a greek, i can be proud that a greek composer can represent so well New Age. (Sorry about my awkard English, i'm still a greek!!). Don't forget to listen to Alpha with eyes closed!!!!!!!
B000003TAW|5.0|This cd is way better than the follow up green cover, and i also think better than pinkerton. Its got great vocals, and intrumentals along with lyrics that really get to you. There are fun songs like &quot;buddy holly&quot; and more serious, sadder songs like &quot;undone (the sweater song)&quot; IF you like the green cd, you will definitly love this one. Pinkerton is in a whole different direction than this, but I would still give it a chance if your a pinkerton fan. I say, go for it, buy the cd.
0446605409|4.0|While not as good as Lion's Game, Plum Island is still very enjoyable.  I'd love to see both these as movies.  John Corey is a lovable strong main character with all his flaws (and aches and pains.)  Nelson DeMille spins a good yarn here that's hard to put down.  This would be great on your summer reading list.
B00000J7JO|2.0|Better then the old ones, but it still is pretty bad. I only like 3 songs. Save your money.
0380789019|4.0|Wow.  While I can honestly say that this book was not my most wonderful read, or my favorite book, it is up there.  A wonderful fantasy story that does not get *too* weird, but is odd enough to still consider a fantasy.  The characters are believable, from the be-fuddled main character to the smelly rat folk, and the plot moves along at a pace that is sedate enough not to lose non-fantasy readers (me) without boring the hair off of the hardcore fantasy readers.  A good book to pick up and read in the evenings, and then re-read in about 6 months when you think about some little scene and can't get it out of your mind.  Enjoy this one, people!
B00004Z459|4.0|This CD is awesome.  Even if all you know from Linkin Park are the radio hits like &quot;One Step CLoser&quot;, and &quot;In the End,&quot; this cd is still a good buy for you.  There are amazing instrumentals, and the vocals rock. This cd isnt really a mood picker upper, but its great to listen too anyway.  I really enjoy every minute of it. definitily go buy this cd if you like alternative rock and really really really cant stand &quot;bands&quot; like nsync and backstreet boys. this is about as far away as you'll get from them with modern day radio played rock.
B00005221M|5.0|At least once a year I will sit down and watch this movie.  It's a great story, with characters you're drawn to, incredible scenery and its all together in one movie package.  This is definitely one to own in your collection.
B00004XOWM|1.0|This Limp Bizkit stuff is enough to drive any person with a normal head crazy. How can anybody listen to this! I borrowed this cd from a friend because he claimed this music speaks to you. Whatever that means? Do not buy this you will seriously regret it! I call it depressing, suicidal, and very crazy. American Teenagers do not need music like this. Music like this causes lots of problems.
0064471837|5.0|This book is unbeleivable. I can't imagine how it could be better! It was so well written, leaving little out, except things better left to the imagination. It is a fantasy, with a touch of romance, and Mogget, the free macig spirit bound in the form of a cat provides the comic releif. He always has something witty to say, unless they are in a predicament.<br />Sabriel has lived her entire life in Ancliserre, accross the Charter magic form of The Wall from The Old Kingdom. When her father(The Abhorsen) Sends his bells and his sword to Sabriel, she knows that he is in trouble. Her father is an unusuall Necromancer that does good and binds the dead instead of raising it. He is called the Abhorsen, and when Sabriel's father is trapped in death, this title is passed to her.<br />The basic story is Sabriel trying to live up to the title of Abhorsen, while trying to save her father, and along the way, many other people. Also along the way, she finds romance, which is very well placed...This is a wonderful book. It is not just for young adults. Even my mom likes it. I think many people should read it. It is just so great...
B000001Y79|5.0|No Doubt really did it this time with this ska, punk, pop cd. It's got a little bit for everyone, with the ska song &quot;spiderwebs&quot; to the radio favorite &quot;dont speak&quot; and &quot;i'm just a girl&quot;.  Its a great cd to listen to when you're working out, relaxing, or right after a rough break up. It really picks up your mood and after hearing it once, you cant help but sing along. This is really a great cd!
B000002KKD|5.0|Ok, when I was growing up, my only exposure to the B-52's was hearing \\"Love Shack\\" and \\"Good Stuff\\" on the radio. Therefore, I figured that this was the WORST band in the history of rock n' roll. Then, on a hunch, I stole their debut album from this record store I worked at. That album didn't leave my CD player for five months!! Seriously, this record is catchier than the clap! EVERY song (well, except for the Downtown cover) is a friggin' classic! And this is coming from a GG Allin, Flipper, Black Flag fan! While I don't recommend anything but their first two albums (Whammy! is pretty rockin' if you REALLY like those first two) they are MUST HAVES!!!
0882847953|5.0|Drum teachers worldwide use this book because its THE syncopation book.<br />'nuff said.
B00005JKQX|1.0|I'm sorry, but this movie just ... some serious eggs! I mean, it just went on and on, and by the end I was praying for someone to dig my eyes out with a carrot pealer just for a little entertainment. Russel Crowe was too bullish for this role. It was kind of like hiring a football player to act as a meek, mentally disabled person. And then there was Jennifer Connely, the human Barbie doll, practically perfect in every way. She was really dull to watch for almost three hours.  The basic plot line wandered a lot. They could have edited about an hour out of the movie. Oh well. Its a hard knock life.
B000063CPL|5.0|Rock in Rio is the best live Maiden since Live After Death.  I last saw the band in '99 and they were better and more energetic than the first time I saw them in '86 Somewhere On Tour.  The returns of Dickinson and Adrian Smith have revitalized the band.  I enjoy the Brave New World songs much better live than on the album.  The classics are still great and it is good to have Sign of the Cross and the Clansman sung by Bruce.<br />Buy it now!!!
B000063CPL|5.0|Rock In Rio is a fantastic album worthy of a spot next to Iron Maiden's \\"Live After Death,\\" KISS' \\"Alive,\\" and Iced Earth's \\"Alive In Athens.\\"  From the opening track, \\"Wickerman\\" to the grand finale of one of my all time favorite Iron Maiden tracks \\"Run To The Hills,\\" the album is a non-stop rocker.  The disc includes what may be their best performances of \\"Wrathchild,\\" \\"Two Minutes To Midnight,\\" and \\"Hallowed Be Thy Name.\\"  I saw them when they came to St. Louis on the Brave New World Tour and was astounded.  The use of three guitarists really brought live Iron Maiden to life, and the songs that I had not heard before (\\"The Clansman\\" and \\"Sign Of The Cross\\") were fantastic.  \\"The Clansman\\" in particular is even better on the live album.  The song is now in my top ten favorite Maiden songs.  If you are a big fan of Iron Maiden, you know how difficult it is to narrow down just ten songs, and therefore know how much of a compliment that is to that song.  Brave New World is tied for my favorite Iron Maiden album, so it is great to see the tracks from that album on here.  But I would have loved to see more from Powerslave on here.  Even a track from Somewhere In Time such as \\"Stranger In A Strange Land\\" or something else from Seventh Son(...) such as \\"Moonchild\\" would have been welcome editions.  But alas, every fan has a favorite song that is not going to be on every live album.  Mine would have to be \\"Rhyme Of The Ancient Mariner.\\"  Either way, the bottom line is this:  I bought this album the day it came out.  I have yet to even look at the enhanced portion of the cd because I do not want to stop listening to it, and I am currently listening to it for the seventh time through.  If you like live perfomances of fantastic heavy metal, this album is a must have!
B00005BL2A|2.0|Being a Depeche Mode fan, I was very excited to hear that a new album was coming out, and in a rare display of obsession actually bought this album the very day it came out.  What a disappointment.  One of my favorite things about Depeche Mode has always been their ability to blend a lot of different sounding songs into one album which makes them such a pleasure to listen to.  Exciter has almost none of this: it all pretty much stays at the same mellow, uninspired level except for a few jarring interruptions with &quot;The Dead of Night&quot; (one of the worst songs I have *ever* heard) and &quot;I Feel Loved&quot; (which is actually halfway decent but doesn't fit at all with the rest of the album).<br />&quot;Dream On,&quot; &quot;When the Body Speaks,&quot; and &quot;I Feel Loved&quot; are all decent tracks, but the rest of the album is, at best, a watered-down version of the sound and sentiment in these three songs.  Depeche Mode has so much more to offer; I would not reccomend this album unless you simply want anything and everything the band has ever done.  I sincerely hope that whatever it was musically that happened on this album, that it never happens again.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|I cannot believe that some people actually do not like this CD.  I am scratching my head, because they either like metal, or rap, or they are too young to know what punk music is.  I have been around this scene for 20 years and I know good music when I hear it.  At The Drive In is punk at it's finest... they totally make me spaz!
B000002JSR|3.0|While I have a really hard time critizing anything that Zeppelin has done of all their Albums this might be the worst. Now, don't get me wrong Zep's worst is still infinitley better than most bands. I feel that all the songs had a lot of potential but the synthesizers really ruined most of the album, especially \\"All of my Love.\\" For Zeppelin I don't rate this as their highest but in comparsion to most other stuff this album would definitely rate 5 stars!. <BR> I once read that all of Zeppelin's albums were about a year ahead of their time, and it's clearly evident in this album. The Sounds of the 80's are starting to definitely rear their ugly head. I hate to say it but it might have been a blessing that Bonham died before the 80's ruined the band. Overall if you're just a fan of their best stuff (mainly Led Zeppelin I-IV) then I wouldn't suggest buying this Album. However if you're a \\"Hardcore\\" Zeppelin fan I would suggest getting this album in the Remastered Box Set, which is the best buy for you money.
0451169514|4.0|This book is one of King's best. A lot of books give you good, deep characters but this one gives you more than that. I felt like I was reading about old buddies after awhile and that only adds to the stakes when they are raised, and they are. The premise is solid and the flashing from present to future and back again works well. It(the evil entity of King's book) is a fully realized evil that makes for a scary read. That's not to say that this is King's scariest but certain scenes will give you chills. I found the book to entertaining and while I'm raving about the detailed characters and endless information let me say what sometimes made It a chore. The detailed characters and endless information. All of this makes for a deep, satisfying read but at points I found myself hoping for something to happen. Anything other than another encounter that felt just like the last. These are scarce moments but if you find 1000+ pages a daunting task you may wish to look elsewhere. This book's length and complexity are its strong points but they also slow things down. That said, this is a great read.
B00003CXXP|1.0|Considering the budget and effort, this must be considered one of the worst movies of 2001. The whole movie ultimately revolves around the relationship of a robot child with his human mother and is told (in particular during the second two thirds) completely from the perspective of the child. In doing so, the movie loses its audience after the first 30 minutes or so. The intersting part ends when the kid is abandoned by his human mother. Up to this point the viewer could at least attempt to identify with the human parents. What makes the movie fail subsequently is the fact that the viewer is unable to find any identification points. The child - as emphasized by the movie, remains a machine, ultimately with an off switch. All that is left is a bad version of Pinochio.<br />Maybe this movie might have worked 100 years ago, but not in the year 2001...
0790734060|5.0|I watched this film in a humanities class and enjoyed it thoroughly. Although there are gaping historical accuracies, it is truer to life than certain other productions in the same genre (e.g., Immortal Beloved). The acting is superb; Abraham plays the part of the aging, frustrated mediocrity very convincingly, and the character of Mozart is also very good (although I am not so familiar with the actor). Indeed, everyone in the movie, from the main characters to the NDs, is very convincing. Visual factors, such as set design and lighting, are flawless. The score, as one might expect, is collected from Mozart's great works. Although classical music in modern movies sometimes backfires, it is executed perfectly here, and the effect is very nice. I have no noteworthy qualms about this movie, neither with the execution nor with the design.
6300214354|5.0|one of the greatest movies of the 80's...and you should all go out and demand it on dvd
B00005JKDR|5.0|My husband and I are always looking for a movie we can take our two young sons to. We definitely found that in Monsters Inc. So many times we go to what we think are \\"kids\\" movies, only to find them riddled with \\"adult language\\" and \\"sexual overtones\\". What a joy to actually have a movie that earns its' \\"G\\" rating. There is a need for more of these great movies. Hope to see more in the near future.

B000003TA4|5.0|&quot;Nevermind&quot;; the album that made Nirvana and Kurt Cobain gave out the voice of the generation. &quot;Nevermind&quot; has probably been the greatest and the most best selling albums in the early 90's. This album contains the majority of Nirvana's biggest hits and every song gives out the reason of why Nirvana had became a success.<br />&quot;Smells like Teen Spirit&quot; has been the most popular song by Nirvana and has been the most requested song by any rock fan. Other songs including &quot;Come as you are&quot;, &quot;Polly&quot;, &quot;Breed&quot;, and &quot;Lithium&quot; are just a few of the top selling singles containd in this album.<br />In my conclusion, &quot;Nevermind&quot; is one hard-hitting rock album filled with great catchy tunes and great lyrics that makes this album the #1 best seller and the #1 album. For those who wanting to buy any Nirvana album, make sure you get this one first.
6305878323|5.0|What a wonderful picture! There really aren't enough adjectives to describe effectively how this film gets to your heart. Julie Andrews was superbly cast as the magical nanny Mary Poppins. From when she swoops down onto the sidewalk outside the Banks home, to the final ending when she leaves, Julie Andrews owns the screen.<BR>This film carries a powerful message about love and family, and not to waste what time you have with your loved ones. It's a potent message that if not done right, can get very preachy. Fortunately, it was done right in this film, so it's carried over beautifully. The songs simply enchant. &quot;Feed the Birds&quot; is so heart-felt, you can see why it was supposedly Walt Disney's favorite song.<BR>The film transfer to DVD is excellent, with perfect sound and picture quality. The bonus features are well-done, with a nice 'Making of...' featurette in the mix.<BR>All in all, this has to be considered the crowning achievement of Walt Disney's time with his company, being the only feature by Disney to be nominated for a best picture oscar until 'Beauty and the Beast'. Please get this wonderful film for yourself. If you haven't seen it before, you'll love it. If you have, go back and enjoy it again and again.
B00004RFCM|5.0|Season one was great and I own this DVD set because I can't get enough of it! But I actually think season one was the weakest of all...it just keeps getting better! But Season One needs to be the introduction so that the latter episodes make sense! So if you can't purchase them all, run to your local video store and rent Season One and then buy Season Two (and three when it comes out!) <br />These characters are quirky and funny and brutally honest. I think \\"Sex and the City\\" is like \\"Seinfeld\\" with more mature humor and women who have substance! (OK, I loved Elaine, but there were a lot of women in Seinfeld that really lacked any substance...but I guess many of the men did too!) While the humor is more mature partly due to the fact that this is aired on cable, I also think the writing is just better. They often take the same approach as Seinfeld and they explore the everyday things that we often don't think about, but they do it with more insight and depth. Perhaps it is because they can do that since they have four strong women as the characters, rather than the Seinfeld bunch of mostly-shallow social-rejects. Now, you might think I don't like Seinfeld...but I actually do! It is great for a good laugh and there are some classic episodes that are some of the best TV moments ever. However, I like Sex and the City more because it takes what Seinfeld did and improves upon it. I don't know if they did it consciously, but to me the parallels between the shows are obvious.<br />So I love Sex and the City and I recommend Season One and all of the seasons to follow!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This is my first review. I was disappointed with the reviews already posted, so I thought I'd add one. I hope it helps. Here goes...<br />Those who can't see past Memento's &quot;gimmick&quot; of moving backwards in time have missed the point. This is the only way the viewer could possibly experience Leonard's condition - which is the inability to form new memories. By withholding from us the content of the &quot;previous&quot; scene, we truly see the world as Leonard does. If the film were run forwards, we would pity Leonard or think him a fool; the movie would simply not work. That said, the movie is run backwards, and it does work - brilliantly.<br />Memento is about memory - how memory defines us and how we define it. Who are you? Simply put, you are who you remember you are. A slightly more artsy film, &quot;Dark City&quot;, explores this concept as well, if more fantastically.<br />Memento's style is that of a &quot;puzzle flick&quot;. If you enjoyed &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; or &quot;The Game&quot;, you will enjoy Memento. A series of logical revelations lead us to the start/end, which is ultimately satisfying. The tone throughout is gritty, realistic and dark - noirish, if not downright noir.<br />Memento kept me guessing right 'til the end, and left me with food for thought afterwards to boot. Highly recommended.
B000063CPL|3.0|This live album is similar to &quot;Brave New World.&quot;  Specifically, both are far superior to anything produced in the 90s, but that is not saying much.  Both albums suffer from too many tedious, over repetitious songs, and &quot;Rock in Rio&quot; tends to get a bit slow in the middle for my taste.  Iron Maiden also continues to use a very poor guitarist, despite the return of Adrian Smith.  The bottom line is that &quot;Rock in Rio&quot; is a great example of how Iron Maiden sounds today, and most of the band is in great form.<br />There are a few other problems with &quot;Rock in Rio.&quot;  The rhythm guitars are too muddy with no high end crunch.  Oversaturation issues with the recording mics, particularly from the right side, result in some bad distortion.  While the album is very raw, some people might be put off by the usage of &quot;cut and pastes&quot; (aka overdubs) on many of the choruses.  Overall, it is a solid live album that should have been better.
B00005UKKF|5.0|What can I say except this (not yet a ...) woman is a STAR. I have seen some concerts in my time, including Madonna's 'The Girlie Show', Janet Jackson's 'The Velvet Rope Tour', and this concert is far better than any I have attended before. Not only is she a talented performer, with a passion for her art, but she also comes across as a genuine and warm-hearted person. The energy evident in her performer is electric, there isn't a dull moment in the whole performance. I guarantee you will be entertained from beginning to end.<BR>   The new Madonna? NO WAY, Britney is gonna be bigger and better, and will replace her as the Queen of Pop!
B00005NW02|3.0|First off!!!!! Toxicity is a good well written album, but there is an obvious change in the bands sound...for the worse. I remember seeing the band before the first album came out and they blew me away. Now they are mediocre at best. The new matereal is very watered down from the old album. The bands new musical direction can be heard in \\"toxicity\\" and \\"chop suey\\". They are extremly commercial tracks and im sad to say that they arent the only ones on the album. When I turn past rosie o'donnel on the tv and hear chop suey playing then i know somethings wrong. Watch a past live performance and then watch a new one of these guys, they lost the edge that made them so great and unique, this is because of the new songs no doubt. Now they are turning to the \\"nu-metal\\" era(i hate that term by the way...).<BR>So i will give them one more album to redeem themselves or they will be cast into the mainsteam with all the other trash!<BR>Sorry guys but u let me down after so many years.....
B00003003R|5.0|5 stars for the music 2 stars for the selection of preformances. Where are the intros and solos huh?<br />It sorta annoys me with this cd, i mean sure, it's great, it's got most of the best songs but where are the intros and solos that make a gnr show so great in the first place? Also it's missing the best guns song civil war. So if you are a bootleg trader email me and we can work out a trade. I have to offer soundboard shows that show off what guns can really do live...
0812550706|5.0|Enders Game is truely one of the best books I have ever read. To give you an idea, my copy of the book no longer has covers because I have read it so often.<br />The story starts off with a little kid, Ender, who is a 'normal' little kid with a 'twist.' He's brilliant, an all around genious. Ender then goes on to save the world in a way that I would have never expected.<br />This book is written in such a way that you're never sure what will happen next, and it always exceeds your wildest expectations on how it will end.<br />I have told tens of people about this book and even let people borrow my copy so they can read it, and not a single person has been disapointed. In fact, many of those I have let borrow it, liked the book so much they have started to read books again.<br />I would most definately suggest this book to anyone and everyone. When I first read this book I was in Grade 7, I've since graduated and still read it on a regular basis.<br />Warning: Enders Game gave me such an interest in Scott Card that I purchased every one of his books that I could find, this can hurt the pocket book if you are only a student like I was. :)
B00005221L|3.0|If this review were based on the movie alone, i'd give it 5 stars. The beef i have is with the transfer to the DVD format. The video looks terrible. Its grainy and the color is off. What a letdown. It sounds good but couldn't they have put some more effort into the picture? No bonus materials of mention either. This DVD definatly doesn't take full advantage of the medium. Its a shame cause the movie itself is spectacular.
B000000P17|3.0|...after Appetite and the Use Your Illusion albums we expect more than good from GnR. Not that the songs they chose to cover are bad, they're not. And it's not that I don't like covers: I love it when bands punk up/slow down/add their own twist to songs... but these versions are pretty similar to the originals. Not what you'd expect from GnR.<br />I'm all for popular rock groups introducing their young fans to bands they might not hear or look into otherwise, but when a band with the power to write rock classics (such as Sweet Child and Paradise City) and original epics (like Estranged and Coma) compiles an entire album of cover songs -more to the point, AVERAGE cover songs- you can't help but feel a little let down.<BR>It seems they've taken advantage of their popularity, cos I doubt any other bands would dare release a record like this. Overall it's a good, fun album... but compared to their previous offerings it's horrible.<br />Best tracks are probably Black Leather (better than the original with its elevated guitar riffs, but not a patch on the Runaways' version); Ain't it Fun (though, much as I like Hanoi Rocks, was it really necessary to bring out Michael Monroe AGAIN? Despite the strength of both Hanoi and GnR his voice can really grate on the nerves); Buike MacKane/Big Dumb Sex; Hair of the Dog (Nazareth don't get enough credit y'know...); and the pretty little Charles Manson cover (a desperate attempt at controversy perhaps?)<BR>But all are far too similar to the originals, and even these \\"best tracks\\" don't compare to the weaker songs on Appetite or UYI 1 &2.<br />Since I Don't Have You and Down on the Farm are atrocities I won't even mention.<BR>The other tracks are moderately good, but by no means great.<br />On the whole, a worthwhile purchase if you're already a fan (especially if you're keen to look into which bands influenced them,) and not without a few good tracks and a certain punkish charm.<BR>But if you're relatively new to GnR, STAY AWAY, cosit doesn't truly reflect their good musicianship or songwriting skills.
B00004X0ER|2.0|Listening to the Hives is a bit like answering your door on Halloween and finding your neighbor's ten year old kids dressed up in homemade Iggy Pop, Fred 'Sonic' Smith and Sky Saxon costumes. They're simply adorable, and you love their spunk, but there's no way in hell you'd mistake them for the real thing. The Hives have obviously spent quite a lot of time perfecting their trashy lyrics, wailing Ron Asheton guitar licks and rock &amp; roll attitude, and therein lies the problem. Everything about this record is flawlessly executed, and totally predictable. It's easy to grow your hair out and jump around with a vintage guitar hollering about tearing things apart, but it's a lot harder to do it like you really mean it.
B00005JKED|5.0|Whats goin on this is Greg sologub. and after i saw this join at the movies i knew i had to get this S!$T before n e one in the uk on DVD.

B00003OSTV|5.0|ENTHRALLING! The film intertwined action, romance, politics, and spirituality to create a historical tale of the time and rule of Nero in Rome. Peter Ustinov's character of Nero was well done at depicting him as a spoiled, insane, blubbering, king.  The relationship between Lygia, played by Deborah Kerr, and Marcus, played by Robert Taylor, was a little unbelievable for our current times.  Special effects depicting the burning of Rome and martyrdom of Christians was very well done, and at times graphic. The name of the movie, Quo Vadis, means `Where are you going?\\" in Latin.  This could be a deep spiritual question (quest).  Today most people do not know Latin, and if they did this question may escape any deep meaning to our postmodern culture. If it weren't for it's unusual name I believe this film would be in league with The Ten Commandments with Charlton Heston.
0767830555|5.0|I've seen this film many times over the years and I'm always stunned by the final shoot-out. Very Dark.<BR>A truely brilliant comentary on the under-belly of society through the eyes of the under-belly of society.<BR>One of my All Time Favorite Films!
0553108034|4.0|This book kept me captivated for hours. The incredibly developed plot and charters that Martin started in his first book carry through this book, making you wonder what will happen next. I have read this several times and each time I enjoyed it very much. The only thing is all of the books in the series are very long, which is ok for fast readers, but may drag for other readers. If you enjoy in depth fantasy books, you WILL enjoy this book, despite its length. Overall it is a very well balanced story, which leaves the reader wanting more.
B00005AXEL|5.0|I probably can't add much to what the other 200+ people have already said about this wonderful recording by the queen of rock.  13 songs and I like them all.  Stevie has once again poured her heart and soul into her music with this album, and the result is classic Stevie.  Sheryl Crow appears on this album, co-producing, and playing guitar on several songs.  Sarah McLachlan also appears on the last song, 'Love Is', playing piano and singing background.  Hard to say what my fav track is, because I like them all. If I had to pick a few, 'Candlebright', 'Love Is', and 'It's Only Love' would be right up there at the top.  Stevie's songs take you on a musical journey through fantasy and reality in relationships and various situations of life.  Her sexy, husky voice just pulls you right in.  To sum it up, this album rocks, and so does Stevie.  And her collaberation with these other fabulous musicians make it even that much better. If you don't have it, get it.  ROCK ON!
B000060P79|5.0|Never in my life have I found a cd and been totally and completely in love with it! Simple Plan has the best lyrics. I find myself singing their \\"Im just a kid\\" song during classes. Its upbeat but not like that \\"BSB\\" [stuff]. its really good! If you like Green Day, Sum41, and Blink182 then this cd is a must have.
B00000DG1R|5.0|Come with me and take a journey back in time to when great music ruled the air-waves.  This is synth-pop rock at it's finest, this is without a doubt a true greatest hits collection.  A complete retrospective that covers all of their hits.  If you remember the 80's, these tracks should be instantly recognizable.  'Hungry Like The Wolf', 'The Reflex', 'A View To A Kill', 'Notorious', 'Wild Boys', 'Union Of The Snake', 'New Moon On Monday', 'Is There Something I Should Know', &amp; 'Rio' are here.  The early 90's comeback hits are also here: 'Come Undone' and 'Ordinary World', as well as the '97 hit 'Electric Barbarella'.  I can listen to all 19 songs on this CD and rarely  skip a track.  Brings back some great memories from growing up in the 80's listening to the radio and watching MTV(when MTV actually played VIDEOS).  Grab this one and enjoy great 80's music.  ROCK ON!
B000001Y16|5.0|This album touches on all aspects of society and it's intensity is almost too much..It's just too deep in a sense - and I believe that the reason All EYES ON ME tops this is because it scares alot of people. He bears all on the album and we get to see the man at his most potent interms of militancy - he just lays it all on the table.I get angry at so many issuses when I listen to the masterpiece and therefore I believe that this album is not for everyone.I will continue to put this man in the same category as Malcomn x , because it is almost impossible to seperate the two men ...they both fought and were fighting personal demons (as we all are) and they were both men with the capacity to grow and keep growing. And Tupac shakur was still growing into whatever he should have become, but I still cannot see 2pac getting any greater than he was at the time of his demise.Its sad because I think that he had reached his peak in a way because unless he got out of the lifestyle he lived he would not have been able to reach his full potential. People rate greatness by so many different things...but I believe that he was one of the greatest activists of all time -reason for this is that he changed and had an impact on so many lives, and he made us realise that we should love and be ourselves at all times.
B000002LFZ|5.0|This is a great, great collection of songs by the legendary group, all from the first 13 years of the Buckingham-Nicks era 1975-88.  Almost all of the best ones are here, the ones that I feel are missing are 'Landslide', 'Gold Dust Woman' and 'Second Hand News off of the album &quot;Rumours&quot; and 'Monday Morning' off of the 1975 album &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot;.  They have so many great songs that this could easily have been a 2-disc set.  However this is still an immaculate 5-star collection in my book.  Stevie Nicks' songs 'Rhiannon', 'Gypsy', 'Dreams', 'Sara' and 'No Questions Asked' are my favs, the other 11 songs are a very close 2nd.  Stevie's background vocals on 'Little Lies' are simply magical. These 5 members pour their heart and soul into their music, that's why they were and still are one of the premier groups of all-time.  I also hear that they are about to begin work on a new album to be released sometime in the next year or so, and you know it will rock.  If you want all of their greatest songs, get this 'greatest hits' collection, 'Rumours' and the 1975 'Fleetwood Mac' album.  Also a great live CD is 'The Dance'.  If you want to listen to great music, then listen to this group.  ROCK ON!
0679759328|3.0|All I can say is that the book is not a true image of the hotel nor the place, (Vevey Switzerland) itself. But this was passed as a fiction so scratch that out and give this award-winning novel a break.<br />I just saw on Amazon that there's a used book for $0.47, go click on that and keep this book as part of your collection.<br />Could have been a 2-star, but I have a penchant for reading books such as Tojours Provence and Bella Tuscany in the exact places that they were described in the book. So sentimental me....huhuhu
B000002LND|5.0|Pop it in, let the windows down, and just go for a ride.  This is one of those CD's that you can listen to from start to finish. 17 songs in all, with 15 greatest hits and 2 new cuts from 1990 -'Justify My Love' and 'Rescue Me'.  All of Madonna's biggest radio and video hits from the early days are here, maybe except for 'Who's That Girl' and 'Dress You Up' which are missing, but this is still a 5-star collection. Catchy dance beats on the up-tempo songs and a few slow ballads are here to give this album a great mix. All songs are from 1983-90,(my fav era in music) I'm 26, so I pretty much grew up listening to this music, and listening to it brings back great memories. You know the hits: 'Holiday', 'Lucky Star', 'Borderline', 'Like A Virgin', 'Material Girl', 'Into The Groove', 'Papa Don't Preach', 'La Isla Bonita', 'Like A Prayer', 'Express Yourself', 'Cherish', 'Vogue' and 'Open Your Heart'(my all-time fav Madonna song). Everytime I hear that song it just brings back great memories from those days.  Also the great ballads 'Crazy For You' and 'Live To Tell' are here. Madonna sings with fire and passion in her music, and in my opinion is a very under-rated singer. I like alot of her newer music, but I like this older music better. You absolutely can't go wrong with this CD, it is a must have for anyone who enjoys cool 80's music. If you like Madonna, or 80's dance music, you'll absolutely love this CD. Be good to yourself and get this one, ASAP!
B00005A46T|5.0|I love Slipknot. their music is agressive and very energetic.how 9 people beat the (heck) out of their instrumens and make it music, I will never know. but slipknot changed my life. I can relate to their music. and if you ever try playing their music, some of it's imposible. but I still love it. I bought 2 copies of this cd. one for my car and one for my home radio..I can't get enough it them. every song on this CD is great...
044022165X|5.0|I am only half way through this book and this is by far one of John Grisham's best works.  John Grisham is a wonderful author and can definetly paint a picture with his words.  I have watched the movie also and even if you had not seen the movie you are able to make your own movie in your head with how well written this book is.  If you have not read this book yet I recommend that you pick it up today.
B000063CPL|5.0|There´s nothing more to say than Rock in Rio is the best live album I have ever heard! The sound is superb, the songs are superb and the way how McBrain and the boys handle the songs are superb! Mr. Nicko McBrain is beating...his kit, you can cut the air with a knife while listening this masterpiece, the atmosphere is amazing! BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!!<br />UP THE IRONS!!
0380789019|5.0|It's been a little while since I've read this book.  I read 'American Gods' right after it came out, and was a little disappointed.  It made me want to reread 'Neverwhere', just to remind myself how good Gaiman can be.<br />I was captivated right away with 'Neverwhere' and thoroughly enjoyed it cover-to-cover.  The lead character, Richard, is drawn into a London &quot;underworld&quot; after attempting to help a young girl.  The story then unfolds as Richard tries to help with issues of the underworld, and to rejoin his previous life.<br />The characters are all well developed, and the plot rolls along beautifully.  The ending is somewhat of a surprise, but is really the only fitting one.  I would love to see a sequel. <br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B00005T7I1|3.0|Amazon.com has NO details for this or a half dozen or more Buena Vista movies released today on dvd but I have done some research & found that Dick Tracy & Turner & Hooch were released in full frame while 3 Men and a Baby & Ruthless People were put out in widescreen. Surely, all of these very recent releases were made in widescreen & does anyone know why they would not put out a ws dvd. According to imdb the region 2 release of DT & T&H in 1999 were in anamorphic widescreen. Anybody have any answers?
0800187873|5.0|This film is the greatest film of all time, and is so very accurate in its portrayals of the persons and events which comprise the story.  There is not one single inaccuracy in the entire film, which is a tribute to all concerned.  Of course, the author might have gotten a few facts confused in the book, but the fine folks who made this film straightened them out.  Wonderful!
B00005A1PR|5.0|The incredibly beautiful and indisputably talented India.Arie deserved 2002 Grammy recognition beyond her seven nominations.<br /><br />Unfortunately, she was shut out while Grammy voters were trippin' and droolin' and \\"fallin'\\" all over Alicia Keys.<br /><br />But that in no way diminishes the caliber of this impressive debut.<br /><br />The neo-classic soul songstress, writer, producer and acoustic guitarist treats us to some honest, rich and at times sultry vocals, along with some compelling musical and vocal arrangements. She also exhibits a lyrical and musical strength, courage and wisdom that belie her youth.<br /><br />Through songs such as \\"Brown Skin\\" and the infectious \\"Video,\\" the dignified, culturally aware and gracious Arie reveals her appreciation of reality in this image-conscious, still color-struck new and \\"enlightened\\" millennium.<br /><br />Throughout the more than hour-long CD, Arie shows off extraordinary musical and storytelling prowess.<br /><br />She offers us a taste of her instructive insight through songs such as \\"Video,\\" \\"Back to the Middle\\" and \\"Strength, Courage and Wisdom.\\"<br /><br />She shows us just how ready for love she is through \\"I See God in You,\\" \\"Simple,\\" \\"Part of my Life\\" and \\"Brown Skin\\" (which takes the concept of food as aphrodisiac to new heights). \\"Always in my Head,\\" \\"Nature\\" and \\"Ready for Love\\" are standouts, boasting some incredibly seductive vocals.<br /><br />The \\"Intro\\" and \\"Outro\\" and a third interlude titled \\"Interlude\\" -- it would be fatal to mistake these as filler -- offer up some heartfelt tributes to the famous (John Coltrane, Minnie Ripperton et al.) and not-so-famous (Grandma Louise, Papa Joe and others). And, as one writer points out, Arie is probably the first artist in history to roll-call blues guitarist Robert Johnson and pop superstar Karen Carpenter in the same song.<br /><br />Two bonuses come in the form of the absolutely beautiful \\"Beautiful\\" -- an expression of spiritual awakening --  and Arie's long-form tribute to Stevie Wonder titled \\"Wonderful.\\"'s long-form tribute to Stevie Wonder titled \\"Wonderful.\\"
B000060P79|5.0|I first heard Simple Plan when they opened for Sugar Ray at SVSU.  I was hooked, I couldn't wait for the cd to come out, and was there the first day to buy it.  I am always listeneing to it!  The entire cd is great, which is a hard thing to find these days.  I love it and I encourage everyone to go out and buy it!
0930289234|5.0|Watchman was my first exposure to the genius that is Alan Moore.  I enjoyed comics as a kid but gave them up until someone recommended I read Watchman.  Watchman takes characters you've never heard of and shows them in various stages of their lives and their careers.  I was skeptical those characters could be brought to life in any way close to what I know about Superman, Wolverine, Captain America and others from Marvel and DC that I grew up with.  Rest assured, these characters leap off the page and simply learning about where they come from and where they're going will keep you turning pages.<br />In Watchman, superheros are banned and each hero must find his own place in the world, either as a hero or as an \\"ordinary person\\". Each hero gets a chapter  : Dr. Manhatten is the most powerful being on earth, Rosharch is a violent vigilante who refuses to stop his fight against crime (his chapter is worth the purchase of this book alone IMHO), the Nightowl is a middle aged pudgy rich guy who find that fighting crime is the real excitment in life, Osimandius is the smartest man in the world who believes he has the answers to all the world's problems and finally, there's the comedian who dies in the first chapter (no spoiler really) and the investigation into the  death of this fascinating character is the backdrop for the entire story.<br />Watchman makes you think - I read it in the backdrop of the 9-11 tragedy and even years after its publication, it still feels timely for me (in Watchman, the Soviets are the unstoppable menace). Watchman makes you feel - I cared what happened to every character (some more than others- the Comedian is a fascinating study of the anti-hero) and at the end of the book, I was sorry the ride was over.  If you like fiction of any kind, pick this book up ASAP- I doubt you'll find the combination of art and writing in any other medium.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones's debut release, &quot;Come Away with Me,&quot; is an enchanting gem of an album that is sleek and atmospheric as well as one that defies categorization.  When I stumbled across it quite by accident at the music sampling area of my local Borders books &amp; music store, I was instantly mesmerized by her sweet wispy vocals. It is good that she chose a different path than her legendary Indian father Ravi Shankar (among whose fans included the late George Harrison) and little sister Anoushka, for I never quite acquired a taste for the meditative trance of sitar music.
B0000033TE|3.0|Oof.  I know I'm gonna hear it from the diehard ELP fans for this.  Believe me, this isn't a bad album by any means.  I love certain parts of it, and I feel more than comfortable keeping this on my shelf.  And the first side is simply amazing, before the second half takes the whole thing down a notch.<br />We're started off with a stirring rendition of \\"Jerusalem\\".  I like it, and that's saying somethign because I'm not huge into classical/hymns (to put it mildly).  The next is the wonderful chaos of \\"Toccata\\".  Another quasi-classical piece, just really f'ed up.  That's a good thing.<br />The next two tracks don't do much for me (\\"Still\\" is a ballad with a cool bassline, so it's alright, and \\"Benny\\" is just comic relief filler), so let's move on to the focus of the album: KARN EVIL 9.  Apparently, the (very dumb) concept is that in the future, the machines we make will revolt and we'll be too busy making war and arguing amongst ourselves so the machines take over and put us in carnivals.  It might work for a B-movie, but it's [not good] for an \\"upscale\\" rock suite.<br />This song is split into four (really three) parts.  The first and second are perhaps my favorite part of the album.  It's about 13 minutes long combined, but seems much less than that.  It's a little bit in the vein of Thick as a Brick, with little bits of different songs joined together by great instrumentals.  And then, the album starts to lose it.<br />Part 2 of Karn Evil 9 is a 7-minute jazzy instrumental that goes ABSOLUTELY NOWHERE.  Now I realize this may be some fans' favorite parts of the album, but it doesn't do jack for me.  You could drop the needle pretty much anywhere on the track and it would sound pretty much the same.  Part 3 is a bit like part 1, just uglier and without the energy.  Another 9 minutes there, and you've got what could have been an amazing album degenerates into bloated, overdone boredom halfway through the second side.  It's no Tales From Topographic Oceans, but pretty high on the list of overblown prog-rock.<br />Give me Tarkus anyday.  But still, this definitely is worth a purchase.  Pick it up if you like this sort of stuff.  Personally, I'm not the biggest ELPhead out there (obviously), I'd prefer King Crimson, Yes, or Jethro Tull any day of the week.  But hey, you could be different.  If you're into prog, give it a try. YOu might be surprised.
B000002MFE|4.0|OK, before i get into this review, let me just state that I am a 14 year old kid that is mostly into rap music. My mom would play this cd on our way up to a resort to go skiing when I was younger and I remember loving it. Just recently, I found this laying in our attic and decided to give it a listen for &quot;old times sake&quot;. I remember liking the songs &quot;Tears in Heaven&quot; and &quot;Layla&quot; but those were the only tracks I remembered. However when I listened to it just recently, I liked almost every track. I think the whole acoustic guitar thing gives certain songs a nice touch, especially &quot;Tears in Heaven&quot;. My favorite tracks on this album are &quot;Tears in Heaven&quot;, &quot;Layla&quot;, and &quot;Before You Accuse Me&quot;. I will continue to listen to rap music, but this CD has expanded my tastes to different genres of music. The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars as opposed to 5, is because i am into a little more of the harder rock, such as Led Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix.
B000008H1Y|4.0|Among Tull fans, this album is regarded as one of their best.  However, for some reason, critics seem to hate it, from the snotty Rolling Stone reviewers to the online sites (Starostin and McFerrin immediately come to mind).<br />Well, they're wrong.  This is an incredible album.  While the naysayers say that it's boring and lacks melodies, I say that they lack ears.  The one track that's singled out is the fantastic \\"Hunting Girl\\", which for some reason everyone but me hates.  Everything else is good to great, with catchy tunes and great playing.  The only exception is the overlong \\"Pibroch (Cap in Hand)\\", which is why this album gets a 4 instead of a perfect 5.  It's interesting, but could have been done much better in half the time.  I love long songs when they're done right (a lot of Yes songs, Thick as a Brick), but when a band either stretches out a good tune way too long (Karn Evil 9) or has really long tracks that aren't all that good to begin with (Tales From Topographic Oceans), you run into serious trouble.

0783113943|5.0|This film is too interesting for two reasons:<BR>Firstly, for its sharp subject concerning the dirty that is hidden behind the glamorous fashion world where the sensitiveness has no any position.<BR>Secondly,for the alive,realistic,and hot playing of both actresses, Angelina Jolie, who is already famous and amazing actress, and mainly Elizabeth Mitchell, who unfortunately, has been overlooked by the majority of reviewers. I think that Elizabeth is a very good actress and she worth to be supported and first roles to be given to her.<BR>I think that her success in the role of Gia's lover was due mainly to her talent of course, but also to the interaction and chemistry between these two young actresses.This exciting appearence I am afraid that could not be repeated. It was unique. I don't think that Elizabeth is suitable for lesbian films. &quot;Gia&quot; was not a lesbian film. It was rather a film in which an ideal, tender relationship of deep love between two girls, a love from the first sight, that I don't know if there was in Gia's real life, was appeared.<BR>If Elizabeth reads these reviews I would like to advise her to be more careful in the choice of her roles and also to wish have more success in her career and happy birthday.
B000060P79|5.0|I am not a big fan of punk music but my friend brought me into it.  I have meet the band a couple of times and got there cd the day it came it.  It is awsome I think the coolest thing is they hang out with there fans I think that is very important.  They also very sweet.  There songs relate to people think about life and I think how they felt like a teenager.  Go Simple Plan,  And Simple Plans for ever one thing I wanted to add i think it was nice to include another cd to give away to someone else also the fact that if you load it into the compuuter you can see clips of them which with other cd's you cant do.  Thanks for listening Danielle
0060934913|5.0|I have to say that I used to fantasize about owning a restaurant, or being a renowned chef.  Fantasy is one thing--I could never do it.  While not an expose (so much) this book is a fascinating look into what really goes on behind-the-scenes in your favorite restaurants.  Bourdain writes well and entertainingly...I enjoyed reading his story from start to finish...
0195145925|4.0|Barbour lays out a world view that runs counter to the past 250 years of physics, and its implications are unsettling to anyone trained in the physical sciences. He may have found a link between the ideas of Ernst Mach and the strange, unintuitive conundrum presented by quantum mechanics. <br />We all admire the beautiful complexity present in a waterfall or in a fractal diagram, yet we assume that complexity in the real world has a limit, and we believe that science will someday find the last pieces to the puzzle. Barbour tells us that deconstructing matter is a dead end in terms of understanding reality. If he is correct, the very foundations of moden physics, biology, and philosophy will be transformed.
B00004Z459|5.0|Easily one of my favorite CD's of the past year!  You've got youthful angst, great guitar riffs, hip-hop influence and no swear words!  (can you believe it?)  This is the group Limp Bizkit aspires to be. I love every single song on here and can't wait for their next project!  Check it out!!!
B00005LLK8|5.0|My whole family loved this video. All emotions were used up in this film. Even though the dancing made me want to get up and dance along, I was entralled by the lifelong friendship of 2 boys, the changing relationonship between Billie and his father and the struggle of  the family going on strike from the coal mines. We laughed and cried and cheered. But mostly &quot;We Loved to Boogie!&quot;

B00005IC2H|5.0|Wow. This album, This album. After the disapointing sales<BR>of their debut and remix album the decided to do something new,<BR>not as dark and more beautiful with their next album. It is exactly what they did. This album is probably on of the best albums of all time. In Iceland it was voted the album of the year and the album of the century. <br />When this album was released in the summer of 1999 in Iceland it was a smash it stayed on top 20 in Iceland for 2 years straight.<br />Every song on this album is beautifully written,composed and arranged. the violins , the guitar work and the lead singers voice are all excellent. This is a great album by a group that is probably the best band in Iceland even in the world for that matter. <br />If you don´t have this album buy it now. Because you won´t regret it.
B00005QXXO|5.0|If you didnt like Kid A that much, and Amnesiac was a little to electronic for you, this is the album to make ammends with.<BR>Perfect renditions of somw of the best tracks. You will be able to understand both records more profoundlly after you listen to Everything in it rigth place and I might be wrong.<BR>then you will be delighted to hear Spinning Plates, the most beautiful rendition and the best song on the cd. <BR>Please do not expect true love waits to be an amazing song, for it turns out that its the less impressive one on the album.<BR>This is a must have for all radiohead listeners, and an album you should think of buying even if you are not a fan.
B000002N1E|5.0|O Yes. <br />I wanted this album so much. I just didn´t find it in stores so I forgot. But when I saw it i bought it right away. this album containes 18 tracks (including intercludes). The music on the album is great. If you like hip hop you will love this album. If you like R&B you will love this album. If you don´t like anything with Prince except for Purple Rain you would maybe skip this one. If you liked Sign O´The Times you will cherish and love this album to death. <br />This is a great album. It´s a shame it didn´t do very well. But it wen´t gold and became one of the artist most promising and best work to date. All the songs here are excellent and well arranged and written, His voice when he sings is great and he even raps on this. Get it if you can because this is an album that you will own.<br />Thank You I hope this would have helped you
B000002GYN|5.0|this album is indeed a classic. it is the perfect sign-post at the crossroads between what had been in country rock, and what was coming. it does have a country vibe because of bernie's playing, has perfect pop (peaceful easy feeling and take it easy), and does have a bit of henley's darker edge on tunes like witchy woman, which foreshadows what was to come on the hotel california and long run albums. i love this record, and it particularly showcases the talents of randy meisner, my favorite eagle. by the way, to marc booth:  the great songwriter jack tempchin has in fact released several albums...
B000056K04|5.0|I know all the die-hards fans would like to string me from the nearest tree, interrupting their crying over the loss of the Lillywhite Sessions.  But I hated Dave and Co. before Everyday came out.  Oh, man, the dragged-out jams that lasted forever.  Come on, that's what live shows are for, and they do a great job.  But I don't want to hear it in my car coming home from work.  And who thought a 2-minute fiddle solo sells albums?  On Everyday, Dave crams in twelve tight songs, all of which you can move to.  It's \\"pop\\" if you define pop as music \\"under four minutes long and tight\\".  It's not hip-hop, grunge, or bubble gum.  It's \\"pop\\" as in lots of radio play, and huge sales.  Millions of buyers can't be wrong.  Sorry guys, Dave is mainstream.  Phish is still relatively unknown and looking for fans...
B00004UEDQ|3.0|This movie did not find a large audience in the theaters due to the fact that is a tough sell. The story focuses on Gwen (Sandra Bullock) an alcoholic journalist who wrecks a limousine at her sisters wedding and is sentenced to 28 days in a rehab center where she meets a wide variety of people. One might ask themselves, where is the fun in that? However in the hands of director Betty Thomas (Dr. Dolittle) a wonderful quirky comedy/drama is created. When people are uncomfortable and vulnerable it is a human tendency to deflect those feelings with humor. That is what we see here, a wide variety of people who need help with a multitude of problems. Each person uses humor in a different way to cope with what is going on in his or her lives. However, Thomas is careful not to go overboard, and she adds plenty of emotional scenes to balance out the movie. This is after all about rehab and the seriousness of addiction, and Thomas never trivializes the subject. In fact she, along with most of the cast, spent time at an actual rehab center in order to portray the experience as accurately as possible. By walking that fine line between comedy and drama, Thomas has created a group of people that you genuinely care about without pitying. In today's cynical world, that is quite a feat<BR>...
0451167716|4.0|In 1969, Mario Puzo wrote down all the urban legends and hearsays he'd heard about the Mafia. This resulted into \\"The Godfather\\", a tale about a fictional Mafia family in New York, the Corleones. The tale reached epic proportions as it told the tale of the family and people associated with it spanding decades and generations.<br />It all begins in 1947, when the leader of the Corleone family, don Corleone aka The Godfather falls victim to a murder attempt that has a big conspiracy at it's roots. This leads into a cunning plan from the part of the Corleoe family; a patient plan that takes years to reach it's full execution.<br />Puzo does an exellent job at creating several interesting characters as he plays with them to create a complex and ambitiuous plot that keeps the reader in it's hold as the Mafia world is described in a fascinating way, leading up to a truly action packed adventure.<br />Thar's what \\"The Godfather\\" is at heart; an action packed adventure. It's entertainment in it's purest form and if you want to read something profound and challenging, then this isn't the book.<br />Nevertheless the entertainment works well and we're left with a book written with talent and imagination, resulting into a functioning piece of entertainment.
B0000009RX|5.0|This is my favorite album of all time!  That is why, when confronted with the opportunity to buy the original vinyl for [money], I couldn't refuse.  What I found at the end of side one was something that I had heard over and over on the c.d., but never knew what it was.  At the end of \\"Hot Poop\\", recorded backwards, is a censored verse from the song \\"Mother People\\" (which can be found intact on \\"Mothermania\\", if you can find it).  \\"Better look around before you say you don't care, shut your ... were alive, ... little person.\\"  If you notice the liner notes, I believe there is a mention of this in the lyrics for \\"Mother People\\".  If you have the means to get this on vinyl, I recommend it.  If not, just know that Zappa was a purveyor of the recording legend known as Backwards Masking.

6303477259|5.0|I would like to know when this video will be on DVD. So I could have a very special collection in my life.....
6304308388|5.0|On March 27, 2002, as the world has sadly learned, filmmaker Billy Wilder passed away. No doubt, over the passing days, weeks, months and years, there will be some discussion about him and of his work. There will also be biographies, documentaries and other tributes to him. I believe, however, that he should be left to rest in peace and that the only true monument to him is in the great movies he left to us. One of these is 1960's \\"The Apartment\\". Some might disagree with this film's Best Picture win (Considering that it was the same year as \\"Psycho\\", \\"Elmer Gantry\\" and \\"Spartacus\\"), but it's a great movie nonetheless. <br />Jack Lemmon, In a memorable role, portrays C.C Baxter, an insurance man for Consolidated Insurance in New York. Baxter has a secret: He has been lending the key to his apartment to various executives so they could have extra-martial affairs. In exchange, Baxter's career advances so far that by the movie's end, he is the boss's executive. Shirley MacLaine is elevator girl Fran Kubelik, who has had a romance with Baxter's boss. Even though the boss is a real weasel (More on him and the actor in the next paragraph), Kubelik thinks she still loves him at the end. However, she doesn't realize that she actually has fallen for Baxter. <br />Fred MacMurray will probably be most remembered for his role on \\"My Three Sons\\". His early film career also involved largely comedic roles. Ironically, his most memorable film roles, like \\"Double Indemnity\\" and \\"The Caine Mutiny\\", had him adapt to villainous roles, which he did real well. Here, he portrays J.D Sheldrake, the personal manger at the Insurance company. He is a real liar, using people to get to the top (Where he is at) and having flings with others at the building. With his looks and smile, however, you would think that he could have easily played a good guy. Shows just how good of an actor he was (Or was the part just a good fit?). Unfortunately, he joined the ranks of actors who never won Oscars. <br/>Wilder's films had a common theme of people willing to do anything for happiness, even if it means breaking the law. Here, the story is about someone willing to give up his bachelor flat for a higher position at his job. In expense, he loses the trust of those around him. The main character here, like Walter Neff in \\"Double Indemnity\\" also have a similar flaw: They don't know what to do until it's too late and they never take a stand on something. Wilder's films also had great endings, often with dialogue. The final line in this film (\\"Shut up and deal!\\") has become nearly as famous as 'Nobody's Perfect'. Now that's movie making! <br />References to previous Wilder films made in this one:<br />Mr. Dobisch (Ray Walston), one of the executives, remarks that he picked up a girl that looked like Marilyn Monroe, who was in \\"The Seven Year Itch\\" and \\"Some Like It Hot\\". During the filming of those movies, Wilder had grown to despise Monroe's demands for star treatment and her poor work ethic. Thus, he also included the party-girl Monroe-esque character in this film.<br />Another of the executives, Mr. Kirkeby (David Lewis), saw Baxter with Kubelik at his apartment and remarks that they had a \\"Lost Weekend\\", a possible reference to the 1945 film that won Wilder Best Director and Best Picture academy awards. <br />The character name Sheldrake was also used in Sunset Blvd. (1950).

0451523938|5.0|Ah, the classical dark tale of Dr. Jekyll and his mysterious, vicous, murderous counterpart, Mr Hyde. One of my favourite books, one that combienes science fiction and horror like few have others have done so well.<br />A book of suspense and mystery, it is foremost a book about psychology, exploring the sweet duality of Good and Evil. And though Hyde may be Evil, i have doubts about Jekyill being Good itself. No, the doctor is merely a troubled soul longing for freedom, and that's what Hyde gives. Freedon without consequences, a theme of debate even nowadys.<br />Stevenson's work is simply grounbreaking. It explores so many things: ethics in science; the limits of science and knowledge; how science may affect people. Like The Invisible Man, it talks about the tribulations of scientists and what are their limitations. It's also a dark view of science, for it makes it as something without benefits in the end.<br />But besides this, its still a horror story, a classical one, with all the old ingredients: dark nights; the london fog; a murderer walking about the streets after the next victims. And he does find a couple of them. In my chilliest moments, i like to think Jack the Ripper himself reed this book and decided to make it true.
B00003CXXP|2.0|Yuck, this movie is pretty awful. There is no doubt that Speilberg has had his moments but this is one of the lesser ones. Hayley Joel Osment, although he literally irritates me..., was quite good in this film.  Jude Law, as usual was great and most of the rest of the cast were great. I said MOST! The guys who plays the father in this film is so furiously terrible that I didn't even read the credits to find out who was responsible for such a performance, out of sheer embarrasment. Most notably this is a bad error of judgement on Spielbergs part.  the screenplay is something only Stanley Kubric could have pulled off. Speilbergs mix of cruel, cold and \\"Disney\\" is marred from being disturbing and effecting by the fact that it just looks plain stupid and misguided. I REALLY wanted this film to end toward the last third because I thought the point of the film had been made when the kid was dumped by his surrogate mother. Basically this is a cruel, nasty ugly film that was really badly executed...
B000002KY8|5.0|Ask anyone who grew up during the 1980s, and if they had to choose a real innovator in pop music, the guy with the most votes would have to be Prince.<br />Here was a guy from Minneapolis who played just about every instrument known to man, wrote song after song & broke down the barriers regarding the discussion of sex in a popular song. With 1980's landmark DIRTY MIND album, Prince seemed to be disinterested in creating hits, as the highly suggestive & celebratory subject matter on DIRTY MIND proved. 1981's CONTROVERSY (which would have been a better title on the previous album) saw Prince take politics to task with the same fervor he celebrated sex with. But whether or not the meager sales of those albums (both of which are now considered classics) influenced him, Prince decided to open himself up more to the masses while still talking about sex with unheard-of frankness. The result was his 5th album, 1982's 1999.<br />Indeed, 1999 built on the promise of Prince's 1979 hit \\"I Wanna Be Your Lover\\", which was sexy in its way, but still able to be played on the radio. But that's not to say Prince wasn't still pushing the envelope a bit in the way of subject matter. \\"Little Red Corvette\\" was a song that surprisingly made it onto the radio, despite the sexual themes being cloaked in innuendo. The video was one of the first by a Black artist to be showed on MTV & that no doubt helped expand Prince's audience. \\"Little Red Corvette\\" had to be the most explicit song to reach the top 10.<br />The title track naturally took on a new life by the time the new millennium came around, but at the time, its party-not-war message may have been misinterpreted. Sure, the urge to dance was undeniable, but coming at a time when the Cold War was reaching a fever pitch & the threat of nuclear war more imminent than ever, \\"1999\\" had a more important meaning that was overlooked. Nevertheless, the song did become a hit single all over again when re-released the year 1999 did come.<br />\\"Delirious\\" was the album's third hit single, but not as memorable as the two previous. It was a top 10 hit & made the synthesizer swing like it never had before, but it was probably just intended as fluff compared to the significance of its two predecessors. Elsewhere, 1999 is a double album that, like most, is a bit scattered. But when taken as a whole, it's fabulous.<br />\\"Let's Pretend We're Married\\" (the closing ad-lib I'm sure was edited for the single), \\"Lady Cab Driver\\" (not since the late '60s international hit \\"Je T'Aime...Moi Non Plus\\" has sex been \\"re-created\\" effectively on a pop song) & \\"International Lover\\" (mile high club, for sure) proved once again that Prince was dealing with sex more openly than any artist before or since. \\"Free\\" & \\"All The Critics Love U In New York\\" continue the discussion of politics & prejudice that began on CONTROVERSY. Finally, \\"D.M.S.R.\\" (dance, music, sex, romance) is an 8-minute jam that could very well be Prince's national anthem for those remain the qualities at the core of his music.<br />In the way of commercial success, 1999 was when Prince finally arrived. After the no-holds-barred approach of his previous two albums, he may have learned that critical success isn't the only thing one should base their career on. Some have criticized Prince for being \\"too commercial\\" at times, but 1999 was certainly not one of them. His star was rising & as the next album proved, Prince was just this close from becoming the royalty that befitted his name.irious\\" was the album's third hit single, but not as memorable as the two previous.

B000002KLP|5.0|Prince signed his contract with Warner Bros. Records in 1978 at the age of 19. His debut album FOR YOU took 4 months to record & ate up all the advance money Prince had been given by Warners. The album wasn't a success, for the single \\"Soft & Wet\\" was just too suggestive for pop radio, although on the R&B charts, it was more successful. His 1979 self-titled second album was recorded in only 6 weeks & finally indicated that this kid from Minneapolis was someone to keep an eye on. \\"I Wanna Be Your Lover\\" was his first major hit, but the album proved Prince was still discovering his footing this early on.<br />Then comes 1980. Prince, now 22, must have thought \\"I've broken through commercially. Why not show the world what I can really do?\\". And indeed he did! DIRTY MIND was not only the most provocative record released up to that time, but it firmly showed Prince had a grander musical vision in mind & this was the start of it.<br />Musically, DIRTY MIND is probably Prince's barest, most organic album (excluding the fabled BLACK ALBUM), which is logical considering the album is about a subject where \\"getting bare\\" is a requirement. The title track opens things up with an undulating rhythm as infectious as a porno movie & is sung in the falsetto voice that Prince utilized on much of his early work (so his music could be easily covered by other artists & made their own; just look at Chaka Khan's \\"I Feel For You\\"). Released as a single, it naturally didn't do well because the subject was just too risky for top 40.<br />\\"When You Were Mine\\" is another catchy favorite that harkens back to the British Invasion sound of the 1960s. Cyndi Lauper later covered this song wonderfully on her 1984 album SHE'S SO UNUSUAL. \\"Do It All Night\\" is a party-call-to-arms that doesn't beg you to get up & dance, it orders you to! Who can deny the invitation? \\"Gotta Broken Heart Again\\" is the only ballad on the album & ends a bit soon at only 2:13. It would have been nice to see more to this song.<br />The second half is one long suite where each song segues into the other. \\"Uptown\\" is another song that begs the listener to get up & move, the same with the self-explanatory \\"Head\\". That song proves that even if the subject may seem objectionable to some, the rhythm is practially inescapable. \\"Sister\\" deals with another taboo subject before closing out with one last funk workout \\"Partyup\\". But there's more to this song than just getting up to dance. The misunderstood political subtext of \\"1999\\" is hinted at on \\"Partyup\\" with its insistence that as long as the world gets up & dances, there'll be no need for war or any violence. The closing chant on this song further drives this point home.<br />DIRTY MIND may have been an appropriate title, for even though Prince had proved himself as a hitmaker with his previous album, his excursion into unspeakable territory no doubt colored people's perception of this obviously-talented but questionable artist. Throughout the 1980s, Prince would be named as one example of pop music being made unsafe for children's ears & an album like DIRTY MIND only proved that point. Then again, the album wasn't intended for children in the first place. Prince was all about breaking down barriers & singing about things other pop stars wouldn't dare to discuss. In the case of DIRTY MIND, it was mission accomplished. Prince was more than a hitmaker, he was now offically an artist & trendsetter. Simply put, pop music would never be the same.g.<br />The second half is one long suite where each song segues into the other. \\"Uptown\\" is another song that begs the listener to get up & move, the same with the self-explanatory \\"Head\\".

6304711875|5.0|How i love this film, and the many films which it spawned. ( Scream2, Scream3, I Know What You Did Last Summer, and I Still Know What You Did Last Summer. plus others) This film is better than Screams2/3, and even they were pretty dang good!<br />This film has a cracker of a plot and a great cast. (Although i don't really know what all the fuss is about about Neve Campbell. She's not half as attractive as Jennifer Love-Hewitt) It is full of mystery, excitement, and, screams. <br />I love it. I love this genre. It may not be your high-class film full of social commentary and important messages hidden within the plot (although i'm sure some people would indeed argue that it is. and they would find no real argument here) but nonetheless it is an excellent film. I have never had such fun watching a film. When i go to the cinema, or rent/buy a video from the store, i am looking primarily for enjoyment. A film which will entertain me and keep me riveted and excited. As such, this film is fits the mold perfectly. There is little doubt that films such as this are just fun fun fun all the way. You just sit back, let it all wash over you, and enjoy the enthralling ride every twist of the way. <br />as well as being a hugely entertaing film, it is one which pays some kind of homage to all films in this genre which have gone before. At the same time, it lightly makes fun of itself, and is full of irony. It is just so enjoyable. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and is completely unpretentious (i HATE pretentious movies) <br />I can't get over how fun and enjoyable this movie is (you can probably tell, as i can't stop telling you) anyway, just rest assured that if you see this movie, cast aside all expectations of a clever and serious movie, and just enjoy!<br />The acting is great (especially Courtney Cox's sterling performance), and the plot is a stunner. It moves along at such a fast pace that you hardly have enough time to stop and think. It's chilling, creepy, disturbing, and fun, all at the same time!<br />And the ending, what a one! A perfect climax. Tense, shocking, full of twists. I could watch it again and again. The last frame is great as well. it caps the movie off perfectly. ANd im not evne going to start on the brilliant theme music at the credits.
0792839730|5.0|One of the premier Paratrooper movies of all time. It does Cornelius Ryan's writing justice-and honors those brave &quot;sky-soldiers&quot; who jumped and died without questions.
0061053147|5.0|A must have for Blade Runner's fans. Easy to read and enjoy.
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park, most definately put together a classic on this project.  The lyrical aspect is excellent, and the musical aspect is far from disapointing as well.  The two bonus tracks are very well done, I have no idea why they didn't put them on the american version because they were just that dang good. I'd highly recomend it
B000002ORU|4.0|This isn't the perfect collection of The Who, but then again, it's hard to include all the best of the Who on 4 CD's. The last reviewer mentioned 2 songs that aren't even on this collection. At the time of this release, we were treated to some new stuff like \\"Bonie Maronie\\", live versions of \\"Naked Eye\\", \\"My Wife\\" and \\"Dreaming From the Waist\\", remixes from Sell Out, some extra selections from the famous Leeds concert, and some excellently remixed High Numbers recordings along with some never before released songs like \\"Girls Eyes\\" and \\"Early Morning Cold Taxi\\" (many of these are now included on rereleases). The problem with \\"Music Must Change\\" and \\"Guitar and Pen\\" are that they are remixed so that you can barely hear Keith Moon's drums. Also, they should've included \\"Fire\\" (off Pete Townshend's Iron Man album and performed with John Entwhistle and Roger Daltrey). Nevertheless, it's quite a collection of quintessentials and hits(\\"My Generation\\", \\"I Can See For Miles\\", \\"Pinball Wizard\\", \\"Love Reign O'er Me\\", \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\", \\"Happy Jack\\", \\"Slip Kid\\", \\"Who Are You\\" and \\"You Better You Bet\\"), single tracks (\\"Let's See Action\\", \\"Heaven and Hell\\", \\"Dogs\\", \\"Relay\\" and \\"The Seeker\\"), classics (\\"Sister Disco\\", \\"Eminence Front\\", \\"A Quick One\\", \\"Rael\\", \\"Anyway Anyhow Anywhere\\", \\"Boris the Spider\\", \\"Acid Queen\\" and \\"5:15\\") and onstage and studio banter (it all begins with Pete scolding a wild crowd and other highlights include Pete sassing Roger and punishing Abbie Hoffman for an unappreciated public announcement in the middle of the Who's set at Woodstock). Plus, you get plenty of comedy skits from the late Keith Moon. To end the box set, there is an apology from Pete taken from a 1969 concert explaining why the Who could not perform an encore followed by a 1991 cover of Elton John's \\"Saturday Night's Allright for Fighting\\" (one of the highlights from the Two Rooms CD). The book is loaded with pictures and essays from Pete (whom I quoted in the title of this review),Dave Marsh (who argues that the real leaders of the Who were the Who, not merely Pete), Keith Altham, the Who's publicist who almost got \\"stuffed and put in a glass case\\", and an excellent chronology by Chris Charlesworth.

B000003TAR|5.0|This is the best band to walk on earth.This band would with no dought be Americas band if Cobain hadn't  died.His music was so good even though you didn't know what he was saying ,he pumped me up to do things.I thought Cobain was so cool.I  get any of Nirvanas cds now in Cobains honor.Nirvana rocks.
B00005R2M3|4.0|!Muy Bien, Shakira! When I first heard \\"Whenever, Wherever\\" I at first did not like it, but after hearing it again it kinda grew on me and I kept singing it. Songs I keep singing I HAVE to buy. I found out more about Shakira. This is her first english album - that alone made me think maybe I should just buy the single because first times usually aren't that good. But I don't think the single was out at the time so I bought the whole album instead. After listening to it, I developed a likeness for \\"Objection (Tango)\\" \\"Underneath Your Clothes\\" and \\"Eyes Like Yours (Ojos Asi)\\" (Which I will admit is the most outstanding!) also for the spanish tracks \\"Suerte\\"  and \\"Te Aviso, Te Anuncio (Tango)\\". Now, I'm a J.lo fan, but Shakira really outdoes her with this one! Way to go Shaki! This is a definite buy album!!!!
0805047905|5.0|If you're looking for a fun way to teach your toddler about colors, this is it.  Each animal is assigned a unique color -- and the combinations get increasingly funny as the book progresses.  (My son is usually giggling hysterically by the time we get to \\"blue horse\\" or \\"purple cat.\\")  I swear we must have read this book a dozen times the day it arrived in the mail!  A fun book for both parents and kids.  Highly recommended!
B00005JKED|4.0|When I saw the trailer for Training Day, I didn't think it looked like anything special so I decided to wait for it to come out on dvd. So I rented it the other day as a last choice at the video store and I was very surprised at how much I liked it. <br />First off, the storyline is pretty good but not plot of the year. It's fairly universal and interchangable. The shining stars of this film, however, is the acting. Denzel Washington is simply outstanding in this role and Ethan Hawke is terrific as well. The movie as a whole is pretty damn entertaining. I wouldn't say it's the best film I've ever seen, but definetly worth the time.
B00003CXWV|5.0|Brilliant visual portrayal of George Jung's amazing life. Johnny Depp is great, Penelope Cruz hot and great, however the dark horse in this film is definitely Ray Liotta who plays the father. Makes any kid almost wish that if they had to choose anyone else to be their dad it would certainly be him!<BR>Highly recommended
B00005LLK8|5.0|When I first saw previews for this I thought it looked very stupid, so I never saw it.  One day though I came home and my parents had rented it, reluctantly I watched it.  It was the best movie!  It brought me to tears of joy at the end.  This movie is about being able to express yourself and just being able to be who you are, even if you are a guy and you like ballet.  This movie was so touching, not to mention I loved the music.  When Billy (Jamie Bell) would dance I felt so happy and I just wanted to get up and dance along with him.  This is one of the greatest movies I've seen, no wonder Jamie Bell won an oscar for it!
B00005B36H|5.0|I am a loyal fan of TOOL. I only like to listen to TOOL. If you are new to TOOL them I suggest you know the band. Lead vocals: Maynard James Keenan, Drums: Danny Carey, Lead Bass: Justin Chansler, and Lead Guitar: Adam Jones.  Maynard's vocals will open your ears and your mind. You will not be the same. Danney Carey's drumming is, to me, the driving force of the band. Listen to the track: Ticks and Leeches on the Lateralus CD and you will see my point. Adam Jones is a master when it comes to playing the guitar. Listen to any of TOOL's songs and you will understand. Adam has also directed most of their videos. Justin is the best bass player out there. I really don't know much about him other than the fact that he replaced Paul D'Amour, the original bass player of TOOL. TOOL is just TOOL. You like them or you don't. Lateralus is a good TOOL CD to start of with because it's their new CD and it's not as deep as the others. I hope this review helped. If not, I enjoyed writing this review about TOOL. Here's to TOOL
B00004YA66|5.0|Frequency is the best movie you will ever see.  I am 22 years of age today actually and I can't say one bad thing about this movie.  I've been sitting here reading everyone elses reviews and actually got pretty bored by them, but I have to say that they are very intellegent reviews.  Instead of wasting your time telling you what the movie was about and ruining it for you I am going to tell you why you need to watch this movie.<BR>1)It is the best movie ever<BR>2)It is interesting, keeps you thinking<BR>3)Actors/Actress' were wonderful<BR>4)Come on, you cant miss out on watching Dennis Quaid in any  <BR>movie<BR>5)If you don't watch it you will regret it<BR>6)It melts your heart<BR>7)And like Ive told all of my friends about this movie It IS a mens movie and a womans movie  It is NOT a Chick flick.<BR>Thanks for taking the time to read my review, its not the greatest review ever but I hope it convinced you enough to rent the movie and watch it. You wont regret it.<BR>Melanie
B00003CXZ1|5.0|This movie isn't for everyone, but that doesn't mean it should be pounded on either. Personally I loved it. I like the games and I thought Angelina was great bringing the character Lara Croft to action.<BR>People who say there isn't a plot or dialog in the movie don't play the game. The Character is an adventurer, not a linguist. Lara goes on trips and comes across tons of different things, places and people. Plus she's a strong woman to boot!<BR>Angelina did a great job showing these characteristics of Lara and the movie was well done and written in relationship to the character Lara. If you've been addicted to the game and comic books then this movie is for you. If your not into the whole Tomb Raider scene already this may not be all that interesting to you. <BR>The locations and variety in actors is cool and there are hints of Brittish comedy that most American's probably wouldn't get.<BR>Personally I had to have this as soon as it was out and it was the coolest thing when my husband got it for me for Valentine's day.<BR>Girl power and blowing up stuff, What more could a tom boy ask for!
B00004WGAI|1.0|hi, I read Jane Eyre about a month or 2 ago and i LOVED that book. It's almost as good as Gone with the Wind. I rented this movie and watched it. I was not prepared for this-. The scenery looked so fake, the actors were terrible, they looked like they didn't know what they were doing, and it looked like it was recorded from someones shoulder at some times. The one star is for the fact that at least the movie tried to follow the book, I'll give them that because I despise movies that are titled after books and end up being totally different (e.g. 3rd Anne of Green Gables movie.) <BR>Excuse me, I might have been running away with my imagination while I was reading Jane Eyre because the movie so rudely brought me back to the bare facts of the book. (I am so sorry, but Timothy Dalton looks most unbecoming, even if he's supposed to, I always fancied the \\"ugly\\" men as handsome- forgive my ignorance.)
B00003CY6M|4.0|O.K., Let me start off and say this movie is based on all the \\"coincidetal\\" parts in love movies that make females, and some males (I'm a MAN and can admit when I cry), cry.<br />Yes, this movie is very gimmicky, but that what makes this movie great also.  It knows it's very gimmicky and that's what makes this movie, being it's the bases and not to include main plot points.<br />The story goes like so:<br />In one magical moment Jonathan Trager (John Cusack) and Sara Thomas (Kate Beckinsale) meet unexpectedly and spend a romantic winter day together, although both are involved with other people. At the end of the night Sara decides they must let fate determine if they are meant to be together and disappears without giving Jonathan a way of reaching her. Ten years later, they are both engaged to others but cannot give up the dream that they will meet again. And so begins their journey to find one another worlds apart!<br />Like I said, very gimmicky, but that's what makes this movie work.<br />The DVD itself is nothing too special.  It has a good anamorphic widscreen presentation, ok audio, and not too many extras besides a few deleted sensces(nothing to go crazy over here) and an On the Set feature.
6301247485|3.0|Almost everyone who has graduated from high school has heard of F. Scott Fitzgerald's highly acclaimed book, The Great Gatsby.  But how about the movie?  Does it do the 1925 novel justice? Does it even compare?  My answer is no, and here's why: First of all, the movie version of a book is almost never as good as the novel because the reader can create his or her own ideas about what is taking place.  Unfortunately, director Jack Clayton seems to have better ideas about costumes and music rather than interpretations of the text.  Secondly, Mia Farrow, who plays Daisy, is transparent as an actress; the viewer might as well be looking at a window.<BR> The director did an excellent job of recreating the party scenes and outfits of The Great Gatsby.  However, his interpretations of F. Scott Fitzgerald's text were somewhat disappointing.  Symbols such as the green light at the end of Daisy's dock were not as satisfying as they were in the book.  The one scene that I felt was well done was the hotel room, where everyone was sweaty and irritable but Gatsby, and the argument that occurred there was quite convincing.  Other than this well-done scene, something was lost in the translation from words to pictures.<BR> The casting was well done, with the exception of Mia Farrow as Daisy, who ruined the movie.  Every scene that featured Farrow was disappointing.  Farrow's version of Daisy had absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever, making it very hard to believe that Gatsby, or anyone, would be willing to break up a marriage or spend millions of dollars for parties, just so that he could reclaim her as his own.<BR> The 1974 film The Great Gatsby, based on the novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald, does not do the book justice.  A few of the scenes from the book were recreated well, but Clayton and Farrow both failed to capture the entire essence of Fitzgerald's original story line and theme.  I would recommend this movie only to those who are looking to spend a quiet evening at home,not to the serious moviegoer or novel reader.
0571212689|5.0|Someone once asked me why, if I liked best to cartoon, I would bother with courses in life drawing. I suppose I gave some sort of answer, but it was never as good as the one Richard Williams gives in &quot;The Animator's Survival Kit&quot;.  If I only had space for one animation book on my shelf, it would be this book.  There are actually quite a few animation books on my shelf, but this one is like getting a whole animation course.  It's full of wonderfully useful and understandable drawings, with just the right amount -- ie, not too much -- of explanatory and entertaining text. It clarifies, analyzes, teaches (and occasionally debunks), as it presents the collected knowledge of some of the world's greatest animators, including Williams himself.
0060930187|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and also enjoyed Plath's last collection of poems, Ariel.<br />The book is extremely hunting for it blurs the line between fiction and reality to a point where you wonder if it was just persuasive writing or yourself is ultimately suicidal. It takes you onto a journey from broad daylight to the dreary hours and the shocking finality. It brings out the truthful dark side out of everyone.
B000050FEN|5.0|SE7EN is the most brilliant film I have ever seen.  It's the type that once you see it, it leaves a dark, gloomy image tatooed in your mind.<BR>It has an excellent cast with a villian so creepy, so ingenios that not even Dr. Lectur could match wits with him.  Plus, most films are based on actual killers, but not this one.  This villian is so twisted that no one in the real world could compare to him. <BR>(The Silence of the Lambs is nothing compard to the genious of this movie!)<BR>Last, it has an ending that will send chills up your spine that will last in your mind.<BR>THIS IS THE ONE YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS
6301954947|5.0|This is a truly remarkable film.  I can add little to the earlier reviews except to note that the VHS version is different from the original.<br />Steiger and Plummer are to my mind spot on.  Wellington was both dour and very charming - otherwise he would not have been so effective as a ladies' man!  <br />I remember going to the original widescreen version at the Odeon in Leicester Square - a truly widescreen.  My recollection of the movie is that it was significantly longer, with additional vignettes featuring at least two of the \\"scum of the earth\\".  Moreover, I have a distinct feeling that the cavalry charge against the squares is far longer in the orginal version.  My hope is that the DVD version when it comes will fully restore this movie...
B00005YW4H|3.0|On her official debut release, Come Away with Me, \\"jazz\\" vocalist Norah Jones evenly splits the difference between subtle and boring.  There's no escaping that she's a prodigious singer.  She feels her way into her material with grace, compassion and, best of all, intelligence.  She has none of the preening or pretentious overreach of similar artists like, to use one example, Cassandra Wilson.  Her gifts are in evidence on a broad range of material, from the Hoagy Carmichael chestnut \\"The Nearness of You\\" to Hank Williams's \\"Cold Cold Heart\\", both expertly rendered, to her own \\"Nightingale\\", the CD's standout.  Still, I put jazz in quotes above because her phrasing never breaks an emotional sweat the way the greatest do (Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughn), and, for all its pedigree (the Arif Mardin production, the label affiliation), the CD could just as easily have been released by Windham Hill, who might better market its soporific qualities.
0440219078|5.0|The giver is a very good book I liked it very much and I think that you should read it too(only if you like science fiction). It has a interesting plot and a thinkable ending.<BR>The giver is about a boy named Jonas he lives in a different comunity in a place where there is no pain,stress or bad history each family is alowed to have only two children each of different gender.Jonas gets to be picked as the next Reciever of memory, he learns and he discivers the horible secrets of his comunity and decides to do something about it. And that is about all Im going to tell you. I gave this book five out of five stars because I think that this book is excelently done...
B00005MP58|5.0|This adaptation of Jane Austen's classic is absolutely addictive.  I bought this special edition DVD less than a month ago and have watched it at least 3 times and various different scenes more than a few times.  The attention to detail with the settings, costumes and language that stays very true to Austen's novel is magnificent and part of the enormous charm of this mini-series.  The actors are all wonderfully cast. Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth as Elizabeth and Darcy have an undeniable chemistry between them that it would be very difficult to imagine anyone else in their roles.  The characters literally come to life on the screen, and it would be difficult to re-read the novel without imagining all the wonderful actors who portrayed them in the film.  <br />The DVD had a special &quot;Making of...&quot; feature that is very good, but not as interesting as the book version.  I found it odd that the two main stars, Ehle and Firth, were not interviewed at all but Alison Steadman (Mrs. Bennett) and David Bamber (Mr. Collins) were instead.  It was interesting to hear the production team and the producer, Sue Birtwistle, the director, Simon Langton and the writer, Andrew Davies, tell their own personal feelings about both the Austen novel and their film adaptation of it.  This DVD is very much a valuable collectible for any Austen fan or any period film buff.
B00004XONN|5.0|Kid A is an incredible piece of work. From the eerie &quot;Everything in its right place&quot; to the last emotions of &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot;, this is incredible. My highlight of this album is the booming &quot;The National Anthem&quot;. It begins with a warped bass guitar sounding like the apocalypse before the drum falls in. Then we're in business. Just when you think it can't get any better Thom Yorke's distorted vocal comes in singing just what you are thinking. The icing on this cake is a trumpet salute following the vocals, by which point the entire song falls into disarray before the drum kicks back in and we end with a piece of unknown classical music recorded from a radio station during the album's making. Masterful!<BR>If you never buy another album (except Hunky Dory) buy this.
0451169514|5.0|Stephen King's IT demands a pretty big investment from readers. At more than 1000 pages it seems like a helluva mountain to climb and I can understand the hesitation a lot of people have when they first pick it up. (It's a hefty muther, so remember to lift with your legs!) But as intimidating as it may seem, the reward in the end is extraordinary and it is a journey you will never forget... A group of children, struggling to survive the cruelties of being outsiders and \\"geeks\\", find themselves battling for the survivial of the entire town when the epitome of the boogeyman crawls forth from beneath the town. The creature takes the shape of a demented clown named \\"Pennywise\\", but like the devil, it is legion and can take many guises; capitalizing on their individual and most personal fears. Through sheer bravery and desperate love for one another, they manage to slay the beast and send it back to where it came from. Decades later, however, as adults who have all gone their separate ways, they are called back home by one of their members who stayed behind as a kind of Watcher. The evil has returned, he tells them, and it is up to them to finish the job they started as children. But the unspeakable IT (aka Pennywise) is expecting them and it will make them pay for what they did to it those many years ago... As big as this book is, and as intimidating as it seemed when you first opened the cover, turning the last page will break your heart. It is a novel to be cherished again and again.
0399236201|5.0|In the new novel Stormbreaker by Anthony Horowitz, 14-year-old Alex Ryder is living with his uncle and guardian Ian Ryder in modern-day London when Ian is mysteriously killed in a car accident. Alex soon finds out that his uncle didn't really work at a local bank but was a spy for England's secret service. Now the British government wants Alex to pick up where his uncle left off and investigate Sayle Enterprises, the makers of a revolutionary computer called the Stormbreaker. After being trained by MI6 (British secret service) Posing as the winner of a contest, Alex finds himself entering the Sayle Enterprises' headquarters only to discover several strange things such as a must butler nicknamed \\"Mr. Grin\\" for the two scars extending from both ends of his mouth to his ears, and a hidden underground factory. In a James Bond fashion Alex dodges death left and right, discovers the `truth' about the Stormbreaker and still makes it home in time for tea and crumpets.<BR> Anthony Horowitz makes this novel and eloquent romp through the field of literature. But seriously this novel made my palms sweat. Horowitz keeps you peeking around a corner the whole time. A quote: \\"If Alex went down there into the water, and ran out of breath halfway, he would drown. Again his imagination got the better of him. He could see himself pinned beneath the rock in the freezing darkness. He couldn't imagine a worse way to die.\\"<BR> I found this novel quite suspenseful and entertaining. It took me through several unexpected twists and turns while I was cheering Alex on. I recommend this exiting book for anyone.
0060012331|5.0|The latest in Terry Pratchett's wry, bizarre, exciting, and impossible to put down Discworld series, The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents is a humorous yet compelling story of a cat and his boy, as well as a tribe of rats who have all gained sentience due to the accidental side effects of wizardly machinations. The cat has also been blessed or cursed with sentience - for how is a cat ever meant to be capable of pondering the distinction between right and wrong, predator and prey? And now that the rats have the ability to think for themselves, they must find a new way of living, for they are no longer like ordinary rats in this superb, fascinating story that parallels \\"The Secret of NIMH\\" but with a closer reflection of true human nature - even as human nature can apply to cats and rodents. Terry Pratchett's Discworld series has been first-rate reading since its debut with \\"The Colour of Magic,\\" and the latest in this proud, funny, and often insightful series does not disappoint. A \\"must\\" for the legions of Terry Pratchett fans!
0345440803|1.0|This is an example of a writer having one seller then putting a useless sequel out.I really would like to get the money I wasted back on this book.She seems too much like an old fashioned English Nanny or nurse and not someone that familiar with children.Not enough activites to stimulate the childs development and games suggestions.Only good suggestion she had was that Moms needed to not interfere with Dads being with their kids.
0060207051|5.0|Goodnight moon was my favoite bedtime story growing up. It stands the test of time.  Now I am 32 years old and this is the 1st book I think of when I am purchasing a book for a gift for a young child.
6305428557|2.0|I guess you have to be a huge fan of British humor. I mean, so huge, that you love a British movie just for being, well, a British comedy. I'm a big fan of Hugh Grant. I enjoyed Notting Hill and I LOVED Four Weddings and a Funeral.<br />But this movie was a lame duck. It's supposed to be funny that a little town gets all in an uproar over the fact that what they perceive to be their 'mountain' is a handful of feet short of being considered a mountain, by mountain height standards (MHS). So bent out of shape are they, that they keep the mountain measurers in the town, and while they're not looking, the townsfolk pile dirt and grass on top of the hill, because apparently a hill with a 16 foot mount on top of it makes a mountain.<br />It's a one joke movie where the joke just isn't funny. To please the viewers, they throw in a romance at the end of the movie that doesn't work. She starts off hitting on our hero just to keep him around, but then falls in love with him...but you really can't tell when that actually happened, considering the romance was thrown in near the end of the movie.<br />The music gets silly at points where you're supposed to laugh. But the dialogue isn't funny, they make fun of Grant for being English (as if that's worse than being Welsh and obsessing over a hill), and it's just hard to keep wondering how long it'll be until this two hours of snoozefest is finished. For a swerve, the picture on the cover of the movie is a more updated one of Grant. They were smart in not showing what he really looked like in the movie on the cover.<br />The introduction of the movie was awful, but the scenery was pretty.<br />Definitely rent this one before you decide to buy. Buying this without previously viewing it would be a HUGE mistake.
B000002GVO|2.0|When I heard the song Hotel California I wanted that album. It was big mistake though, because when I bought and played it, I wanted a refund. The title song and Life In the Fast Lane was great, New kid in town was a good calm rocker. The rest are really boring fillers. Wasted time and its reprise was boring all the way through, Victim of Love was downright depressing and I hate depressing tunes, Pretty Maids All in Row was lousy and dreary. Try and Love Again was not good, and The Last Resort was big time filler. As a suggestion borrow somebody's HC album and get a copy of the first three songs. Stay away from the others if you don't to get torchered to death with bordom and depression.
B00004TLN3|4.0|if you can get past the strange 80's soundtrack (and the fact that Mrs. Allen's 'torn muslin' isn't actually muslin), you'll enjoy this film.  Oh yes...and if you thoroughly dislike fantasy sequences, stay away.  <br />Penned by Maggie Wadey, author of a number of BBC literary screenplays, this version is sweet and entertaining.  Peter Firth is a bit prissy, but he's good-looking, and delivers his lines with grace and skill - he makes a fine Henry Tilney.  Ingrid Lacey, as his sister Eleanor, is sympathetic, likeable, and memorable.  Katharine Schlessinger, as Catherine Morland, has wonderful, wide blue eyes that make her look every bit the ingenue she ought to be.  and the people who play the Thorpes are creepy as heck.  <br />I was happily reminded of my time in Bath by the filming locations.  And after awhile, i even liked the silly sountrack.
B000002GJH|5.0|Take the best of Soundgarden and the best of Pearl Jam, mix it all together and this is the magnificient result. Some songs (as \\"Say hello to heaven\\" and \\"Times of trouble\\")are mere musical perfections but the whole album is absolutely flawless. Maybe excepting the excessive lenght of \\"Reach down\\", nice but endless; I always skip it at half track.<BR>Chris Cornell will test the resistence of your room's glasses with his powerful and matchless voice.<BR>What else do I have to say ... BUY IT !!! Especially if you are a Chris Cornell fan and you loved either his latest Soundgarden records and his solo album.<BR>In the end,I don't want to sound cynical but if an unfortunate artist's death leads to this kind of output...well...sorry but I'm longing for thr next ! ...just kidding.
B00004WG28|5.0|When I heard that one of my favorite stories was being remade, I decided not to see it. One day it was on TV, and I saw a bit of AATK and thought it looked interesting. Since renting it, I have watched it 25 times leaving it on during my work day since it elates my spirit.  For romantics, this is a movie worth watching. The writing is the kind that I enjoy from movies made 50 years ago. Chow Yun-Fat and Bai Ling (Tuptim) should have gotten awards for their work. Jodie takes some getting used to because of her accent.  The rest of the cast is excellent. The musis is outstanding. Please, if you read this, and love a good story and romance, you will enjoy this immensely.
B00005RIKD|1.0|Now, Don't get me wrong, I am a great fan of Sting. I just feel that his newer renditions of some of my favorite songs were cheap and shallow. True, as he ages, some of his abilities change, leaving him no choice but to rewrite the music to his new tone, but I feel that this is a tad too far. Just listen to the samples of Brand New Day, All This Time, and Don't Stand So Close to Me, and then listen to the originals. It's practically a travesty, what happened to his music.

B000062Y98|5.0|This album should not be listened to, it should be EXPERIENCED.  70 minutes of what is easily Blind Guardian's best album (among their other 5 masterpieces) containing beautiful orchestral arrangements to bone-jarring guitar riffage, this is a must-own album for any person who appreciates music.  The epic &quot;And Then There was Silence&quot; is among the finest extended tracks of all time, along with Rush's &quot;2112,&quot; Iron Maiden's &quot;Rime of the Ancient Mariner,&quot; and Iced Earth's &quot;Dante's Inferno.&quot;  While Blind Guardian have all but departed from the speed/thrash metal of their first two albums, the evolution is for the better.  Hansi Kürsch's multi-layered vocals sound crystal clear.  Marcus Siepen's and Andre Olbrich's guitars cut through the mix, full of sound and fury, only in this case, signifying brilliance, power, and technical skill.  Thomen Stauch's drums and percussion are the hammers of Valhalla, and thunder through the album.  All in all, there are no flaws on the album, other than that it's not long enough!  So kick back for a few hours and let this album play through three or four times to let all of the sounds fill your soul.<BR>Ratings:<BR>Production: 10/10<BR>Performance: 10/10<BR>Lyrics: 10/10<BR>Arrangements: 10/10Songwriting: 10/10<BR>Tone: 10/10<br />Overall: 10/10

6304007523|5.0|Rocky is probably the role Sylvester Stallone is most known for. The two bit nobody from Philadelphia that gets a shot at the big time.<br />Rocky Balboa A.K.A. The Italian Stallion is challenged by the heavyweight champion of the world, Apollo Creed(Carl Weathers). Apollo wanted to give a no name a shot at the title. He picked Rocky due to the fact he like his name The Italian Stallion. When rocky gets this shot he turns to an old gym owner to train him. Mickey Goldmill(Burgess Meredith), Whom I think is the best character in the Rocky movies. Along the trials and tribulations of the film Rocky is introduced to his future wife, Adrienne(Talia Shire), by his friend, and her brother, Paulie(Burt Young). All the actors give notable performances. After all of the training Rocky is ready to do battle with the champ. Needless to say Rocky makes a name for himself.<br />I also like this film because when they box they actually hit and bloody one another. It's an all out war in the ring. Unlike realistic boxing matches where there is a bunch of hugging and blocking punches. The boxing is very entertaining and not a borefest. Also Rocky Balboa, The Italian Stallion, always makes us Italians feel a little better about ourself. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and see where it all started for Sly. See Rocky today!!!!
B000002C25|4.0|Be Here Now is widely considered the weak link of Oasis' musical catalogue, and it's easy to understand why people might think that way.  After the massive success of What's the Story (Morning Glory)?, Oasis' follow-up LP is over-produced, overdubbed and, naturally, overlong (71 minutes!).  It pretty much begs for the conclusion that the Gallagher boys took Morning Glory's success and used it to satisfy every creative urge they've ever had.  <br />That conclusion is true, and the end result is maybe the most overly ambitious album in history.  Of course, this being Oasis, almost all of it pays off.  Be Here Now positively assaults you with every melody and ambiguous lyric that Oasis can find.  Simple rock songs are morphed into seven and eight minute epics of self-awareness.  &quot;D'you Know What I Mean?&quot; has a slow crunch that seems to last even longer than the song's gargantuan length.  &quot;My Big Mouth&quot; would be Oasis' fastest driving rock song if it weren't for &quot;I Hope I Think I Know.&quot;  And both &quot;Magic Pie&quot; and &quot;All Around the World&quot; string out their chorus' into codas so long the songs practically beg for mercy by the end.<br />But all of it shimmers with that patented Gallagher touch.  The melodies are spot on, and Liam Gallagher's vocals are as arrogant and effective as ever.  Certainly, by the reprise (reprise!) of &quot;All Around the World,&quot; the album has run out of steam.  But part of Be Here Now's charms is its unending determined ambition to big the biggest album you've ever heard.  And, if you can get past the collective bloat of the whole affair, you're left with another powerful LP in the Oasis catalogue.
B0000509C3|1.0|What a pitiful, feeble attempt to make a horror movie. Where is the horror in this film? Maniacal children sacrificing there own to a demon in the cornfield? HA!! HA!! I laugh at that.<br />A couple gets lost along the cornfield. While looking at the map they strike a child with their car. They search for help and find out the child was already mangled when they hit him. Peter Horton plays the man(I forget his name) and Linda Hamilton(forget her name too, as the whole movie is forgettable)plays the woman. They meet these two young children who aren't like the others. They let the copule know what is going on. Upon finding this \\"vital\\" information out, they devise a plan to burn down the corn field. Let's hear it for brilliance!!<br />The actors give laughable performances, there is no climax, there is no story and there is no point in watching this film. I thought this was a horror film. Where's the scare? Where's the blood? Where's the fright? If you are a horror fan, such as I, please, please stay away from this monstrosity. You'll be entertained more by eating corn then watching Children of the Corn.
B00004XOWM|1.0|What happened? Limp Bizkit went from \\"Holy Sh-t\\" to \\"Piece of Sh-t\\". This is truly depressing. I could have seen their downfall when they started to slowly mix rap into their metal. Sure, it'd be sweet if they did that for like one or two songs (Slipknot hit it right with Spit It Out). To every band out there, don't mix metal and rap...they're two different genres...Please, we don't need anymore Fred Durst clones...
B000001FKY|5.0|Everyone seems to dislike Def Leppard and Hysteria because it was a huge part of the 80s Hair Band movement. Well, I'm here to tell everyone that this album is the greatest music I have ever heard. I'm serious. This is such a great album. Usually a so-called \\"good\\" album has its 2 or 3 hit singles and a bunch of other crap songs on it. Not only does Hysteria have 7 hit singles on it, the 5 other tracks on it are all worthy of being singles. This album just seems to have something on it that can appeal to everyone. It has its line up of singles (Rocket, Women, Animal, Love Bites, Hysteria, Armegeddon it, and of course Pour Some Sugar on Me) along with Gods of War, Excitable, Don't Shoot Shotgun, Love and Affection, and Run Riot. Another thing I need to mention- I am 15 years old. So don't you dare think for one second that this album is \\"dated\\" or stale. If a fickle 15-year-old can fall in love with it, you can too. Pour Some Sugar on Me is my personal favorite form Hysteria. I first heard it on the radio and I thought that it was a new song from a band I hadn't heard of. I really really liked the song,it had such a great rhythm and I just loved everything about it. So I looked it up on the internet and I found out the song was nearly 15 years old. I was amazed. I just thought it was a great new song. I had no idea it could turn me on to such a great band. I now own every album they have released.
B00005U122|5.0|There are so many DVD concerts out there, but few are truly done right. Too often the video is poor quality, the vocals are out of sync, or the editing is so overdone you get a headache. In The Flesh is quite the exception. The technical aspects are as good as I've seen. It is really a pleasure to watch. But what puts this Concert DVD at the top of the genre is the musical performance. It's obvious that a lot of artistic effort went into creating proper arrangements of these songs for a live show. And Waters has assembled a stellar group of muscians/singers who take his groundbreaking music to new places. If you've loved the music for decades, you'll be delighted by the freshness achieved here. FYI - my other DVD concert recommendations are: James Taylor - Live at the Beacon Theatre, Talking Heads - Stop Making Sense, Eagles - Hell Freezes Over, Music for Montserrat and John Fogerty - Premonition.
B00005UQ9F|5.0|Take \\"The Shining\\" and the better parts of \\"The Blair Witch Project,\\" let them go k-i-s-s-i-n-g up in a tree, and \\"Session 9\\" is what you'll get.  I can't say enough good things about this movie.  It's the best-made, most atmospheric, genuinely creepiest horror movie I've seen in a long, long time.  It's the kind of movie that restores your faith in a whole genre, making up for every bad teen horror film and mindless sequel you might've sat through in the last few years.  What can I say?  \\"Session 9\\" is the fleck of gold you hope against hope to catch gleaming amid the broken rocks and sand at the bottom of your pan.<br />Directed by Brad Anderson (\\"Next Stop Wonderland\\"), \\"Session 9\\" tells the story of a team of six asbestos abatement workers hired to clean out in one week's time the deserted Danvers Mental Hospital in Massachusettes.  The film was shot onsite in the historic red-bricked monster of a building once known as the Danvers Lunatic Asylum.  There's no shortage of creepy atmosphere at hand, and the film-makers use it to their purpose, slowly bringing to boil a tale of escalating interpersonal frictions and dizzying madness.<br />\\"Session 9\\" works on many levels.  On the surface, it's a taught thriller, offering more than a few jump-out-of-your seat scares; it's also an interesting character study of six men thrown together under high-pressure conditions.  The acting is all top-notch, but Peter Mullen and David Caruso are particularly good as the boss and foreman of the asbestos team. At its heart, \\"Session 9\\" is a compelling psychology tapestry, woven together from haunted voices, spooky sounds, and rich visual metaphor.<br />From the opening scenes where the team tours the massive building, it's pretty obvious that Brad Anderson didn't miss the day in film school when they studied Stanley Kubrick.  The prominence of slow, wide tracking shots, ironic daylight, and place-as-character motifs are all strongly reminiscent of The Shining.\\"  So is much of the storyline.  But \\"Session 9\\" is more than just a \\"Shining\\" knock-off.  It slowly builds its own character and atmosphere, managing to create something original, modern, and truly scary.  If you're a fan of great horror films and have begun to worry that they don't even try to make them anymore, please see \\"Session 9.\\"toryline.  But \\"Session 9\\" is more than just a \\"Shining\\" knock-off.  It slowly builds its own character and atmosphere, managing to create something original, modern, and truly scary.

6304143184|5.0|When this movie lost the Oscar to \\"Gandhi\\" in 1983, I predicted that the children who had seen \\"E.T.\\" the previous summer would be taking their own children to see it twenty years later while \\"Gandhi\\" gathered dust on archive shelves.  This Easter weekend, I saw my prediction come true, as three generations of my family went to see the new theatrical release of \\"E.T.\\"  The music still lifts you twenty feet into the air when the bicycles take off into the sky, the scene when E.T. is dying still makes everyone cry their eyes out, and kids still come out of the theater imitating E.T.'s croaky voice as they repeat \\"E.T. phone home!  E.T. phone HOME!  E.T. phone hooooooooome!\\"  The film is definitely a hit with the new generation, which confirms my opinion that kids these days are all right!

0425180638|5.0|For those of us who are diehard Scarpetta followers, this book brought us exactly what we expected.  If someone is looking for a mundane murder mystery with a predictable plot, pass on Cornwell and Kay Scarpetta.  I feel like I know Scarpetta and I expected nothing less than an overwhelmed character in this latest book due to her recent experiences.  Part of having a continuing character (that so many of us are addicted to) is carrying her experiences and how she develops by them from book to book.  If you're not a true fan, perhaps you would be better off passing on this one since it's deeply reflective and is more centered on the main character than any of the rest of the series.  After reading one of these I am overwhelmed with the fact that I need to wait...usually quite a while for the next one.  I KNOW Cornwell will help Kay start to come out of her funk and jump back into life and I can't wait to see how she does it!
B000000OPW|5.0|I'm a hardcore devotee so, with the exception of SUPERSTITION, Siouxsie can do no wrong in my eyes. Just the same, I recognize the potential for some listeners to complain that this album feels very commercial. Several tracks are, indeed, tailor-made for FM and college radio play. But it doesn't detract from this being one of the high points in the Banshees' career.<br />The group finds a remarkable balance among Sioux's post-punk wailing, Severin's (often indulgent) reflections on personal demons, and Budgie's melodic genius. The results are tunes that are somehow haunting, affecting, and just right for singing along in the shower. Commercial, yes, if that means the band demonstrates the professional restraint and polish that comes with age.<br />Oh, and the bonus tracks on this issue are alone worth the price of purchase . . . very different in tone from the final LP edit.<br />If you want to explore this band, this is a good place to start. It's not their absolute best, but it's a wonderful and thoroughly accessible introduction. If you already like them and don't own this one, you'd better get it while it's still in print.
B00005QW5X|5.0|This is the most amazing musical I have seen in a long time and one of the most amazing movies as well.  Throughout the movie you are with Hedwig all the way.  It is a movie about separation and unification.  It is about completion.  The music sits in your head all day and when you finally get home and put the CD in the player it is like scratching an itch that has bothered you for hours.  I especially recommend this film experience to anyone who knows what it feels like to be half.
B00003W8NM|5.0|-Personally fight club is one of the best movies that I've ever seen. it is brutal and in your face with all the wrongs and rights of life. A movie that was truly overlooked until its video release. With the movies cult like success there have been two views created. One view is that fight club is a pointless over thought gore fest waste of time. I believe a lot more women think this then man. Its not a sexist thing, but most guys I talk about fight club with seem to at least some what like it and most women seem to hate it. I think its a little funny because a lot of women love to see shirtless ripped men. <BR>-Beyond the who likes what part, we come to the actual movie. Most people who read already know the goods about fight club so will just skip to why they should see it. First of all, despite being the title of the movie, this movie had little to do with fight club. Its in depth look at the go nowhere life of a man in middle management (Edward Norton). So anyone who was turned off by the previews, don't worry its a completely different experience. This movie is based on a book (of the same name) that is intense and well thought out so anyone who thinks this movie might be a scriptwriter's weekend off mission, you should once again think twice. Edward Norton (my favorite actor: American history X, primal fear, etc.) and Brad Pitt give one of the most insane duo performances ever. David Fincher (my favorite director: se7en, the game, panic room, and sadly alien 3) does in outstanding job of making this movie dark and hard to swallow.  <BR>-I can understand why people would hate this movie. it has a style that is very masculine and has a dark overshadow but no one by any means should over look this movie.
1561005533|5.0|First of all, let me say I am amazed by Egypt. My friends at school call me the Pharaohaulic. This book only hieghtens my opinion of the culture.<BR> When I started \\"River God\\" I was expecting a lot. I had just finished \\"The Ramses Saga\\" by Christian Jacq,(Those are awesome too.) and was desperate for a novel to top them, or at least match 'em. Boy, did I get what I needed! <BR> My favorite character is the narrator, Taita. Now,for all you people who wrote reveiws saying he was arogent and a know it all, I've got one thing to say. YOU ARE ALL CRAZY!! Taita is definetly one of the sweetest characters ever. The person who got my goat was Intef, Taita's master. He both infuriated me and scared me. His emasculating Taita left me enraged and appauled. Man, was I happy when he and his bodygaurd, Rasfer died. (I know that's a little sick.)<BR> As for the lovers in the story, Tanus and Taita's mistress, Lostris, their relationship was beleiveble. It wasn't some stupid Disney-like romance where two people fall in love and everyone lives hapily ever after. The couple has to work to keep their love a secret. And who has to arrange their secret meetings and what not? You guessed it, Taita. This is a tough job, especially after Intef engages Lostris to Pharaoh.<BR> Now that I've laid down all the characters for you I won't give away anymore of the plot. All I can say is if you like historical fiction about Egypt read this book. I'm twelve and I adored it. Think of how much you'll love it if you're an adult 'Pharaohaulic.'
B00005JKGO|5.0|Until Criterion get off their butts and remaster this (and take your time and do it \\"right\\"), ultra-legendary film classic, we will all have to content ourselves with the VHS cassettes: two chunky tapes with semi-poor audio and a grainy picture. <br />This film is BRILLIANT in every way, and in my opinion, if you have never seen it, you don't know much about cinema! See it as soon as you are able, and if it's been awhile, you owe yourself a treat and rent or buy it again soon!<br />The VHS tapes will \\"do\\" temporarily, but considering the  overseas international sensation this film caused in 1960, it's puzzling why no one has released a high quality version on DVD as yet? The 1960's would not have been what they were had it not been for this movie. The city of Rome would not be what it is today if not for this movie. We would not have the term \\"paparrazi\\" if not for this movie. Why then can we not see it in all its wonderful glory as it was meant to be seen?!?!<br />I can only hope that the Criterion collection is preparing something BIG and giving this film the same spectacular treatment that Criterion showed to 8 1/2.<BR>When (not if), they do, buy your copy immediately. I would easily pay $100.00 for my copy without blinking an eye and feel I got a bargain! If you only own three movies in your home collection, this should be one of them!
B000056VJ7|5.0|You can sit and listen to this album over and over again because the songs are so unique and entertaining. I am 13 years old and born in 1988, and a know Meat Loaf was before me, but they are my favorite group. Bat Out of Hell is a creative work of art, with songs stretching on forever but keeping their power and force and leaving the listener saying &quot;Is it over already?&quot; after 9 minutes are up and wanting more. With the classic first track &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot; to &quot;Paradise By The Dashboard Light&quot; or the emotional &quot;Two Out of Three Ain't Bad&quot; to &quot;All Revved Up With No Place to Go,&quot; Bat Out Of Hell is my favorite and a must-own for those enjoy fine quality music.
0761536434|5.0|Steve Kent's book truly is the \\"Ultimate\\" history of video games. I was not bored once and kept finding myself craving more with each passing page. I bought The Ultimate History of Video Games primarily to learn about Atari, Commodore, and Nintendo in the 1980s, a time from which I have many fond video game memories, but no real knowledge of the industry and the people behind it. What I received was a book that easily met my expectations and provided so much more. From the beginnings of Pinball (which Kent actually makes a very interesting read) to the launch of the Playstation 2 and the development of the Gamecube and X-Box, this book has it all.<br />I assumed that I already knew a lot about the 1990s video game industry. I WAS WRONG. There is a ton of information in this book. Pick you subject, person, or game system and they are probably in here and you will almost definitely learn something you didn't know, even if you are an expert on a particular subject. Thank you Steve Kent!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Here's a tip.  Watch this film late at night (but not too late as it demands your full attention), turn down the lights (perhaps light some candles, unplug the phone and be prepared to be taken on an amazing heartrending journey.  Does it all make sense the first viewing? No. Does it lessen the experience? Not in the slightest. <br />Like many of the reviewers here I am baffled by the films weak release in the theaters. I do think it was marketed ineffectively.  The trailer was limp, the posters lackluster, the release limited, before a lively buzz could get started it was gone from the theaters etc...  I would have loved to see this film on &quot;the big screen&quot;.  Nonetheless, I do think we will be seeing this film becoming a midnight classic at town theaters.  It's that cult, it's that classic.
B000002G0P|5.0|As a Christ oriented album, I like III Sides alot!  Extreme isn't the best band, but for Christian themed music this is hard to beat! The first song is probably the only one I don't like, the rest are really good, and the last four are the best in my opinion.  The writing is really good, the vocals are fair, and the guitars are very good.  It's almost a concept album, with the last four songs going together in an almost mini-opera style. This has to be the high point line in the whole album, &quot;Am I ever going to change, will I always stay the same, Say one thing and  I do the other, same old song goes on forever&quot;.  Any one trying to follow Christ will be able to relate!
B00005QZ7U|1.0|This is a movie you either love or hate.  I hated it!  It was just plain stupid.
6304779607|3.0|This isn't a good film,it isnt a bad film either though.<BR>It's another example of a studio releasing a bad movie with a big star in it,and hoping no one will notice how poor it is.<BR>The plot is average,and the acting isn't great.Stallone is the only thing that makes this film worth watching.With some good one liners and some good fight sequences,it's worth watching if you're a stallone fan,if not,look elsewhere.
B000002572|5.0|One of of the top ten Rock albums of all time! It will never wear out its welcome. Plainly stated It's a masterpiece.  I never get sick of listening to it and never will. These guys deserve to be in the Hall of Fame just on the merits of this album alone.
B0000399WI|5.0|The basic plot of this movie has been done many times, but never so well. Shawshank Redemption is the story of a quiet accountant named Andy Dufrane who is convicted and sentenced to life in prison for the murder of his wife and her lover. The story takes place in Shawshank prison, where Andy must learn to defend himself from violent guards, and prisoners who take a more-than-friendly interest in him. However, these are only minor points in the plot, which focuses on the development of a unique friendship between Andy and a fellow prisoner named Red. Red is the prison bookie, but he also specializes in bringing in goods from the outside \\"for a small fee\\". The two first meet when Andy requests an uncommon item: a rock hammer, used to shape precious stones. <BR>    Some say this movie is long and slowly-paced. I can't say I noticed. Perhaps this movie is slow compared to the average prison movie (which usually involves many murders and large-scale prison riots), but a faster pace would destroy the emotional context of the film. One of the major themes of Shawshank Redemption is \\"A man will do almost anything to keep his mind occupied in prison.\\" That point wouldn't come across in a fast-paced movie.<BR>   To me, everything about this film is great. It's brilliantly cast, has wonderful characters, and comes with a beautiful score to set the mood.  The plot is interesting and realistic, and the dialogue is fascinating. It also has plenty of humor to offset the sad/depressing events. I wouldn't recommend it to an adrenaline junkie, but for everyone else it's a must-see movie.
B000060P79|5.0|I bought this CD on a suggestion from my friend.  It's been in my stereo ever since.  The true to life lyrics, catchy melodies, and musical talent all combine to form a great record.  The everyday angst and struggles of many a teen are captured on this record.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes lyrics they can identify which...I'm guessing that would be most people.
B00005NW02|5.0|This CD is totally awesome.  If you are a fan of hard rock this is the CD for you.  At first it took me awhile to actually enjoy it, but after listening to a couple of the songs I was hooked.  The guitar on some of these songs, such as \\"Bounce\\", \\"Chop Suey!\\", and \\"Prison Song\\" have a great beat.  My favorite songs, besides the ones I've already mentioned, are \\"X\\" and \\"Shimmy\\" and the rest of the songs are great too.  I bought this CD with some doubt in mind, but after hearing it I really love this CD and its up with my top favs.  The lyrics (which totally rock), the guitar, and their voices combined make up an awesome package.  Buy this CD and you WILL NOT be let down.
0140189378|4.0|This is a story about relationships and alienation.  It is a psychological work by Bellow, getting in the head of a man coming to grips with his mid-life failures.  It also shows his relationships with a tough love (or just tough?) father, and manipulative friends.  As you read it, you struggle between repulsion, sympathy and identification with the lead character. <br />The book is very accessible and easy to read given the intellectual pedigree of the author.  Even still, one is left at the end wondering, &quot;What did I miss?&quot;  While the reader may be left perplexed, it is a sign of the depth of material pushed into such a short novel.<br />I'm left thinking, &quot;It's a good, deep book&quot; - perhaps a more in tune reader would find it a great one.

B00005JKQX|5.0|Great movie and Russel Crowe was outstanding. He made the movie...without him the movie wouldn't have been as good as it was.
0385484518|5.0|This is without a doubt an honest and candid look at the very essence of life and human interaction.<br />Albom writes beautifully and so eloquently - the words just flow right off the page!<br />I found it very hard to put the book down - it was almost like being there and being a part of the conversations that took place between teacher and student.<br />Life is too precious to waste - it made me wake up to this and make very day count!<br />Everyone should read this and give a copy to a dear friend.
B00004XQ83|5.0|After seeing the movie over a year ago I was stunned by the brilliance of the theme of the movie. A take-off on Homer's Odyssey and the music accompaning it.I have been playing the C.D. as though obsessed , much to the annoyance of my wife,ever since.Some how the faces of the actors are burned into my mind along with the tunes seemingly coming from their mouths.It is seldom a movie and soundtrack will leave you with such a great feeling ,which I, am inadequate to describe.
B00005N919|4.0|My wife and I enjoyed the original and still own it as well as this special edition. By now you must know that the packaging includes an ice pick shaped pen and a block-of-ice-like case - the only problem here is that there is no \\"spine\\" on the case so it doesn't read like other DVDs while it is in our library. I enjoy the little extra stuff - it kind of thickens the experience of owning the film. If you like this kind of thing you'd probably enjoy the packaging for the directors cut of Manhunter as well. <br />The film: While the original had an edgy quality this version really allows us to observe Michael Douglas' journey into the dark side with more clarity and at times biting visuals. The sex scene with Jeannie Tripplehorn in the original had a sexy quality while this version shows us it borders on a violent rape.  As a matter of fact all of the sex scenes are more graphic and titillating and in a way, the viewer is drawn down Michael Douglas' path in the same way he is - \\"I know we shouldn't go there, but it looks so devilishly inviting.\\" The film is now a bit dated but still comes across well enough to be enjoyed a few more times.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Leave it to Pixar to create, besides another blockbuster, a really touching story. In the grand tradition of Toy Story 2 and its predecessor and A Bug's Life, Pixar and Disney's fourth collaboration doesn't disappoint.  Mike and Sulley are, what else?  Monsters!!  They work in a factory where each monster is assigned a door leading to a child's bedroom.  Their job is to scare the child and collect the kids' screams.  When one child, \\"Boo\\", crosses over to the monsters' side, Sulley befriends her and learns the importance of friendship, love, and hope.  For you snifflers, bring extra tissues.  Not only is the movie phenomenal, this DVD is packed full of goods.  Looks like Pixar has delivered once again.  I can't wait to see what Disney and Pixar cook up for their next meal.
0440234743|3.0|The Testament is primarily about Nate O'Riley's (a lawyer whose career has gone sour due to his alcoholism) 'adventure' in locating the sole heir to an $11b inheritance.  Little has been said about Rachel (the heir) & little has been seen about her.  However, her presence hovers & influences not only Nate's faith but mine as well.  For those who have already read the book, we all know what happened to the money.  For those who are about to read the book---well, what happened was really unimaginable!<br />Similar to the The Street Lawyer, this lawyer-story has minimal courtroom scenes & centered on one's morality & faith.  However, what rendered The Testament more believable was Nate's struggle to overcome his weaknesses & fears. & although his life was converted (in some sort of way), it was not too outlandish (i.e. living in the Brazilian jungles.  But just like any Tom, Dick or Harry's, he continues to live in civiliization with all of its comforts, but only, 'modestly'.

B00005V9HH|4.0|Sure it's clever and tricky, sure Kevin Spacey gives a knock-out performance, sure the rest of the cast is solid and entertaining, but it just amazes me that not one viewer here recognizes, or is willing to admit to, the vast cheat this film plays on its audience. Oh yeah, the revelation at the end is a complete surprise, and for a moment, the shock elevates the movie, but once you start to let reason enter in, you realize that everything else that has gone before in this story has been rendered utterly meaningless. You get involved in characters for ninety minutes, then discover you didn't really know them at all. Then my question to the viewer is: what is the point of the story? That a good story-teller can make time pass quickly? Come on. Many films with great surprise endings work within the story to shed new light on what has gone before (Sixth Sense, Memento), but his one completely throws out everything else in the movie, and says, &quot;Nyah, nyah, fooled you, and you sat there and listened to the whole thing!&quot; <br />It's a highly entertaining film, don't get me wrong. It has a great crime story and strong actors letting it all hang out, especially Gabriel Byrne as the one crook who finally figures out what's going on, but don't pretend that the ending is some brilliant twist. If you want to fall into the world of a story, you have to trust that it's a real world, and not one existing solely in the mind of one character. They could have  just as easily had a space ship swoop in at the end and scoop up Verbal, and it would have made just as much sense.
B00003CY5J|5.0|the acting is top notch and the direction was at the same peak when the movie is at full speed.

B000002I99|5.0|Alice Cooper is a composite of vaudeville, old horror movies, EC Comics, and rock 'n' roll. He was the first American rock star to wear theatrical makeup and among the first to incorporate elaborate props and wild antics into his act. Up until that time, no one had incorporated these things to the degree that Alice did, and he has yet to be equaled! The typical Alice show of the 70's might include a live boa constrictor, gallows and guillotines, dancing skeletons, giant monsters, straight jackets and a lot of spooky music.<br />That spooky music is just the point, for if any living entertainer embodies the spirit of Halloween, it is Alice Cooper. With his long black hair and black greasepaint dripping down his cheeks, his black leather clothing and tall boots, Alice paints the perfect picture of a rock 'n' roll ghoul. Not content to simply sing songs about breaking up with a girl and inevitably getting back together with her, Alice croons his way through such uniquely thematic songs as \\"Dead Babies,\\" \\"Sick Things,\\" \\"Skeletons in the Closet,\\" \\"Tag You're It\\" and \\"I Love the Dead.\\" Just by the titles alone you can see that these are not typical rock songs, but don't think Alice is merely being disgusting or violent--his songs are actually done with the class and charm of the old Universal horror movies of the 30's and 40's. Sure, there's some good old-fashioned rebelliousness, but his music is playful rather than violent, like a campfire ghost story.<br />The greatest Halloween album ever recorded is Alice Cooper's \\"Welcome To My Nightmare.\\" It was his first solo album after the breakup of his original band, and his chance to make the wildest, most eerie album ever. Not unlike the Christmas music you pull out every year after Thanksgiving, \\"Welcome to My Nightmare\\" is a perennial Halloween album chock full of Halloween...carols.<br />The title song begins the album with a whispery invitation to sample some of the disturbing images in Alice's haunted toy box. The songfeatures creepy guitar work by Dick Wagner and Steve Hunter and ends with a rousing fanfare of horns welcoming you into the nightmare.<br />Next up is \\"Devil's Food,\\" about the Devil getting ready for a hot date-or maybe a hot meal. As the song winds down Alice treats us to a monologue by Vincent Price, a full eight years before Mr. Jackson would do the same on his \\"Thriller\\" album. He portrays a museum curator with an obsession with spiders. This leads us right into \\"The Black Widow,\\" Alice's Spider King who demands that we love him or be devoured.<br />The next three songs, \\"Some Folks,\\" \\"Department of Youth\\" and \\"Only Women Bleed,\\" aren't particularly macabre, but they are fun songs that add musical diversity to the album. \\"Only Women Bleed\\" was Alice's first ballad and would mark the beginning of a string of melancholy hits throughout the rest of the seventies. Some Folks is a nice little Broadway kick-line number about anger, pain and violence. Department of Youth is a pre-teen ballad about kids running the world-a nightmarish thought if ever there was one!<br />The chilling mood returns with \\"Cold Ethyl,\\" probably the most upbeat song about necrophilia ever written. \\"One thing I miss is Cold Ethyl and her skeleton kiss...We met last night making love by the refrigerator light.\\" When Alice sang this song in concert in Los Angeles one summer, the girls in front of me got up and left. If \\"Cold Ethyl\\" doesn't liven up your Halloween party, nothing will.<br />\\"Long Ago,\\" \\"Stephen\\" and \\"The Awakening\\" form a story about a little boy (or is he a great big man?) with some sort of multiple personality disorder who can't figure out why all his friends are gone, all his toys are broken and people keep dying, until...well, buy the album and see for yourself. \\"The Awakening\\" is one of the coolest punch-lines to an album I've ever heard.<br />\\"Escape\\" closes out the album and is about just that, escaping from the nightmare. Because Alice at heart is basically a sweet guy all his stories have happy endings and \\"Welcome to My Nightmare\\" is no exception. In the end we wake up and wipe the cobwebs from our eyes and realize that we are back in the daytime world. Don't worry; we can get back to the nightmare if we need to. After all aren't nightmares just a way to escape from our sometime mundane lives? Isn't that what Halloween is all about? We love to put on our makeup and escape from our 9 to 5 existence at least once a year.<br />Alice Cooper may be about as scary as a ten-year old in a Halloween mask, but he's also just as playful and exuberant. If you want music that captures the flavor and fun of Halloween, don't waste your money on a sound effects album. Pick up \\"Welcome to My Nightmare\\" and play it loud at your next Halloween party. <br />Don't wait for Halloween though, get it now and play it every day! I think you're gonna like it. Get it before it gets you.

0452282152|5.0|I loved this story. It was captivating, interesting and highly informative. I learnt so much about Delft, the history and the lifestyle of those times. I was fascinated by the discussion around light, the paints, the models and the moods. Having viewed the Vermeer exhibition in London last year, I now wish that I'd read this book before then. It would have meant appreciating the paintings so much more.

0679805273|5.0|This book has been the inspiration to most children at my age. It was the basic founding and principle for understanding about differences with the youth of our time. It shows that there are hardships in life, and not everything is perfect from a child's eyes. It really does tell the truth and expose the meaningless words our parents told us when were younger children. Being 17 now, there is a positive outlook on life based on this book. That's why it will always be my favorite.
B000000OUE|5.0|Everyone's heard of Rob Zombie. You know, the OTHER famous solo metaller besides the Ozzman, that's still around. Well, this is where he learned the ropes. White Zombie's(the band Rob used to be in) Astro Creep 2000 is a fun-filled ride through the fun side of heavy music. This album is a fine work of industrial metal, which laid a lot of groundwork down along with Psalm 69, The Downward Spiral, and Demanufacture. \\"More Human Than Human\\" is the obvious hit single, with its simple bassline and awesome slide guitar. Other works are \\"Super-Charger Heaven,\\" a fun campy song blazing along at locomotive pace; \\"I, Zombie,\\" with its great chorus line; \\"Creature Of The Wheel,\\" for its all-out heavyness; and \\"Real Solution #9,\\" another nice rocker straight out of the Ministry songbook. All in all, the album's good fun, with slightly perturbing artwork and the Zombie seal-enough to make this not a masterpiece, nor a classic but a milestone in industrial metal as we know and love it today. Pick this up along with La Sexorcisto and Zombie's solo stuff.
B00005QIPH|2.0|Hooray for the Strokes -- they have an impressive record and CD collection.  They also have the ways and means to record a bunch of derivative songs saluting the likes of the Jam, Buzzcocks, Lou Reed/Velvet Underground, Television, etc.  And sure, the songs themselves are toe-tappers.  No argument with that.  The problem with &quot;Is This It&quot; is that their influences do the Strokes a million times better.  So I guess I appreciate the work of Richard Hell much more these days.  For that I thank the Strokes.<br />The Strokes wear their influences on their collective sleeve -- so what.  Good for them.  Oasis did the same thing and sold a lot of records in the process.  Like everyone else dating all the way back to Elvis, all the Strokes really want is to be rock stars.  God bless 'em.  So I suppose they are AFFIRMING rock n' roll, if not exactly saving it.  They do have a great P.R. guy, though.<br />As long as the Strokes don't become egomaniacal jerks expounding on what's wrong with the music scene and how their music alone is the only kind that matters, I'll have no problems with their existence as a band.  In fact, I may even buy another Strokes album.  That statement alone bumps this album up to two stars.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Very faithful to the book and simply an Amazing movie. It's based on J.K. Rowling's Popular books, it's about a Orphaned Boy who is actully a Wizard and is sent to a special School where he<BR>gets training for a year to become a full fledge Wizard. It's such a brilliant and visual triumph which will be a classic in the Fantasy hall of fame with: \\" The Dark Crystal\\", \\" The Wizard of Oz\\", \\" Labyrinth\\", \\" The Princess Bride\\", \\" Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Rings\\", \\" The Neverending Story\\", \\" Conan The Barbarian\\" and \\" The Last Unicorn.\\"<br />A must see! but it may scare children under 7.
B00005JKED|4.0|I came away from watching this film feeling like I've been slapped in the face until numb; it keeps coming at you with such savage disregard for your petty little sensibilities, all the while tearing Ethan Hawke a new one.<br />Unlike '24' which, while a novel idea, is harder to swallow in regards to continuity, 'Training Day' unfolds nicely, going from how-ya-don' to JAYSUS! in the course of 2 hours.<br />Denzels performance was surprising. He manages to hold on to a little nobility even when he's at his sleaziest (note the way he scruffs his boys head during a 'break'). But make no mistake; his character is the worst kind of S.O.B., wrapping his criminal behavior up in flimsy justifications. It reminds me of New York in the 70's. When I was a kid, the cops had no problem just busting into our building &quot;looking for someone&quot;, lining up the usual suspects against a radiator and bashing thier knees in until they fell to the ground and then rifling through thier pockets for money. Denzel reminded me of them, the way they hid thier actions behind a badge.<br />Lastly, you never know which way Ethan's going to go at the end, and that's life isn't it?<br />All in all, a very good film that brings back a lot of bad memories.
B00000BKDW|5.0|This cd is unbelievable. It has more solos and riffs than any of their other cds and i love the heavy sound. This is a very close contest with The Number of the Beast and I think if I had to choose between those to listen to an album forever I would choose this one just plainly because the songs are longer and they tire more slowly. Below are their grades.<br />Aces High- was my favorite but soon became my least favorite just because it one of the shortest and the easiest to get into..which means it soon got old to me - B<br />2 Minutes to Midnight- one of the best on the album. It has a great chorus, a great solo, and great vocals and lyrics.- A<br />Losfer Words- took awhile to get into but then it really struck me. The worst of their instrumentals though.- B<br />Flash of the Blade- crazy! I was expecting this to be a ho hum normal song but this is awesome, especially the guitar playing in the middle.- A<br />Duellist- another great song that is 2/3 instrumental. Sounds similar to Losfer Words and beats it even though it gets the same grade.- A-<br />Back in the Village- one that gets stuck in my head but I think theres something missing in this song.- B+<br />Powerslave- for some reason it never captivated me until the instrumental part.But that part is memorable.- A-<br />Rime of the Ancient Mariner- unbelievable. This is what an epic is all about.- A<br />I got this cd and Piece of Mind both at the same time for Christmas and this does beat out that. To me this has little to no filler which I cant say about Piece of Mind. The Number of the Beast also I think beats out Piece of Mind but a true fan shold buy all three because they are the core of Iron Maiden. Even if you dont like Iron maiden this album will change you. 10/10
B00005QG9J|5.0|This is a sweet CD. Incubus is a great band because they make quality CDs. Theres no throw away tracks here. No tracks really stick out above the rest on the album, which is good, because then you listen to the whole album, not just a few tracks. All the songs blend nicely, and lead into each other. I almost feel guilty when I stop this CD, because it feels like Im leaving a performance in the middle. Buy this CD. Support Incubus so we can keep getting these [great] CDs!
B00000IP4H|5.0|I have to say...I am a huge fan of testament now...I heard their stuff before but never actually owned one of their CDs. I got this album and was absolutely blown away by the ripping/thrashing tones of the guitar and bass...the opening song just makes you bang your head so damn hard all the way until the end. Like I said I am not judging this album knowing the (old) testament...but now I am a true fan (of this cd) and EVERY METAL FAN SHOULD BUY THIS CD. I cannot believe the heaviness to this well oiled machine...and that is exactly what this band is a will oiled machine that just crushes your soul...<BR>I recommend this album to anyone who wants to really go to the heavier side. I too dislike death metal..but this isn't..this is borderline...you can actually understand what he is saying...DEFINATELY PURCHASE THIS ITEM
B000063CMK|5.0|Along with many others, I was disappointed to learn that Pain of Salvation's fourth album would not be the continuation of The Perfect Element story, which began with part I in 2000. Instead, we get Remedy Lane, a stunningly powerful and convoluted semi-story that is emotionally fatiguing in its intense pathos. Pain of Salvation has crafted a masterpiece here, perhaps one greater than The Perfect Element Part I. The band's original music and emotional performances are more powerful than ever. I'm not making any real objective statement here...it's just that I feel more drawn to this album than any of the band's previous works (which are all good, if not great).<br />Remedy Lane is another theme album (like One Hour by the Concrete Lake), this time about various forms of reconciliation. There is a roughly defined story, but it is fairly disjointed and the album mainly deals with different issues tied to the theme. Mainly it seems to cover the challenges of relationships and the connection between love and sex (you can have sex without love, and love without sex). It touches on tragedies like a miscarriage (\\"A Trace of Blood\\"), attempted suicide (\\"Rope Ends\\"), and a simple broken heart (\\"Second Love\\"). It's not all sad, though. There's some happier subjects like simple romance (\\"This Heart of Mine\\") and an obscure hint in the dark \\"Beyond the Pale\\" that two people can make each other better.<br />I am in the minority that thinks Gildenlow is not an amazing vocalist, but his performance on this album _is_ amazing. Mainly, this is because he no longer mistakes melissima for emotion, which always annoyed me before (I know I know...I'm demented). He conveys much less melodrama through his singing on this album, which really makes the emotions sound more natural and convincing, as if Gildenlow has improved as an \\"actor.\\" He just gets better and better: the barely controlled pain of \\"Undertow\\"; the vicarious hopelessness of \\"Rope Ends\\"; the heartbreaking \\"A Trace of Blood\\". Since the emotional power of Pain of Salvation's music is so very closely tied to Gildenlow's singing, this improvement is critically important.<br />Just like always, Pain of Salvation's unique brand of music is refreshingly...fresh! \\"Fandango\\" weaves staccato guitar, bass lines and eddying pianos through odd patterns. \\"A Trace of Blood\\" is a fast, powerful mix of twisting piano run, heavy riffing, strange vocal accents, scratching guitar (?) effects, and tragic chorus. Eight-minute songs don't usually go by so fast. \\"Rope Ends\\" works heavy guitars through hypnotizing time signatures without being awkwardly technical. \\"Undertow\\" is initially understated sonically with a weird recording technique -- almost sounds like they put the microphones in the opposite end of the room or something. It erupts into a crippling outburst of emotional power (isolated and captured by vocals & instruments), suggesting suppressed emotions breaking free. \\"Remedy Lane\\" is a quick instrumental that reintegrates themes from previous songs with unusual keyboard effects. \\"Chain Sling\\" features melodies based on Swedish folk music (actually, that seems trendy these days). \\"Beyond the Pale\\" is the engaging finale, deceptively simple at face value but very involved texturally, with complex melody shifts. Unfortunately, I don't think this song ends the album with the powerful finale it deserves, and the vocals are awkward in places.<br />And even when the songs are \\"normal\\" they remain strong, showing that the band can tackle any format. \\"Second Love\\" is an understated, melancholic acoustic/electric mix, with Gildenlow's pained vocals rousing an image of a lonely night under the stars. The lyrics smell like an 80s love ballad, but it works, you know? (Interestingly, the song was written about 15 years ago, so it _was_ an 80s love ballad, hehe.) Another ballad, \\"This Heart of Mine\\", stands out with its powerful middle section and affectionate chord structures. \\"Dryad of the Woods\\" is a beautiful instrumental with pastoral acoustic guitar melodies befitting the title. I love the piano melody on this one, heh. What can I say? I'm a sucker for nice little piano bits.<br />Even the recording quality is great...there's none of that grievous lack of clarity that impaired some of the heavily textured sections on The Perfect Element Part I. There's a lot going on in Remedy Lane's songs, but you can hear everything. Plus, you can gain appreciation for a whole new level of nuance in this recording through headphones. Even the booklet for this album is great, with elaborate artwork and twisted imagery.<br />Remedy Lane is another album that captures Pain of Salvation's creative magic. The band's fans are pretty energetic, so most of them have probably bought this disc by now. If not, well, they'd better have a good reason not to have it!

B00003CXXO|1.0|Artificial Intelligence comes across to me not like a movie in the usual sense. To me it was more like Spielberg spending 2-1/2 hours worshipping what little is left of his creativity. And why is this clunker so excruciatingly long? Simply because Spielberg couldn't figure out how to end the thing. As a modern rehash of the old Pinocchio myth, Artificial Intelligence is a complete flop. The special effects are interesting (thank God for special effects!) but Spielberg spoils the fun by applying a thick layer of cheap sentimentality to everything in sight. Haley Joel Osment is incapable of doing anything other than whining and making spaniel eyes at everybody. The single bright spot is provided by Jude Law who sparkles in his role as a sex worker robot. Who should see this movie? If you are among those who think that drug store greeting cards provide interesting reading, you should definitely see Artificial Intelligence. All others should stay away.
0385503954|5.0|Atonement could possibly go down as one of the best English novel in the 21st century and this will not be an overstatement. The novel is of average length but yet so much was conveyed -- love, jealousy, foolishness, brutality, and of course atonement. The novel itself feels epic because of the scope covered -- from the idlyllic countryside lives of the Tallis' family to war-ravaged France and Britain, and finally to England right before the 21st century.<br />The central character of the novel is Briony Tallis who, on one hot summer night, committs a crime out of jealousy and foolishness to the hero Robbie Turner. From that day onwards, the lives of Briony, her sister Cecilia, and Robbie are forever altered. Briony attempts to make amends for her mistake but the outbreak of war made it difficult if not impossible.<br />It's difficult to describe any more without spoiling it for readers. The ending was shocking and sad but ultimately necessary for Briony to atone for her actions on that fateful hot summer day.
1577311523|5.0|I've brushed along this topic in several books. One of the more notable ones is \\"A Course in Miracles\\" which was difficult to decipher.  Learning to live in the present is a fantastic and difficult thing to fathom.  Many people will say it is easy, we do that daily, but we do not.  Tolle brings this to the light. Most of us tend to live in the past where we harbor resentment, anger and many negative and not so negative emotions.  On the same token we often live in the future, as we set goals or fantasize about how great (or dreadful) `tomorrow' will be.<br />\\"The Power of Now\\" is simple and easy to understand. Tolle covers every aspect of human emotion and the how and why of our thinking process.  His question/answer style gives a glimpses into the many questions he has been asked over the years.  Many of them practical and he has managed to combine them in one book in a way that one question leads to the next.  Of course he gives us full and practical answers.<br />We all crave peace, and look for a variety of ways to obtain it.  We may do this trough relationships, sex, drugs or organized religion.  Tolle shows us that the peace we crave does not come from any outside influences but it comes from within, it comes from the present.<br />There is no sadness, anger, anxiety or fear in the present. All that is in the present is the now.<br />I have been practicing his techniques, but have yet to master them.  This is a very difficult thing for our conditioned minds to accept.  But every now and then I manage to grab a piece of the `now' pie, and the feeling of peace overwhelms me.<br />This is by far the most thorough book I have read to date on this topic.  Tolle is truly on to something.
B000003BDJ|3.0|Well, time to put my views into this age-old debate. One star was taken away for the Stones being horribly over-rated. The other one was for the horribly misogynistic songs on it (did I spell that right?).<br />They both started out putting out hit singles and copying the styles of 50's bands. The albums were thrown together with a lot of covers. During this period the Stones were better, cause the Beatles were making like the Spice Girls of the 60s.<br />Then they both started writing all their songs for a period of three albums each, without the albums being too terribly amazing. There were good songs on Help! and good songs on Aftermath. The Stones were ahead, but just barely. Meanwhile the Beatles start to create the Music Video (but we can forgive them for letting MTV exist)<br />Then comes the classic period of both bands, where the Beatles pull ahead. The invent the concept album, go where no rock band has gone before with orchestras and all that with Sgt Peppers. The Stones develop their own style.<br />The Beatles break up, the Stones start putting out incredibly mediocre albums.<br />SCORE:<br />Beatles: Created Concept Album and Music Video. Put out six classic albums (Rubber Soul, Revolver, Sgt Pepper, Magical Mystery Tour, White Album, Abbey Road), plus there were some classic solo albums (All Things Must Pass, Imagine, Plastic Ono Band). One horrible misogynistic song (Run for Your Life - John hated it too)<BR>Rolling Stones: Put out four classic albums (Beggars Banquet, Let it Bleed, Sticky Fingers, Exile on Main Street). Put out like twenty or so fillertastic albums, while the Beatles only have six of those (Let it Be was ruined by uneven production, leaving good songs off in room for bad songs, and the fact that the Beatles were at each others throats) Had an albums worth of horribly misogynistic songs (Everything from Heart of Stone to Brown Sugar). Still around today, even though Keith said that he'd kill himself if he was still playing Satisfaction when he was 40. He's 50, at least<br />CONCLUSION: The Rolling Stones had some good songs, sure, but the Beatles were better. In fact, most bands of the era were better. Try some of The Who, Bob Dylan, Jefferson Airplane, the Doors, or Country Joe and the Fish. Stick to Stones hit collections, like this one. Even if you still have to hear their extreme sexism from time to time on it. Personally, I burn CDs of the Stones songs I like, which is a surprising amount given this review.
1878424505|5.0|I have been reading self-enlightment, the nature of reality,  psychology, and books about religion, etc., etc., since I was about 14 years old.  I am now 51. Don Miguel Ruiz's books are very truthful and simplify how one looks at the illusions of this 3 dimensional world we live in.  Everyone is on different levels of consciousness.  Some people will find this book helpful and fruitful; some people may not like the book at all.  It is all in what you need or what you are ready for.  The Four Agreements are simple, positive rules to live by in one's life.  Maybe they are too simple for some people.  Everyone is different.  I, myself, really liked it because it confirmed or reinforced alot of my previous ideas about how I live my life.

0345448898|5.0|When I was flicking through a book catalogue, like some silly little moth I was immediately attracted to the 'pretty' cover of Northern Lights (Golden Compass for Americans), and so it is fair to say 'judge a book by its cover'. Little did I know I would be entranced by the consistent brilliance of His Dark Materials. Not only are the characters and settings the most exotic ever seen in a book (forget Hogwarts) but it has real meaning, the only book I've ever read to make me laugh, cry, shiver with suspense, and genuinely think. For many days after reading the final chapter YOU will ponder on the meaning of HDM, which seemingly has no definitive 'message'.<br /> Easily the greatest book ever written (in my biased opinion. But I have read some other classics- If you really like fine details of HDM you'll love Lord of the Rings).
B00005U16N|5.0|This has got to be one of the best movies in a while. I have no idea why this was not nominated for anything at the Oscars. Everyone gives great performances. It was just a great movie, and I really enjoyed it. This film is based on a true story.<br />George Jung was a man who made many huge mistakes in his life that cost him dearly. It is very sad to see his life gradually ruin. He is supposed to get out of jail in the year 2015, as the movie tells us just before the end credits roll. <br />An anti-drug movie that surely does get it's message across. Highly Recommended.

B00005JKJA|5.0|let me start by saying: A) for the record, i am a big lynch fan, and B) i understand that people are gonna think whatever they want about him and his work. that said, i thought this was a good sturdy lynch production. BUT... i would have rather seen it as it was intended. i think at times the tv-ness showed through, but you can't fault david for that. i DO however fault him for sticking to some pretty typical lynch subject matter. its like \\"hey gang, im gonna make lost highway, then throw you off my scent with straight story, then basically do lost highway part 2\\". don't get me wrong, it's a good film, and there are some things that will grab your nuts, as far as \\"wow, lynch never tackled THAT before\\". BUT, like i said before, this WAS to be a TV SHOW. so buyer beware. you will be in for a very strong lynch product, but you'll feel slightly cheated if you're expecting something as bold and daring as twin peaks. oh, and by the way, all the obvious reviews that start out like \\"i didn't get it\\"... seriously, it's lynch. he doesn't do ron howard films. on top of that i can't see how, at this point, he can be THAT unpredictable to people. he's basically making the same movie over and over again. it just happens to be a good one.
0385505833|3.0|...turn off your brain and enjoy!  If you don't think about  this book too hard, it's an entertaining piece of fluff.  If you enjoy books with depth and reasoning, you'd do best to avoid Skipping Christmas.  The idea is a good one, but is not a fully realized one...as is the problem of many Grisham books.  I didn't hate the read...but it wasn't very memorable.  It'll make a great movie...and yes, a movie is already in the works.  Hey, it's got to be better than that &quot;Grinch&quot; movie!

B00004TA41|4.0|Accompanied only by drummer Rasheed Ali, John Coltrane takes his experimenting to dizzying heights with \\"Interstellar Space.\\" This is as stripped down as it gets, yet it's in this format that Coltrane seems to draw some of his most interesting inspiration. I bought this not just because I'm a fan of Coltrane and all of his beautiful accomplishments, but also on the recommendation of several friends, who insisted this one of his best works.<br />This won't take \\"A Love Supreme\\" off my favorite Coltrane list, but it's definitely high up there. This is wonderful stuff, for people who aren't afraid to try new things.
B00005T7I1|5.0|Just finished buying the DVD of \\"Dick Tracy\\" and I must say that I loved it even more than when I saw it in a theatre. The colors are truly striking and I absolutely loved Madonna's \\"Monroesque\\" performance. She was wonderful in this but then Beatty has assembled quite a cast (although you can hardly recognize them under all the latex). One minor quibble about the DVD is that there are no extras but the movie looks and sounds fantastic. I recommend it highly.
B00003CXTG|5.0|This movie was excellent and very emotional to watch.The screenplay was great and the action looked so real.
B000053VAF|5.0|This was definately one of the best movies I've ever seen; I've watched it about a million times.  I still laugh untill it hurts every time- a great buy in my eyes.  Although, if you don't like vulgur humor, it may not be right for you.
B00005V9L1|5.0|This is without a doubt the best film I saw this past year. Now, that might not seem like great praise in such a weak year, however it was meant to be. This film is hard to describe, because there is so much going on. Part drama, part science fiction, part romance, part horror and part comedy. A very ambitious project and you cannot help but respect that.<br />The story centers around a very intelligent high school student named Donnie Darko. Donnie has what is described as \\"intimidating intelligence\\" and borderline schizophrenia. One night, Donny is summoned outside by a demonic rabbit. Later that night, an engine drops off of a jet and lands in Donnie's room. Had Donny been there, he would have been dead. Was he destined to die that night? The rabbit continues to visit Donny and give him instructions. Donny senses that his life is taking on dramatic changes. Donny starts to question fate and freewill. Was he destined to die that night or is there no such thing as fate? Is the rabbit real? Is he in fact going mad? Will the world end, like the rabbit tells him it will? I think that by trying to describe this film, I will confuse you, so I will stop. However, I will conclude by saying that this film ranks right up there with the best film debuts ever. The writing is intelligent and the direction expert. The film will challenge you to expand your mind and will stay with you for a long time. I think the film was marketed rather poorly. This is not \\"Final Destination,\\" but more like \\"Memento.\\" It also has a great soundtrack! Do yourself a favor and watch this film, do yourself a bigger favor and watch it twice, it will help.

B00005JKYS|5.0|\\"We Were Soldiers\\" is an excellent film, both entertaining and historically accurate.  It is an account of the US Army's 7th Cavalry during the battle of the Ia Drang Valley in Vietnam during 1965.  At the end of the film, most of the people in the theater I was in applauded!  Films like this are rare in hollywood.  Of course, many in hollywood have always been uncomfortable with the portrayal of communists as the enemy!  <br />This film is not in any way similar to \\"Apocalypse Now\\", or Oliver Stone's \\"Platoon\\".  In my mind it is in many ways similar to the excellent film \\"Zulu\\", with Stanley Baker and Michael Caine. <br />\\"We Were Soldiers\\" also reminds me of incidents described in Guy Sajer's classic account of combat on the Eastern Front, \\"The Forgotten Soldier\\".  Often heavily outnumbered German Army combat groups would fight off attacks by human waves of communist infantry.<br />\\"We Were Soldiers\\" is far superior to \\"Saving Private Ryan\\".  Spielberg's film had realistic carnage used with a fictional script, in a historical setting.  There were many historical and technical errors.  For example, Tom Hanks and his men clear their section of Omaha Beach in 24 minutes flat!  Of course, on June 6th 1944, it actually took 4 to 5 hours.  Also, the positions occupied by the defending units of the German Army 352nd Infantry division were actually much farther from the waters edge than was depicted by Spielberg.  The battle in the village near the bridge was really amazing, particularly the way the combat hardened veterans of the 2nd Waffen-SS Panzer Division blundered into an obvious Hollywood ambush.  When will the hollywood \\"Germans\\" ever learn!  I wonder where Spielberg dreamed up P-51 \\"tankbusters\\", or mortar bombs used as hand grenades?!<br />After I finish reading Col. Moore's book, I plan to see \\"We Were Soldiers\\" again.
B00005O5CM|4.0|To \\"Angelhrs\\" in Washington, LIGHTEN UP! You are taking this movie WAY too seriously! This movie is cute and funny, (ESPECIALLY the joke about gay guys knowing designers and straight guys not), and no other actress could have pulled this off the way Reese Witherspoon does. She was PERFECT casting!<BR>\\"Angelhrs,\\" your lack of spelling ability totally blew any credibility you might have had with me, and it's apparent that you wouldn't know what funny was if it bit you on the nose! Just because you happen to live in Washington, D.C. doesn't mean you can't have a sense of humor.<BR>To anyone who hasn't seen this movie, just ignore what \\"Angelhrs\\" has to say about it because if you put any stock in what SHE says, you'll be missing out on a cute, fun little movie. To those of you who HAVE already seen it, you know what I'm talking about.
0425074811|2.0|Come on people.  I only read this book because he is the classic example of bad archaeology at its best.  He only looks at a hand full of the evidence and makes up stories to fit it.  For example in this book, The pictures of pottery he has with Flying Saucers on there, he has admited to being [unreal].  <br />This book is is a sweeping attack on the memories and abilities of ancient peoples. Von Däniken claims that the myths, arts, social organizations, etc., of ancient cultures were introduced by astronauts from another world. He questions not just the capacity for memory, but the capacity for culture and civilization itself, in ancient peoples. Prehistoric humans did not develop their own arts and technologies, but rather were taught art and science by visitors from outer space.<br />Does this sound a little toooooooo [unbeliveable] for you.
0452282152|1.0|What's the big fuss about this book?  I think it's selling because of the beautiful art on the cover.  The story is just so predictable and so much like every other romantic story told.  Perhaps people like the accurate historical detail? I'm sure the general public couldn't tell if it was accurate anyway.
B000002JSJ|5.0|Jimmy Page has repeatedly said on many interviews over the years that that he was very fond of Presence, the seventh studio release from Led Zeppelin.  He was especially pleased with the intricate guitar work; the layering of guitars on Achilles Last Stand where as many as twelve guitars are playing at once.  Jimmy likes Presence very much and Jimmy is right.  <br />Led Zeppelin's Presence does not attain the commercial notarity as the fourth album or Physical Grafitti, but perhaps better than any Zeppelin release crystalizes what makes this band so incredible.  Presence is tight, creative, instense, emotional, and thoughtful.  It is the kind of album that a younger, raw Led Zeppelin could not have recorded.  While it packs just as much punch as Zep II or the fourth album, it is deeper and more complicated than any other release.  Any good garage band can muster up a cover version of Rock and Roll, Ramble On, or even Whole Lotta Love, but have them try to play Achilles Last Stand or Hots on For Nowhere and they will likely run for cover.  <br />While Zep has always played the blues as good or if not better than any rock and roll band, Tea For One may be their best blues song ever.  <br />John Lennon said &quot;give peace a chance.&quot;  This long time Zep fan says the same thing about Presence.  Give it a chance.  Give it time.  Some albums are like fine wine.  They get better over time and mature with age.  Presence does this.  It is a superb album.  <br />In June 1977 I saw Noboby's Fault But Mine performed live and it completely blew away the crowd of 70,000.  Presence, more so than any Zep album blows me away to this very day.
6305908648|4.0|This is a single disc DVD, taken from two nights. The running time is two hours. There is also a double CD version of this show that contains 3 more tracks. Video and sound quality are excellent. There is an option for stereo or 5.1 sound. The only special feature is printed words (not even a video interview) from Jon Lord explaining how he wrote the concerto.<br />The first songs of this show do not include any members of Deep Purple. It is the orchestra and guest vocalists doing some of the more recent Deep Purple songs. They are actually very interesting and sound better than the original studio versions. <br />Members of Deep Purple slowly join in the act. Finally when Ian Paice comes for Wring That Neck, the group is complete. The version of Wring That Neck is excellent. It is done as a quasi-blue grass number, but supported by an orchestra.<br />After Wring That Neck, the group goes into Concerto For Group and Orchestra. It is 55 minutes long. It is not much different than the original, except for some Steve Morse guitar solos. If you already have the original, this new version is not different enough to warrant buying this DVD.<br />On the final four tracks, Deep Purple comes out front, with the orchestra now in the background. There are some very nice guitar solos from Morse. <br />Most of this DVD consists of newer songs. Wring That Neck, Smoke on the Water, and Concerto are the only classic songs included. <br />Deep Purple started out as a pioneering cross between a progressive/art rock band and a hard rock band. Jon Lord was the leader and led the band in more an art rock direction. After 3 albums, they kicked out the original singer and bass player and replaced them with Glover and Gillian. Lord has his final art rock production, Concerto for Group and Orchestra, released in 1970. It wasn't the first time a rock group was backed by an orchestra, but it was the first for a hard rock band. This album did not do well, and that was the last of Deep Purple'sexperiments. After that, Ritchie Blackmore became more of an influence and the group moved to harder rock sound.<br />My favorite Deep Purple studio albums are the first three and In Rock, when they still had the progressive and innovative sound. But, they were their best live, on albums like Made in Japan and Live and Rare.
B00005JG6Q|4.0|Akira is definitely one of the best anime titles in existence, ranking up along with Ghost in the Shell, Robotech/Macross, Mononoke-Hime, and Neon Genesis Evangelion.  Like Ghost in the Shell and Neon Genesis Evangelion, there is quite a bit of philosophy involved with Akira; that philosophy is mixed with a great storyline and stunning animation shows the true power of anime beyond the standard glitz and fan service of titles such as Elf Princess Rane.  <br />The film is based upon the manga series of the same name.  However, those unfamiliar with the manga are likely to be rather confused at what appear to be key moments in the film.  At times, one action seems to follow another for no apparent reason.  <br />I purposely purchased this DVD to replace my worn-out VHS copy.  What I find truly novel with the DVD version is the ability to use the optional information capsules scattered throughout the film.  When the capsule icon (from Kaneda's jacket) is shown in the corner of the screen, pressing Play/Enter will show a translation of various signs and graffiti in the scene.  This feature alone helps to improve one's understanding of the film, even if unfamiliar with the manga series.  <br />However, the main reason I can only rate this a &quot;4&quot; is due to the DVD's incompatibility with the PlayStation2 console.  Unfortuantely, more and more anime DVDs in the States are incompatible with the PS2, and certainly some anime fans bought the PS2 for its games AND its DVD capabilities.  That such a high-ranking title in the (unofficial) anime canon is incompatible with such a high-profile gaming console with DVD capability is a true slap in the face to anime fans everywhere :-(
B00005V1Y0|5.0|This is a great movie that doesn't take itself too seriously.<BR>Rather than tell the plot or actors I would like to comment on other attributes. I bought a copy of this film on laserdisc 8 years ago and it has become the most watched film in my collection. Why, you might ask? As an owner of a home theater for years this movie contains one of the best soundtracks and some of the most visual stunning sceens that I have seen combined in a movie. If you haven't watched Strictly Ballroom on a good home theater system your missing half the fun. Due to the immenent extinction of the laserdisc format I have anxiously awaited for its release on DVD. I wasn't disappointed. The Dolby Digital soundtrack has one of the best mixes todate. The video is as clean as the laserdisc version. Not all is perfect; the skin tones at times can be attrocious due to set lighting, as was the case on the laserdisc, but when the lighting is correct it's a visual treat.
0440180295|5.0|This deserves every star I gave it.  The \\"and so it goes\\" after almost every death of anything has great meaning.  Vonnegut is refering to the fact that Billy is unstck in time and knows the past as well as the future.  Hes saying \\"so it goes\\" in connotation to the timeline.  Anybody who gave thius book under 5 or 4 stars should read it again.  Its a great book and when i finished the last page, realized this.  Read it!
B00005JKED|5.0|Ethan Hawke plays a rookie cop that is trying out for a position on Denzel's elite narcotics team.  Denzel is a criminal with the badge that abuses his police power in every possible way.  He steals, kills, and lies without flinching.  Throughout the day, Denzel keeps getting Ethan to do bad things, a little at a time.  Denzel tries to justify what he is preaching with an \\"ends justify the means\\" attitude.  This is of course a big load of garbage.  Denzel is just playing Ethan to take a drug wrap, if he can even survive the day.  The movie has complex characters and a good plot.  Denzel earned an Oscar for his performance.  In my opinion, Ethan deserved the Oscar over Denzel.  Ethan had the tougher role.  He showed a great deal of depth.  Denzel was just a fast talking crooked cop in this movie, but he nailed the part to a tee.
B00005RY7X|5.0|Remember the excess of the 80's?  No messages, no angst no meaning.  Pure entertainment!  The kind of music you would pop in to go out for the evening and get crazy with the boys and or girls.  Imagine if you put Poison, Cinderella, Whitesnake and a pinch of 90's edge in a blender without the cover on and hit frappe.  Andrew W.K. detractors need to lighten up.  Music is entertainment in its purest form.
1573226521|4.0|At first I was reluctant to read The Beach, because, frankly, the movie bites.  I was afraid the book would be the same.  But when I read it for an assignment, I was pleasantly suprised.  This is one of the best books I've read in a while.  I usually stick to romance like Sandra Brown, but I would read another Alex Garland book anyday.
B000063CPL|1.0|Well, it seems to me that Maiden is treating his fans like the more commercial artists always did....releasing compilation after compilation for the hardcore fans to buy, and always stating that &quot;this is our best work to date&quot;....<BR>This live CD has an almost unbeliavably bad choice of songs, considering its a two-CD set!! Tunes &quot;Iron Maiden&quot;, &quot;SAnctuary&quot;, &quot;THe Number of hte Beast&quot;, &quot;Run to The Hills&quot;, &quot;The Trooper&quot;, etc, are included once again. Theyre all great songs and are exactly what they played that night, but whats the reason to buy an album like this if youre already a Maiden fan? Certainly Maiden reasoned that a lot of people that were there that night in January, 2001, would like to buy the album...<BR>But ROCK IN RIO borns dead. Like their previous live albums, REAL LIVE ONE, REAL DEAD ONE and DONINGTON, Maiden live sounds so weak, the songs lose so much when comparing them to their studio versions, that ones ends up in diusgust. Most of the blame for this recurrent factor is the production by Steve Harris and the atrocious playing by Janick Gers. ROCK IN RIO is produced and mixed by Kevin SHirley, but it has Steve Harriss name as &quot;co-producer&quot;....<BR>All in all, this album is aimed just to earn some fast money and create some hype for their second studio album after the reunion, to be released in 2003. Clever guys, they are...
B000063CMK|5.0|This music is not about virtuosity and long, fast soloing, but Composition. All five men are really on the top and put up a good show, though we know that Daniel Gildenlöw is the Brain. I have to emphasize the magnificient work of the drummer and the keyboardist. Its wonderful how Daniel is playing with his voice in a whole spectre from murmuring to those rare moments when he lets it fly high. The music is lacking real heavy moments as well its not about revolutionary innovation (whats more, sometimes its not richer than a better Bon Jovi song), but still this is one of the finest works of recent times. By the way I cannot consider it progressive metal since its neither progressive nor heavy in the way of f.e. Dream Theater, the doyen of the genre. But the small tricks, some crazy riffs and tricky rhythms make it stunning enough! The epic last track made me recall Diary Of A Madman of Ozzy Osbourne and well, its not a bad reference.<br />    In the centre there are relations, pleasure and pain, finding and losing, love thats life unbound, and death, too, seeking the way and searching the truth. Daniels mind is becoming something like an opened book, and the words may become a mirror for us. A real emotionful and feelingful album, Romantic in its best way of sense like that is the epic works of Liszt and Sibelius. Concerning my nationality it is especially appealing to me that Budapest and Hungary is a very important location in the songs. But dont be afraid over the sea: this is a universal and timeless work.
6305841861|5.0|This movie may at first seem like another gore galore horror film like dead alive among others, but infact is a very sophisticated horror comedy. But don't get me wrong this isn't just a comedy it does have shocks and scares through out the movie as well as humor that can be deranged at times it seems. I loved this movie because of the perfect blend of humor and horror its not a movie spoof like a scary movie which have no plot, no thought, and nothing to do really with horror. Also I thought the gore was excellently done in this movie, every special gore effect among the numerous other effects are done very well. I'd say if you are looking for a good gore movie with plenty of humor and scares this is the movie for you!
B000002ADT|5.0|Miles Davis, in what is quite possibly the greatest jazz album ever recorded, delivers. Largely. The lineup of artists appearing on this album with Miles is an all-star group in itself: Adderley, Coltrane, Evans, Kelly, Chambers and Cobb could put out this album by themselves and still make it into the top albums ever. <BR>     The CD opens with a slow and dreamy introduction, Paul Chambers on bass and Bill Evans on piano in a light and airy interplay. Chambers kicks into a light swing groove and the most recognized song on the album begins, &quot;So What.&quot; Amazing solos and a great time feel drive this tune home.<BR>     The second tune, &quot;Freddie Freeloader,&quot; is an easy blues tune, with Wynton Kelly playing piano instead of Bill Evans. Kelly's bluesy approach to jazz piano fills well here, as his solo forces you to tap your foot to the beat.<BR>     &quot;Blue in Green,&quot; the only song that Adderley does not play on, is a slow and melancholy song that can bore some listeners, but to the avid jazz fan, it is a treat. Coltrane's explosive and expressive solo is so good, it can make you listen over and over...<BR>     &quot;All Blues&quot; is another blues in 6/8. Miles' solo is, although simple, very interesting and broad. A light feel travels through this one always.<BR>     &quot;Flamenco Sketches,&quot; the last song, is also a slow and light tune. It differs from &quot;Blue in Green&quot; in that all of the scales and chords used hint at Spanish and African musical ideas, allowing for some very interesting solos indeed.<BR>     The sixth track, an alternate take of &quot;Flamenco Sketches,&quot; is the only complete take of a song from the entire &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; sessions.<BR>     Whether for a rainy day or a road trip, &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; is the ultimate addition to any jazz collection and a great listen any day of the year.

B00005O5CM|5.0|As hokey as it was..I fell i love with it.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|I already had the first release of this on dvd, but the Bootleg is totally worth it!  There's so much packed in here, I've been listening to the Stillwater cd on an almost daily basis.  I really enjoyed the deleted scenes, even if they didn't add much to the plot.  It's great to see it all, even if it's not ALL the deleted scenes!  The extras, like the Stillwater concert, are fantastic.  I found the director's commentary particularly interesting.  I liked hearing about what inspired Cameron Crowe to make this movie.  He mentions a Bebe Buell as being a partial influence on the Penny Lane character.  If you want to know why Penny wanted to go to Morocco, try doing a search on Bebe Buell.  In a chat transcript for Playboy online, Bebe mentions always wanting to visit Africa someday!  There are interviews online where Bebe says the very first conversation she had with Cameron in 1973 was about their ages.  Sound familiar?!  I recommend reading \\"Rebel Heart\\" by Bebe Buell too.  You're bound to see other \\"Penny Lane\\" similarities.
B000063CPL|5.0|Okay, if you want to pick apart the track listing, I would have liked to see a few more of my favorites too. But then again, that's why I bought \\"Live after Death\\" and \\"Live at Donnington\\". Fact is, this is a very good cd with a lot of Maiden favorites and new stuff as well. If you want everything else, then buy everything else. My only real problem with this cd is trying to get used to Bruce saying \\"scream for me loud BRAZIL\\" instead of \\"mates\\" as on \\"Live after death\\". Now that's picky.
B0000029DD|1.0|Jeff Buckley's \\"Grace\\" is a weak album by an all around weak artist.  This album is the same old \\"been there, done that\\" trash that has been killing our music scene says the 80's.  A lot of people thought he was here to save music but that is clearly not the case.  The only good rock to come out in the past 15 years is the Strokes.  In conclusion, dont buy this album--youll regret it..i know i did..
0783241542|5.0|The best movie in the world! Witty humor and sub-romantic qualities are put to life in this extremely enjoyable and highly entertaining raunch-fest! The stars and characters are a great ensemble as well!<BR>The story centers around the coming-of-age of James/Jim (Jason Biggs), who fantasizes about girls often and even has crazy occurances with pornography, but never once has had a girlfriend. After a party, (in which he and his buddies hope to get laid, but have no such luck), thrown by goofball, semi-friend, Steve Stifler (Seann William Scott), the guys find out that the biggest nerd in school, Sherman the \\"Sherminator\\" (Chris Owen) claims to have gotten laid with a chick he just met; so he (Jim), Chris \\"Oz\\" Ostreicher (Chris Klein), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), and Paul/\\"Finch\\" (Eddie Kaye Thomas) all vowed to get laid before they graduate....but not just love 'em and leave 'em, but with some emotional standards and loving to it! The objects of their affections are: Vicky (Tara Reid), Heather (Mena Suvari), Michelle (Alyson Hannigan), Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth), and Jessica (Natasha Lyonne). The supporting cast includes Jennifer Coolidge as Stifler's Mom and Eugene Levy as Jim's Dad.<BR>I will detail this more at another time!
B000002OX7|4.0|Let me just say first of all that no matter what you hear or read this is a great album to buy and is capable of thousands of listens. Now onto explanations. The original album is and was as I say wonderul  and represents the epitome of what \\"The Who\\" is. The use of a synthesizer as a rythm instrument on \\"Baba O'Riley\\" and \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" was not only a great sound but was at the time literally revolutionary. \\"My Wife\\" is a great rocker written by John Entwistle, however even though any recording of it is great most of the live recordings are a little better. I feel they played it to slow on the studio recording but most performances of it have been faster. The use of dynamics in songs \\"Getting In Tune\\" and and \\"The Song is Over,\\" were not only written extremely well but also pereformed well. \\"Love Ain't for Keeping\\" is musically brilliant and lyrically speaks volumes. \\"Bargain\\" of course is a great classic and also speaks volumes.<BR>Now for the additions. On this rerelease they added seven tracks. I think that all of them are good bu \\"Baby DOn't You Do It\\" \\"Naked Eye\\" and \\"Water\\" are fairly weak. \\"Too Much of Anything and I Don't Even Know Myself\\" are too pretty good tracks that would have fit well on the album originally and I think are good additions. \\"Pure and Easy\\"?.... What can I say but I am ecstatic that they have finally included their recording of this song on the album. It is a beatufil song and a Beautigul sentiment. As for the previously unreleased version of \\"Baba O'Riley\\" at first doesn't seem any different from what they originally released but after a couple of listens you can tell the guitar and bass are fairly different. All other differences are so subtle they are not even worth mentioning. All and All I think this is a great album and I think it really deserves 4 1/2 stars with only those three additional tracks been weak at all.
B000002572|5.0|All I can say to be blunt is that I've heard every song on the radio.  Every single song!!! Of course it's on a classic rock station and it's a local station so it could be a bias, but still.  Great sound, great listening.  just pop it in and enjoy.
B00005JKBC|3.0|Spy Game is a movie that is so slickly made, it's hard to come to an immediate impression about the film. Sure it looks and sounds great, but is there any substance? Going through the commentary tracks, we learn that of course there was a lot of thinking about what was going on behind the scenes. Unfortunately without the commentary tracks, the glossy feel, constant fast cuts, and other devices that director Tony Scott uses, takes away from the viewer's ability to get into the minds or emotions of the characters and even to understand everything that it transpiring.<br />Spy Games is a thriller set in 1991 right after the cold war has ended. Robert Redford, playing Nathan Muir, an old-school CIA agent about to retire, learns that Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt), a much younger agent who he had trained years ago, has \\"gone rogue\\" and has been captured in an attempt to rescue a prisoner in a Chinese prison. The Chinese are threatening to execute him as a common criminal in 24 hours and Muir has been brought in to shed some light on who Bishop is. From here the story unfolds as a series of flashbacks covering the past encounters between Bishop and Muir, how Bishop was trained, various missions in Berlin and Lebanon, etc. Intermixed between these flashbacks Scott refocuses onto the present (which is 1991 in the film) and Muir's struggle to get to the bottom of what his superiors want to do with Bishop's situation and trying to launch his own independent plans to circumvent the Agency's.<br />Perhaps it is because they are all spies, but the characters don't seem to be fully developed. We see their actions and some heated dialogue, but I was left with not really knowing how much was the \\"game\\" that they had to play in order to use people. As I mentioned, there is a lot of fast cutting, stills, and other camera tricks in this film, and this makes it similar to other Scott efforts like Enemy of the State. To some extent you almost feel like you are in an MTV video - everything's so stylized. Perhaps this distracts us enough to where it makes it difficult for the viewer to understand the players beyond the obvious and superficial, but it does admittedly add lots of texture and energy to the film as well.<br />Spy Game is presented in its original 2.35:1 aspect ratio, anamorphically enhanced for 16x9 TV's. The transfer is very clean and sharp, and shows off well the different coloring schemes that Scott utilizes throughout the movie (he uses different tones and saturation levels to depict various places and times within the story). The 5.1 Dolby Digital audio track is very lively - Scott is as slick when it comes to sound as he is with video, and this is definitely a film that one can use to show off one's audio system. There is also a DD 5.1 French track as well as a DTS 5.1 English track.<br />The disc has a pretty sizeable set of special features, adding a lot of value, and without which the film would probably seem very incomplete. There are nine \\"deleted scenes\\" and \\"alternate versions of existing scenes\\" available both with and without the director's commentary. These clips uncover alternate storylines that could have added a lot more depth both to the characters and to their relationships with one another, shedding a whole new light on the film itself. So these are very helpful in understanding the film beyond its slick exterior. The commentary tracks are, of course, very helpful as well. There's a commentary by Scott, which runs the gamut from talking about the actors and the making of the film to more of the background information that puts the story into much greater perspective. The second track is with Producers Mark Abraham and Douglas Wick and is expectedly more focused on the making of the film and all the technical and logistical aspects surrounding that. Both tracks are fairly interesting and insightful, but I would not rate them among the best commentaries I've listened to. Next comes \\"Clandestine Ops\\" which is billed as \\"A unique viewing experience that puts you in control. Go behind-the-scenes and gain access to classified information simultaneously while watching the film.\\" What this boils down to is that you have to watch the entire film over again and watch for a graphical cue that tells you to hit a button that will bring up a kind of mini \\"making-of\\" clip relating to something you just saw in the movie. Although an interesting method of getting info, after watching the 2+ hour film and much of the commentary tracks and deleted scenes, I would have much rather had a simple making-of featurette which encapsulated all of the ones in \\"Clandestine Ops.\\" Hey, they could even have provided both and left it up to the viewer to choose which method he would like to view these making-of clips! There's a small textual piece, which shows the requirements for getting into the CIA, which was interesting. There was also a short piece that included some recounting by Scott (and examples) of how he creates storyboards and gets his filming ideas from them - he was originally a painter before getting into film. Finally there is DVD-ROM material which I did not view as I dd not have one at my disposal.<br />Spy Games is a good bet for those who are into spy thrillers and slick action flicks. Even for those who are not necessarily into these genres but like the challenge of watching something that appears mostly superficial and yet actually has a lot going on behind the scenes, there's a lot on this disc to sink one's teeth into. If you are looking for lots of character and relationship development, you'd probably best be served with another film.A unique viewing experience that puts you in control.

B000001EAQ|4.0|POP got either a bad rap or mediocre reviews, and the POPMART tour didn't do well - at least compared to the ZOO TV tour - BUT SO WHAT! I saw the POPMART tour at the Alamodome in San Antonio, TX in November 1997, and that was the best concert I have ever seen (by the way, I was in the Army doing my medical training, and I waited 9 months and stayed out past curfew that night to see them in concert, so you can imagine how psyched I was to see them live!)<br />As for POP, that whole CD was my soundtrack to 1997, because I joined the Army and I want through basic training and my job training, and about my only motivation aside from wanting to pass was to see U2. &quot;Discotheque&quot;, &quot;Staring At The Sun&quot;, &quot;Gone&quot; and &quot;Mofo&quot; were songs that stayed in my head the whole year, especially when I was running in formation or doing some training, and by the end of 1997, the songs really resonated with me. As for the music itself, I like the experiments U2 did, and despite fans groaning, techno beats and blips really did fit with the band's anthemic rock, if not provided a unique springboard for it. If nothing else, U2 were having some fun, and you can't fault them for that. The other side of the 'fun' element was some of the 'darker' songs such as &quot;If God Will Send His Angels&quot;, &quot;Please&quot; and &quot;Wake up Dead Man&quot;, possibly the spookiest song U2 has ever done. As good as they were, I think U2 missed the uplift in their songs. And as much fun as they had playing with electronica and irony, they missed good old fashioned down-and-dirty rock and roll. But don't diss this album - it may not be a classic like THE JOSHUA TREE or ACHTUNG BABY, but it's a very good album nonetheless.
6302752337|2.0|\\"Easy Rider\\" (1969)<br />\\"A classic...a great film for its day...everyone is sure to love it\\", those were the comments I had been hearing about Easy Rider before I rented it. I expected this movie to be great because it was called a counterculture classic and topped many people's lists of the best film of the 1960's. In my opinion, Easy Rider is a case of don't believe everything you read.<br />Sure, the movie has its good points. The music is fantastic. The songs are all very memorable and suit the road theme, styles of the film and the time in which it is set very well. Many of the songs of the movie have become classics since the films release. Easy Rider is also shot gorgeously, with heaps of great sunset shots and motorcycle journeys.<br />The performances in the movie are also very good. Jack Nicholson is the stand out as the innocent comic relief Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda meet when they go to jail. Nicholson deserved another Oscar for this role! Hopper clearly put a lot of effort into the film being a writer, director and lead actor, but his continuous \\"man's\\" and hippie references annoyed the heck out of me, as did his monologues about what he \\"sees\\" after he takes drugs. Peter Fonda was hailed as the leading actor of the movie but he really doesn't say that much and he has very little facial expression. His acting definitely got better.<br />There was also way too many drugs in this movie. In the film, this is basically the story: these 2 guys take drugs, encounter people, take drugs, make the people they encounter take drugs, take some drugs, sleep, take a couple more drugs, have sex, and then take drugs. And apparently this story is all about \\"freedom\\" according to Dennis Hopper. Yeah right. Also, Easy Rider doesn't present any ideas why or why not the characters should be doing this. Why are they doing it in the first place? Is taking drugs a way to make people free and express freedom? No. I found the use of drugs both pointless and excruciatingly unrealistic in this film.<br />So, the movie does have its good points - the cinematography, bikes and Jack Nicholson - but not enough to overcome the whole pointlessness of the entire production. This is one big disappointment for me, and I can't believe such a film that was hailed as a \\"classic\\" could be so banal and stupid.<br />MY GRADE: C-
B0000640SA|4.0|I'd have to say it might have been too complex and clever except for all the brilliant acting. I got so obsessed I watched it three times and took notes to remind myself of all the details and clues. I might have been wasting my time except that the acting and story are all so deep and nuanced I enjoyed every time. Was the wife a drug-dealer? What was she reading over and over again - I think there are still some things to discover....
B00003CXPJ|5.0|If you haven't seen the movie then dont ask about the title.  Ok, this movie is probably the second or third funniest movie I have ever seen, along with monty python and some Mel Brooks films.  One thing to clear up, I'm 14 so if you dont have a 14 year old sense of humor rent it before you buy it ( i did) but even my parents at 50 found it funny. The movie is about a male model, if you think about it even that is funny.  Well I won't give away the movie its too good to deserve that, but i will say that the dvd is packed with great special features. WATCH THESE AFTER THE MOVIE It has the clips of Zoolander when it first started back in 96 and 97 director commentary for the whole movive (if you want it), extended and deleted scenes (which are funny too) and a hidden feature which if you dont want give away dont read past now!<BR>go to the second part of the special features menu and highlight the pictures and stills part then press right and the mugatu logo will be highlighted press enter to watch derek and hansel rehearse the walkoff
0316776963|5.0|David Sedaris has some great stories to tell, from his encounter with his speech therapist in grade school to being called a &quot;dirty froggy&quot; on the Paris Metro.  If you are literate and you obviously are because you are reading this, click the button that says &quot;BUY&quot; now.  You won't regret it.  (Plus having this book in your collection will impress your indie friends).
0823003035|4.0|I bought this book because I found the artist online and loved his painting &quot;Josephine.&quot; When I saw he had a book for sale, I wanted it.<br />I commend Mr. Ryder for using models of different shapes and ethnicities. The variation in models is wonderful. I think his style of rendering in pencil is precise, very sensitive, and very pleasing to the eye.<br />I am unhappy with this book because the drawing process is not broken down sufficiently to my taste. I like seeing many steps, and all of the marks that go into a piece, regardless of whether or not they eventually get erased. There are no gestural renditions in this book, and all of the models are outlined. I hate outlining. I think it's very grade-schoolish and a real detriment to Ryder's overall craft.<br />So my final judgement is that this book is not essential to your collection. It is NOT a guide to anatomy. However, if you are looking to expand your knowledge of technique and application, Ryder is more than worth purchasing.
B0000542DJ|5.0|Upon release JFK was heavily criticised for being a speculative film that was liberal with its account on the JFK assassination. I believe it is the greatest film ever made, and that these critics are probably the same people who predicted Fight Club would inspire a generation to start beating each other up. It is not my favourite film but JFK is perfect in every way, and showcases the heights at which this medium can reach.<br />There are two DVDs available. Warner were hasty when DVD arrived and shipped off loads of films that had zero features (the odd trailer here and there) and JFK was one of them. Thankfully there is now a Special Edition DVD that spans over two discs. The first contains the film and Stone's commentary. The second disc's notable inclusions are the \\"multimedia essays\\" and a near hours worth of deleted scenes. The second disc is great but even if it were not part of the package I would still be urging you to buy it because the commentary Stone provides is ridiculously good.<br />If you look at JFK on merely a filmmaking level you will appreciate it all the more. It is probably the most accomplished, daring and epic film ever made. Lord Of The Rings may have been difficult to film (understatement) but no one can tell me it is as complex as JFK in terms of plotting and editing. There are so many scenes, cuts and speaking roles (think Traffic times ten!) that it startles me how under appreciated the film is. The courtroom scene alone should be analysed by film students across the world. Then think of the cast (the best ever assembled?): Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Donald Sutherland, Sissy Spacek, Gary Oldman, Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon, Michael Rooker, Kevin Bacon, John Candy and many more. How Stone managed to handle this many stars proves his strength as a director.<br />Anyway, the commentary covers everything. The filmmaking, the writing, the politics, justifications of excluding certain events, scenes and characters and he responds to each criticism of his film and makes the people who voiced them look like idiots. And Stone is not like a monosyllabic Tim Burton (whose commentaries can be so boring and painful at times). He speaks with an articulacy that is rare among any Hollywood director. He is an educated man whose intelligence overwhelms the listener. He ends on an ambiguous tone. He questions my generation (I am 18). He asks if I am an institutionalised consumer in a capitalist society who blindly accepts the information fed by the media. That is DEEP! Stone's intention in this film was to elevate the importance of the JFK assassination. To show how a country that was once founded on the greatest of ideals allowed such a horror to occur. It is also a very relevant commentary as the face of Lee Harvey Oswald could easily be replaced by the face of Osama Bin Laden.<br />I thought the Fincher/Pitt commentaries were good but Stone puts them to shame. This director has proved to me that film still matters, that it is a serious medium which can make serious changes in the world. If you care about film you should own this DVD.
B0000634EV|5.0|I've honestly been praying to hear from Down again since the first time I heard \\"NOLA.\\"  When I found out \\"II\\" was finally coming out I was exstatic.  When I first popped the new album in I was shocked.  I had heard nothing in the media as far as the content on this cd, so I was expecting it to be similar to NOLA.  Was I ever wrong!  This cd has less of the Pantera style Metal feel to it and more of a Led Zep/Skynyrd rock feel.  It has its heavy points (The Man That Follows Hell, Stained Glass Cross, New Orleans is a Dying Whore), but it also reveals a melodic side (Learn From This Mistake, Landing on the Mountains of Meggido).  It is nearly impossible to pick a favorite song on this cd, personally I would give the nod to either Stained Glass Cross, Beautifully Depressed or New Orleans is a Dying Whore.  This could possbly be a ground breaking album, because it is true to form you don't hear any hip hop elements like most metal acts you hear today.  Phil catches you off guard with his singing ability, and Pepper and Kirk pound out riff after riff of amazing guitar play.  Rex and Jimmy deliver the low end swampy feeling needed to make this cd what it is.  I haven't been able to stop listening to this cd for a week now and that doesn't bother me a bit.  A+ job from an A+ band.

B00005RYKU|4.0|Well first let  me say that Leelee Sobieski is one of my favorite actresses. Today I found out that I'm not the only one who thinks she looks just like Helen Hunt! Well anyways it was a great movie with a wery well written plot. The cinematography was done well also. The reflections of the water in the glass make the movie creepy and help to biuld the suspense. At many ponts in the movie you think someone is going to jump out and grab Ruby (Leelee Sobieski's character). Well if you're looking for a great renter or buyer, get this DVD.
0446608955|5.0|I saw the movie with my girlfriend not knowing what it was about. I thought it was good and she gave me the book to read. Im not the biggest fan of readign but i thought the book was really good. Very touching story. Nicholas Sparks really knows how to write love stories that even guys can be interested in reading.
B000006E17|3.0|This is the film where art and torture become one.  Moral values are tempered to relativism by a descent into absolute power and depravity.  Salo takes the nihilistic worldview of Materialism to its logical extreme.  The bleakest idea I have considered is that this is where we are heading today.<br />Watch at your own risk.  Nothing should be censored (almost), but some things leave you wondering if you really wanted to see that?
B00005K3OT|3.0|I found the DVD version of \\"Chocolat\\" to be better than the book, something that usually isn't true for me.<br />For one thing, the movie characters had more depth and were more likable than those in the book.  Vianne, as portrayed by the beautiful Juliette Binoche, was so much more sympathetic in the movie and far less selfish than the Vianne portrayed in the book.<br />Armande, a character I found both silly and shallow in the book, became quite delightful when brought to life by the extraordinarily talented Dame Judi Dench (though I have to admit that Dench could probably entice me to love the devil, her acting is that good).  I do think the relationships among the characters should have been developed more, especially the lovely relationship between Armande (Dench) and her grandson, Luc.<br />In the movie, as in the book, the character of the priest is very weak.  I think this movie would have been greatly strengthened had the character of the priest been strengthened.  A movie (book) is only as strong as its villian factor.  In this movie, the priest is the villian factor and his role definitely needed strengthened.<br />Those who complain that the gypsy character portrayed by Johnny Depp wasn't around long probably haven't read the book.  In the book, the gypsies make just as brief an appearance before moving on.  I agree, this was a fault of Harris' writing, but I don't know what could have been done in the movie version short of re-writing the story Harris had already written.  In some cases, such as this one, it wasn't a bad idea, and the scriptwriter did make a few minor adjustments, all to the good.<br />Visually, I thought the movie was \\"pretty,\\" if more than a bit unrealistic.  There was a very artificial, \\"staged\\" quality in many of the scenes; it was easy to tell that many of the \\"outdoor\\" scenes were actually filmed indoors.<br />This movie's weakest point was also the book's weakest point...a complete lack of story tension.  We always knew just whatwas coming next.<br />The resolution of the movie was, in my opinion, far superior to the resolution of the book.  Despite the lack of story tension, this movie's end left a feeling of satisfaction, something I failed to get from the book.<br />Depite its flaws, \\"Chocolat\\" isn't a bad way to spend a few hours.  Although flawed, the movie does have its charms, not the least of which are the chocolates themselves.  I'd give \\"Chocolat\\" 3 1/2 stars if I could.
B0000029DD|5.0|Jeff Buckley's music could bring the hardest of jaded synics to tears.  There is an overwhelming sense of lonliness, and desperation to his lyrics, and his untimely death leaves a void in all of us who love his music.  When I bought Grace ..., it took me a year to absorb the CD, and begin to realize how unique and special his music truly is. It is more romantic and heart breaking than the story of Romeo and Juliet.  His songs leaving no resolution to whether Jeff ever had found true love, and true contentment.  I've heard certain critics saying the only reason for his career as a musician, was due to his father Tim.  I completely disagree, and it saddens me that these critics have built their life on what they believe is good music, and can't even see one of the best musicians of our time for his obvious talent....

With John back on the guitar, this album clearly energizes the style of the band and brings out the excitment for all the fans. With new development in their music and style than their previous albums, Californication is packed with whacked out funky guitar effects, incredible lyrics, great choruses, pounding drums, and amazing bass solos, you'll be glad to hear the great sound they've produced. Great highlights of the album may include &quot;Around the world&quot;, &quot;Scar Tissue&quot;, Californication&quot;, and &quot;Get on Top&quot;. This is one great album to put in your collection.

Zhang Ziyi shines as Di, the smitten young maiden who's fallen for the new school teacher in the villiage. What develops between them, shown through her eyes, is simply captivating. And the underlying story about the son wishing to fulfill his mother's difficult request is moving, especially when it all comes together. <BR>I adore this movie and can't wait to watch it again and again!

I first heard of pearl Jam through the MTV unplugged session when Eddie went nuts during Black, from then on I was a fan. It may be raw but that is the charm of it. Songs like Alive, Black and Jeremy are absolute gems which still send shivers through my spine ten long years after I first bought the album. Do yourself a favour.
0887307396|5.0|This book is a &#34;must-read&#34; for anyone interested in organizational leadership.  I was a bit nervous when I first picked up the book and learned that it was based off a formal study of companies.  Fortunately, the very first paragraph of the introduction put me at ease and tickled my curiosity when it revealed that the book had &#34;more than forty printings worldwide, translation into thirteen languages, and best-seller status in North America, Japan, South America, and parts of Europe.&#34;  Now, having read the book, I understand why it has achieved such extraordinary success.  The authors did a fantastic job of transforming cold statistics into meaningful analysis and then translating their analysis into plain language for students of management and leadership.  Their many examples and common-sense conclusions were easy to understand and believe.  Whether you are a CEO or a technician on the line, and work in a multi-national corporation or a small local business, this book's lessons can apply to you.
B000003TAR|5.0|I don't know what I could say about this CD.  When I first bought it, I had no expectation of how it would change my life.  Before this, I had been stuck in the stupid world of gothic metal.  I was constantly buying all these Black Sabbath and Kittie cds trying to make the whole metal crowd think I was one of them.  How stupid I was.  After buying this I was officially introduced to what real, emotional, heartfelt music is.  I admit that i still listen to Black Sabbath some, and i may at least give 1 out of a million of these metal bands on tv a listen, but music like In Utero cannot be topped.  I just don't understand why the other reviewers here and most people i know keep putting down Scentless Apprentice, Very Ape, and Milk It.  Yes, I agree that Heart Shaped Box is great, but I have a feeling people keep praising it just because it was the only song on the album that had a video.  Unlike the picky listeners, I like or perhaps love the whole album.  From the bluesy opener &quot;Serve The Servants&quot; to the heart-wrenching closer &quot;All Apologies&quot; it's all fantastic.  Don't listen to all the nay-sayers, especially all those Ozzy Osbourne worshippers.  This CD introduced me to REAL music.
0812550706|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book, but I was not &#34;wowed&#34; by it.  I kept waiting for the book to suddenly come together and live up to its reputation, but it never did.  This book is an adventuresome story of Ender Wiggins, a young genius boy in a future universe where human survival is threatened by an alien &#34;bugger&#34; race.  Ender's life is a struggle as his family's third child in a society with a two-child limit law.  His life changes when he is `manipulated' into a training facility where he quickly becomes mankind's greatest military leader and ultimately saves the human race.  Card's detailed descriptions of the actions in and around the training facilities' Battle Room were fantastic and by far the best parts of the book.  I was taught in college that fiction writers (especially science fiction) should lead their readers into a &#34;willing suspension of disbelief.&#34;  That is, get them to willingly accept and believe in something that is not real.  Card was never able to get me to the point where I accepted or believed in a future world where genius adolescent children had such power and influence as Ender and his siblings and friends. The story flowed smoothly and I was easily able to follow it, but I just did not believe it.  I am not a big science fiction or fantasy reader, but I did read and enjoy Heinlein's &#34;Starship Troopers&#34; and &#34;Space Cadet,&#34; Robert Adams' &#34;Horseclans&#34; series, Barry Sadler's &#34;Casca&#34; series, and Robert E. Howard's &#34;Conan&#34; series (and most of the subsequent writers of Conan's adventures).  I was disappointed that this book was not as good as those books mentioned above and I have no intentions of reading the rest of the Ender series.
B000002JS0|4.0|Now I have always believed if you have heard one AC/DC album you've heard them all. Boy was I wrong. My neighbour who is only about 7 yrs younger than I is an avid AC/DC fan having all the cds in his collection. The other night he sat me down to listen to the Bonfire box set- I was hooked on Bon Scott. Up to this point I owned only Ballbreaker and Stiff upper lip, I have since bought all Bon Scott cd's and have to say this is rock energized to the max. IMHO the newer stuff sounds tired but then as we age we all slow down and with all the touring and hard living these lads have done I guess they have the earned rite to sound tired. Get the early stuff 'cause it really kicks a**, good solid hard rock ideal for summer backyard BBQ&quot;s and beers.
B00000064G|5.0|This is one of those rare albums that you can just sit back and listen to, and not have to do anything else to be completely and totally occupied.  This album takes you to another place, where all you can do is hear and feel every word of the lyrics.  If you liked the Royal Tenenbaums (soundtrack or movie, take your pick) you will love this album.  And vice versa...if you like this album, check out the Royal Tenenbaums.<br />Some songs will just stick with you for the rest of your life, and most of the songs on this album fall into that category.  Buy it, and enjoy.
B00005ATQI|5.0|Stephen King's books have usually made a transition to the screen ranging from so-so to god-awful, but in &quot;The Shining&quot;, Stanley Kubrick has made a movie that is actually better than the book.  It's tight, spare, lean, mean, and spooky as hell.  From the marvelous opening, of a lone Beetle making its way up a spectacularly beautiful and utterly empty mountainous terrain, we get a sense of the crushing loneliness and isolation that eventually drives the film's protagonist over the edge, coupled with his out-of-control alcoholism.  Jack Nicholson is a diabolical presence as Jack Torrance, the frustrated playwright who takes an off-season job as caretaker of a once-glamorous hotel gone slightly to seed; after being kicked out of his teaching position at a posh prep school, it's the only job he can find to support his clueless wife and his five year old son Danny.  Danny has the &quot;shine&quot; on him, which means he has the gift of Sight, and he is able to see, as neither of his parents can, the ghastly doings that have haunted the old hotel where he and his family are trapped for the long winter.  Jack's descent into madness and his wife's growing panic are wonderfully portrayed in the film.  Probably nobody else could have played this part as effectively as Nicholson; with his peaked eyebrows and sardonic, twisted grin, he even looks devilish.  Shelly Duvall as his wife overdoes the shaking and quaking in some scenes, but she is very good as the wife who just wants to protect their son and get them both out of this possessed hellhole alive.  The only disappointment in the film was the diminished role of the cook Hallorann, who understands Danny's gift because he shares it; although Scatman Crothers was very good indeed in this part, we saw much more of him in the book and we should have seen more of him in the movie.  The cinematography and the music are both excellent and effectively contribute to the film's atmosphere of haunting isolation and insulation.  King must have been glad when he saw this movie that at least one of his books came out right on film.n.  King must have been glad when he saw this movie that at least one of his books came out right on film.
B00005JKYS|5.0|'We Were Soldiers' is one of the most moving and meaningful war films ever made.  Unlike 'Black Hawk Down', 'We Were Soldiers' brings you inside the war to the people.  You really get to know the soldiers, you really feel for them.  Randall Wallace brilliantly combines the two most important aspects of the Vietnam; the battlefield and the families at home.  Many films try to do this, not many succeed.  Wallace does this by dedicating the first 40+ minutes to the familiarization of the characters and families.  While the battle is raging, Wallace frequently flashes back to the army base where the wives are faced with the difficult task of distributing death notices.<br />Mel Gibson puts forth a brilliant and moving performance as Lt. Colonel Hal Moore.  Gibson masters this role.  We can be sure that his portrayal of Moore is accurate because he worked with the real Hal Moore while filming.  He became Moore, right down to the way he walked!  Madeleine Stowe also puts forth an impressive and emotionally driven performance as Gibson's/Moore's wife, Julie Moore.  I heard that she too worked with the real Julie Moore to help herself master the role.<br />The battle scenes are terrifyingly realistic and haunting.  I've never seen anything like it.  I must mention one particularly haunting scene;<BR>The boys are lying in the bush at night with their guns aimed into the darkness before them.  Two terrified soldiers begin to whisper to each other; where's the enemy?  \\"I can smell them, they're here\\" proclaims one.  They can't see anything.  It's pitch black.  The soldiers can barely breath.  One whispers into his radio for a flare to be thrown into the woods in front of them so that they might see where their enemy is at.  The flare come, the woods light up.  The silhouettes of the Vietnamese appear.  They are only inches from where they lay.<br />This is only one of the many haunting and unforgettable moments in 'We Were Soldiers'.  It took my breath away.<br />'We Were Soldiers' is such an emotional film!  I found myself sobbing by the time the credits were rolling.  I wasn't the only one, either.  Grown men were crying as well.  We cried for the lost lives and the pain.  We cried for the families and the sacrifices our boys made.  This film really helped me to understand what happened in Vietnam and how it affected the families and those who lived through it.  I honor them.
B00005JKBC|4.0|The only negative comment is the Beirut action.  Is it so difficult to find people who speaks Lebanese.  A film as good as this one should not have this kind of flaw
B000002WNP|5.0|For many, the raw purity of Elvis' 1950's recordings define his greatness. His post-army work is often relegated to also-ran status. Truly, the early recordings were filled with an overpowering invention that Elvis would never fully recapture. By the time of his return in 1960, numerous changes affected his comeback. First, Elvis himself had matured, and the songs that suited him just a few years earlier didn't fit the same way. Second, the music scene itself had moved along. Third, the 1960s saw Elvis starring in a progressively more mediocre string of films, churning out blander and blander soundtrack material. The dilutive impact of the awkward movie music makes Elvis' 1960's catalog tricky to evaluate as a whole.<br />Luckily, RCA's sweeping series of box sets provides a clear view of Elvis' mid-period catalog by removing the movie music to its own collection. Although this relegates some fine tracks such as \\"Return to Sender,\\" \\"I Can't Help Falling in Love,\\" and \\"Viva Las Vegas\\") to reside with a large harvest of lemons, it also cleanses this presentation of his non-movie work. The resulting five-disc \\"Nashville to Memphis\\" box set features substantial hit tracks and numerous lesser-known (but no less worthy) album tracks, padded out by a large helping of passable chaff that, sung by someone else, would still be laying in the vault.<br />By 1960 the galvanic fire of Elvis' early sides was mostly extinct, replaced by a variety of new direction that often bore fruit. Rather than turning himself to '50s anachronism by trying to reproduce his earlier sound (or, worse yet, consigning himself to a follower's role by aping then-current trends), Elvis dug deeply into himself, and especially into the capabilities of his voice, to find new veins of artistry.<br />Elvis' first post-Army single, \\"Stuck on You,\\" resounds with the freedom of someone liberated from barracks life. Same for \\"I Gotta Know,\\" with a backing vocal that playfully tracks Elvis on the later verses. The easy swing and playful growl in Elvis' voice would soon become the province of pretty boys like Bobby Rydell, but heard here, it's a natural maturation from Elvis' earlier years.<br />The early- and mid-60s served up some fine rock 'n' roll, including Leiber & Stoller's shades-of-the-Coasters' \\"Dirty, Dirty Feeling,\\" the blazing \\"Feel So Bad,\\" and Doc Pomus & Mort Shuman's \\"A Mess of Blues\\" and \\"Little Sister.\\" Scotty Moore provided some great guitar riffs on the latter two. Elvis and the band jammed strongly on bluesman Lowell Fulsom's \\"Reconsider Baby.\\"<br />Mid-tempo tunes provided Elvis the chance to sing happier pop like \\"Good Luck Charm,\\" and the dramatic longing of \\"She's Not You\\" and \\"His Latest Flame.\\" The latter, with its loping Bo Diddley beat, piano-charged uptempo chorus and popping bass is a perfect frame for Elvis' voice.<br />Dramatic ballads like \\"Fame and Fortune,\\" \\"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\\" and \\"Surrender\\" introduced a style that would stick with Elvis until the end. More sparely arranged songs like \\"Fever\\" and \\"Starting Today\\" spotlight the sheer beauty of Elvis' voice.<br />Elvis visited Country (\\"Judy\\" \\"Just Call me Lonesome\\" \\"I'm Movin' On\\"), gospel (\\"I Gotta Know\\"), and covers of Bob Dylan (\\"Tomorrow is a Long Time\\"), Chuck Berry (\\"Too Much Monkey Business\\") and others. A few covers, such as an oddly orchestrated take of \\"Suspicion\\" and a hurried, horn-heavy arrangement of \\"Fools Fall in Love\\" miss the mark.<br />Those interested in the hits and lost gems (and there are plenty, including \\"Devil in Disguise,\\" \\"Don't Cry Daddy,\\" \\"Finders Keepers, Losers Weepers,\\" \\"It Hurts Me,\\" and \\"Love Letters\\") may be overwhelmed by the dross and clunkers. \\"The Girl of My Best Friend\\" is too soft for Elvis, and come off as a Brill Building reject. \\"Girl Next Door Went A'Walking\\" could have been drawn from one of Elvis' lesser soundtracks, and \\"Just Tell Her Jim Said Hello\\" shows that Leiber & Stoller were just as capable of writing duds as hits.<br />Thearc traced by this collection begins in 1960 with an outpouring of Elvis' pent-up artistic expression. By mid-decade the great songs get fewer and further between. You can almost hear the air rushing out of the initial bubble of enthusiasm. As the decade wears on, the productions take on unfortunate contemporary trends (e.g., faux sitars). Their are still high-points at decade's end (the trio of \\"In the Ghetto,\\" \\"Suspicious Minds\\" and \\"Kentucky Rain,\\" for example), but the material is more uneven and the enthusiasm often wanes.<br />1969 provided some fine performances, including \\"Power of My Love,\\" \\"Without Love There is Nothing,\\" \\"After Loving You,\\" and a cover of Johnny Tillotson's \\"It Keeps Right On A-Hurtin'.\\" But the year also produced less successful choices such as the soul-dance \\"Rubberneckin'\\" and an overwrought remake of \\"From a Jack to a King.\\" Covers of \\"Hey Jude\\" and \\"Only the Strong Survive\\" find Elvis adding little to the originals.<br />Disc 5 includes several alternate takes (including \\"In the Ghetto\\" \\"Suspicious Minds\\" \\"Kentucky Rain\\") presented in rough form (e.g., no backing singers). The lack of final production leaves the focus on Elvis' vocals, generally reaffirming the producer's choice of take for the hit single. Also included are snippets of studio dialog, and a 1960 Presley/Sinatra live television performance of the duo trading \\"Love Me Tender\\" and \\"Witchcraft.\\"<br />The sound throughout is superb, mostly the product of RCA's Nashville Studio B. The backing, especially on the early tracks, retains some of the rock 'n' roll group energy from Elvis' early years, but by mid-decade, though all very professionally arranged and played, the songs sound more constructed than evolved. The accompanying liner notes from Elvis biographer Peter Guralnick are top-notch, as is the accompanying discographical information.arc traced by this collection begins in 1960 with an outpouring of Elvis' pent-up artistic expression.

B00000IAU3|5.0|No Angel by Dido is absolutely incredible.  It's one of those albums that you can buy and listen to a million times and never get tired of it.  Dido has this interesting sort of talent.  She doesn't have to push her voice or do dance music to get her point across.  She just uses her talent and light music to back her up.  Let me tell you, that really works for her.<br />I can't believe that without Eminem's &quot;Stan&quot; this album probably wouldn't have been as big of a hit as it has ended up being.  It's absolutely an album that no one should miss, yet without him (despite the fact that I dislike him a lot) this album would've been missed by too many people.  The world could've lost out on such an incredible talent if she hadn't had her song sampled on one of his tracks.<br />This album is very smart and classy, and so is anyone who buys this album because it shows that they're okay with making a mature decision.
B000002UDB|5.0|i found this cd really good to listen to.

0312955006|5.0|I have only read the first three of these (savouring my way through the series) but so far, this is far and away the best! This is a corker of a book. <br />Connelly hand;es the parrallel plots (investigation into the new Dollmaker body and the court case) with the skill of a master.<br />Both the plot twines are superb, and so well plotted and written. They are full of tension and surprise. The legal-thriller side of the book is even more compelling than Grisham. It rings with authenticity and is exciting and tense. I loved following the case, and trying to decide which way the veridct would go, what else would happen during the course of the trial, etc. <br />The investigation into the new Dollmaker body is also great. It is puzzling, intriguing, suspenseful, exciting, and a whole load of other adjectives. Due to both the plots running next to each other i just couldn't stop turning those pages. The book always felt fresh and readable because of the fact that the focus on plot kept switching between the court and the Dollmaker case. <br />Harry Bosch is a great character. And i do wish he and Sylvia would work it out. She is a good match for him, and they would be a good couple. Bosch needs a bit of romance in his life to stop his character from getting stagnant.... <br />The plot is so well devised and drawn that i was amazed. It is so completely original. I have never read anything quite like it. Intriguing, different, exciting, compelling, taut. I couldn't wait to find out how everything was going to resolve itself. <br />And, boy, was it a cracking resolution! I loved the ending, and the solution to whodunnit. I never saw it coming, evne though by rights i probably should have. Also, the final death is quite upsetting to the reader, because even though the victim has been against Bosch for much of the book, she is still quite a likeable character, and you can sense that Bosch likes her and respects her too. <br />A great book. <br />(For all who like Michael Connelly, i have to reccomend Ian Rankin to you. He is the Scottish Michael Connelly. (Actually, to be more accurate, Michael Connelly is the American Ian Rankin, as Rankin has been writing for longer.) Rankin's novels are very similar in mood, plot, sense of place, and character. Bosch is very like Rankin's lead character Rebus. Bosch was in Vietnam, Rebus was in the SAS. Rebus is flawed, as is Bosch. They are both somewhat unsucessful with women, and can't seem to keep a relationship going for long. Connelly's LA shimmers with life, and Rankin's Edinburgh literally breathes and pulses like an entity. The plots are also similar in style. If you are a fan of Connelly, you should really like Rankin.)
B00003CXGP|2.0|American Psycho is a dull, uninspired movie. A twenty-something upper-class white guy leads an empty, spiritually bankrupt life. Ho-hum. I've seen that motif in countless other movies, and American Psycho offers no new spin on the theme, save the fact that he gets his kicks out of mutilating and murdering people. In the end, the viewer discovers that none of the murders were even real, merely figments of a warped imagination. <br />It is, however, a mildly amusing movie, has some excellent photography, and Christian Bale does an ok job portraying the main character. But, like the vapid and soulless lifestyle it purports to criticize, American Psycho dances around the same tired and superficial images, content with just looking stylish without tackling anything substantial. It is a frustrating movie because it so desparately wants to be a biting satire, a work of art, and comes pretty close in a few scenes. But true satirical art must be fresh, original, and sustained, not merely stylish and half-hearted. N.B.: the opening credits montage is very well-done and clever, and worthwhile viewing on its own, if you have the will power to stop it once it's finished.
B000063CPL|5.0|If you are a TRUE Iron Maiden fan, this CD is a must have. They have never sounded better! This is a great live recording and the track list is fantastic (covering things all the way back to Maiden's \\"Jurassic Era\\" to quote Bruce Dickinson). Do yourself a favor and buy this CD, you won't regret it!<BR>UP THE IRONS!
B0000508U6|3.0|Mellow music is always harder for me to get into.  Some bands, however, have been able to excite despite their calmness, such as Radiohead and Pedro The Lion.  Coldplay is close to being one of those bands.  Songs such as &quot;Shiver&quot; (great riff!) and &quot;Yellow&quot; are poppy and soaring, with a bit of a U2 feel.  Throughout the album, guitar and vocals shine.  But when it's all said and done, a lot of these tracks are boring, dragging melodies out too long and stumbling about for a while.  More focus in songwriting could produce some amazing work.
B00003CXPD|5.0|I first saw this picture at the cinemas when first released and was crying at the end.  I saw so much of myself as an artist and identified completely with Billy.  I think we all have personal struggles, especially in youth, and Billy gives us hope that we can win.  This picture is one of my favourites and I must have it for my collection.  The sound track is fabulous and probably worth owning on it's own for T-Rex and Stephen Gately.<br />The symbolism is simply brilliant.  I hope everyone notices the swans on the wallpaper during the feather pillow fight scene.  This ties in with the whole theme of wings, feathers, flying to freedom, and \\"Swan Lake\\", with a genius interpretation of the ugly-duckling-to-swan metamorphosis that Billy makes, only he is quite cute.  The story is all about overcoming the unrecognised oppression that males face straight or gay.  There is also a sense of anger/fear changing to cathartic tenderness between men and it's about time we have more of this in pictures.  Men's liberation has only begun.<br />I would recommend this picture for everyone young or old, fed up to the back teeth with the constrictions of antiquated thinking, and seeking great entertainment.  The violence is the only thing I would be concerned with children seeing/hearing.  Everything else is a fact of life.
B00004XQ83|5.0|This album is awesome!... It is a soundtrack to a wonderfully done movie. I grin everytime I hear \\"Man Of Constant Sorrow\\". It is almost comical. I have seen the movie twice and the only other movie I've seen twice was Titanic. The music captures the era of the movie and could stand on it's own. This is just feel good music and that is the point of music~ isn't it? Only a few artist like Enya and Ryan Farish have just good music. This album is a MUST and has my 5 stars no dought.
B000002JSN|5.0|Led Zeppelin is the definitive group of the genre of classic rock, and I think this is the album to have.<br />While it doesn't have the more popular songs, aside from \\"Kashmir\\", this is one of the best of their albums.<br />The music is all great here, and Jimmy Page is the greatest guitarist ever.<br />\\"Physical Graffiti\\" plays on so many different levels. Zeppelin can rock out, they can mellow out.  Mostly, they just entertain the masses of classic rock fans like myself.  I've been listening to them for 20 years now, and I bet I will still listen to them when I am old and gray.<br />If you are of the age I was when I started listening to classic rock, this will be a great start to your Led Zeppelin collection.  It is a mix of a more edgy Zeppelin with the beautiful sounds of Robert Plant's harmony during the slower songs.  The music is powerful here.<br />Worth buying!!!!
B000050XEI|5.0|I am so glad to see Enya's album &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; doing so well on the charts. I was fortunate to see her perform on a late night talk show. She captures the beauty of &quot;Only Time&quot; on stage as well in a recording studio. She has without a dought moved millions of listeners with her modest voice. This is a wonderful album to own. I only have a few favorite songs like &quot;Only Time&quot; ~~ &quot;Someday&quot; by Yanni and &quot;Friends&quot; by Ryan Farish.

6305350205|1.0|This movie should have been billed as a spoof. After two, three, and four, it is obvious that the cast wanted to have fun with the story, and it is equally(and painfully)obvious that they really did not have a script. Kirk, McCoy and Spock are camping in Yosemite, when they are called back to go rescue the peace delegates on &quot;The planet of galactic peace&quot;. The delegates have been kidnapped by a renegade Vulcan named Sybok, who happens to be Spocks(half?)brother. That was a little too pat. Sybok's quest is to find God, who according to legend lives an the other side of the barrier at the center of the Galaxy. They rescue the delegates, only to have the delegates turn on them and turn him over to Sybok, who then turns his empathy powers onto the crew of the 1701-A, and who help imprison the Captain(Admiral!)and the Captain Spock. Except that they are rescued by the Captain Scott, despite his being exposed to the empathy powers of Sybok. Scottie then runs into a wall after saying he knows the ship like the back of his hand. The two captains are soon captured by Sybok's converts, but since they are now at or beyond the barrier, Sybok turns command back over to Kirk without even making him say pretty please. They find God, except he is not God but just some super energy being who was imprisoned in the ancient galaxy by forces/powers that we never find out about for reasons that are never stated. This scene produced the highlight of the movie, when Kirk asked &quot;Excuse me. Why does God need a starship?&quot;. A semi-renegade Klingon captain and crew were thrown in to spice it up, but ultimately they only give the movie two good lines for Spock: &quot;Damn you sir, you will try.&quot; and &quot;Please sir, not in front of the Klingons.&quot; The good-guys win, the bad guys lose, the betrayed idealist becomes the hero-martyr, and all is well again. Then we are back in Yosemite, but this time Spock knows &quot;Row, Row, Row your boat.&quot;<BR>It was obvious that the cast had fun doing this movie, but if I were the one titling it, it would be Star Trek Five: The Wrath of the Screen-Writers Guild.
0780631684|1.0|A work of comedic genious? Perhaps, but as a horror, it could be no worse, the plot is [weak]. Basically this flick deals with the idea that if death is on your path you're toast, no matter what you do to try and escape it, real scarry huh? no, its not. Luckily for the cast, one strong willed gent has figured out this plan of death's. he takes matters into his own, powerful, ingenious hands. even after this \\"hunk\\" realizes out he can't stop it, he goes ahead and tries anyhow, very very very courageous of young vern. if you ask me, this guy is a little light in his loafers. final destination couldn't hold the attention of an invalid, sat in a chair, in a locked room with no way to shut off the tv, and nothing else in the room. i hated this movie with a passion. i hate the fact that somebody could possibly like it. and i believe my review reflects that.
B000002L9B|3.0|I dind´t like this album that much. It´s very different from the other Prince albums I´ve listened to. But there are few great tracks on this album such as Kiss, Sometimes it snows in April etc. But this cd lacks something and I don´t know what it is. Maybe Prince was to fast making this album. But thanfully a year after this one was released. The magnificant Sign O´The Times was released. Probably one of the best albums of all time. <br />If you wan´t to become a Prince Fan you must have this. If you are a fan you must have this already. If you wan´t to buy anything with Prince but not nessecerly a fan don´t buy this one. Buy Purple Rain, Sign O´The Times, The Gold Experience, 1999 or Dirty Mind
0425107469|5.0|Koontz's own personal favorite, and it's easy to see why.  Everything now recognizable as his trademarks are evident in it.<br />Even if you hate Koontz's adorable dogs  -  which would only be due to the drastic overkill usage of them in his books  -  you'll love Einstein, the genius golden labrador, who mostly carries this story.  Einstein escapes from a government weapons lab, and hooks-up with an old war vet and his soon-to-be girlfriend, who piece together his history with a little help from Einstein, himself.  Einstein is the scout half of a telepathic search-and-destroy animal team.  The \\"Other\\" half is a mutant killer baboon, jealous of his \\"brother\\" Einstein's better looks and social skills.<br />The Other wants Einstein's hide.  The government wants its expensive search-and-destroy project back.  Einstein just wants to be free of them all.  The heroes want not to get killed by all the interested parties after Einstein.<br />What's not to love?<br />The best movie version of this  -  there are several, none of them that good  -  is actually Watchers 2.  But read the book first.  It really is Dean at his best.

And keep in mind that these guys are Canadian, show some partiatisum and grab this CD

B00005JKDR|5.0|Whoever said that this movie was just another Toy Story left their brain at home when they went to see it.  Monsters Inc. is possibly the best 3D movie yet, and definately one of the best animated features made. Was it designed for children... yes, but it is certainly well worth the time to see.  The story is unusual and interesting, and the animation is the best yet in the 3D movie arena. The characters have weight to them, and really fit the personalities of their voice actors.  In addition the attention to detail is outstanding.  As a 3D Animator, and professor of, I would rather have my name associated with this film than any of the others out there.  SEE MONSTERS INC!
B00005QZWI|5.0|An absolutely breath-taking score which I have listened to for hours on end the last months. Other reviewers have already given amble discriptions of the style, all I can say is: it's true! It's bloody marvelous!!<br />If you're a fan of for example Sergei Prokofiev, whose Romeo &amp; Juliet ballet is on my record Top 10 of all time, or Tolkien, or Wagner, or just film music far, far above average - well, I guess you don't have much choice, do you, you gotta find that money somewhere!
B0000009SM|4.0|This is an album you could hand someone who asks you about Frank Zappa's music and say &quot;This pretty much covers it.&quot; Then you'll be buying another or escorting them to the store as they buy their own copy.<br />&quot;Inca Roads&quot; is worth the price of the disc itself, but this has a little of Frank's trademark wit (&quot;Can't Afford No Shoes&quot;, &quot;San Ber'dino&quot;) and trademark 'molten gold' guitar work (solo to &quot;Inca Roads&quot;, &quot;Po-jama People&quot;) and some outright offbeat arrangement (read:Weirdness) (&quot;Andy&quot;, &quot;Evelyn, A Modified Dog&quot;). <br />This is a cornerstone album in my Zappa, along with Hot Rats and Zoot Allures. If you like this, this band is on Roxy and Elsewhere and You Can't Do That On Stage Anymore 2, both very good live sets worth investigating.
B00005RFAI|5.0|This is a GREAT album.  The songs are all very personal and easy to relate to.  She is a very talented song writer and has grown so much lyrically from her last album.  Not much R&amp;B, but if you like a rock/pop sound with a little bit of blues this is an album you MUST get!  I am very impressed.  This is my favorite album this year!

B0000542DJ|5.0|To say Oliver Stone's epic JFK was a little generous in exposing half truth's about the JFK assasination would be a gross understatement. In fact, some of the most chilling moments in this 'true' story are mere heresay. However, movies were not made to educate, but to entertain. And this movie comes through. Filled with numerous cameos (Walter Mathau, Jack Lemmon, John Candy, Donald Sutherland, Kevin Bacon) this ensemble piece really manages to focus upon one man's lone struggle to prove that the asssasination of JFK was not only done by someone else than Lee Harvey Oswald, but that the government knew Oswald was innocent. Second maybe to only To Kill A Mockingbird, this film delivers the best courtroom scene ever produced. And even though this movie winds much longer than 3 hours, there is not a dull moment. If you want to know the truth read a book, but if you want Oliver Stone's truth, watch JFK, Stone's best film and Kevin Costner's best too.
B000054OXU|1.0|There are two types of absolutely wretched music. There is music so bad, you can not listen to it for a single second and there is music so bad you can not stop listening to it. For years devoted fans have been replaying songs from Bob Dylan's Christian period or John Lennon's projects with a sizable Yoko contribution, their ears begging them to turn it off but there curiosity ablaze, in wonderment how such typically wonderful artists could produce such appalling music.<br />Canadian folkie, Neil Young's foray into head-scratching badness was his affair with Geffen records. For whatever reason, Mr. Young left his label, Reprise and signed with Geffen in 1980. He released two fairly boring records, 1980's Hawks and Doves and 1981's Reactor before things really got absurd. In 1982, he released Trans, an album coated in ear piercing, Kraftwerk-ish synthesizer treatment, completely uncharacteristic of the rugged Mr. Young. He followed it with 1983's Everybody's Rocking, an album that presented a series of frivolous rockabilly songs, presented without a hint of irony or cheekiness and 1985's Old Ways, an almost stereotypically mummbly country album.<br />That brings us to 1986's Landing on Water, an album that continues along the trail of Trans, only without being at least somewhat interesting. While Lading on Water continues the overwhelming emphasis on synthesizer gloss of its predecessor, in place of Trans' experimentalism, the album is guided by conformity to the lowest denominator of the recent new wave movement. Landing on Water is so overrun with high-pitched vocals, instrumental hyperactivity and glaring keyboards that the Thompson Twins might find it ostentatious. Meanwhile, Mr. Young's lyrics have dropped to the level of banal dreck like \\"I knew some people used to dance all night/But not me/I never knew if it was wrong or right/To be so free/I used to close my eyes/And try to hide from the light of love/Spent all my time with the darkness inside/But when I metyou girl.\\" With the exception of the raging cynicism of \\"Hippie Dream,\\" the garbly poet that used to be Neil Young is nowhere in sight. It seems as if Mr. Young intentionally meant himself to be unrecognizable.<br />He would later claim that he had grown to despise Geffen and was making such baffling creative decisions only to anger the corporation (who would sue Mr. Young shortly after the release of Landing on Water for providing them with music \\"unrepresentative of himself\\") and, listening to Landing on Water, it is not difficult to imagine Mr. Young and company absorbing everything absurd about new wave and parodying it, trying to imagine the look on poor, old David Geffen's face when he hears the final mix. Whatever his misguided intensions, this monster should be avoided by everyone except the most adamant Neil fans, ones dedicated enough to the singer-songwriter to want to explore his most perplexing eccentricities.
B00005B3Z6|5.0|If you are not ready for some gritty British \\"tellie\\" and some thick Manchester accents, pass this one by and instead buy the American Queer as Folk. But if you dare, it is great. If you've already viewed the American version, you'll find it was quite true to this original British version, though the characters in the original seem to be more edgy, darker. Also, the characters are not as developed and the entire project was not done with as high of a budget. However, it was a superb and ground-breaking project. It's very British and not as sweet as its American counterpart. It's raw and intense. My sister and others who have visited and love England cannot STAND the USA version of Queer as Folk, but think the UK version is brilliant. I like both.
B00001OH7M|5.0|The zoned-out photo of David Bowie on the cover of his 1969 album, Space Oddity, is a good implication of the product inside. Space Oddity is bizarre music. Take \\"Cygnet Committee\\" with its stark, cryptic, metaphysical language and dramatic cries of \\"I want to live/Live!\\" for example or \\"Unwashed and Someone Slightly Dazed,\\" the story of an aristocrat's daughter who encounters a dirt-encrusted sooth-sayer, described as a \\"phallus in pigtails\\" or \\"Memory of a Free Festival\\" with its chant of \\"The sun machine is coming down/And we're gonna have a party!\\" The hit title track, the dreamlike story of doomed astronaut, Major Tom, may actually be the most upbeat and conventional track on this remarkably creepy album.<br />Like its stunning follow-up, The Man Who Sold the World, Space Oddity is an early Bowie album that, despite not gathering the acclaim of latter efforts, such as Ziggy Stardust and Station to Station, simply blows me away. Mr. Bowie has never been renowned for the melodic, Syd Barrett-ish space-folk employed on this album but he surely knows how to compose such psychedelic-flavored folk very well. Space Oddity is wonderfully ambiguous, creepy and compelling.
B00005QG9J|5.0|This group would probably be horrified to hear that a 51-year old  rock-hippy freak LOVES this album. I was introduced to this group by my 20-year old nephew. Truth be told, it's so refreshing to find 'new' music as even Led Zeppelin gets old after 30 years. You find some loud-angry-rock, some lilting-accoustic-guitar, lovely vocals, interesting instrumentation, and solid song crafting here. This fits right along with other 'new' music I'm enjoying eg. The Calling. So, let's think of this as accessible music....for the young and even some of us old fogies.
0451457994|5.0|A scientific expedition uncovers a tall black monolith, purposefully buried below the moon's surface. Exposure to sunlight triggers a powerful radio signal from the mysterious object. NASA determines the signal's destination: Saturn. Although, Arthur C. Clarke's 2001: A Space Odyssey centers around the discovery of unquestionable proof of extraterrestrial intelligence, what is truly being commemorated in this science fiction classic is mankind's own investigation and realization of the wonders around him. In an age when so many other authors of speculative fiction were predicting nuclear extinction, Mr. Clarke took a very different stance, presenting a goodhearted, intelligent mankind ready to tread that final frontier and meet with what or who received that signal. From the account of man-apes using rocks and sticks as the first tools and weapons in the story's prelude to a human being looking down at an unexplored planet through the window of a space craft in its later parts, every vividly painted scene of this incredible novel seems to gasp at the scientific accomplishments of mankind and our potential for even greater enlightenment. Mr. Clarke believes that we are ready to join the other intelligent denizens of the universe and he wrote a heavily contemplative dazzler of a novel explaining why.

You should read it too (I learned that from this book. 'To' is wrong in this case! It should be 'too')<br />I hope you like this book as much as I did. My brother said he will read it too. He is going to MBA school. He is very smart too.
B000000WF0|5.0|Like many others, I bought The Verve's Urban Hymns in early 1998 because of \\"Bittersweet Symphony,\\" the fantastic ode to angst that became a minor hit. At that time, I was listening to such air-headed schlock as Dave Matthews Band and No Doubt. Needless to say, the somber, reflective brit pop album did not connect with me and I shelved it for several years. A few years later, Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon proverbially melted most of my CD collection. Since then, I have built what is, in my humble opinion, a collection of some of rock's most ingenious albums (Beatles, Bowie, Dylan, Young ect.) and become a bonafied classic rock geek. A few weeks ago, I was feeling a bit spiteful and wanted to hear the malicious refrains of \\"Bittersweet Symphony\\" and somehow let the track number slip past one. About seventy minutes later, I collected my jaw from the floor.<br />After spending countless hours listening to some of the most profound and expressive rock songs ever written, I now recognize that lead singer, Richard Ashcroft, was a man possessed by inspiration. Like George Harrison's All Things Must Pass or Leonard Cohen's The Future, Urban Hymns is the sound of a songwriter in his absolute prime. Mr. Ashcroft dispenses lines that magnificently inspire (\\"One day maybe you will cry again/Just like a child/You've got to tie yourself to the mast my friend/And the storm will end\\"), lyrics that pierce the heart (\\"All this talk of getting old/It's getting me down my love/Like a cat in a bag, waiting to drown/This time I'm coming down/And I hope you're thinking of me/As you lay down on your side/Now the drugs don't work/They just make you worse/But I know I'll see your face again\\") and shove-offs that cut to the bone (\\"There ain't no space and time/To keep our love alive/We have existence and it's all we share/There ain't no real truth/There ain't no real lies\\"). There is barely a verse on Urban Hymns that is not absolutely spectacular.<br />Meanwhile the band shows expertiseat backing such powerful words. They mold their electric sludge into foundation-shaking, sonic ripples on tracks such as \\"The Rolling People,\\" \\"Weeping Willow,\\" and the towering closer, \\"Come On,\\" a song that pushes forth youthful frustration as if it were an outtake from Who's Next. But they also show remarkable restraint and stunning gorgeousness on the more somber numbers such as \\"Sonnet,\\" \\"Lucky Man\\" and \\"This Time.\\" Whatever the mood, each song is given a radiant texture by this obviously gifted group of musicians.<br />It took me a while to realize it, but Urban Hymns is a stunning success; thirteen excellent tracks (no duds) that echo in the depths of the soul. As a fourteen-year old high school freshman, I had never encountered such quality (even though I was obtuse to it) and as a nineteen-year old hopeless rock acolyte, rarely do I come across anything so fine. I will greatly value this album for years to come.
0451450523|5.0|I saw the movie &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot; as a little girl, and I remember being enchanted by the beauty of the unicorn and Lady Amalthea.  I really wished I could be there, see her, touch her, be a part of the story.  One of the most vivid memories I have as a child was watching this movie for the first time, and being utterly heartbroken at the end.  But now that I have read this novel, I can pick up on the real meaning, and it's even more sad than before.  One of the most endearing qualities of this book is its ability to leave you desperate to read on, yet also break your heart at the same time.  It's so sad, I nearly cried.  It brought back memories of how I felt as a child when watching the film.  Yet unlike my childhood experience, I now felt like I understood why the story ended as it did.  It's definitely a story I'll never forget.
B00000J2SO|4.0|Appropriately titled, this is unpretentious, hard-driving rock and roll at its best. There's plenty here to satisfy the palate. Whether its the FM staple \\"Since You've Been Gone\\", the ominous \\"Eyes of the World\\", the alternatingly herky-jerky/melodic \\"Makin' Love\\", the knock-your-socks-off \\"Lost in Hollywood\\", the blues-tinged \\"Love's No Friend\\", or the high-flying \\"Danger Zone\\", Don Airey's melodious, textured keyboard passages provide the perfect backdrop for Ritchie Blackmore's squeaky-clean leads. A must for any fan of the \\"hard rock\\" genre.
B0000399WI|5.0|Any time I ask someone what their favorite movie is, Shawshank Redemption always comes up in their top five.  This movie is nothing short of brilliant.  Every single role is perfectly portrayed by each actor, from the leads, with Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, all the way down to the smallest supporting roles.  This is NOT your simple everyday prison drama.  It reaches for greater heights of filmaking and even larger themes, such as patience(a theme rarely touched upon in cinema), hope, perseverence, sacrifice, true friendship, and resolve(get busy living or get busy dying).  That's a long list and there's probably more.  Anyway, the basic jist of the story is an accountant(Tim Robbins) gets thrown in prison for murdering his wife and her lover(we don't know whether or not he did it, the camera cuts away as we see him loading his gun).  When he gets to prison, people start realizing that there is something different about him.  The danger and reality of his situation doesn't seem to affect him, it's as if he is separated from his surroundings and has his own island of calm and steady resolve. Interestingly, the film is narrated by a long time inmate(Morgan Freeman) who soon befriends Robbins.  This subtle touch helps add to the mystique of Robbins' character because we never really know who he is, or how he finds the quiet strength and hope deep down inside to keep him mentally apart from the horrifying prison life.  The story spans about 20-30 years, and we are submitted to a variety of plot turns, colorful characters, and most of all, the inescapable duration of time.  This film teaches not only the characters but the audience about patience.  It is long, but it has to be.  It shows us that every painful and seemingly hopeless turn of events only makes the moments of love and bonding sweeter, truly proving that we have to learn pain before we can appreciate pleasure.  The movie is filmed with that in mind: lowpoints and pitfalls followed by small, temporary redemptions.  But on the grand scale, it is all simply setting the scene for one of the greatest endings EVER put on film.  I won't even give a hint as to what happens, but the last twenty minutes of this film are so good, you'll simply sit there in awe as the credits roll.  It is truly that good.  Keep in mind that the ending would never be as sweet had so much pain not been endured before hand.  But oh that last shot, I'll probably never forget it, and neither will you.  Buy this movie now.  (NOTE: In terms of DVD extras, I think this is pretty thin, basically just the movie...so if you've got it on VHS, you might want to wait for the special edition.  But if you don't have this movie, what are you waiting for?  Order it as soon as possible.)
B000059TEQ|3.0|Yeah, this movie was kinda silly - predictable, corny, overwrought, and most of all, shamelessly manipulative. It had an extremely generic sounding title (kinda like naming a movie, \\"Action Adventure\\"), a repetitive and overly melodramatic musical score, amateurish storyline, stilted dialogue, and uninspired acting (except Ali Mcgraw - she CAN act). And what the heck did they mean by \\"Love means never having to say you're sorry!\\"? Now that really didn't make a lotta sense! God, the whole thing practically bordered on camp! But you know what, if you just go in to see it without any great expectations, but knowing full well what you're getting into, somehow it works! That's the genius of this movie - not great film making, just surprisingly entertaining fluff! Yeah, I hate to admit, I did enjoy it, even though I wasn't born when it was first released, and viewed the movie as a relic of an older generation. Ali Mcgraw was 32 at the time when the movie was made, playing the character of a girl between 20-25. Granted she was beautiful, but c'mon who were they fooling?? Still it's kind of hard to imagine any other actress who could play the Jennifer Cavaleri role better. Ms. Mcgraw with her cute smile, sweet voice, beautiful long hair, and dewey eyes helps make you overlook the obvious, well almost.... It was also kind of interesting to see a cameo appearance by a very young Tommy Lee Jones (with hair no less!). And it's interesting to know that the Oliver Barrett character was inspired by former Vice President Al Gore. I started thinking about this movie again when I saw the 2002 Oscars, and saw a very aged and bloated Ryan O'Neil and Ali Mcgraw (both in their 60's) coming on stage as presenters with the musical score from Love Story playing as they appeared. It was so surreal. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry, kinda like my reaction to this movie....
0783225881|5.0|Everyone thinks this movie is about baseball, but it isn't, not really.  It is about much more.  It is about fathers and sons, and how baseball, since the early 20th century, is able to tie them together, even when they can't bring themselves to speak to one another.  Every time I see this movie, I am reminded of my own relationship with my father, and the ups and downs we have traversed in our relationship.  No matter how much we would argue, and antagonize each other, we always had baseball to fall back on as our common denominator.  In this movie, Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner) is so haunted by the mistakes he made in his relationship with his father, that he manifests The Voice, which tells him to build a baseball diamond in the middle of his cornfield.  To show you how bad his relationship with his dad had gotten, Ray tells James Earl Jones's character that he once refused to play a game of catch with him.  But by building the field, Ray helps to resurrect Shoeless Joe Jackson, his father's disgraced baseball idol, and maybe make a little bit of ammends.  Ray gives Shoeless Joe, and the other &quot;Black Socks&quot; players a chance at redemption by being able to play in this magical field.  Through other acts that Ray commits on order from The Voice, he helps others fulfill their baseball tinted dreams.  The others being a writer, Terrance Mann (James Earl Jones), who yearns for the days of Ebbets Field and Jackie Robinson, and a country doctor and former minor league baseball player, Moonlight Graham (Burt Lancaster), whose one unfulfilled wish is to bat against a big league pitcher.  During the movie, we are led to believe that he commits these acts out of some random nature, the only reason being that The Voice told him to.  But in the end of the movie, we, along with Ray, realize that everything he has done is connected, and has a reason.  And it all comes back to fathers and sons, and the dreams we share, and our almost spiritual connection through the greatest game ever dreamt by God or man, baseball.  If you are a man, and as a boy you ever played catch with your father, then this film should touch you in a very personal way.  If you shed no tear at the wonderful ending, then you aren't a real man.

157492589X|5.0|When McMurtry's book --for which he won the Pulitzer Prize-- came out the New York Times Book reviewer said that at 800 pages it was far too short. It was, indeed. The film is as good as the book. I cannot imagine better casting, better direction and greater fidelity to the book.
B00003CXXP|1.0|Typically, I try to watch a movie twice before forming an opinion. <br />I couldn't bring myself to watch &quot;A.I.&quot; again.<br />Sure, the effort was there (unlike Spielberg's lazy &quot;Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot;), but the movie didn't have clear sense of what it was trying to be. Was it a fairy tale? A dark twist on that genre? It alternated between polar opposites too drastically to be coherent, and managed to be boring all the while.<br />Other elements came out of left field (&quot;Then a thousand years go by and hyper-intelligent robots make everything all better!&quot;) interrupting what little narrative flow there was. I like to be surprised, not flabbergasted.<br />Another Steven Spielberg film, &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark,&quot; is my favorite movie, and one of the biggest blockbusters of all time. The consensus is that Spielberg has decided to stop making crowd-pleasing films. <br />Mission accomplished.

B00005JKQX|5.0|I'm no judge of movies as I'm easily entertained and really just go to them to veg out for a while--movies are, after all--only passive entertainments--so I always get a kick out of those who take them so seriously (along with their own opinions about them). If I want serious narrative or story art, I can always read War and Peace or Madame Bovary. (That having been said, here I am writing a serious review about a serious movie!)<br />But getting back to the main point, I really enjoyed this movie about a brilliant mathematician's meteoric rise to worldwide fame and academic renown, and equally quick descent into madeness. You wouldn't think anybody could make a film about a mathematician so dramatic, but the life of John Nash wasn't that of your usual cloistered academic. He was certifiably bonkers, and much of the movie is devoted to this long phase of Nash's life.<br />I have some psychological background myself, and if I have one gripe about the movie is that the portrayal of paranoid schizophrenia is a little schizophrenic itself, but I didn't mind that too much (again, it's a movie, I don't even take my own opinions that seriously). So I'll just mention a classic comment by the famous British psychologist R.D. Laing, who worked on schizophrenia much of his career: \\"A schizophrenic is a person the totality of whose existence is split in two main ways: there is a rent in his relationship with his world, and there is a rent in his relationship with himself.\\" In that sense, the movie did a good job of portraying what schizophrenia would actually be like.<br />The performances by Crowe and Connelly are believeable and intense, and Ed Harris in his supporting role does his usual great job as one of Nash's imaginary characters. The guy who played Nash's imaginary college friend is also good (unfortunately I don't know the actor's name).<br />Nash's struggle with his illness and his eventual recovery and return to work at Princeton, and ultimately, his awarding of the Nobel Prize, make for an absorbing and touching story, sort of like a \\"Horatio Alger,\\" or perhaps, \\"Rocky of the psycho wards\\" story. The last time I saw this good a movie about mental illness was the Robin Williams film \\"Awakenings,\\" and going way back, \\"I Never Promised You a Rose Garden.\\"<br />This one might top them all, and I agree with many other people that Crowe and Connelly are probably deserving of Academy awards for their performances.<br />All in all, a great movie and I'm glad the producer and director had the nerve to do something different from the usual Hollywood fare.the Nobel Prize, make for an absorbing and touching story, sort of like a \\"Horatio Alger,\\" or perhaps, \\"Rocky of the psycho wards\\" story.

0684833395|5.0|This is the story of a fictional bomber squadron on the Italian island of Pianosa. The characters are many and diverse, and their problems even moreso. But wow - this is quite unlike any other novel in the history of American literature. We sympathize with only a few characters, mainly Yossarian and the chaplain, the seemingly only sane characters in the entire novel. Everyone else - all of the generals, majors, colonels, captains, pilots, privates, PFCs, etc. - they are all just a little bit off their rocker, and it can make for such an interesting reading experience. We are being shown the true madness of war - the concept of \\"patriotism\\" and all armed conflict is challenged, because, as Yossarian says, it matters not what side they're on, because both sides want you dead. <br />Sometimes the dialogue is absolutely hilarious when two of these \\"insane\\" characters get together for a conversation. And other times the narration makes you double over and wretch in disgust, (e.g. Yossarian tending to Snowden's wounds and that eventual outcome - if you've read you know to what I am referring). Now I wasn't alive when this was originally published, but I can only imagine the praise that it would have garnered. Nothing has ever so perfectly captured the madness and irrationality of war. And Catch-22, now a part of our national lexicon, was the pretense (in this novel) used by our \\"insane\\" characters to argue their point and keep the men fighting. If you haven't read \\"Catch-22\\", this may be making no sense. I leave you with only an example, because it almost defies explanation. Yossarian is a bombardier who doesn't want to fly more missions (the number to get you a ticket home is continually being raised). Learning of a proposed dangerous run to Bologna, he sneakes into the map room and moves the pins on the map. The next day commanding officers see the map, think that they've taken Bologna already, and cancel the mission. <br />You'll constantly be furrowing your brow, butin the end, as I did, you'll understand what Heller's been saying all along. And you won't ever look at war in the same way.

0345448898|4.0|Like many other people who read these books, I came to them through a Harry Potter-related recommendation.  Pullman is technically more proficient than Ms. Rowling, but, as it sometimes goes, the training shows, as do the clear influences of William Blake and Paradise Lost.  More than the plot line itself, those three things, the training, Blake, and the Milton, are what I think of when I think of this book.  To contrast with the Potter books, these seem much less young adult fiction than an English major's attempt to write proper young adult fiction.  The sense of whimsy that made the Potter books such fun is absent here, lost in the almost overweening structure.  I'm trying not to pan these books too badly, as I rather enjoyed the series as a whole, but overall they're no more than a placeholder, albeit a quality one.
B000055ZGY|5.0|Twitch of the Death Nerve is a black comedy. It finds humor in things that wouldn't usually be funny. Bava toys with the cliche's of the genre. Contrary to other reviewers, Twitch of the Death Nerve was not the first body count film. Bava's own Blood and Black was. I saw Blood and Black Lace before this. This has one of most ingenious giallo scripts, on par with Dario Argento's Tenebre. Without Mario Bava there would be no Dario Argento. Yes, Friday the 13th series did copy much of the methods of death in this movie. The ending is the most obvious bit of black comedy, the others deal mostly with the cliche's of the genre. A superb giallo. This has some substance, dealing a lot with human greed. A must-see for die-hard horror fans interested in tracing the evolution of the genre. Yes, the sound is horrible, but as for the movie itself I give it a very high rating. You have to have a black sense of humor to enjoy this. Those who take themselves too seriously should pass.

All the acting in this movie is superb, but the job that Kevin Spacey does is second to none. I would recommend this movie to anyone, regardless of the genre you normally prefer. This is moviemaking in its finest form.
B000002LCK|3.0|Where is the original Temptation and Confusion?????<br />Instead of reworking these tracks, they should have reworked tracks that were available on their standard catalog. But temptation is from an EP that is long out of print and Confusion was a 12&quot; single that I have never seen on CD. <br />Because these tracks are so hard to find, I am only giving this compilation 3 stars since it was a horrible decision not to also include the original versions of these songs.

B00005U11Z|1.0|When I heard that Journey was coming out with a DVD, I was ecstatic. &quot;Wow!&quot; I thought. &quot;Steve Perry, Jonathan Cain, Neal Schon, Ross Valory and Steve Smith! This gonna be great!&quot; But when I signed on to order it and checked out some of the other reviews, I decided to check out &quot;Arrival&quot; as well, and when I did, I was in shock. &quot;Oh, my!&quot; I thought. &quot;Neal Schon, Jonathan Cain, Deen Costrovano, Ross Valory and Steve Augeri! This can't be right.&quot; So, I asked someone at a record store, and they told me that Steve Augeri replaced Steve Perry in 1998. So, I asked what else was available, and I was told that every album Steve Perry recorded with them (&quot;Infinity to &quot;Trial By Fire&quot;) was available. I also asked someone if they'd seen the new lineup. They said, &quot;Yes,&quot; and they said it was great. Initially, I wasn't sure until I saw VH1's Behind The Music. &quot;What a big joke!&quot; I thought. And after I saw that segment, I bought every Steve Perry-era Journey CD (&quot;Infinity&quot; to &quot;Trial By Fire&quot;), and all of Steve Perry solo albums. &quot;The Steve Perry-era?&quot; The Real Journey. &quot;The Augeri outfit?&quot; Journey, 2001: A Big Joke.

B00004YKUY|1.0|I believe that every band who gets a break in the music business has their time in the sun, and when that time comes, they can be on top of the world, and when that time goes, it's the end. When one's hot, he's hot. When one's not, they might as well dig themselves a career grave, and that's how I feel about this band.<br />   Even though the rythmn section is great, the lead singer, Steve Augeri, is lacking. Even though this band is Neal Schon's band (built around his amazing guitar playing), Steve Perry stole the title right out from under Neal Scon when he (Steve Perry) joined in 1978. Steve Perry kept the amazing title of \\"The Leader of The Band\\" until his unfortunate departure in 1998. A twenty-year career as the frontman of what used to be one of rocks great bands (until Steve Augeri joined) is quite an accomplishment. <br />    Journey was an '80s arena rock band who recorded a reunion album in 1996. So, it started in 1978 and ended in 1998. Seems like a long enough Journey to me.

B00000IQC8|5.0|In my opinion, Clerks is one of my favorite movies, The story is about Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran) and Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson.) and what happens to them in the span of a day working at the Quick Stop Groceries and the RST video. During this time they manage to play hockey on the roof, go to a funeral home and  complain about their annoying costumers.
0375805613|5.0|This was one of my favorite books when I was little, and now my 18 month old son is just as amused with it as I was. This is not a scary book, as the title suggests, but actually a cute book that will have your youngster giggling in no time. 2 thumbs up from Reed and Mommy!
B00003CXI1|4.0|I think everyone was way to critical of this movie. First of all, any book adapted to the screen will be lacking. Endings have been changed, characters have been altered and the actor usually playing your favorite character is not the person you envisioned in your mind. Second, scenes had to be omittied. It's a 300 page book with more twists and turns than most writers could imagine. Had every detail been left in, we would have sat in the theater for a good 4 hours at least. Which is fine with most adults, but imagine trying to keep your 5 year old interested. Third, I was thrilled that they picked inexperienced child actors. It wouldln't have been nearly as believeable had they used Hollywood born and raised kids who know no emotion but the scripted ones. Fourth, it was done the way the author saw it fit to be done. She oversaw every detail of every shot. Who's to argue with that? I loved the movie. I loved it more each time I saw it. It made the magic come to life for me and made me realize how angry I was that I didn't get a letter from Hogwart's on my birthday. It was phenomenal. And I can't wait for the following movies.
B000001F7R|5.0|This is what good rock should be.  Raw sound, high energy riffs and great melodies.  Forget that wussrock from Hysteria, this is the stuff.  This is &quot;the great rock album&quot; of their trio of great albums, followed by High N Dry &quot;the great transitional album&quot;, then Pyromania &quot;the great overproduced poprock album&quot;.  Get this.

B00005MG2Y|5.0|This one you defantly dont want to pass up..  the newset song on the radio, \\"My December\\" has got the tightest beat I've heard in a long time.  Be sure to add this one to your collection.
0156711427|5.0|Forster writes late in the book,&quot;...composed in English to indicate His universality.&quot;  But does using English really make one belong?  In the book, all the primary characters communicate with one another in English but miscomprehension abounds; there is a disconnect.  The disconnect is both vertical and horizontal: a disconnect between the English and the Indians but also one among the English and among the Indians.  And, here, there, moments of reaching out to the other interrupt the prevailing tension.<br />This is the first Forster book that I've read completely.  I have seen all the movie adaptations of his books (except A Pssage To India) and have enjoyed them thoroughly.  But an attempt at reading A Room With A View wasn't at all successful (stopped twice at chapter 3) and I gave up (perhaps a little too hastily) reading any of the books themselves.  Recently however, I have become intrigued with Indian authors and books about India and suddenly, A Passage to India popped into my mind and I picked up a copy.  Forster's prose reminds me of F. Scott Fitzgerald's  in its<BR>nuanced simplicity although the former can at times become somewhat abstract.   Forster conveys the complexity of colonial India but the read was spectacularly easy, aided by many humorous points.   Halfway through the book, I was so impressed by the book and wondered if it had made it onto the Modern Library's best 100 works of fiction in the 20th century.  And it did.
B00005Y1XZ|5.0|I agree with the other fans of this album (CD?)<BR>It's one of the first CDs I bought when the medium changed. It was a &quot;must have&quot; in my collection.  I'd add that &quot;Little Triggers&quot; is one of Elvis' better slow/somber songs. It's an early exploration of the catchy extended metaphor that dominates much of his material.  This is a good launch into many of the songs on &quot;Get Happy&quot; and most of &quot;Imperial Bedroom.&quot;  Maybe it's that you can really hear the pain coming through the anger on this one thus fleshing out the angry young man mystique.
B00005RYLE|5.0|...this was my first horror film, and I'll admit I was a little skeptical about this movie when I saw it when I was 5. At first I didn't like the movie, but I was scared of it. It was weird I know. But when they released this dvd w/the book of the dead I figured since everyone raves about it, I'll buy it and watch it again. When I saw it again, I'll tell you, I was blown away, it was a great movie. The effects were great and it still scared ...me. This is my all time favorite horror flick. I recommend this movie set, which is limited edition, to anyone.   Especially if you want to get scared out of your life! It's a 5 out of 5! Greatest movie of horror, it's a classic!
B000003S5H|4.0|When you think of the French, your first thought is of rude, smelly people who find Jerry Lewis funny for reasons unknown to anyone but themselves.  You most definitely do not think of musical prowess, yet Air has put a change to that way of thinking.  After first impressing with Premieres Symptomes, they dazzle with much of Moon Safari.  The first single, \\"Sexy Boy,\\" is the high point of the album, and afforded Air some cool cachet once it was remixed by indie icon Beck.  The track is extremely catchy, \\"Air-y\\" even, with its buoyant keyboards and indecipherable French lyrics.   \\"La Femme D'Argent\\" has an excellent opening bassline and a cool '70's soundtrack vibe to it.  It's easy to see why Moon Safari impressed enough to land Air the gig of composing the soundtrack and score to Sofia Coppola's '70's period piece The Virgin Suicides.   \\"All I Need\\" and \\"You Make It Easy\\" are reminiscent of Portishead and of Beth Orton's work with the Chemical Brothers, and they set the mood for much of the album. While \\"Remember\\" may be the only misstep (and unfortunately it foreshadows their later work), many of the other tracks, including \\"Talisman\\" and \\"New Star In the Sky,\\" have an understated, sublime feel, proving Air to be a force and making Moon Safari the perfect late night chill-out album.
B00005R2M3|3.0|Shakira's first two (well three if you count MTV Unplugged) albums were superb. I could find no faults what so ever with them and I'd totally recommend them. Sadly, \\"Laundry Service\\", Shakira's first English album, doesn't quite live up to her previous album's potentials.<BR>She's gone from being compared to Alanis Morrisette and other \\"good\\" singers to being compared with the likes of Britney Spears (now that is worrying).<BR> She clearly can't express herself properly in English and it ends up in a big pile of lame songs. Put a side the 4 Spanish songs and the two singles (\\"Whenever Wherever\\" and \\"Underneath Your Clothes\\"), there is nothing very interesting on this album.<BR> My advise to Shakira would be to dump the English (and the blonde hair!) and go back to her roots!<BR> ALBUM PRICE: 1/5- It won't play on your PC<BR>SONG QUALITY: 3/5- 6 Good songs<BR>ALBUM LENGTH: 3/5- Average length<BR>TOTAL: 3/5
B00003CXRM|5.0|Even though the movie had been released nearly 2 years ago, I still hadnt seen it. It came on tv about 2 weeks ago, and since I sat down and watched it that first time, I've bought the dvd and watched it about 10 times over. Usually PG-13 movies dont do much for me, but when a movie comes along with a great story, great characters, and great writing and directing, its destined for....well, greatness. This movie deserved at least one Oscar, and in my opinion, O Brother is a better, more enjoyable movie than The Coen Brothers' other success, Fargo. This movie has the same cooky style to it, focusing on a culture and region, and exaggerating that. Fargo made hilarious the already wacky accent of Minnesotans, this time around the Coens' made hilarious the already wacky lingo of the south, and bringing light to a dark time known as the depression. I've heard people were offended by the KKK scene, when all the Coen Brothers did was poke fun at the clan the whole time. If you get offended at that, I pray you dont turn on the tv or walk out youre front door, cause reality is much more offensive than a humorous PG-13 movie. George Clooney shows a whole different side of his ability as an actor, and I have new respect for him as a comedic actor, because I know not just anyone could pull off what he has as the dapper man he portrays. If you havent seen this movie yet, you REALLY should. Bravo to the Coens' for having the guts, brains and imagination, to make a movie based around the great Odyssey. Oh, and this is a review of the dvd..... Dolby Digital's good, but DTS is better, and this dvd has it, that's a plus. There's a neat little behind the scenes featurette, featuring the stars and the Brothers, and a cool little extra about the post production process, which talks about the things they were able to do to the movie since it was shot digitally, rather than on regular film. Love this DVD!!
B000001GBJ|5.0|Every song in this CD has a story to tell you.  It kept me moving through the memories lanes.  It is beautiful, passionate but also has a sad melody to it.  It reminds of the Titanic movie, It is sad but unforgettable.

0792842499|5.0|To me,this is the best western ever made. Clint Eastwood,Lee Van Cleef and,espesially,Ely Wallach made this movie a must-see.<BR>Great score by Ennio Morricone ,and,of course,Sergio Leone deserves the highest praise for directing. A true classic!
B00005JKJA|5.0|Mulholland Dr is, IMO, the finest, most intriguing picture released in 2001. This is very important work. Here is a film about the things we see when we die. The experience of MULHOLLAND DR leaves much to interpretation, but my opinion says it's all an Afterlife Experience, NOT a dream as most suggest. In that light, MULHOLLAND DR has no holes in its plot, leaves no stone unturned, is fully resolved & oh so tragic. --Everything about this film is beautiful. From Angelo Badalamenti's haunting, heart-rending score, to Mary Sweeny's crisp editing, to the lush, eclectic cinematography, to Lynch's classic-style directing (some of these shots are phenomenal! The Oscar was his!), to the awe-inspiring performances from a brilliant cast. Naomi Watts not being nominated for an Oscar is absolute horse puckey. She leaves us breathless, shattered for her life & fantasy, idealism grounded in failure, obsession & love. --If you've never seen MULHOLLAND DR, this is a perfect way to do so. You'll need to sit through this several times, and DVD is the only way to do so economically. This is a sparkling diamond, and the best 2001 addition to one's DVD library, followed by MOULIN ROUGE! --These are films with replay value. Must see!

And don't even sit down for &quot;Smallcreep's Day.&quot;  This 25-minute mini- musical based on the book of the same name has all the benefits of the first five songs, but with a better solo for the guitar and a story line that makes it all the more interesting.

B000062XFG|4.0|Many people don't like Season 2 because it changed Doctor characters and it had its fill of \\"bottle shows\\", however there's still some really good episodes in Season 2.<br />For example, \\"Where Silence Has Lease\\" is a good one where the Enterprise gets hurled into a void when they're confronted by an alien in the void that puts the crew through a deadly experiment.<br />Another good episode is \\"Elementary Dear Data\\" where Data is involved in a Sherlock Holmes holodeck adventure and we see the debut of the Moriarty villian.<br />\\"Loud as a Whisper\\" isn't bad either when a deaf mediator tries to bring peace to a war-torn planet, but his interpreters are all killed in a ambush. Cool on-planet episode with aliens.<br />\\"A Matter of Honor\\" is probably one of the best episodes of Season 2 when Riker takes part in kind of an exchange program on a Klingon BoP and then is forced to attack the Enterprise to prove his honor.<br />\\"The Message of a Man\\" is an interesting courtroom drama where they have to prove that Data is a valuable asset to the crew instead of just a machine.<br />\\"Contagion\\" isn't all that bad either when a probe makes the Enterprise defenseless against a Romulan Warbird.<br />\\"Time Squared\\" is a memorable episode where Piccard's duplicate from the near future is in the present warning the Enterprise of its impending destruction against a blackhole-like anonomoly.<br />\\"The Icarus Factor\\" is a good one where Worf is challenged by the Klingon council and Riker's father shows up with some age ol' grudges.<br />\\"Q Who?\\" is another one of the classic episodes in which Q sends the Enterprise into the far reaches of space to make first contact with the Borg.<br />\\"The Emissary\\" was one of my old favorites when Worf meets his sole mate, a fiesty Klingon female who has an attitude. I'm alway impartial to the Klingon-heavy episodes.<br />\\"Peak Performance\\" is also one of the great episodes where Riker takes over an Constellation-class ship to battle the Enterprise in a wargame when the game is rudely interrupted by a Ferengi Marauder.<br />So in reality half of the episodes are pretty good. The other half are either filler or bottle shows that either may or may not be good. Some have to do with mysterious illnesses, holodeck problems, or Lwaxana Troi garbage. The pluses are that we finally get Guinnan and Ten-Forward in the series. Something sorely missing from the first season.n a wargame when the game is rudely interrupted by a Ferengi Marauder.<br />So in reality half of the episodes are pretty good.

B000002UA9|4.0|By the time the Beatles recorded this album they had scored a minor UK hit with &quot;Love Me Do&quot; and a #1 UK hit with &quot;Please Please Me.&quot; The legend is that the group recorded the album in one day, because EMI still didn't want to spend too much money on the project. What a deal EMI got, eh? Most of the Lennon-McCartney originals are fantastic, especially &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot;, &quot;There's a Place&quot;, &quot;Do You Want to Know a Secret&quot;, and the two earlier hits. Also, this album contains the Beatles most energetic performances on cover versions like &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; and &quot;Boys&quot;. Although PLEASE PLEASE ME pales in comparison to the band's later work, it certainly is a harbinger of things to come.
B0000630YA|5.0|The sound of this remaster is gorgeous! I usually ho-hum at remasters, and can't tell much difference, but this is an exception. The sounds are sharper, crisper. Little sounds and lost instrumentation have been brought up from the background. and some of the weird noises have been given more prominence.  I listened to both CD versions back to back, and I could hear major differences. The original CD seems to have been designed to suit more classic rock tastes, but this one seems to have been mastered to suit the tastes of Alice fans. <br />This reissue was produced by Brian Nelson and David McLees. Sound was produced by Bill Inglot. It was remastered by Dan Hersch at Digiprep-not by Bob Ezrin as the editorial review incorrectly states (check the liner notes before reviewing!)<br />It comes with a ten page booklet with some nice archive photos (that made me wish there were more photos and that they were larger!) from the \\"Welcome To My Nightmare\\" tour and a text piece by Jeffery Morgan-which basically praises Alice to death and doesn't tell fans anything they didn't already know-but it's still nice to read.<br />The three alternate songs were taken from Alice's ABC TV Special, \\"The Nightmare,\\" co-starring Vincent Price, which was first broadcast 4/25/75. This is not the \\"Welcome To My Nightmare\\" concert video-this is a series of vignettes acted out by Cooper and Price that is nearly impossible to find by conventional means. Maybe this CD will generate interest and they will re-release it. In any case, they do not detract from the album at all...in fact, they add a little closure to it. <br />\\"Devil's Food\\" has alternate lyrics-probably mandated by television executives, but in my opinion the lyrics are even more potentially offensive! Leave it to Alice to pull that off. The music is different as well, trippier, more far out. The end of \\"Devil's Food\\" is played out without the Vincent Price monologue. \\"Cold Ethyl\\" is much the same with perhaps a more enthusiastic performance from Alice, he really gets into the \\"ooooooh so cold\\" bit. \\"The Awakening\\" has radically altered lyrics that fit just as well...it is a sweeter, more innocent alternate ending to the nightmare closed out by Vincent Price's lovely voice telling Alice the nightmare is never over. <br />Now as to the original tracks on the album: The title song begins the album with a whispery invitation to sample some of the disturbing images in Alice's haunted toy box. The song features creepy guitar work by Dick Wagner and Steve Hunter and ends with a rousing fanfare of horns welcoming you into the nightmare. The bizarre guitar work is really brought out in the remaster, up to the level of the horns, it gives it a much weirder sound.<br />Next up is \\"Devil's Food,\\" a song about the Devil getting ready for a hot date or maybe a hot meal. As the song winds down Alice treats us to a monologue by Vincent Price, a full eight years before Mr. Jackson would do the same on his \\"Thriller\\" album. He portrays a museum curator with an obsession with spiders. This leads us right into \\"The Black Widow,\\" Alice's Spider King who demands that we love him or be devoured. The little sounds are really brought out here and Alice's vocals sound more distinct. The two guitars are more clearly separated.<br />The next three songs are fun tunes that add musical diversity to the album. \\"Only Women Bleed\\" was Alice's first ballad and would mark the beginning of a string of melancholy hits throughout the rest of the seventies. \\"Some Folks\\" is a Broadway kick-line number about anger, violence, lust and pain. \\"Department of Youth\\" is a pre-teen anthem about kids running the world-the scariest thought on the album! All of them sound crisper and more precise. The violins on \\"Only Women Bleed\\" are much more prominent.<br />The chilling mood returns with \\"Cold Ethyl,\\" the most upbeat song about necrophilia ever written. \\"One thing I miss is Cold Ethyl and her skeleton kiss...We met last night making love bythe refrigerator light.\\" There is a woman moaning excitedly under the music in this song-which is really brought out in this remaster. I like the extra edge it gives the song.<br />\\"Long Ago,\\" \\"Stephen\\" and \\"The Awakening\\" form a story about a little boy (or is he a great big man?) with some sort of multiple personality disorder who can't figure out why all his friends are gone, all his toys are broken and people keep dying, until...well, buy the album and see for yourself. \\"The Awakening\\" is one of the coolest punch-lines to an album I've ever heard. The eerie tone of these songs is served well by the sharp ultra clear remastering of this CD. The creepy sounds, hidden voices, and far off calling of Stephen's mother are all more prominent in the mix of sounds. It made the listening experience all the more chilling.<br />\\"Escape\\" closes out the album and is about escaping from the nightmare. Because Alice at heart is a sweet guy all his stories have happy endings. \\"Welcome to My Nightmare\\" is no exception. In the end, we wake up, and wipe the cobwebs from our eyes, and realize that we are back in the daytime world. Don't worry; we can get back to the nightmare if we need to. After all, aren't nightmares just a way to escape from our sometimes mundane lives?<br />If you are debating getting this remaster because you already have the CD of \\"Welcome To My Nightmare\\"-and it is already a perfect CD, I urge you to take the plunge. I believe this is even better, or at least as good, but delightfully different. The three alternate songs are a must for any fan. The improved clarity of sound, and the brightening of some of the background instrumentation make it well worth buying.

B00005JKED|1.0|I fortunately discipline myself to rent a DVD before purchasing one with few exceptions. This was a waste of money to rent, and I would not recommend purchasing the movie.

Insofar as an academy award for best actor--it had to be a political pick as surely quality acting was not criteria for this winner.
6305078564|5.0|The Storyline:<BR>Elizabeth Bennet is the heroine of this early 1800's English novel by Jane Austen.  She comes from a middle-class family composed of her father (intelligent though overly complacent), her mother (a very foolish woman), and four sisters (Jane, Mary, Kitty and Lydia). Jane, the eldest is the beauty of the family. She is also sweet natured, modestly intelligent and too willing (according to Elizabeth) to see the good in every person or situation. Elizabeth is second eldest. She is very pretty also, highly intelligent and views the world and its inhabitants in something closer to their true light. Elizabeth's younger sisters, like their mother are all very foolish in their various ways. Thus all of the grace and wit of the Bennet family is clustered within the father and two oldest daughters.  <br />Mr. Darcy is the hero of the story. He is a man of good character, very intelligent, handsome and wealthy. But Mr. Darcy suffers from a misplaced pride in his position and is lacking in some of the social graces.  Elizabeth Bennet suffers from a different disability. She has extremely high standards and is easily prejudiced to disapproval when faced with those who apparently fall short. According to Mr. Darcy, her 'good opinion is seldom granted'.   Elizabeth is temporarily attracted to the 'amiable' but evil Wickham who 'has all the appearance of goodness', but in who's character she was easily deceived.   Gradually however, the two lovers find each other and we are presented with the expected happy ending when Darcy and Elizabeth, and Jane and Mr. Bingley, Darcy's excellent and also quite wealthy friend are married. Oh joy!<br />The production:<BR>Simply fantastic!  Virtually all of the performers are truly excellent.  Lady Catherine (a somewhat minor character I know) is very special, especially in the 'prettyish kind of a little wilderness' scene at Elizabeth's home.  Although the performers in the 1980 version with Elizabeth Garvie seem to be somewhatmore attractive overall, their acting skills don't in general measure up to those in this production.  I think Jennifer Ehle made a fine Lizzie and for those Garvie fans out there, I agree that she is also wonderful (I especially like her singing in that version).  If we were to replace the Elizabeth and Jane characters in the BBC production with Garvie and Jane from the 1980 version that would probably work very well also.<br />I must mention the horses.  For me the sounds of the horses and the countryside scenes with carriages rolling across tree-shaded culverts in the woods are a great addition to the production.  And the gallops in the fields.  And Lizzie wandering in the field with horses grazing nearby.  Just wonderful. ....<br />The DVD:<BR>This review is of the full-screen DVD version ...I was fortunate with this purchase since the full-screen version is now somewhat rare and sells on the used market for exorbitant prices.)  Picture quality is excellent!  Sound quality is good although in some of the quiet, conversational scenes I notice a background hum or buzz.  It's not a problem for me but might be for those with a better ear and more exotic sound systems.  A friend purchased the P&P DVD recently (the widescreen version) and doesn't like hers as well.  The 2.35:1 aspect ratio is not appealing on ordinary size TV's and there may be some loss of color also.
6305363668|4.0|I saw this film for the first time about nine months ago. In my opinion this proves that a sci-fi film doesn't really need CG images to make it a popular film like so many of them today. I instantly fell in love with the dark, dingy over populated, polluted cityscape that is Los Angeles. I thought Rugter Hauer did a excellent job as portraying Roy Batty, the leader of the renegade Replicants. <BR> After I saw this I became a Ridley Scott fan (litterly) overnight. I think it's a perfect blend of sci-fi and the grim outlook of the future. (Which probably in the next fifty years is quite possible.) And a combinaton of an intriguing story makes for a great film. It's definately worth a look. Who know's, you might get hooked like I did:)<BR> Hey, this movie was placed on the National Film Registry at the Library of Congress as being &quot;cultrally, historically, or esthetically significant.&quot; I guess that mean't somebody thought it was important. . . <BR> And for those looking for a little bit further insight, this movie inspired a by now well-known Konami video game producer, the great Hideo Kojima, (does Metal Gear Solid ring a bell?) to create a game called Snatcher. Those of you who might still have a Sega CD system in your possesion might recall this one. It has Blade Runner written all over it. Not in a bad way, but in a good way. Like it pays tribute to this film masterpiece.<BR> As with any movie, there could be some flaws depending on what you like. If you're looking for intense action, you won't find it here. There's a couple shooting scenes, that's it. The movie moves at a slow pace, which I thought was cool because it showed off a decrepid LA, the hi-tech, but yet not-to-far-off looking gizmo's they had. (Like the Voight-Kampff [or something like that] machine.) And then it picks up in certain parts, mainly the end. My only real complaint is that the Director's Cut is only available in widescreen. But it's still worth a look. Check it out.

0694003611|5.0|I started reading this book to my daughter when she was about 8 months old.  She is now 21 months old and still loves it.  In fact, she chooses this book every time to read.  I think the book's rhythmic cadence explains the appeal of this book.  It's a definite must-have!
0971855110|5.0|FlyLady has been such a help and inspiration not just to me but also to several of my friends.  Read her book; join her website; and watch your life change.  She turns you from a martyred, reluctant house cleaner to someone who loves her home and wants to make it a beautiful place for her family.  I've read several other organizational books and tried to put them into practice, and yet things just kep getting messier.  FlyLady's system, encouragement, and wisdom made more of a difference for me in one month than anything else I've ever tried.
B000001FTD|4.0|If you like early thrash metal than you'll deffinatley enjoy this CD.  This CD is full of heavy riffs and it's fast as anything Anthrax has ever done.  It starts out with \\"Among The Living\\" and as the song progresses it just gets faster and faster with some lyrics that are as metal as anything.  It's good that they kept the CD short because every track is pretty damn good I gotta say; there's deffinatley no filler.  Only thing that might dissapoint some people is that this CD sounds really 80's (especially the vocals).  Over all, if you like thrash metal...get it!
B00000J7S8|5.0|Diana simply never misses a beat on this terrific collection. Fans of real music can attest to this and the unconverted will never be the same again! My favorite tracks here; the Jobim flavored &quot;Let's Face The Music and Dance&quot;, the almost acapella title track, and the sly, funky rhythmic vamp &quot;Popsicle Toes&quot; show just how versatile a vocalist and pianist Ms. Krall is and round out this fine, flawless collection of jazz/pop gems. A winner from start to finish, &quot;When I Look....&quot; is  not only a fine showcase for Diana's skills, but also features support from a stellar group of backing musicians, most notably the brilliant Russell Malone on guitar. A masterpiece that will never grow old.
B00005JHAB|5.0|Hey, I'm not much of a date movie person, but this was good. Jennifer Lopez really had it in this one. Mary(Lopez) is a wedding planner who one day gets into accident when a doctor(Mcconaughy) saves her life. They fall in love and she finds out that he's one of the grooms at one of her weddings she's planning. A pretty predictable ending but the rest of it wasn't. I think it deserves two thumbs up!
B00004TLMC|5.0|As you all well know, I'm a Kubrick Fan of the highest order and this final masterpiece from the finest filmmaker in history does not dissapoint. While much controversy was raised over the liberal nudity and seemingly indecipherable plot ( I understood it perfectly) the main focus here should be on the sheer beauty, skill and grace that this film exhibits. After more than a decade away from the big screen, Kubrick retained his fine form and complete mastery of his chosen medium. I personally think he did the epic novel &quot;TRAUMNOVELLE&quot; beautiful justice with this film and delivered one final blow to minds of Kubrick devotee's and film lovers all around the world. This is a fitting and perfect end to a majestic and brilliant career.
630428540X|5.0|This is probably one of the best films I have ever seen, definetely my favourite. It helps that Travolta's my favourite actor though. He delivered a better than fine performance and deserved at least one academy for the movie. A story of a ordinary man who became the smartest man on earth overnight on his 37th birthday after witnessing a beam of light which knocked him to the ground. A great story with a very moving ending. I've never liked Travolta as much as I did in that movie, two thumbs up! I by far reccomend this movie!
B00004STPT|4.0|I have had enough experience of these modern orchestrally-scored soundtracks to ever believe that any of them could, or will, contain wholly original compositions. Most of the \\"composers\\" who make a living creating soundtrack-music inevitably rip off some ideas from the music of the true classical composers of the 19th century. Hm!<br />This disc is no exception. If you are a classical music afficionado, you cannot miss the blatant graft of Holst's Mars. Elsewhere, in a more subtle form, you will also hear lots of musical passages which are derivative of Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen - the Rhine River Journey, Siegfried's murder, etc... and also, Giuseppe Verdi's Requiem.<br />So why am I rating this disc highly? That is because, despite the lapse in originality of some of its music, this soundtrack rises FAR above its horrendous contemporaries. There is a palpable sense of musical coherence amongst all the tracks --- ably giving good support for the various scenes in \\"Gladiator\\". Zimmer's set-pieces do generate genuine tension, suspense and pathos for their matching scenes. You'll have to give him credit for this. I have not enjoyed a classical soundtrack as much as this one; since Kilar's splendid score for Dracula.<br />To sum it up, this disc is a lovely example of a modern, but worthy, pop-classical soundtrack. To rave on that it is a great piece of innovative et original classical music - like some other (perhaps less well-informed?) listeners have done so - is stretching the truth a bit too far, though. This disc is something you just put on as a diversion from the true classical greats --- to remininesce about the Gladiator movie, and to accompany your waving of a replica of Maximus's sword you mail-ordered from Toledo. LOL.
6304258984|5.0|One word to describe it &quot;Great!&quot; Ed Harris stars as General Frank Hummel who seizes control of Alcatraz. Only chemical specialist Goodspeed(Nicolas Cage) and a trained killer(Sean Connery) have what it takes to defuse the rockets and stop the bad guys. A great movie put together, one of the best in the 90's. Great job!
B000056NX4|5.0|I watched both versions (original '70s and this one) back to back.  The raw energy of the singing is outstanding in this version...a little flat in the other (like someone left out the stereo...).  Not having to deal with sweeping scenery, it zooms in on emotion in the faces...the songs are the stars here....not the desert.  I think people (especially young people) can relate much better to this updated modern version.  Also...note how Jesus' wardrobe changes throughout the play...first appearing in cargo pants, muscle shirt and tennies and gradually reverts to the dress of antiquity.  Judas is outstanding, and Pilate blew me away.  Jesus' song to God in the Garden is much more powerful here.  In the other version, you don't see Ted Neeley's face through much of it...he's too busy climbing a rock.  This is a MUST SEE for JCS fans!!!
0345409671|3.0|A book that's not as easy to digest as the rest of the chronicles, however it offers some deep insight into Lestat.<BR>His struggle in this book, and the effect it has on the future of Lestat in print makes it worth the slow read.
0425170349|1.0|Rainbow Six is a sad, disappointing book. It makes it even more disappointing when the author is capable of writing much better books such as The Hunt for Red October. Rainbow Six is about an elite international counter-terrorist group that tries to stop some nature-freaks from destroying the world's population. <BR>     Depending on who you are, you will either love or hate this book. I hated it. The characters are cardboard cutouts, the far-fetched scenarios that Clancy thinks up are ridiculous. ... The game that is based on the story is actually much better than the book. Half the story is about how these druids think and only about twenty pages in the entire thousand-page book are about actually executing the missions. <BR>     Better luck next time, Clancy.
B00005QG9J|4.0|Not long after the widespread success of their song \\"Drive\\" did Incubus go back into the studio to record tracks for the follow-up of Make Yourself. Called Morning View, its leadoff single was the feelgood  \\"Wish You Were Here\\". It somehow leaked onto radio stations long before the album was close to finished, and Brandon and the boys weren't too thrilled about that...that is, until it reached #2 on the rock charts before even being released. 2 is a number that seemed to aptly fit the band, for #2 is where Morning View debuted upon its release.<br />To totally enjoy this or any Incubus album, you have to understand their style. Several of the songs have 1 to 2-minute \\"interludes\\" in order to showcase the band's instrumental capabilities. Also, many of the songs are so lyrically involved that new listeners may say, \\"What does that MEAN?\\" But I kid you not, meaning is in there. In fact, many of the songs can be determined as several different meanings, as proven especially in the first two singles (\\"Wish You Were Here\\" and \\"Nice To Know You\\"). There are easier understood tracks on the album as well. \\"Blood On The Ground\\" follows the if-you-can't-say-anything-nice-don't-say-anything-at-all technique, whereas \\"Have You Ever\\" tells us not to judge a book by its cover: \\"Have you ever tried to step in my shoes?\\"<br />The best part of the album isn't either of the songs that are out (although \\"Nice To Know You\\" come very close); it's the slap-your-knee vibe of \\"Are You In?\\" I don't care if you don't like alternative music; if you don't like this song, then I feel sorry for you.<br />There are two small things I would improve about this album. \\"Aqueous Transmission\\" is a little too literal with it's nature feel...in fact, there are three extra minutes of nature sounds at the end that makes the song almost eight minutes long. Also, \\"Echo\\" is a very good song, but the sound and lyrics of it make it sound like it should be called \\"Stellar II\\". Still, Morning View has Incubus doing what they do best: making good music.ing what they do best: making good music.
B0000057C5|5.0|What a killer album.  <BR>Never too harsh on the ears, pleasant vocals, fantastic energy, and not a difficult listen.  <BR>They put on a fantastic live show as well.  <BR>I don't think you can really go wrong with this album, give it a spin at a detestable volume level and enjoy!
B00003CXXP|4.0|I enjoyed this one more when I viewed it the second time. As a fan of both Spielberg's and Kubrick's works (particularly Close Encounters by the former), I also agree about the &quot;hybrid&quot; feel it exhibits. The story is somewhat forgettable, but there are more interesting overtones.  While cringing at the thought of &quot;global warming&quot; and the leftish political vision displayed front-and-center, I nonetheless enjoyed the more human aspects of the film.<br />The film's central question in my mind is: what is &quot;real&quot; and what is artificial? (Similar to Cervantes' asking what is real and what is imaginary.)  Like the woman at the beginning of the film who asks,&quot;but will we love a robot?&quot; to the snot-nosed kids at the swimming pool (including Martin) who talk about how &quot;real&quot; they are (the &quot;mecha&quot; vs &quot;orga&quot; us-and-them sensibilty, also the point of the hideous &quot;Flesh Fair&quot; later on), to the ending, with its suspended vision of an idyllic moment of mother and child you wish could last forever.  There are times when I want to take my own mother (who almost died over the weekend - thankfully she's better now) or daughter and just have that kind of quiet time with either one of them. The notion of it almost brought this viewer to tears.  David is very &quot;real&quot;, but not in the way Mom and Dad were hoping - so they callously kick him to the curb.  Clearly he brought them face-to-face with a view of themselves that was more than a little spooky. The mirror can be a frightening place, and David's monkey-see, monkey-do antics illustrated it beautifully.<br />The futuristic aspects are also thought-provoking. What I found more ironic is the realization that Kubrick made 2001, A Space Odyssey in 1968, and now here's another film made in 2001 with a similar forward look.  Of course, we aren't flying to the moon like tourists yet, and no computer is quite like Hal, but some of his vision did come true.Here, in AI, we get another vision - one which is very forboding.  Why is the future always portrayed as being totalitarian (needing a license to have a child, as if this was current-day China)?  Even in throwaway films like Rollerball this was the case.  Is it because many film-makers think humans are incapable of running their own lives and will make a mess of things?  The rub is that even those more &quot;enlightened&quot; types that give the orders are ultimately flawed as well - witness the mess they make of things.<br />For those that want action, I'd say skip this one.  But if thought-provoking film-making is your bent, it's worth the time. Castwise, I particularly enjoyed Frances O'Connor's anguished mother figure, which struck the perfect balance between softness and the horror of &quot;adopting&quot; a robot son.  I'll also add my voice to the chorus praising Jude Law's robot Gigolo Joe - but acting is not the point of this film. This is a story, sometimes not too well-told, but I won't easily forget it.
B000001ESP|5.0|I have been a Rush fan since 1974 and have to say, that Moving Pictures is the album that pushed Rush over the top so to speak.  Permanent Waves got the big exposure with &quot;Spirit of Radio&quot;, and &quot;Freewill&quot; and created a listener appreciation and demand for the now legendary Canadian trio.  But Moving Pictures adeptly pushed Rush into the very short list for best albums ever.  This album has legitimate top ten songs such as Limelight, Tom Sawyer, YYZ (airport code for Toronto), Red Barchetta and Vital Signs.  With over 7 million copies sold, and with the collection of hits, this album rates among the best ever, such as Yes' &quot;The Yes Album&quot;, Who's &quot;Who's Next&quot;, Led Zep's II and IV, Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, Santana's &quot;Abraxis&quot;, Aerosmith's &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot;, Beatle's &quot;Revolver&quot;, Jimi Hendrix'&quot;Electric Ladyland&quot;, Robin Trower's &quot;Bridge of Sighs&quot;, Rolling Stones' &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; and Traffic's &quot;When the Eagle Flies&quot;.
6304602979|5.0|Director Tony Scott shows what it takes for those who have found True Love.  This is a great film that proves it exists, but it requires a lot of violence to do it.  Not mindless violence, mind you...no, that wouldn't do.  It takes a special kind of violence, the kind that convinces the viewer that each lover is instantly willing to lay down his or her life for the other.  <br />Cynics keep telling me that True Love exists only in the hearts of Hopeless Dreamers.  Perhaps they're right.  I know it's something I've been looking for all my life, but have yet to find it.  However, Alabama Worley (Patricia Arquette) and her new husband, Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) succeeded, which must mean it's out there somewhere...Right?<br />From the first frame to the last, this film is unadulterated fun, very well done by an outstanding cast that includes Dennis Hopper and Val Kilmer.  If you haven't seen it, be sure to do so...you'll love it.  If you've seen it before, see it again...and this time, don't forget the popcorn and your girlfriend
0671578278|5.0|I've read each of the Bujold books several times and I think that this is the best one so far. Bujold manages to create fascinating, tense and often hilarious storylines. More importantly, her characters have a depth and complexity that is rare in science fiction. I think that this is why Bujold appeals to people who would normally avoid science fiction. I've introduced Bujold's books to two ex-girlfriends, my fiance and my fiance's grandmother. Each has eventually bought copies of the entire series for themselves, yet none of them normally even read science fiction. A previous reviewer  accused Bujold of misandry (hatred of men) in her writings because males were supposedly incompetent without their wise, ultracompetent women. I am left completely befuddled by this accusation. Yes, Bujold's female characters are often quite remarkable, whether heroes (ie Cordelia) or villains (ie Cavilo), but who are these foolish men? The Vorkosigan men are three generations of the most brilliant political and military minds of their world. Yes, Cordelia rescues Aral, but never has to save him from his own incompetence. Aral without Cordelia may be a washed up drunk (at least for a while), but Cordelia without Aral is in Betan therapy. For someone who supposedly has a grudge against men, bujold certainly writes amazingly sympathetic characters. When Miles Vorkosigan is cut, you bleed for him. (to paraphrase Cordelia). OK, enough of my ranting. Read the Vorkosigan series. Start with Shards of Honor, because you really want to experience the evolution of these characters and the later books have so many inside jokes that you don't want to miss.
0380817683|5.0|I loved this book.  LOVED IT!  I put off reading it for a year because of it's size but when i was finally ready i finished the book in about 3 days.  I've read people mention this book as a \\"beach book\\"  but i  would have to say tha it is far more than that.  I will definately be reading more from Marian Keyes.  I also hope she brings this character back for another book.  Did I mention that I LOVED this  book!!!  READ IT!
B000000OQY|2.0|Wow! It is awesome that GNR did a cover of the Skrewdriver song &quot;One in a Million&quot; . I am not a fan of GNR, but that is really cool and I have a little more respect for'em now! 88
B00001NFCY|4.0|I've been a hip hop and Rap fan, but I grew up loving 80's Rock, but never bought a Rock album. Now its 2002 and I'm 25 and sick of the same ole Rap (except ja Rule), so I started being receptive to the good Rock music I was hearing all thru the 90's. What motivated me to give Rock a chance was when I heard &quot;Arms Wide Open&quot;. I liked it, couldn't get it out of my head. So I checked out Creed and when I heard &quot;Higher&quot; I was sold. I dont know much about rock and metal, but if I like it I like it and I LOVE Creed. Thru them I am discovering rock bands left and right. Thanks Creed.
0385484518|5.0|This book was a very touching story about life and death.  It was a book that I would recommend all to read, no matter age.  It was sad at times, and funny at times.  <BR>It made me look at the life I live, and want to be a better person. It made me want to live a better life, so when it is my time to go, I am not forgotton. <BR>I highley recomment this book for anyone. Especially those who may be struggling with something in their lives.  For some reason, this book makes everything, no matter how big, seem managable.
B00005R87Q|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever made! I loved the racing parts and the way cool cars like the TOYOTA SUPRA TURBO,    MAZDA RX-7, DODGE CHARGER, and the ECLIPSE. This is all about cars. I loved this movie so much that my background and screensaver on my computer are FAST AND THE FURIOUS ones. ..... A cool part in this movie is when Brian and Dominick race the Ferrari guy and at the end of the movie when Dominick races his father's DODGE CHARGER and Brian races Dominick in the TOYOTA SUPRA TURBO. The DVD edition lets you see the crash when Dominick hits the truck in the DODGE CHARGER. The DVD also has some music video's like JA RULE and SALIVA. I would FULLY recemend getting this DVD because it is the best DVD for people of any age! Thrilling, exciting, and makes you wonder in some parts. Extremly fast and beautiful cars and at the end of the movie, you think to yourself, \\"Will there be a sequel?\\" Because Brian justs walks away after giving Dominick the keys to his sweet TOYOTA SUPRA TURBO...so I think that there will be a sequel. Hope this review was helpful...GET THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS!!!!!!!
B000002A3T|3.0|OK, David and co dug a HUGE hole with Momentary and this bad impression of David Gilmour and Leanord Cohen's love child is supposed to set things right? What about the SRV ...riffs? i hope not. They got 1/4 way out of that hole with this one. Pulse showed they're not hopeless as human beings, but Pink Floyd died March 21, 1983. That is my observation. Pulse is a coverband and Delicate sound of thunder is a bad one. Division Bell is not the place to go for a floyd record but it is if you were trying real hard out of respect to like momentary and if you liked momentary don't speak to me. 3 stars ...i wouldn't dare say anything bearing the Floyd name is worse than that.
B0000027RL|3.0|Me personally I am not a big fan of Pearl Jam they have some good songs on this album like Even Flow and Jeremy but I pesonally find the rest of the songs are uncreative and all sound basically the same. But I can see why people like it but it just doesn't appeal to me. So I say go buy it and judge it for yourself. Even Flow pretty much makes it worth the money.
B00005U122|4.0|basically this dvd is very well done as a dvd, and i'm sure is top shop for any normal roger waters fan. some people have complained that snowy white and the other guitar players are simply not david gilmour. i don't think one who purchases a Roger Waters disc is looking for david gilmour given their colorful soap opera of a past. My main problem with this disk is the background singers. As we all know; these chicks work wonderfully on Dark Side of The Moon. As a matter of fact there are entire tracks based almost entirely around them on that album. HOWEVER &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot; was not meant to have background singers and they totally ruin the mood of the song. Given that this is one of my favorite floyd songs i am forced to drop it down to 4 stars for that alone. They are intrusive on other tracks as well that currently escape my memory but they work very well on some of the songs that previously had none, such as Set The Controls for the Heart of the Sun which may actually be my favorite Floyd song, here it is actually better i think. overall the dvd is good for being a dvd and the concert is good, both as a roger waters disc and a floyd disc, the background singers can be annoying but for the most part roger runs a tight ship and it flows rather nicely. the documentary is also good for insight into roger and his band as people and as performers. But it is very short.
B000003TA4|5.0|This cd is what started it all in rock music today. It started all the heavy power chords. This cd is the most original you will ever hear. Kurt Cobain combined great lyrics with great guitar. Even though he wasn't the greatest guitarist in the world he still was able to take three or two power chords and have a great sound come out of his guitar and that is what made him so talented. <br />Here are my song ratings:<br />Teen Spirit A+++ - Nirvana's greatest and the second best song of all time ...Great opening track.<br />In Bloom A+ - Another one of Nirvana's greatest songs ever. It provides awesome heavy guitar with a great drum beat. ...[bad] music video though.<br />Come as you are B - A brilliant slow song, not my favorite but good. I love the intro<br />Breed A - Nothing wrong with this song except I don't really understand the lryical meaning but still a great song<br />Lithium A+ - Another Nirvana greatest hit, has great guitar<br />Polly A+ - One of the best lyrics ever. ...Even Bob Dylan said that this is one of the greatest slow songs.<br />Territorial Pissings F- - I don't know what Kurt was thinking when he wrote this song. It is the worst song on the album and probally the worst Nirvana song af all time.<br />Drain You B+ - This is a real great song but I took off marks because it shows no creativity in the guitar, Its riff sounds exactly the same as Teen Spirit without the Palm mute in between.<br />Lounge Act A+ - Creative lyrics, great guitar. Another great song <br />Stay Away B - Not my favorite but still good<br />On a Plain A - Great<br />Something in The Way C- - Boring song
B00000099Y|5.0|here is where tool tends to state more how things are than simply how one might percieve them. where their need to SCREW with their audience is most apparent. Here is where they are finally begining to mature letting go of their skin into a new form. Aenima being the most stunningly fierce track proclaiming that all must be washed away, a recurring theme with tool. once submerged Third Eye rises from the water to embrace a new perception free from the pettiness of the former self.
B00005R87Q|4.0|This movie is probally one of the greatest car movies ever made. It was much better than that total nonsense &quot;Driven.&quot;<BR>Most people say that this movie was good but had horrible acting (mainly critics). But I found that the acting in this movie was really great. Paul Walker was really good and so was Vin Diesel who was a new comer at the time. The cars in  this movie looked so amazing. Especially that Mitubishi Eclipse that Paul drove for the first part of the movie. If I was rich I would definitley buy that car for sure. The Toyota Supra that Paul drove after the Eclipse blew up, Also looked real good and I heard that acually had like 700hp in it too.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I found the camera angles on the cars racing, they kept changing and I could never get a good look at the cars driving at full speed.Anyway go buy this DVD or VHS, it is really good. You won't be disappointed
B000000993|5.0|here is where we see tool's ideas begin to take actual form and purpose. However they are still very adolescent. Their use of pychedelics also becomes apparent here, particularly on disgustipated. Very hard album pointing many fingers in all directions. their potential is slowly being realized.
0782008119|5.0|Okay the price of the movie was worth the first (surprisingly RAW)ever appearance of Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit. I expected, yea I know it was stupid to, a little more live musical action.  I mean as soon as you started getting the feeling of the song they'd start talking again, AND they did focus a little too heavily on Seattle alone, setting aside the reactions of the entire country. But I came to relize that the talking was actually rather informative... although for someone like me, it was nothing really new.... and was found very much appreciated. They, despite the odds, chronicaled every major and/or trivial event they'd happened in the &quot;grunge&quot; and &quot;sub pop-early-alternative&quot; scene.  They -meaning those who are musicians who play in clubs there (&amp; throughout the film), had to do with the making/process of the music, were a fan, or (just) lived there- looked at it all with some disdain or humor... but at the same time treating the music with respect.  Admiting that it was just a scene... &amp; not all that different place from many other &quot;scene&quot; places... that it was once a completely normal place, aside from all the suicidal action, (BUT SPECIAL)and that it was cool and yet mediocre that it got all that attention.  Such ambivilance.  In a nutshell, they are simply stating all that you should know already, but with more perspective (and humor).
B000024D4R|5.0|i know the heading of this review is a bit drastic but that's exactly what you will do upon hearing this album. It's shockingly good but horribly depressing. Roger is at his lowest and most desperate here and it's all very terribly frightening to view the world as he does on this one... then as you're lying on the floor dying you will hear the second part of Pigs on the Wing and be so very confused that you will wish you hadn't have killed yourself for the sheer sake of pondering the album. The Wall makes a lot more sense historically and chronologically when heard after this album. You can see where he the floyd were going and may have written The Wall yourself upon hearing this one, had you heard it when it came out. it's that good, and that powerful. but at any rate just get Shine On.
0553296981|5.0|This was a very enlightening story of a young Jewish girl who wrote almost everyday in her diary, that she called Kitty. She wrote about everything that was going on in her life. Anne Frank gave me a great understanding of what she went through during the times of the Holocaust. I knew that those times were bad, but i didn't know how bad until I read this book. Even though these were hard times for Anne and her family, she always looked at the bright side of things. For example, when Anne and her family were captured and sent to concentration camps, as horrible as they were, Anne expressed how good it was to be outside again. I definitely recommend this book to everyone, especially to young girls. I guarantee that they won't be able to put this book down.
B000002U8G|5.0|that was the original title when they performed it live before entering the studio, as i recall. the trouble with reviewing a pink floyd album is that they are all so terribly good. i wanted to give this one 4 stars because of Seamus. A song about a barking dog which, as a special guest on that particular song, barks to no rythym at all, but instead to his own chaotic distractions. whines as well. However the full 20+minutes version of Echoes...regains that star as without Seamus this album would be a 10, but with, it is a six. still off the scale, but without echoes would be a 4. You see the logic? ...Get Shine On, better value, bigger book, specialer package.
B000063CPL|5.0|I cannot understand why I read so many negative comments in the reviews written so far. To say that this album is poor is the same as if to say the grass is red. The remarks about the throat cancer are nothing else but a tasteless attempt to be satiric. <BR>Anyway, as a musician myself, I can assure you that Bruce has never been better onstage, while guitar solos are truly a little awkward and choppy except for Adrian Smith who plays with imagination and most of his solos are perfect. Dave Murray is not in very good shape, and Janick Gers has never been a great lead guitarist. On the other hand, he contributes to songwriting a lot; that is why he should be kept in the band.<BR>For those who still do not believe, listen to only one track - 'Hallowed Be Thy Name' - and tell me if you find anywhere in the archives a better live version...<BR>Naturally, one of the reasons a live (or any other) album to be released is money. Why should we (music fans) be so mad about it? Nobody is forced to buy the album.... Those comments about money as a major reason the band to get together were ridiculous.
B000002U9W|5.0|jesus, where do i begin for AHM? The title track is orchestral madness, somehow much more ordered than Ummagumma, their one previous. It streches for sometime over every bit of land the one song can go. If is the perfect follow up. It is the definition of peace and tranquility. Summer 68 is the perfect segue with a part-AHM part-If part-average hippy song part-well, this is definitely floyd quality to it. Fat old Sun is as close as Floyd ever got to the Beatles, only better. Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast is kind of lame at points but it is a perfect example still of why I call Floyd the Monty Python of music. everything from egg broiling (\\"i like eggs...\\") to piano dominated rock craziness, yet still maintains an atmosphere of purposeful relaxedness. sort of like rejoicing after having defended your town against invading vikings. very good. buy it now.... quit reading, go buy.
0345451325|5.0|This book is excellent. If you're playing Halo or have beaten it it makes it much better. Throughout the game i wondered Master Chief's origins. This book answered them easily. It answers all the background questions about the game. An excellent sci-fi book all around.
B00005RYL9|5.0|Since Anchor Bay seems to have risen out of no where (to me).  It's probably a must get.  Anchor Bay isn't known for [bad]releases.<BR>Look at all the Limited Editions they put out.   Manhunter, Supergirl,...  I probably won't get it since it scared me..., but that Evil Dead cover has got to win an award for creativeness.<br />I like the sequels to this movie, but only keeping in mind that with Highlander 2... Highlander 4 must come before that so Conner must come back someday.  I doubt we've seen the last Highlander with Chris in it.
B00000HZFH|4.0|I actually bought this album by mistake when my art teacher played BTS' &quot;Randy Described Eternity&quot; on her CD player and said it was from their album &quot;Keep It Like A Secret&quot;. So I bought KILAS and that song wasn't on it. But that doesn't make it a bad album; actually this disc is magnificent.<BR>I approached this album from the background of someone who listens to Progressive/electronic/ambient/experimental rock music (earlier on the day I bought this I was listening to King Crimson's &quot;Lark's Tongues In Aspic&quot;), where just about everyone graduated with a degree in music or is a virtuoso in their own right. I have long held the opinion that the 80's saw the decline of musicianship and the 90's saw its total abandonment in favor of dreck like Rap or sugarPop britney nonmusic. I resigned myself to listening to old music from the 70's and hoped that someone else would also so they could learn how to play REAL music instead of what passes out there.<BR>Apperently Doug Martsch has. He knows how to write, and he plays all his guitar parts himself rather than relying on the help of studio musicians, who wouldn't be able to communicate the emotion he puts in his riffs and melodies.<BR>Scott Pluof knows his place as a bass player. the bass is supposed to function as the base (pun STRONGLY intended) of the song. It is not a solo instument. Sadly no one else seems to think so anymore.<BR>Brett Nelson treats the drums as a melodic element in the songs, which they should be. Listen to the grace of his fills and the interplay between the different parts of his kit. This is something that Bill Bruford used to do. The only other person I know of who does it is Phil Selway.<BR>&quot;The Plan&quot; is a perfect example of Progressive rock form. Listen to this one and Yes' &quot;Yours Is No Disgrace&quot; and you'll be amazed at the paralells.<BR>&quot;Else&quot; is the most emotion-laden song of the past decade, perhaps surpassing even Radiohead's masterpieces &quot;No Surprises&quot; or &quot;How To Disappear&quot;. A fabulous crescendo in the latter part of the song.<BR>Built To Spill has done something that I thought was impossible to do - they brought back music. It's sad to think that they aren't nearly as popular as they should be. I think all us loyal BTS fans should buy copies of this CD and give them away to strangers so we can spread the word.
0671027344|1.0|The Perks of Being A Wallflower was truly an excruciating read at 213 pages. ...This book is too long with no kind of literary theme or plot structure. The author should've used foreshadowing, so the readers could be drawn into the story. It is no wonder I could not find this novel in local bookstores. My advice is to avoid this book unless you are into extreme boredom.
006016848X|3.0|Men Are From Mars..&quot; is similar to most self-help writings in that it must not simply be read as a novel and discarded. Doing so will produce no benefit to the reader whatsoever. Don't bother with MAFM if searching for short-term miracles. The astute reader will take notes and refer back to them from time to time.  (S)he should expect no immediate, glossy results.  Was this reviewer helped by MAFM? Ask me a year or two from now.  One particular nugget: 90% of what we believe is bothering us is caused by an incident from the past, not the current crisis itself. Another: &quot;Would you&quot; beats &quot;Could you&quot;. Get the picture?  What do we have to lose?
B00005B36H|5.0|tool has outdone themselves and learned to wield this power far beyond our comprehension. telling us things that need to be said and understood so that we may join up when the time comes. sounds crazy to your average joe but that's because he's been taught that unity is silly. this album speaks on so many levels says so many things musically and lyrically they cannot possibly be contained in this 1,000 word maximum. tool will change you meaning they will encourage you to change yourself into something new, something better. but maybe that's just what they want us to think. they're liars you know...
0738203335|4.0|If you enjoyed _Hackers_, by Steven Levy, or if you are interested in computing, this book is a must read.  Moody tracks the history of the Open Source movement from its inception in the AI lab at MIT up to the present, and along the way shows the people and events that have propelled the movement forward to its present pace.  I was left with a profound and indubitable realization that open source is the future of software, and that realization is exhilerating.  <br />The book is impeccably researched and organized, but occasionally I was left stumbling over some awkward phrasing.  Some of the prose, especially some of the idioms, could benefit from a redaction.  Nevertheless, if you read only one book this year, this book must be the one.  It's a powerful message, with an absorbing delivery.
B000065U1N|2.0|This is a movie that won Best Sound at the Oscars this year, and this disc does not feature a DTS soundtrack. Wait for the special edition whenever it comes out. Ridley Scott has done special editions for his last two movies, Gladiator and Hannibal, and there is no reason why he will not for this movie. This movie will sound dynamic in DTS, if you have the patience and means, I highly recommend you wait for the better version.
630587493X|1.0|I thought this was going to be a good movie when I first saw coming attractions, but it was not good. This movie is NOT a comedy it's a family comedy for maybe the first 45 minutes, if that. For the rest it is a very very very utterly very sad drama.<br />Bicentennial means 200 Years. He literally lives for 200 years. He's staying alive while he sees everyone he knows and loves die. It's horrible. It's the kind of movie that ruins your day in my opinion. Don't watch it if your in a good mood. But I guess if your sad while your watching it, it'll make you feel worse.<br />The one good thing in the movie is the adorable Hallie Eisenberg (Paulie, Pepsi) who plays the younger \\"Little Miss\\".<br />Well, for some reason other people who have written reviews seem to like it, I guess it's a matter of interpretation. Maybe watch it and see for yourself.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|I just saw him in concert the other day... he is so amazing; puts on a great show!<br />I really love this album; I can listen to it from beginning till the end and never want to skip a track.  <br />Escape: Makes you want to get up and dance!  This song is fun to listen to... I can see myself driving to the beach with top down and singing on the top of my lungs to this song.  It was put together very well; the whole song just blends together!  I Love it!<br />Don't Turn Off The Lights: A wonderful follow up the Escape, it still keeps you dancing (and it's sexy).<br />Love To See You Cry:  Very Sexy!  Listen to the words carefully.<br />Hero: When I listened to this song right after Sept. 11th, it made me cry.  I listen to it now and it still makes me cry!  <br />I Will Survive: A nice song, not exactly my favorite, but I like it.<br />Love 4 Fun:  This is a great song, when I saw him perform this live... everyone in the crowd was dancing you just can't help it! =) Fun to listen to, the background music is fun... this whole song is FUN! <br />Maybe: I like it; it's very chill and relaxing.  The sound of this song has an 80's twist to it.<br />One Night Stand: I really like this song... I think a remix for this song would be great!  It's a lot of fun and makes you want to dance!<br />She Be The One: Very catchy song, I like it.<br />If The World Crashes Down: It's a great ending to a great album!<br />Escapar: I love this song so much that I try to sing along with it in Spanish.<br />No Apagues La Luz:  Still a fun song to listen to.<br />Heroe:  This song is great in both English and Spanish!  <br />I think overall this album is a lot more popish than his last.  I love this album!  Enrique's voice is sexy (and so is him) and he puts a lot of feelings into his singing/songs.  This album is a lot of fun to listen to; it's fun, uplifting and happy!<br />I would highly recommend this album!
B000002U9Y|4.0|I'm under the impression this was the last album with Syd. Poor Syd. Wrote some fine tunes... that Syd. There's really nothing not to like about this album. But i'm giving it four stars because it may be difficult to digest for you &quot;moonies&quot; and you know who you are. The production value (even of the remastering) leaves a bit to be desired for some. As you must remember distortion effects were EXTREMELY primitive at the time. All they had was Overdrive which, to the layman, is turning up too loud. Set The Controls for the Heart of the Sun is, in my opinion, the definitve tune here. Just bone shatteringly lovely. I miss Syd, I do. Like the other Floydians though his solo work cannot really compare. They worked much better as a team. Imagine that eh? Gilmore, Waters, and Barret getting along making this terrifyingly insanely good music? Scarey. But at any rate, your average floyd fan will like most of this album, your hardcore will just like it. if you liked Piper, or AHM this is a pretty sure bet, otherwise give it a listen first. You may be frightened. But if you must get it, get Shine On. Much better idea, trust me.
B000003BEV|5.0|First of all--those folks who have said how terrible this album is, you should know that when it was re-mastered for CD in 1986, the mix was seriously mucked up. What had been [on the original LP from 1967] a vibrant masterpiece, is now nearly lifeless. The digitally re-mastered version on LP from the mid-80's had an even worse problem: on \\"Gomper\\" in particular, the sitar sounds like it's been run through some kind of distortion pedal, such that even if you'd never heard the song before, it would be physically painful to listen to.<br />I've heard other folks complain about Abkco's poor packaging of other Stones albums, so this isn't some isolated thing. But here, there are so many layers of sound [especially on some of the tunes a certain jaded reviewer referred to as \\"doodling\\"] that it just doesn't work to have someone who probably didn't hang out much with the original version be the person doing the mastering. Get ahold of a good copy of the original LP [with the plastic picture on the front cover] if you don't believe me, ...and then wait for a good CD version.<br />As for the last song on the album \\"On With the Show\\": it seems that many of the reviewers really hate this one. But the Brit bands in '67 had a strong proclivity for this type of old-time dance hall song. A number of them had such tunes on their albums: Procol Harum (\\"Mabel\\"), The BeeGees (\\"Craise Finton Kirk Royal Academy Of Arts\\"), Cream (\\"Mother's Lament\\"), and the Beatles (\\"Your Mother Should Know\\", \\"Being For the Benefit of Mr. Kite\\"). All of them were a lot of fun with their honky-tonk piano sound and/or singing through megaphones, etc. . . . \\"On With the Show\\" was merely the best, and the one with the most complexity in terms of its overall instrumentation. There is an incredible amount of attention to detail that the engineer, the producer and the musicians had to put into recording and mixing it, but that's true of the entire album. It's also very spirited, telling its story with scads of realistic-feeling candor [and genuine barroom sound effects blended in throughout], and has some truly hilarious moments. If this obvious 5 star effort is the worst song on the album, just think what else we have going here!<br />Many of these same folks seem to have an intense dislike for \\"Sing This All Together\\" [both parts 1 and 2]. But this is a song of profound, over-arching joy. The second part has incredible detail instrumentally, not just in the sheer quantity of different instruments weaving in and out one by one, two by two, etc., but the way in which every note played by every instrument creates a meaning within the ongoing tapestry of emerging sound/music. This is of course not too apparent for those listeners who have only listened to it once. If you really sit and listen on good 'phones or via good speakers, you'll experience the first epic journey on this album. But, as I warned before, and particularly with reference to this tune: the mix on the re-mastered CD is pretty much dead.<br />Bill Wyman's song \\"In Another Land\\" is so right on in the fashion by which it tells the story of going into a beautiful, almost viscerally alive dream, with the extreme frustration of having to wake up, i.e. leave the fantastic, alternate world. The megaphone lead vocal, and the swirling harmony backup vocals at the chorus work so well in sequence it could make a fellow cry . . . there's the titanic sound of drums, guitar and piano entering as the dream is broken. If you've never in your life experienced such intense joy that it's very disconcerting or downright painful to lose it, I have to say I feel sorry for you. This song is a miniature masterpiece in every one of its facets.<br />On \\"Gomper\\", the boys poke gentle, good-natured fun at Donovan, the Beatles, the Strawberry Alarm Clock, and the numerous other purveyors of raga rock; but they sing and play themselves into the music so well that they become one with the ostensibly serious intent of these other artists. Once again, the boys' ability to create the perfect atmosphere musically is stunning. You walk into yet another world with them as you listen, more or less tranfixed.<br />Seriously, we used to listen to this entire album as a group in the dorm all of the time, and really liked it. The whole album fits together well in terms of sequence and also general vibe/ambience.<br />\\"2000 Light Years from Home\\" is one of the two most dramatic space songs ever, right up there with the Byrds' \\"Space Odyssey\\" from 'The Notorious Byrd Brothers', which came out around the same time. In the days long before Star Wars and Star Trek mega-movies, these tunes gave people a chance to go where no terrestrial had yet traveled, while lying face up on the floor of a dorm room somewhere. Everyone got really quiet whenever this one started playing. It holds much of this same power even to this day.<br />\\"Citadel\\", \\"She's a Rainbow\\" and \\"The Lantern\\" are just three more deliciously romantic journeys back in time to a place where we all still live, deep in our imaginations. The Stones are re-vivifying traditions and resurrecting images that go back to the times of the Arthurian legends of the Middle Ages, as well as the Romantic poets and painters of the early 19th century, and the Pre-Raphaelite and Symbolist poets and painters at the end of that century. The other well-known proponent of this renaissance was Donovan, most especially his albums 'Sunshine Superman' and record #2 of 'A Gift From a Flower to a Garden'.ts.

B00005U122|5.0|My first reflection about this DVD, is the remarkable resemblance to old Pink Floyd live gigs. Even though I am too young to have experienced Pink Floyd during the 70's, I know them well through old live tapes. When Waters and his band performs an excellent and sombre fully-version of \\"Dogs\\", it sounds to me like Pink Floyd at Anaheim Stadium, 1977 (with Snowy White on guitar back then also). It sounds to me that the band is more faithful to old Pink Floyd bootlegs, rather than their studio works - in this case \\"Animals\\".<br />This is by far due to the youngish Doyle Bramhall II and Jon Carin, both who very successfully are substituting Gilmour and Wright on vocal parts - as well as guitar and keyboard. Did maestro Waters play old Pink Floyd live tapes for the band when he instructed them? Of course Snowy White has been playing with the Floyd since the Animal tour in 1977 - but it seems as the real PF-atmosphere is caused by Carin and Bramhall.<br />Well. The video quality is excellent. Extensive use of dissolve-clips and moving cameras makes a soft and poetical expression. The whole event is captured with an adequate number of cameras, and there are practically no bad footage at all. All together it leaves me with a perception of masterliness. As expected.<br />My only objections are that Waters have a tendency towards putting an American flavour to some of the old Pink Floyd songs - for instance \\"Wish you were here\\", which he has turned into an C&W-ballad (he did that back in Stockholm the 16th of june 1984 too, I remember). Are Waters making a distance to someone in the Floyd? Is he really saying: \\"I wish you all gone\\"? No more evil speculations....<br />The great surprise about this DVD, is the astounding and to times staggering Pink Floyd quality, which are never importunate, and certainly exceeds the expectations of a comeback by far. Waters characteristic voice still make faces, and bare it's teeth. The drummer, Graham Broad, is clever but still loyal to NickMasons dynamical, almost lyrical, intentions. The underestimated magic touch that Wright once contributed with, is present due to Wallace and Carin. The lap steel is laid back and thrilling, thanks to Carin. The female vocal-trefoil is soothing. <br />My favourite moment is \\"Breath\\" and \\"Time\\" from DSOTM - a moment where the band fully slides into the old PF mood without being pedantic. Of course the material from Waters later solo projects work out well, too. Especially \\"Amused to death\\" and \\"The pros and cons of hitch hiking, part11\\", the latter a song which brings Waters voice to it's hights - like at Istadion in Sweeden, 1984.<br />All stars. Let them shine on!<br />Øivind K. Zahlsen

B000002UA2|5.0|this album gets the vibe of mainly gilmour and wright run. not that that's a bad thing. just a bit hard to get used to after, as i'm sure most are, being most familiar with a Roger-run gig. After that it was smooth sailing. I don't have it on me so i can't confirm that's who wrote most of the tracks. it could have just been all of them more, which i've found worked best with the ol' floyd. but at any rate, this album, coupled with Meddle is a good preview of things 'achanging in the Pink Floyd pool. the direction is far more apparent with meddle, as is the change itself, which is ironic given that meddle was first and this is the album directly preceeding Dark Side, but go figure. perhaps this material was actually written before meddle, who's to say, or they just were in a different mood, i don't know. but it's got a lot of AHM in it, but it goes beyond where AHM didn't. However it leaves behind some things that were also enjoyable. hard to truly review. It's just another good Pink Floyd album. They all really shine on this one, a lot, but it's nothing epic like echoes or AHM or Saucerful or Brain Damage. it's Floyd's one damn good straight forward rock album+ some things.

B000005RZ4|4.0|I am an avid Curiosity fan.  I bought the first tape in the eighties when &quot;Misfit&quot; hit Mtv, (I'm only 29).  I was one of the first to run out and buy the second tape, for &quot;Name and Number&quot;.  My only disappointment with this &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; is that fact that thee best song by Curiosity is &quot;Red Lights&quot; which can be heard on the first release along with &quot;Misfit&quot; and you can hear it as background music on the Movie &quot;American Psycho&quot; (when he killed the rich girl and the hooker), but wasn't on that soundtrack either.  I still listen to that tape all the time, its classic, you can't date it.  It is like Harry Connick, Jr. getting Jazzy, but he's not Harry.  I can't figure out why it didn't make the cut here.  Regardless, anyone who enjoys some relaxing tunes on a sunday drive...this is the one for you.  And if Curiosity reads this....PUT SOME MORE MUSIC OUT...YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING SPECIAL!

B000002KZ6|5.0|at the point i started liking this album i didn't know why outside of the catchy beats and for that i am ashamed. but now i love every inch and aspect of it. i don't have the cd yet but i have the tape and vinyl. it's great to mix with some club beats to really mess with people too. David byrne is a genius and the Talking heads were a terribly beautiful concoction that i miss very much. If you don't know the talking heads and you like REAL music, like perhaps you yourself are a musician ths is your entry album. listen and enjoy.
B00005RY7X|3.0|It is hard to classify the album, but I would say that it is closest to punk in the simplicity of the music and the catchiness of the guitar riffs.  Many have classified it as hard rock, but it hardly has the angst to be called rock.  In fact, I would say that it has anti-angst.  It has to be the most positive rock album I have listened to.  Although, it does have all the qualities of rock, and it is reminiscent of 80's rock music.  It is a unique album because it is neither good or bad.  My rating of 3 stars is a combination of my scores for the poor music quality(1 star) and the great entertainment value(5 stars).<br />Let's start with the positive.  This is a very entertaining album that will leave you cheerful.  It just wants you to jump up and dance around.  Every song on the album is less than 4 minutes, which is perfect for the radio.  Every melody is memorable and may never escape your memory.  I cannot single any one song out since they all sound about the same, but I can say that every song consists of a heavy guitar riff, loud screaming, and a fast beat.  In general, it is a perfect album for parties.<br />Now, I will start with the negative.  In terms of musical value, this album is pure crap.  It is unimaginative, uninspired, and uncreative(musically speaking).  Every song consists of a simple 4 measure guitar riff that is repeated over and over and over and over and...  Anyway, that could go on for a while.  The percussion is utterly simplistic and can barely be heard over the heavy distortion and screaming.  Plus, the worst thing about this album is that every song has the same sound and same structure.  Thus, even if you liked the first couple songs, it might drive you crazy by the end of the album.  The only positive thing that I can really say about the album musically is that the songs are short, because more than a few minutes of any one song could drive one crazy from the repetitiveness.  <br />In conclusion, if you are looking for an album withany musical quality at all, this is NOT the album to buy.  However, if you want bubbly and happy music with catchy melodies, this IS an album to buy.
B000059HCN|5.0|There are movies like \\"trainspotting\\" that hype the idea that \\"heroin chic\\" is acceptable, cool, fun. Heroin is about shooting up, needing more, getting sick, freaking out, and doing *ANYTHING* to get more. That's what \\"Requiem for a Dream\\" does a fine job of truely portraying. But this movie doesn't just explore heroin abuse (Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans), it explores the world of the down-and-out cocaine addicted rich girl(Jennifer Connolly), and the widowed, t.v. obsessed speed freak (Ellen Burstyn). <br />In this movie, you literally feel how they feel: the euphoria, the pain, the descent into madness. \\"Requiem\\" goes far beyond just being a movie, it's an experience. Director Darren Aronofsky does a fine job of making all your senses aware in this movie: the beautifully haunting music, the syringe in the arm and the pupils dilating, the lines on a mirror and a rolled up $20, the snap of the white lid on the pill bottle. It's all there. This is a beautifully sick movie. It's raw, real and you should do yourself a favor and see it!
6305212112|5.0|This is one of my favorites.  I guess I don't see where there's lesbian undertones to it.  To me, it's more of a friendship love than romantic between Idgie and Ruth.  The extra scenes are an added bonus.  There is one scene that comes to mind that seems like it's just the actors in front of the camera and the picture quality changes from crisp to grainy, but that's about the only bad spot I can think of.  And the other scenes really seem to add to the movie.  There are a lot of special features including my favorite, Sipsey's recipes (which you can get in the back of Fannie Flagg's book, too).
B000002UA5|5.0|To clarify; the whole thing is not live. Just the first cd. And the first cd is a psychotic mess of wonderful. With most of my favorite songs to the point this album was made on it in very stunning live renditions. I hope the floyd will one day release an entire live album from roughly this period. It must have been truly magical to see. At the time i am writing this i am only 18 so it would not have been possible for me to view them circa 1966-1983 when the final cut was released (7 months and 14 days before my birth). The second album is THE most not-for-your-average-squeamish-moonie album i think thay have ever done. Noisy at times, and strange at most of those times. Ranging from beautiful soundscapes that are clearly orchestraly influenced to roaring cacophony that would make Throbbing Gristle head for the hills and whimper behind their mothers. And i have great respect for TG, that was not a knock on them but a bow to the floyd. a very fearful bow. Each member shine wonderfully on this album. most notable being Gilmour's sysyphus, but most famous being Waters' &quot;Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together In A Cave and Grooving On A Pict&quot; for its ridiculously long title. most have not actually heard the song, much like Careful With That Axe, Eugene which is legendary sheerly for its ridiculousness. However both are fantastic pieces when one manages to get passed the spectacle of them. Floyd, seen here as the Monty Python of music. a definite masterpiece.

0767812166|5.0|My dad used to watch this movie a lot and we'd watch it w/him.  It took me a long time to understand it.  It was the first time I'd ever seen Jeff Bridges acting.  So, when my dad told me that he was the voice of Prince Lir in &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot;, I didn't believe it because he didn't talk funny like he did in Starman.  At any rate, what a great movie.  The actors were wonderful, I have always liked Karen Allen.  And Charles Martin Smith was great as well (remember him as Toad in American Graffiti?).  This movie is not as sappy as E.T. and far from Independence Day.  The music and effects are a little cheesy, but this was made in 1982 and I thought they did ok.<br />The picture quality is great, I remember it being grainy on VHS.  There wasn't much for special features, unfortunately, but hopefully that's not why you'd buy the DVD.  Over all, I'd say it's well worth the money.
B000002C1V|4.0|Ok, i love this album, i do. but Pink Floyd (aka Roger Waters at this point) were getting HORRIBLY depressing through and through. This was a very clean shiny little gem for 1983 but don't expect anything more uplifting than The Wall to come outside of this. Maybe a few more upbeat tunes but it's still very drab and \\"let's watch this old man whither away into death\\". But good. I can see how many call it a Roger Waters solo record. but look through the catologue; the last two were roger solo efforts with some gilmour guitar solos attributed. so was most of Dark Side, so i will hear no more of it.... though on this one it's REALLY obvious. It's hard to even tell it's David on guitar, and as i recall the drums(or keyboard) had abandoned them in anger at that time only to come back for the floyd's private shame in 87. but overall it is good and the tale it tells was very fitting, at the time, for the dying beast known as Pink Floyd. Certainly meant to be a final nail in a very beautiful and mostly honorable coffin.

0553277472|5.0|There are only a handful of books that have really changed the way I've looked at things; Jerzy Kosinski's The Painted Bird, Victor Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning, Julian Jayne's The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bi-Cameral Mind, Ludwig von Mises' Human Action and Robert M. Pirsig's Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance (ZAMM). Pirsig's book may be the most profound because it not only challenges, but re-labels our entire thought process, challenging many of our most deeply held values. In fact, it's subtitled, (An Inquiry Into Values).<br />Proof that I'm not alone in assessing the impact of ZAMM is the fact that it has remained in print for nearly three decades since it was first published in 1974. That's quite an achievement for a book with such a clunky title - a book whose first publisher warned Pirsig not to expect \\"much more\\" than the $5,000 advance because, \\"works of this kind rarely sell in volume\\" and whose author readily states up front that it \\"has little to do with the study of Zen and isn't all that accurate when it comes to motorcycle maintenance either.\\"<br />On the surface, ZAMM is a very simple story about the narrator's cross-country trip on motorcycle with his emotionally troubled son, Chris and their technologically challenged neighbors, John and Sylvia Sutherland. Pirsig wraps a brilliant philosophical analysis of values, in a road story that pits Phaedrus (the narrator's former self) against his current, post-electroshock persona, his son and the techno-phobic Sutherland's.<br />The story unfolds as a series of talks or Chautauquas, in which the narrator explores such topics as \\"Classical (emphasis on underlying function) Vs Romantic (emphasis on external form)\\" styles of thinking, \\"defining quality\\" and \\"insanity as a rejection of the accepted mythos\\" (an idea previously explored by Thomas Szass).<br />Ultimately, Pirsig does nothing less than re-focus the nature and definition of QUALITY. What is it? How do we define the \\"present\\" when everything we're conscious of has already happened, been processed and is already a part of the past?<br />Phaedrus looks at quality and notes, \\"we all know it when we see it, but how is it truly defined? What makes one thing of greater or less \\"quality\\" then another?\\" He comes close to quantifying it in his \\"Church of Reason Lecture,\\" which starts on page 142 of the original paperback release.<br />Pirsig breaks the world down into two outlooks, Classic (which focuses on the underlying function) and Romantic (which focuses on the outer-lying form). Aesthetics (the study of beauty) is form based or Romantic thinking, while mechanics (the study of how things work) is function based or Classical thinking. He uses this to explain why different people see the same world in very different ways. In this journey he shows the difference between the two as the difference between the narrator's Classical outlook and that of the Sutherland's Romantic one.<br />John and Sylvia both enjoy the look and feel of riding a motorcycle, but despise the mechanical chores of keeping it functioning at top proficiency. John is proud of his shiny, new and very expensive BMW motorcycle, but can't get into the daily maintenance of it. Phaedrus, on the other hand, is primarily attracted to and focused on the underlying form of the motorcycle. He is fascinated with how it works and what causes it to break down. Phaedrus is interested in the mechanics of the bike because he wants to minimize its weaknesses and maximize its effectiveness. The Sutherland's just want to ride, and to avoid at all costs the mechanics of the thing because that's what they're on vacation for - to get away from the mechanistic world.<br />This Classic/Romantic split is important today because it explains all of our contemporary socio-political schisms so well. Emotional thinking is always Romantic, while pragmatic or logical thinking is always Classical. Both sides see only one true way of looking atthings and both overlook an important part of the puzzle of life.<br />It's why so many Leftists wear the \\"bleeding heart liberal\\" tag as a badge of honor. It feeds their emotionalism. Anything that sounds compassionate, feels good or \\"helps people,\\" is, to their form based thinking, \\"good,\\" and people who espouse self-reliance and individual responsibility are, in their view, \\"mean-spirited, Social Darwinists and well...evil\\" On the other hand, that's why economic Libertarians and social conservatives see \\"do-gooder liberals\\" as \\"grossly misguided dupes who care nothing for helping people help themselves and as well...evil.\\"<br />It's why, Romantic thinkers rarely use facts. They support their positions on what \\"feels right,\\" or \\"fair.\\" It's also why, when emotional Leftists are confronted with facts they don't like, they interpret the data as \\"angry\\" or \\"argumentative.\\" This also explains why Classical thinking Libertarians and Romantic thinking Leftists don't communicate. Classicists deal in pragmatics and facts, while Romantics deal in feelings and appearances.<br />What Pirsig does, is synthesize both Classical and Romantic components into a sort of \\"unified field theory\\" of living. He offers a vision of a complete whole - a fusion of logic and emotion, form and function. An ideal whole that we're still very far from. An ideal that cost his narrator, Phaedrus, dearly.<br />Upon reaching Montana, the Sutherland's split and head south, while the narrator and his son head on toward Bozeman, the College town in which the narrator's former self (Phaedrus) taught. As they get closer to Bozeman, the pull of the narrator's former self (Phaedrus) grows stronger and he begins reliving some of the philosophical questions that had brought Phaedrus to the brink of emotional breakdown.<br />The entire book becomes a journey of self-discovery in which the reader comes along for a ride. As the narrator gets in touch with the questions and pursuits of his former life, he realizes that, in order to connect with his son, Chris, he must first confront his former self (Phaedrus).

B000006TRV|4.0|ok, not that this is TRULY the BEST pink floyd album, i just meant generally it's one of the best, blah blah blah. But seriously, just get Shine On. It's got the Wall, Dark Side, Wish You Were Here, Meddle, Saucerful of Secrets, and Animals all for a much lower price than it would cost to get all of them seperately(and you know you will) and it's got a really nifty book and some post cards and most of relics plus some others. only drawback being that it does have Momentary Lapse of Reason which, as i have stated and will continue to state is the worst floyd album in existance. It is pop [junk]. Anyway the 4 stars is for the price. It could be much cheaper, and should be, it's a beautiful work of art masterpiece but it's not worth that because you KNOW you're getting the others anyway so cut to it and get Shine On.
6305696071|4.0|Okay, so you won't be pondering life's greatest questions after watching this movie, but you will have that nice warm feeling of a happy ending.  A modern day Cinderella, this is one of the best Julia Roberts movies made.  No wonder she and Richard Gere teamed up again in The Runaway Bride, they have such strong chemistry. Jason Alexander's character is really slimy and Laura San Giacomo is lovable as Robert's roommate.  Definitely a must see!
0441172717|2.0|...but I honestly don't see what's so great about this book. Daniel Keyes'  &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot; and Arthur C. Clarke's &quot;Childhood's End&quot; are both better science fiction stories than Dune. They make powerful, emotional statements about the human condition without rambling on incessingly or clogging the pages with useless action scenes. If you want epic literature, read Lord ot the Rings. That story about an innocent hobbit thrown into a destructive war is a million times more epic and personable than this rambling nonsence about a superhuman destined for greatness since birth. Everything is predictable about the plot, not to mention the fact that Paul is next to impossible to relate to.<br />On the other hand, Frank Herbert DID exert a lot of artistic effort into this, which is to be commeneded. Perhaps he should have exerted this effort into a better idea.
B000002JSP|5.0|This is a very impressive album. There is no track on this album that is either filler, or a throw-away.'In through the out door' begins with the eery, almost frightening sounds of Jimmy Page's guitar (played with a bow), and explodes into an awsome, and unforgetable guitar riff that is \\"In the evening\\".\\"Southbound Saurez\\" and \\"Fool in the rain\\" are equally amazing in their own rights. They are well written, and very enjoyable to listen to. \\"Hot dog\\" takes some time to get used to on the other hand, and I must admit that I wasn't very found of the track when I first heard it, but it grows on you after a while.\\"Carouselambra\\" is the high point of 'In through the out door'. If Jimmy Page's guitar work on the bridge went on for an half an hour I would be interested in listening to every second of it.\\"All my love\\" is a tender ballad written for Robert Plant's lost son, and \\"I'm gonna crawl\\" finishes the album off to a fitting conclution.The all star on this album goes to John Paul Jones, who really steps up to the plate and delivers. Jones who co-wrote 6 of the albums' 7 songs, kept the band going and gave Led Zeppelin direction, while half the band were battling with their addictions. This is probably the only Zeppelin album where Jimmy Page wasn't at the forefront of the band, but Jones was a capible leader in his own right.I recomend this album to anyone who already owns, (and likes) a Led Zeppelin album. But I wouldn't suggest it as your first Led Zeppelin CD.
B000063UR2|5.0|This is a great movie, and will always be one! I recommend this movie to anyone above the age of 7, because of Darkness, (the devil.) And because of the demons in the movie. This is my favorite fantasy film ever, it's the best one out there! If you like fantasy, adventure films this is the best ever, and the one to get. Not even Lord of the Rings could top this film in my opinion, and if you think it does, whatever, because this is the grandfather of fantasy films. This is what T.L.O.T.R. was born from. Great movie, i'm so glad i have the chance now to get it on DVD! thanks!!!!!!!
B00005B36H|5.0|You do not listen to this album...you surrender yourself to it. The experience of Lateralus penetrates deeper than the brain -- it is deeply spiritual and uplifting. Sonically, the dark sound works powerfully with MJ Keenan's dynamic, unique vocals and lyrical messages. Whether he's questioning emotional dichotomies (\\"Schism\\") or reflecting on a difficult spiritual sojourn (\\"The Grudge\\"), there is a dark, brutal beauty to this music.<br />Few bands have a collegiality that matches that of Tool. With the exception of drummer Danny Carey, this is not a band of virtuoso musicians. What separates them from the rest is their united, progressive artistic vision and originality. Danny Carey's drumming is octopus-like, modulating every passage with rhythms I can't begin to understand. Put together with rest of the crew, the opaque instrumentation creates music of endless shades and layers, with time signature changes a supercomputer couldn't crack. There is magic here. Powerful, crunching riffs are foiled often by placid, narcotic passages, generating an album that only rarely \\"rocks.\\" Instead, it's heavily cerebral, dark, beautiful...and ultimately indefinable. For a band that's selling millions of albums and getting mainstream recognition, they still carry an uncompromising progressive aesthetic.<br />Ignore those who make the asinine comment that \\"Tool sold out.\\" All other factors being equal, this is Tool's _least_ commercially viable album. Frankly, I think it's fairly remarkable that they passed off a 7-minute music video (\\"Schism\\") onto MTV. (Credit the amusingly surreal video, I guess.) I guess when a band like this becomes popular, the so-called fans dismiss quality for the sake of remaining \\"hardcore.\\" With lots of 8-minute songs, numerous melody shifts, texturally complex movements, world influences, enigmatic lyrics, this is not an album that can be easily digested. Aenima was complex in its own right, but is was nothing like _this_. I've had Lateralus for almost a year (at the time of this writing), and it remains as arresting as ever. It's so deep, I'm not sure I'll ever see the bottom; it's so high, I might never reach it. (Yes, I like that book.)<br />And yet in telling you all of this, I've told you nothing. I think the best music is the hardest to describe. Lateralus comfortably lands in that category.<br />We often hear, in a denigrating tone, \\"Yeah, that Lateralus is so self-indulgent.\\" Quite. Tool made the album they wanted to make, with commercial considerations thrown out the window. Of course it's self-indulgent -- this isn't commercial pabulum. Clearly, Tool's objective wasn't to make _you_ happy, it was to make _themselves_ happy. This is what separates art from products. <br />Tool, strangely, managed to produce high art that remains a viable product. We expect mainstream rock to be dominated by bands like Creed, Nickelback, and Staind...not Tool. None of this matters, though. Whether it sells 10 million copies or 10 thousand, great music is great music. We don't need Rolling Stone or MTV to tell us that.
006092988X|5.0|&quot;A Tree Grows In Brooklyn&quot; is a truely captivating book, from the moment I was introduced to the grubby slums and characters of Brooklyn on the first page it cast its spell over me and I could hardly wait to get back to reading it after being torn away.<BR>All the characters are well rounded and the reader is shown them in all their wonderful glory, for better or for worse.  The book's focal character is Francie, we are introduced to her aged eleven and follow her on a, sometimes turbulent, journey into adulthood as she gains wisdom and an understanding of the world.<BR>I found this book poignant, witty extremely wise and deeply moving.  Betty Smith offers some wonderful insights into the human condition and gives a vivid description of what it was like to be poor and living in the slums of Brooklyn in turn-of-the-century america.  <BR>I strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to look into the heart and soul of an era, I was deeply touched by the sheer brilliance and wisdom in this book.

0971855110|5.0|I live by myself and have never been a good housekeeper nor been organized. Flylady has helped me begin (I'm one of the slower Flybabies) simple routines that are starting to make a dent in all the STUFF I have. I use her book as a backup to the website/emails and it makes me feel like she is always with me, pulling me along and supporting me while I slowly take control of my home. She starts you out at the very beginning with &quot;Baby Steps&quot; as well as her mantra of &quot;You can do anything for 15 minutes!&quot; I am finding that through this process I am also finding strength in other areas. I hadn't realized how the atmosphere in my home has had me down emotionally. It's pretty amazing how it all ties in. She is so supportive and positive. Sounds corny, but it works for those of us who either never really learned this stuff, who just plain forgot it in all the turmoil of life, or who somehow just let our homes get out of control long ago and never got it back. There are no organizational system instructions or reccomendations, just rock solid ground support and fun and effective ways to get out from under and STAY that way!
B000002KXV|5.0|even though Im 30, I hate to admit that my tastes run towards the juvenile and reckless in rock and roll, with a few exceptions. After all, the format itself is dedicated to extolling that nascent period in one's life, but its still hard to give up the buzz that hot rock and roll gives you. But if more records like \\"The Nightfly\\" were made, it would be less shameful to indulge in rock when the time for sex and drugs has long passed. <BR>What we have here, actually, is not so much rock, but jazz and blues. The lyrics are intelligent and communicative, about making sense of a changing, dangerous world. Its written largely from the point of view of a young man growing up in the late 1950's, surrounded by high tech and nuclear escalation. Two songs deal directly with that vibe, \\"IGY\\" and \\"New Frontier\\", the former a sardonic commentary on the \\"Brave New World\\" we hope to head for, with liberty and convenience for all, the latter about who and what to put into the nuke shelter when the bomb goes off..ah heck, baby, lets just go make out in there. \\"The Nightfly\\" is the other stunner on the record about a lonely overnight DJ. This is much mellower than Steely Dan, but its more powerful than \\"Two Against Nature\\". Regardless of power, this is a keeper and a hell of an expression.

6305511055|4.0|Here are the seventies again ! At that time, Hollywood was ruled by such directors as Alan J. Pakula, John Frankenheimer or Sydney Pollack. The bad guys were the C.I.A., the F.B.I., the Big consortiums or the Army and the good guys had the face of Paul Newman, Robert Redford, Warren Beatty or John Doe. It was one of the only periods in the history of cinema during which Hollywood was the champion of morality. Alas, times change...<br />THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR stands very well the test of time with a solid plot involving a Faye Dunaway smiling for the first and last time in a motion picture, a Robert Redford gaining with this role a star status and a Max Von Sydow impersonating an official hitman. Nevertheless, there are a few gaps in the screenplay ; for instance, Robert Redford can a little bit too easily enter the Bell Central building and Faye Dunaway hasn't any difficulty to meet one of the C.I.A. big bosses. But, after all, it's only cinema !<br />THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR is a classic political thriller of above-average quality which deserves a place in every serious movie lover's library. Sound is very well balanced and clear and images reflect the sadness of an early winter.&lt;P...
0140288503|5.0|I have not seen the movie, so I can offer no comparison to it, but the book is a small classic as a book about small units at war.  It is worthwhile reading for any citizen who wants to know what uses the military is sometimes put to, and what soldiers in combat are called upon to do.  It is my understanding that this book has virtually become required reading in the officer corps of the U.S. Army; I think this is a good thing.  I was an Army officer myself (First Lieutenant, Infantry) who never saw combat; I cannot attest to the accruacy of the battle scenes but I can say that he gets the details of the equipment and the culture correct.<br />Mark Bowden, in writing the book, had no agenda or axe to grind:  he merely wanted to find out what happened.  As such, he gives a pretty objective overview of the situation in Mogadishu from all the parties involved:  the UN and Adminral Howe, the Somalis, and the servicemen involved.  His research even included travelling to Somalia to interview the Somali militia who faced the Rangers and Delta Force soldiers -- so the book has a good balance of perspectives on the battle.  <br />Bowden also gives a good account of the strains between the leadership of the Rangers and Delta -- how the more rigid discipline and formality of the Rangers contrasted with the more freewheeling Delta \\"operators\\" who, as the elite among the elite, seemingly answered to no one.  <br />The book is about a mission gone wrong -- how a plan which contained contingencies for one chopper being lost did not have contingencies for multiple choppers going down.  In addition, the troops were not prepared for night operations (plan was for a one hour mission) and did not have adequate water, night vision equipment, etc., available.  <br />The book does revisit the issue of whether if tanks were available to the units, it would have made a difference.  There was definitely not enough quick reaction forces available for a \\"mission gone bad\\"; the hours it took to assemble a U.N. relief force is an excellent example why units should always plan for the worst.<br />The book doesn't address the larger issue of whether the mission was proper for the U.S. troops; one comes to the conclusion that \\"mission creep\\" -- the temptation to use the troops for a greater role than they are configured to fight -- was and is a real problem.  Because of the past successes of the Rangers and Delta, and their overwhelming competence as soldiers, there was an aura of invincibility about them.  When they were overextended, as they were here, they proved vulnerable.  <br />This is a valuable lesson to civilian policy makers as well as to soldiers -- try to heep the mission to its original scope, or demand the assets necessary to do the job properly.  <br />That being said, the decision to leave Somalia was almost certainly the wrong one.  It gave the impression of weakness, and everyone -- especially the Somalis -- have suffered more because of it.  <br />An excellent book.
B00005V1Z5|2.0|...I didnt want to like this movie. However, given the offal that I mistakenly rent on a weekly basis, I was not driven to shower or puke after watching it. No belly laughs, but a few guffaws. Though the star is not a SNL member, it is an SNL movie more or less...Certainly better than the worst movie Ive seen in I dont know how long, \\"The Ladies Man\\", but definitely not Ben Stiller's finest moment. Chock full of meaningless cameos as well...

I should also mention it scores high on the celebrity factor with Brando playing a significant role in the film (that is, he's in more than one scene).  But when we get to the story, it's nothing more than a retelling of other older stories. <br />DeNiro's character, Nick Wells, is a veteran safecracker. The movie opens with Nick busting a safe at someone's house while a party is raging outside. After a travel montage depicting Nick's less than direct route back to his home in Quebec, we meet Max (played by Brando), the fence and the big guy who sets up Nicky with jobs. But Nick wants out of the whole thing. He's got this happenin' jazz club and his beautiful girlfriend, Diane, played by Angela Bassett. See where the movie's going? Anybody see _Carlito's Way_? Well, needless to say, Brando offers DeNiro the last big \\"score\\" and he can't refuse. And this time he's got to work with a partner, the impulsive Jack Teller (Ed Norton's role). Jack is an impersonator who's gets a job as a janitor at the site of the big score. He adopts the persona of a handicapped kid named Brian, and so no ones suspects him of anything and he stakes the place out while working the night shift. Norton deserves some recognition for this role since he does a convincing job acting handicapped. <br />So, Jack is the greenhorn, smart and talented but lacking experience and maturity. Nick is a straight player, by the books, a real stoic with a very even demeanor (trademark DeNiro). Picture this scene: DeNiro trying to talk sense into the kid (Norton), and he's calm, his plea is rational, it makes sense, but the kid is rash, stupid, and there's nothing Bobby-D can do because these kids just can't listen and do things right. They always gotta' be the hotshot! Well, that's how the film rolls out. See it for the nice cinematography and the big safecracking scene. But, if you haven't seen _Rififi_, you should see this film first. _The Score_is fun but it is a movie that will be forgotten. <br />Also: Bobby-D in his safecracking ninja suit bears an uncanny resemblance to a certain vigilante ductworker from an earlier film. Just thought I'd make the connection . . .
0553583182|5.0|I had an older copy of this book around for years and I never read it and then one day I picked it for some reading material while I was going downtown for jury duty.  I figured I might as well do something for mind while I had to wait and waste time as some would look at it.  Instead, I discovered my little second bible.  I have read sections of this book dozens of times and I have underlined many of the affirmations and I read them daily.  I even downloaded them to my palm pilot and read them when I am in car pool lines etc.  I have memorized several of the affirmations by heart.  This book has changed my attitudes and my whole concept of what is possible in life.  I even started doing workshops in my chiropractic office titled the power of affirmation in healing.  I would highly recommend this book to people interested in their personal power and reaching their full potential.  I regularly give copies to my patients as thank you gifts.
B000001IPL|5.0|Well, I can honestly say this is a great CD. It's also the one that brought the Offspring to their fame. Yes, Ignition and their self-titled album are also good, but they really weren't noticed until Smash. Many people also think this was the peak of the Offspring's career, but I have to disagree. They sound just as good now as they did back in 1994 when Smash was made. So, here's the track-by-track rundown:<br />Time to Relax- 8.5/10 This gets you in the mood for the rest of the CD. Seems like how they'd treat you in first class on an airplane.<br />Nitro (Youth Energy)- 10/10 A fast-paced song which is a great way to kick off the CD. Solid drumming plus the live fast lyrics make it a hit the whole way through.<br />Bad Habit- 9/10 Second song I heard on the CD, it's a solid piece. About a road rager who seems a little too much on the edge. Sadly, I know people who will end up like this.<br />Gotta Get Away- 9.5/10 A good opening baseline and chords kick this one off, and the lyrics suit the song well, along with the way they come out. It's about a guy who needs some \\"alone time\\" to really look at himself, kind of to be someone else.<br />Genocide- 9.5/10 This song depicts the life of a country fighting within itself, I think it could be a good song for Blackhawk Down. Solid guitar riffs and a fast-paced chorus. <br />Something to Believe In- 9.75/10 A lot of people don't like this song, and though the chorus just does repeat itself a lot, I think it's a well written tune, and the lyrics are strong and they show how people will try and get you to do something based on their beliefs.<br />Come Out and Play- 9.25/10 Easily the equivalent of Pretty Fly or Original Prankster, this fun song shows the violence of schools today, with a nice funky sound.<br />Self-Esteem- 10/10 When I first got the CD, this was the only song I'd heard, and I figured it would be the only one I'd like, but I was horribly wrong. This song has some great chords, and Dexter's voice is really good on this one. It's about a guy who's girlfriend constantly mistreats him and cheats on him, but he thinks that's ok.<br />It'll Be a Long Time- 9.5/10 This is a solid song, although the singing seems a bit off. It's about how places can crumble in an instant, and it'll be a while before everything can be right again.<br />Killboy Powerhead- 8.5/10 It's a really short song, just like much of the second half of the CD is, and the chorus gets repeated for much of it. It's a cover of another band's song, and it sounds just as good as the original.<br />What Happened to You?- 10/10 Even though it's short, I like the ska-punk sound of it. It's about a friend who was once sane and in control, but after doing drugs is totally out of it.<br />So Alone- 8.75/10 A super short song, it's basically screaming thw whole time, yet oddly enough, it still sounds good. I'm not sure what this is about, though.<br />Not the One- 10/10 This is a great song about the fact that although there are problems in the world, it's not our fault and we shouldn't blame ourselves for them. A cool intro on this one.<br />Smash- 9.75/10 Nice song, saying how you shouldn't do stuff just because other people are doing it.<br />That's the rundown of the songs on of the greatest CDs. Definitely pick this one up, even if you don't like the Offspring. You will be amazed at how good this one sounds.
B00003CXTG|2.0|It's hard not to believe on a day when more than two thousand Americans died,that there wasn't another compelling or convincing story which to carry a film.Buy the DVD and gom to the attack scene.
B00005U8EM|3.0|This is, of course, one of the best Bill Murray movies out there. However, a large part of the reason I buy or rent DVDs is for the extras, and on this DVD, they are just not worth it.<br />Having listened to excellent commentaries by Harold Ramis before (Bedazzled and Analyze This), I expected this one to be just as good or better, since this is one of my favorite movies. However, the commentary is a disappointment overall. There are a few interesting tidbits here and there, but there are also stretches throughout the movie where Ramis says nothing at all, and times when he recites the dialogue with the actors. Obviously this movie meant a lot to him, and he is understandably entertained by it, but that's not what a commentary is supposed to be about.<br />There is also a new 25-minute documentary about the making of the movie, which is a nice extra, but nothing great.<br />If you are a huge fan of this movie, you might want to rent it just for the chance to hear the commentary once and watch the documentary, but if I were you, I wouldn't waste my money buying it.
B00003CXTG|5.0|I think Pearl Harbor was a outstanding movie because it shows great meaning of how Pearl Harbor really was.It had a great meaning to it and it wouldn't have been such a good movie if it hadn't had such great actors in it like Cuba Gooding Jr.,Ben Affleck,and Josh Hartnett.I thought it was sort of a said movie as well as the end of it but throughout the whole movie I would give it Two Thumbs Up.
B00005JKT8|5.0|I have seen \\"Kate & Leopold\\" about a few days after the film came out, and I thought that it was a really sweet romantic comedy with a romantic twist! The stars of the film, Hugh Jackman (\\"Swordfish\\") and Meg Ryan (\\"Proof of Life\\") gave great and funny performances that make them the best on-screen couple since Ryan and Tom Hanks starred in \\"Joe Versus the Volcano\\", \\"Sleepless in Seattle\\", and \\"You've Got Mail\\"! I really liked Jackman the most in this film because I would like to think of \\"Kate & Leopold\\" as his follow-up film to 2001's \\"Someone Like You\\" with Ashley Judd. The direction of James Mangold (\\"Cop Land\\", \\"Girl, Interrupted\\") was brilliant in every way possible! The film starts off in the late 19th century version of New York. The year is 1876. It concerns Duke Leopold of Albany (Jackman) being accidentally swept away into the present-day New York one night. He takes one look at how the \\"new\\" New York is and he is quite shocked at what he is seeing. In other words, Leopold has to adjust (\\"blend in\\") with this new trend somehow. There he meets a hardworking Manhattan executive named Kate McKay (Ryan) who lives with her brother Charlie (Breckin Meyer, \\"Road Trip\\"). During the film, to me, it seems as though Leopold and Kate might not be the perfect couple, they might not see eye to eye, but when you get right down to it, they just might fall in love together! In closing, the performances by Jackman and Ryan were very sweet and very appealing as well. The other performances by Breckin Meyer, Natasha Lyonne (\\"American Pie 1 and 2\\"), and Liev Schreiber (\\"The Hurricane\\"), who plays Ryan's ex-boyfriend, were simply amazing and quite enjoyable! \\"Kate & Leopold\\" has got to be Hugh Jackman's best since \\"Someone Like You\\" and Meg Ryan's best since \\"Sleepless in Seattle\\"! It is so charming, so witty, and so downright funny that you would have to see \\"Kate & Leopold\\" again and again! A great DVD addition to any romantic comedy collection!
B00003CXTG|4.0|A great movie to see on the big screen.Lots of action and the camera work is fantastic work.It seems alot shorter than the three hours it lasts.
B00005QK3W|3.0|I'm not as enthused over this album as everyone else seems to be; maybe I'm missing something...like the 80's. I'm a third-generation Beatles fan who's building his collection from the ground-up, meaning original Beatles recordings, then early solo albums, mid 70's efforts, and so forth.<BR> I haven't gotten to the eighties Beatles stuff yet, but I do pick up Paul and Ringo's new releases when they come out, which is why I think this album doesn't thrill me as much 'cause it harkens back to that era of Paul's career(I do know some of his 80's work).<BR> But I will say a few things about select songs here; for one, \\"She's Given Up Talking\\" is the funkiest I've heard Paul since the \\"If We Ever Get Out Of Here\\" part of the \\"Band On The Run\\" title track. It's entirely reminiscent of John's \\"Steel And Glass\\" from his \\"Walls & Bridges\\" album.<BR> Two, the semi-instrumental \\"Heather\\" is very charming and sounds right at home when you're driving a long way very fast.<BR> Three...\\"FREEDOM\\"!!!! This confirms every suspicion I ever had that, as good as Sir Paul is in the studio, he belongs in front of an audience! This is Paul's strongest vocal in years, and he chose the very simple and familiar G-Em-C-D chords around which to base a strong, political song that not even a few clunky rhymes could tarnish; this song is most definitely \\"Give Peace A Chance\\"'s MUCH younger sister.<BR> One thing, though, in reference to the head reviewer at the top of the page...it was John, not Paul, who sang \\"All You Need Is Love\\", so the philosophies are not in conflict.<BR> All in all, a \\"nice\\" album; if it were someone at a party, it wouldn't be the loud, annoying guy bothering everyone with his dumb jokes or the prissy, stuck-up snob who's just there to be seen...it would be the classy guy who's there to have a good time and would even hand you a clean glass when you need it.
B00000J2SQ|4.0|But it has some good songs in it. MISS mistreated has a very original solo ( but of course, you can tell it's Ritchie as he plays the first note ). I love Ritchie and love Rainbow, so I think you should give all cd's a listen. But begin with &quot;Long live Rock'n'roll&quot; or &quot;Rising&quot;. Even if you like the Joe Lynn Turner era, I think the best one is &quot;Difficult to cure&quot;.
B00005OCMR|4.0|Tron still inspires today, despite the fact that it was written before the PC revolution.<br />The core of its story reveals an epic struggle between monolithic centralised corporations and networks of independent programmers for control over the future of computers.<br />In 1982, Tron asked - will we see a world where computer usage, application, development &amp; growth be driven solely by ubercorporations, or will we see (in Tron's words) &quot;a free system&quot; where the independent user can innovate, interact &amp; freely explore their digital potential with other users?<br />Well, it's now 2002 &amp; I'm writing this review on a personal computer to be read by anyone hooked up to the Internet, an aggregated network of PCs hooked up to hundreds of millions of users throughout the world, unfettered, as in Tron's vision.<br />It's true that Tron is more remembered for pioneering the use of computer graphics in film, for kicking off the video gaming age, or even for attempting to build an immersive digital world 15 years before The Matrix.<br />But I think that it's greatest accomplishment is that it spoke for the future, envisioning &quot;a free system&quot; where the computer liberates the average person in the street by providing an avenue for heightened communications &amp; abilities never before achieved in human history. Tron announced to an unsuspecting public the beginning of the digital democracy. And we've not looked back since.<br />It's no wonder that Bruce Boxleitner's programmer character, Allen, is named after the inventor of Apple's first PC.
B00005OWEG|5.0|Maybe it's because I'm older now, but having just watched this movie on DVD for the first time since seeing the original in 1979 (when I was 16), it made so much more sense to me than it did back then.  And my appreciation for just how well this movie was filmed and put together is dramatically enhanced; this is a superb movie, and they don't make them like this anymore.  Because there was such a long amount of time between when I first saw it and now, I don't know the extent to which it was re-edited, but the characters made a bigger impression on me, the visuals made a bigger impression, and the story made a bigger impact on me.  Regarding the two long scenes that were added (the second Playmate scene and the French Plantation scene), honestly, while they did much to explain some things, they seemed somewhat out of place.  But regardless, I think this is an amazing film.  And the quality of the DVD (video transfer, sound) is great...
B00005IC2H|5.0|Agaetis Byrjun is one of those albums that no word can describe. maybe &quot;wow&quot;. With their debut, Von, Sigur Ros set out as an avant garde band with very abient leanings, some songs being quite atonal and without melody. but on their sophmore effort, agaetis, they have set a new standard for beauty in music. the first thing the listener needs to do when listening to this album is forget all preconceptions of what music should be. this will blow all those ideas away. the haunting beauty of svefn-g-englar is a great example. besides being original and progressive, it is quite possibly one of the catchiest songs ever written. it conjures up images of floating through space, swimming in the arctic ocean, standing at a funeral, and looking at a newborn baby all within the blink of an eye. i could give lists for every single song, but the general idea is that this music is amazingly beautiful and emotional. sigur ros has garnered comparisions to my bloody valentine, radiohead, and the cocteau twins, among others. without taking anything away from the aforementioned, amazing bands, sigur ros blows them out of the water. it takes all of the good elements of those bands and takes them up ten notches. it is impossible to articulately describe their music. . . but the one word that comes to mind is perfection. so this cd is highly recomended. their live show too, they give great concerts. if you want to experience music, not just hear it, and feel what it's like when music is done so right it could bring a tear to your eye, listen to sigur ros
0375751513|4.0|C.S. Lewis wrote that pride is the greatest sin. It is the doorway to all other kinds of evil. Though this was certainly not what Oscar Wilde was writing about, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a perfect illustration of this. The protagonist's pride causes him to go to horrible lengths. In the end it causes everyone around him (and eventually himself) great pain. I have read Wilde's works only a couple of times since being introduced to them in high school. Each time I do, I remember how much I like him as an author. This time, I was once again reminded how masterful Wilde was as a writer. His keen wit and incisive humor is refreshing. His prose is clean and unlabored. I don't know why I haven't read his stuff more often. I certainly will now.

B000063CMK|4.0|I know this sounds odd but in terms of classifying the type of music on the album i would have to say that it is emo-prog.  The songs deal with loss and suffering and pain and how those problems are dealt with.  Its kind of a sad album, but if you are having problems in your life, i would suggest giving this disc a spin because it will help.<BR>There are many great songs on this album such as A trace of blood, ending theme, ropes end, beyond the pale, and second love.  The whole album is pretty good and most of it is enjoyable to listen to (sometimes the vocals on chain sling and fandago get a bit annoying but they are still good).  The playing on this album for the keys and the drums and bass are incredible, but the guitars are a little lacking.  That isnt so bad though, there is an occasional solo that is pretty cool, i just wish there were a couple more guitar solos than key solos. I do really like this album a lot, but it is far from the masterpiece that perfect element was.  I rate this album a four compared to their last album, but it would be a five when comparing it to the mainstream [stuff] that so many people listen to today.  Be different, listen to prog.  Listen to Pain of Salvation.  In short, buy this album.
B00005JKNF|5.0|In Gosford Park Robert Altman sets himself an almost impossible task, and pulls off what might be The Perfect Movie.  This one has it all: drama (both high and low) and comedy, sex and violence, incredible beauty and vile human ugliness.  It has a script that one would think some mid-level executive in Hollywood would have squashed as being more story than could be told in two-plus hours, and it probably needed a Robert Altman both to get the green light for the project in the first place and then to actually pull it off.<br />The setting is a large British country house in the '30s, and the plot centers around the house residents and several wealthy guests and all their servants at the house for a weekend of hunting.  Immediately the house is divided between the nobles and the servants, and much of the next two hours' interplay involves this distinct class difference.  The guests interact with the house residents and the other guests, while the visiting servants are accommodated by the butler and head housekeeper and head chef of the house.  The nobles come downstairs occasionally to give instructions, and the servants are quitely everywhere as the nobles discuss all their dirty little secrets (and make some new ones).  All the doings upstairs are duly scrutinized and analyzed by the servant corps, and alliances are formed and fall as events unfold.<br />This all requires a very large cast (and he could not possibly have cast better--there are too many standouts to mention) but Altman begins with Maggie Smith and her maid and driver, to set the tone and to introduce a pivotal character, and also to ease us into what will shortly be a very hectic scene.  We meet a few others as she makes her journey, and she arrives at the house to join the fray.  Each character plays a vital part in what begins as a huge and confusing puzzle, and each little story and subplot is essential to the fabulous, three-dimensional whole that is, almost miraculously, birthed at the end.<br/>But that intricacy places some demands on the viewer; indeed, the most common criticism I've seen is from viewers who wander innocently into the fray and never find their way back out.  It's a movie that requires rapt attention at all times, but it rewards us by leaving us stunned and breathless not for the body count or special effects but simply for the sheer virtuosity of the story-telling.  That he actually pulls it all together in the end is a bit like watching a vaudeville juggler who keeps 18 plates spinning while singing an opera aria and balancing on a beach ball with one foot: you're convinced A) that it can't be done, and B) that even if it CAN be done it won't be accomplished this time!  The first time I saw it I was wowed but left the theater still wondering about a couple of the characters.  The second time it made much more sense, but I think there are discoveries aplenty to be made by further viewings (which will have to wait for the DVD)!<br />Movies are about story-telling, and about the human beings in those stories.  No special effects budget can take the place of great writing, or of a substantial idea well-executed.  But maybe if movies like this are becoming rarer (though it's been a good year for movies) it makes one like Gosford Park stand out from the hail of bullets and reminds us what great story-telling really is.
B000060P79|5.0|Simple Plan is a great new band! I heard \\"I'm Just A Kid\\" on mtv, and was instantly hooked.  I got their new cd, and it rocks!! Their songs are great, and the music is hot.  All of the songs are good, and you won't want to skip any of them.  I definetly reccommend this CD to anyone who likes Punk, or is just looking for something new. So buy this CD, or you'll regret it! And don't forget to go see \\"The New Guy\\" when it hits theaters. \\"I'm Just A Kid\\" is on the soundtrack, and is probably in the movie. So go see it!
B00005RZV4|5.0|I personally really liked the cd, but then again, this is me we're talking about....Trent Reznor is really cool, and i think i sound like a groupy so i'll just be quiet now. *subliminal message* GO BUY JOHNNY THE HOMICIDAL MANIAC
B00005UEAR|5.0|It's almost unfair for the editorial reviewer to say, &quot;...they've found a formula and are sticking to it.&quot;  Though the comment is meant well, the sheer inventiveness of the material belies any notion of &quot;formula&quot;.  Six Degrees does meander from time to time, but no matter - it's a brilliant onslaught of creativity from start to finish, and has occupied my CD player for weeks on end.  Dream Theater fans must own this, and those who have wanted to give them a try will find a representative sample right here.  One of their best efforts, and that's saying a lot - highly recommended listening.
B000003TAR|5.0|First of all, I would like to say that this album ain't for the faint of heart. It is the complete opposite to Nevermind. while Nevermind had very catchy, jolly and sort of poppy songs, In Utero has some of the darkest and heaviest songs I've heard in a long time, with songs about death, addiction, suicide and some other irrelevent themes, but still this album is a masterpiece.<BR> This is also a very moody album, ranging from soft, heart-wrenching songs, to very heavy songs, to punk rock. The standout track is probably Heart-Shaped Box, which in my opinion is a brilliant song. It contains the sickest and most unique lyrics that Kurt Cobain has ever written, and contains the same soft/hard dynamics used in Teen Spirit. Other great songs are All Apologies, Pennyroyal Tea, Dumb and Rape Me, the catchiest song on the whole C.D. This is probably one of the most important albums of the 90's, and if you're a big fan of grunge and you don't have this album, I'd suggest you go and get it right now.
B00001O2GN|3.0|ROBOCOP - The '87 blockbuster that started it all. Look, I'm well aware that this is not the \\"greatest\\" movie of all time, but it sure is my favorite. I grew up with it. I mean, true, the film's violence is pretty nasty an' unremitting even by today's standards (in fact, movies have gotten TAMER since then), but once you get past that you'll find an incredible world here that Paul Verhoeven created that has influenced many other films. It's cold an' cynical society is established through sardonic television news, commercial products, big business conferences, an' the idea that the body of a hero cop killed in the line of duty could be used as the blueprint for a new brand of law enforcement (marketed not by the police force, but by a major corporation). The movie is wickedly satirical, but there is also an incredibly human story beneath the surface, as Robocop, the half-man/half-machine, begins to re-discover his past and what he was, which makes him further resent what he has been turned into. If you're looking for the ultimate sci-fi movie, no need to look further. THIS is it. A modern classic.    ROBOCOP 2 - In some ways, 'Robocop 2' is a really underrated movie. I mean, it really is almost just as creative as the original in a lot of ways. During a huge citywide police strike, Robocop is the lone officer that patrols the crime-filled streets, now completely overrun with designer drugs and heartless thieves an' criminals. The OCP corporation that created Robocop (and runs the city's police force) is apparently oblivious to all. The chairman played again by Dan O'Heirley has gotten wildly out-of-control after his massive success with law enforcement, and decides to up the ante by creating a newer version of their original Robocop. I shouldn't give too much away, but there's quite a few cool touches to this one, although the film loses its bottom by the end and becomes almost a parody of itself. Overall an above average sequel that just barely falls short. Now...ROBOCOP 3 - Ohhh, boy. Here's the Robocop movie that you can skip, and not miss a thing. I don't think there is one redeemable quality about this film. The plot is basically OCP running thousands of citizens out of their homes to make room for urbanization and high-rise office buildings. A small citizens' uprising begins underground, raging guerilla warfare against the capitalist army. Robocop, sensitive to the little people as he is, decides to join them and assist the rebel forces in their crusade. Even the appearance of veteran actors like Rip Torn and CCH Pounder can't save this awful mess. The story plays like an after-school special, with cheesy morals being plastered in your face, an' awful dialogue an' corny one-liners from every character that will make you wince with embarrassment. Peter Weller, who played Robocop excellently in the first two films, is replaced by Robert John Burke, and, although you wouldn't think it would be all that noticeable due to Robocop's limited dimensions, it's ANNOYINGLY noticeable.    Overall, the DVD set is nothing really amazing, with hardly any features on any one of the discs. But at least the films are shown in Widescreen format, the way the movies were presented in theaters, and the sound and picture quality is obviously sharper an' clearer than my beat-up, worn-out VHS copies. Any fan of this series should be happy purchasing this collection for the simple fact of having the complete trilogy. It's not likely that the Robocop series will ever be resurrected (especially not after the UNFORGIVEABLE third film), but I'll never get sick of watching and remembering how fresh, sardonically funny, and action-packed the first two were, and how I seemed to never get sick of the half-man/half-machine police officer who went out against all the odds, refused to let go of his humanity, and dished out some cold justice against the deplorable criminals who made him what he was.
B000000OQF|4.0|I've never been a big fan of Guns, but I've always appreciated them a lot, because they made some really great songs. And I rated this C.d four stars instead of five because I don't especially like all of the songs on the album. I mean, songs like Paradise City and Sweet Child of Mine  are one of my favourite songs ever, but I just find that some of the other songs aren't nearly as good as these two. But hey, that's just my opinion, and I'm not saying that this is true.<BR>Anyways, I'd recommend this C.d to all of you metal lovers who appreciate really good music and avoid trash like Limp Bizkit, Korn and Slipknot.It's a classic, and you won't be disappointed when you purchase it.
B00003CXA2|1.0|The movie is fast paced and pretty entertaining. However, as a form of art, I thought the movie really [wasn't].  Tom Hanks does a superb job of acting stupid and the movie doesn't seem to have any real message.  The real problem is that the Forest Gump character is very annoying and once you notice this, the movie really starts to have a grating sensation (fingernails on a chalkboard type stuff).
B00005NWM3|1.0|So one day I sign up to write a music review for my school newspaper. I start thinking about what albums have just come out that I would be interested in reviewing. While I'm thinking and asking, someone says they're got the new Nickelback album, and lo and behold, a day later I've got a burned copy.<br />I'd only heard \\"Breathe\\" and \\"How You Remind Me\\" from Nickelback, and both seemed pretty good to me, so I was going into this with pretty high hopes. But that's as good as it got, sadly. The best thing I can say about this is album is that it has a good start, putting the only passable songs right up front in the first two tracks. \\"Never Again\\" is a good rocker that deals with spousal abuse, and of course \\"How You Remind Me\\" is the big hit single that suckered people into buying this album. I'd also like to add that, as many of you have probably noticed by now, that song loses much of it's appeal after repeated listening.<br />If you want an idea about how bland this record is, read the last paragraph and realize those were the GOOD THINGS I had to say about it. After an initial eight or nine minutes of decent rock, we're treated to another half an hour of the same old, chugging generic alternative-metal riffs. I could barely tell any of the songs apart after listening to the album half a dozen times. That isn't a good sign.<br />\\"Silver Side Up\\" is only about forty minutes, but the time drags so it seems much longer than that. I don't know what happened, on some previous songs and even for a brief time on this album Nickelback showed that they could produce good material, but either they're lazy or just plain out of ideas. They lack a distinctive sound in every possible way, and are just an amalgam of numerous other bands of this genre. Even their singer just sounds like the mutant ... offspring of Gavin Rossdale and Aaron Lewis. That's right, they're stealing their sound from bands that are already derivitave. <br />The low point is probably \\"Where Do I Hide\\", one of the corniest songs I've ever heard in my life. Sample lyrics: \\"Got a criminal record/I can't cross state lines/First on the bad list/And you're last on mine\\".<br />If this review hasn't convinced you that this album isn't worth it, you're probably not going to be swayed. But my ultimate recommendation is to avoid this one at all costs.
B00003CXZ3|5.0|if you dont see this movie you are cheating yourself, its incredable. the acting, the story, everything. the people who are complaining about the plot not being beleviable should stop trying to analyze everything, give it a rest...enjoy the movie for what it is....the best film of 2001.
B00003CX5P|5.0|This movie is great, Jar Jar or not. It keeps the Star Wars saga alive. This movie has everything from Gungans to Wookies, Humans to E.T.s. This movie ROX.<br />I remember seeing the movie when I was youthful. I was so pumped and ready to see the flick! I was wereing a Wars T-Shirt and was ready! It opened with a wonderful BANG. Seeing those LightSabers clash, baby, I was a kid again.<br />The acting is perfect, with the exception of Padme. I can't believe how stale she was! Lucas [did well] directing, but I say he shoud've used models like the Classics, but he used CGI!<br />I hope this movie is re-released in 17 years!
B000021YQV|5.0|There is no doubt that this album will have heads banging all over the world. If you listen to this second cd of this band (Toxicity), you will truly understand where this generation of rock bands is going. I don`t quite know what category this band (System Of A Down) fits into, maybe it's Nu-metal. For me, this album is simply the best albun of 2002. Serj Tankian with his naive and socially conscious lyrics and hypnotic weird vocal style is destined to become the Bono (U2 vocal) of Nu-metal. This Armenian album will make you hear a style of music that you will not find anywhere else. There are parts in some of the songs that are slower and then when you least expect they change into a heavy, head-banging style. I wish to see this Armenian band playing live here in So Paulo but it will take a long time, because the album has just been released. I suggest you give this cd a try, and when you find out that you love it, spread the sickness to your friends.
B00003CXCT|3.0|This movie isn't that great. I am glad, however, that it spawned more movies, which were good. I mean, it's OK, but the best one is Return of the Jedi!
B00003CXB7|5.0|I was always a bigger fan of the TV show than the movie (Still Am) but the special features of this film were fascinating!  I had no ideas the struggles the filmmakers went through to get this movie made.<br />An interesting documentary on the second disc also compares the film, the tv show, and the real Korean war.<br />Interesting Stuff
B00005U18E|5.0|Although Emily Watson was cast aside for the American actress Renee Zellweger, she was great impersonating a British accent and playing out the character in the book.  She wears this awful suit picked out by her mother.  The suit on her looks very tight and uncomfortable on her.  That is where it starts to be amusing.  It is even more amusing when she flirts with Daniel, her boss and at the vicars and tarts party.  <BR>The actors parallel with the characters in the book.  Colin Firth, who played in \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" as a bitter aristocrat, plays the same role in this movie.  I don't care for the soundtrack, but the movie was worth the investment.

0971855110|5.0|This book had changed my life. Because I have read it, I am happier, my home is squeaky clean and my life is so much simpler and organized. I have never been know to be a neat person and my husband and friends are amazed by my new habits. Flylady taught me that a few daily and simple routines make a huge difference in my family's way of living. This book is worth every penny.. Can you really put a price on having an enriched quality of life? Oh, also it's easy to read and funny!
B000000JO3|5.0|If you think you like hardcore and haven't heard Minor Threat, you may need to reevaluate.  Simply put, MT is the most meaningful and honest band of the '80's.  The straight edge lifestyle emerged as a direct result of the song of the same name.  That is the kind of lyrical honesty we have here.  If a single song can spark a worldwide movement, then none of my words can do it justice.  Anyone into punk or hardcore NEEDS this.  Buy it NOW.
0971855110|5.0|I have been a subscriber of the author's website for about a year now.  I am so glad she wrote a book to share with the world.  If you live in chaos (can't have anyone over syndrome) and need organization in your home/life, buy this book...you won't be sorry.<BR>I went from a grossly cluttered, disorganized home to a home I now can invite friends over and be proud.  My life has completely changed.  Throw out all your other &quot;get organized&quot; books and get this one, it truly works.  I LOVE FLYLADY!
B000002AH9|5.0|I admittedly was never particularly drawn to Billie Holiday for various skewered reasons (too legendary, too long ago, too sad). But after seeing her story on an A&amp;E Biography, curiosity got the best of me, especially with respect to Lady In Satin. I remember having run across this album in the stores; it was the only Holiday offering that looked like an actual album, as opposed to the endless profusion of latter-day compilations.<br />  I haven't wanted to listen to anything else since I bought it last week.  It's just that good! There's something to be said for an artist's so-called &quot;declining period&quot;. Though even for someone like myself who's largely unfamiliar with Lady Day's early work, this album can make for difficult listening. But her worn out, often fractured voice only adds to the material's emotional honesty. Be prepared to have your heart ripped out by &quot;Glad To Be Unhappy&quot;; her voice has a whimsical trace that somehow manages at times to pierce through the sadness.<br /> Placing singers with less-than-perfect voices into lush pop arrangments tends to make for very appealing contradictions. <BR>  It's very easy to see why this was Holiday's personal favorite album. The well-documented liner notes only serve to make the album and the Lady all the more compelling.  This one will haunt you...and you'll be glad.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones is another fine example of in which curiousity killed the cat based on the word of mouth. I'm not particularly keen on anything jazz or jazz-influenced that still didn't deter me from checking out Norah Jones' stellar debut album &quot;Come Away With Me&quot;. &quot;Come With Me&quot; is a stunning collection of original and cover songs in which Norah's breathtaking voice gracefully glides through without a single stutter. Now while this album isn't pure jazz (according to some people which really should not be an issue). Norah reminded me quite a bit of the late folk/jazz singer Eva Cassidy with her soft-spoken vocals. The only song I didn't particularly cared for on this cd was &quot;Don't Know Why&quot;. That song just didn't do anything for me. I loved her version of the Hank Williams' song &quot;Cold Cold Heart&quot;. I thought she did a spectacular job on that song. As far as original material, I think my favorite track is &quot;Nightingale&quot;. The song simply took my breathe away (as did the rest of the album). This is a nice easy-going album to listen to with diverse influences of jazz and folk fused together. Hopefully on her next album, Norah will choose a few more songs that are more uptempo but overall &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; didn't disappoint me. Norah definitely shows a lot of promise as an artist and I will most certainly be keeping a close eye on her in the near future.
B000060P79|5.0|This cd is great for all those fans out there who like anything from Blink-182 to Sugar Ray. They combine teenage angst with a great beat. The cd is definetly worth at least a listen to. It goes from punk rocking hard in songs like \\"I'm Just A Kid\\" and \\"I'd Do Anything\\" to a lighter sound (and my two faves)in \\"One Day\\" and \\"Perfect\\". Give this cd a listen to and check out their web site (...). These guys rock and one of my newest favorites since they played here @ my university!
6301934229|5.0|\\"the hitcher\\" is an overlooked horror masterpiece, whether one can stomach the admittedly excessive violence or not. rutger hauer gives the performance of his career as john ryder, a tormented and possibly supernatural hitchhiker that c. thomas howell makes the big mistake of picking up on his way cross country to a car dealership. boy he shouldn't have done that. see what happens when you pick up people hanging out in the middle of nowhere in trench coats? you get thrown into inescapable metaphysical nightmares that will leave a scar or two on the psyche.<br />the most unforgettable scene is in the beginning, when howell throws hauer out of the car onto the road and the hitcher, whatever and whoever he is, slowly gets up and looks tragically and hauntingly into the distance. it can't be said what he's thinking about or what his tormented look means, but it is one of the most memorable sequences in the history of the horror genre. the camera pans under him and cuts off at just the right moment.   .... there is no way the gratuitous and disgusting shoot em up scenes can detract even slightly from the value of this film. it is hypnotic, dreamy, and absolutely entrancing. not even one star should be taken away from this movie for the violence. this movie is so firmly etched into my memory that every time i hear the doors' \\"riders on the storm\\" i think of it immediately. see it.

B00005JKED|5.0|At first glance this movie can be cast aside as another decent Washington flick, but if one chooses to take the time to think about this movie, it becomes the best motion picture of the year.<br />This story takes place of the course of one day, and during this day we see the plateaus the police must reach and depths that the police must sink to in order to keep our streets safe. It is a brilliant movie portraying the king of the undercover world falling from his throne.<br />As for the acting, Denzel Washington was very strong. His intensity was believable and he radiated enough for all others to work off of. Eathan Hawke, although not his best performance, still was very strong and was key to the movie. He and Denzel worked well together and no other actors could have performed as well as they have.<br />The reality of the flick is unparalleled. It is filmed on location and the extras are from the areas; one could not ask for more.<br />Overall, this movie was excellent. It shows a fall from grace and the tough decision a rookie must make. No other movie has done it before and it wouold be an unsurmountable challenge to out-do this one.
B00000JTB2|5.0|This cd rocks! (Even though it's blues.)  The in between banter, between Mr. King and Mr. Vaughan, shows the ease with which the two blues players work together.  The songs are great and the playing is outstanding.  One problem, listening to this recording makes one wish it had been a 2CD set (at the very least!)  It's a shame that there wasn't enough material to make a \\"Part 2\\".  Thanks.  A must have for all SRV fans.  Also, a treat for Albert King fans.  It shows why the death of Stevie, at such a young age was a tragedy, and why the death of Albert King was also sad.  If they could be here to play together again one wonders what \\"magic\\" they could have created.  MDC
B0000634EV|5.0|I didn't even know about DOWN or their first album NOLA until the end of 2001. But even at that time, about seven years after the album came out, I loved it and played it over and over again.<BR>I waited with anticipation for this album to be released and I was expecting a killer album. I am not disappointed. This album has more bass and a very classic rock feel to it. There are plenty of influences that show up on this album. I would say it has some of the following artisits' influenced sounds in it: Sabbath, Zeppelin, and Soundgarden That's pretty good company!<BR>This album is heavy, moody, and soulful all at the same time. While I don't like every song, I like most of them and I am not disappointed at all. In fact, I am going to see them in concert in May and can hardly wait!<BR>If you liked the first album - NOLA, this album is a bit slower, but it is produced much better and just plain rocks!
B00005Y7AW|4.0|Rufus Wainwright proves again why he's pop music royalty.  &quot;Poses&quot; is a sterling collection of imaginative songs, a bit down, but always hopeful and melodic.  Wainwright infuses every verse with heartfelt emotion, making the most of a generally dark serious set that nonetheless is ethereal and magical.  In years to come, this artist will be a legend - no doubt about it.  He's talented as a songwriter first and a singer second, yet few other artists are successful at both the way Rufus is.  Whether singing about tragedy or love, Wainwright is part Dylan, part Sheryl Crowe, and yet always uniquely his own voice.  A winning combination!
0930289455|3.0|Yes, this book has one of the most bizarre, ruthless depictions of the Joker in comics history.  Yes, there is a crucial Batman continuity event here.  Yes, the creepy cover gets even creepier after you've read the story.<br />But it's not Alan Moore's best work, it's not the best Batman story ever, and it's not the best Joker story ever.<br />Yes, Moore and Bolland do a wonderful job of depicting the Joker's worldview and giving us insight into his motivations by fleshing out his origin.  Yes, the Joker is so twisted that you'll find yourself agape at the perversions he thinks are humorous.  And yes, his cry of &quot;see what one day can do to a man&quot; gives him a previously unrevealed pathos.<br />But the story is sticky and difficult to slog through--it dawdles along and then comes to a complete stop when Moore indulges himself in something that he should have known wouldn't work in a comic book:  the Joker sings.  Page after page after page, the Joker sings about what it means to be insane and how you can be insane too if you just let yourself. It didn't work for me, and after two pages, I just started skimming the words and concentrating on the pictures.  I may be recalling this incorrectly, but there's nothing happening in the panels while the Joker drones on and on that couldn't be depicted in a panel or two.  For me, this sequence guts the whole story.<br />Treasure it for its contributions to Bat-culture, but please don't call this one of the greatest Batman stories ever told.
630170648X|5.0|Want to have fun at the movies?  Look no further than this often-overlooked gem, with classic performances, a magical script and a laugh-a-minute.  This is Jack Benny at his very best, and stands as a crowning achievement in cinema.  Up there with Mel Brooks classics and Capra's fables, &quot;To Be Or Not To Be&quot; is moviemaking at its finest!
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This film is exquisite.  There are very few films I can think of that literally change the course of your life and this is one of them.  I assure you that you will be moved if you see this.  The editing is something that I have never seen before and the acting is top notch.  As an actor, I would love to work with this director as he is on new ground here.  Ellen Burstyn SOOOOO deserved the Best Actress award, her performance is like nothing you have seen.  Again, if you are depressed, DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM!!!!
B00000612Q|5.0|Continues where Every Picture . . .  leaves off.  Just as outstanding!
B00003CXXS|4.0|Joe Johnston, taking over the reigns from Spielberg, has created an adventure that starts off quickly and hardly ever lets up. Sam Neill, returning to the role which made him famous in the original, is a stronger presence than in the first Jurassic, and the suppourting cast of William H. Macy, Alessandro Nivola and Tea Leoni manage not to get lost amidst the barrage of CGI dinosaurs.<br />The special effects are, of course the main stars, with Stan Winston's excellent dinosaurs surpass the ones for the original. And the plot (a bunch of people get stuck on an island with dangerous dinosaurs) provides plenty of great scares (a scene with nasty pterodactyls is the high-point) and fast-paced action to satisfy audiences. Great fun.

0743420373|2.0|This book was written years ago and although it was ground breaking information then it basically gives statistics and generalities on the rich.  Its message about being frugal and investing is repeated in a number of wealth building books.  Not worth the hype!
0553573403|5.0|Instead of ramming magic and sorcery down your throat, this book illustrates that fantasy can be superb by simply creating characters that we truly care about.<br />In fact, besides the limited role of The Others, it's not until the very last page of the book that we are told of a truly supernatural occurrence.  Most of the novel involves good old sword fighting and the battle for the throne.  Excellent book!
0060931671|5.0|...and perhaps the best single book written on the 1960's. While i will agree with other readers that this isn't Pynchon's best book it is still a great read and takes you places that you will want to re-visit periodically. Although ostensibly revolving around the heroine Oedipa Maas' attempts to probate the will of a former lover, The Crying of Lot 49 sweeps us up and down the west coast of a U.S. that is visibly coming apart at the seams. From a San Francisco where folks are \\"lookin' for a Good Time\\" to a southern California that is caught in a hollow booming suburbia and rising defense industry (Pynchon enthusiasts will immediately recognize Yoyodyne, an organization that also manages to drift into film in The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai)we get a rare glimpse back into a time when just about anything seemed not only possible but likely. The Tristero network can be looked at as an odd but wonderful foreshadow of the Internet, and all too much else that at the time seemed Pynchon's fantasy has now come to pass.  Unlike some other reviewers I regularly laughed myself sick -although at times it is a sick laughter. Conspiracy enthusiasts will be delighted to find that not only are They out to Get them, but They have been around much longer than you thought. Did it happen? was the whole thing a practical joke? read it & see. In the meantime, We STILL Await Silent Tristero's Empire.
B00005LOUP|5.0|Guys, get over the idea that this movie is not a very close remake of Dr. Seuss' story. In order to make this story work cinematically, the Grinch got to have a backstory, and the Whos had to be a little less \\"innocent\\". I like what Ron Horward and Jim Carrey did here. Yes, I love the critics to commercialism about Christmas, I love the idea BOTH the Grinch and the Whos are wrong, and in their interaction they come to understand what Christmas is really about. Jim Carrey is absolutely fantastic in this role, he'll make you laugh, he'll make you cry, there should be an Oscar category for comedic roles like this. Believe me, doing what he does is not easy, it's even more difficult than many dramatic roles. I was expecting the boring, silly, Dr. Seuss' story (sorry, but it really is), and they gave a really novel and updated version that had in me a better \\"feel good\\" effect than the original story. Don't compare, look at the movie as somenthing different, and you'll enjoy it.
0385503954|5.0|I agree with a previous reveiewer-don't read too many reviews because it may spoil the fun.  I read this book quickly and was thoroughly engrossed and enthralled with McEwan's precise, descriptive prose.  Even the simplest sentences are strewn together so craftily that I had such solid images in my mind and was lost from MY world for hours.  The &quot;war&quot; section was especially gripping, but even the begining, which some think is slow, has beautiful moments of interior dialogue.  <br />It is also a thought provoking novel.  It's surprising ending raised more questions than it answered, not just about the characters and plot itself, but also about the nature of writing and narration.  &quot;Atonement&quot; lingered in my head for some time after and that's what a good book should do.  After having survived &quot;The Corrections&quot; I realized this novel has a perfect pace and length and it's just really well written.
B000003S0B|4.0|I like this cd because it builds on the latter kc release, 'In the court...' and extends to further musical realms only this band could go/achieve.<br />'Pictures of a city' is marvelous.  Nice and developed.  'Cadence and cascade' too.  Excellent work bringing in singer Gordon haskell.  The rest of the album really stands out good including 'the devil's triangle'.<br />I reccomend this cd because King Crimson is and was a group which took risks on recordings that gave good results.
0060934913|4.0|I just read this book by recommendation and really enjoyed it.  If you've spent a lot of time eating or working in restaurants you will appreciate how grueling of a job it is for the staff. Bordain convinced me that maybe my office job IS cushier, but his job may be more fun.  I liked him for his brashness and honesty and enjoyed his cultural references to the more seedy late '70's and early '80s, Provincetown and his drug use intertwined with a solid work ethic, once he got himself going in the morning.  I felt like I knew him.<br />He also offers some good insider advice on how restaurants work their specials, what knives to use and my favorite-how to cut garlic, \\"[like the two mafiasos in the movie Goodfellas who use a razor to cut the garlic paper thin].\\"  That's love of food!  To me this feels like a coming-of-age autobiograhy about a guy who struggles to stay afloat in a tenuous business, often flying by the seat of his pants (or his wits) and manages to survive.  I hardly saw it as shockingly revealing about the restaurant business-I've heard much worse stories than days old fish on the Monday special.  For me it was an honest and entertaining view of the world behind that plate of food that arrives on your table.  It made me respect that world a bit more too.

B0000004V2|5.0|This is the one.  This is the music that defined my world in 1989.  This was the sound that made me finally believe in the power of music.  All drama aside.  My dad had his favorite album that he never got sick of playing nor sick of talking about.  I grew up in a house filled with music.  The good kind that radio rarely touches.  I never found that one album that captured all of the things I loved about music.  That is until a day in 1989 when I stumbled upon a sound that turned me on my ear.  It was the simple bassline and chugging beat of \\"She bangs the Drums\\" tinged with john Squire's magic fingering.  I knew immediatley that this was a band that was going to stay with me for a very long time.  To this day I can always put on the \\"Roses\\" and it's like I am forever transported to that day in a little record store in tulsa, Oklahoma.  The album is simply perfect.  Nothing has affected / effected me since...the closest being the Flaming Lips \\"The Soft Bulletin\\".  So, take this as you will, we all have or favorite things in the world.  This happens to be one of mine.
B000002HPT|4.0|Each one of Dream Theater's full length releases has been completely different from the every other one; so you never really know what you're going to get when you pick up a new album.  Falling Into Infinity contains a few traces of the hard-hitting Awake in songs Just Let Me Breathe or Burning My Soul, but also explores an unprecedented softer side in Hollow Years, Take Away My Pain, and Anna Lee, which might be the &quot;sequel&quot; of sorts fo Space-Dye Vest.  Many people regard this as the &quot;worst&quot; Dream Theater album due to its leanings toward mainstream music, notably on such tracks as You Not Me, Burning My Soul, and Hollow Years.  But it is redeemed with dazzling brilliant songs such as New Millennium, Lines in the Sand, and the amazing and emotion Trial of Tears trilogy at the end.  As a whole, this album is great.  While it will never be considered on the same level as Scenes from A Memory or Images and Words, it nevertheless belongs in your collection if you call yourself a Dream Theater fan.
0671042858|4.0|First off, I loved &quot;Tom Gordon&quot; and next to &quot;The Stand&quot;, I believe its King's best book yet.  I've read about 10 Kings in the last year or so. While this book seemed to reflect the same pattern of thinking, suspense, and fear as the others, It had a lot more deep thoughts as well as better and more surprising foreshadowing than, for example, &quot;Hearts In Atlantis&quot; or &quot;Thinner&quot;.  I especially like the fact that it didn't get anywhere near as sick as &quot;Pet Semetary&quot;. I might be a little prejudicesince I a huge Red Sox Fan as a pitcher too. I'm only a freshman in High School, in a Nowhereville in MO, But I've played enought to know the feelings that run through the second half of the book. Anyone who has played ball will get chills with the mental images of &quot;Flash&quot; Gordon standing tall on the mound, motionless, and collected, while the little girl tunes in to the broadcasts on her walkman.  Even if you aren't a rabid baseball fan, you will love the way everything unfolds as the girl just gets deeper in and I couldn't put it down until I finally finished it. That would explain My fourth hour tardy today.
6300215717|4.0|Being very weary one night, I decided to watch a video that had arrived in the mail the day before, which I had ordered as a prudent way to take my mind off recent problems.  This was \\"Roman Holiday\\", with Audrey Hepburn - my favorite, and beloved, actress when I was young - and Gregory Peck.<br />     This is a remarkable film.<br />     For, as it happens, I sat cursing through virtually the whole of it at the insufferably stiff and offensive acting of Peck, disturbed by the brutally exploitative, fraudulent, and insensitive behavior which a script that - on the surface - seems mindlessly lame has given the actor in his role as a journalist.<br />     But then there occurs the astonishing - profoundly dramatic, symbolic, and moving, and socially and psychologically unique - finale, in which, much as a photographic print in its bath reverses absolutely the negative, the entire movie - all that has gone before, all the seeming clumsiness and error - suddenly develops backwards in one's mind, and reveals itself to have been an antithetic, perfect, and consummate work of art.<br />     Rarely have I encountered such an uncanny example of the transformative power of a frame to pluck sublimity out of bathos, and of the indeterminacy or misleading nature of the world but for one thing.
B000000HZT|5.0|Of all of Tony Banks' efforts, this one is my favorite, and the favorite of many &quot;old&quot; Genesis fans, because the way Banks plays keyboards here is pretty much unrestrained (bold lead lines and insane arpeggiating - think &quot;In the Cage&quot; from &quot;Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot;). Banks also pulls off a couple of nice instrumentals, finding a way of coaxing realistic individual instrumental sounds off the keyboards of the day. The album's theme mirrors the story &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot;, about the rise to genius of an everyman, followed by his fall. The songs are crafted in Banks' admirably idiosyncratic way - who else would start off a song as a tender ballad, then suddenly in the middle turn it into a frenzied synthesizer romp (&quot;You&quot;).  Which other lyricist would come up with word images like, &quot;Come with me then, to the Garden of Eden; Put back our bites on the apple of the tree of knowledge, be like the beasts again.&quot;?  <br />Banks plays guitars, too, and recruits Chester Thompson from the Genesis tours to play drums. One criticism some fans make is Banks' choice of one Kim Beacon to do vocals - I guess some folk feel his vocals are a little too strident (like someone being forced to sing from a torture rack). To me, he does not interfere with the music, which is the main thing. The most beautifully haunting album in Banks' canon; it may be the closest individual statement TB would make, as all subsequent albums seem to have an element of having to bow to some force outside himself, be it commerciality or appropriateness of music (i.e., soundtrack albums).  I bought this album when it first came out in 1979, and it only sounds better today.
0441172717|4.0|4???? 4 stars???? How can any self-respecting sci-fi fan dare, heck even dream to give less than a full 6 stars (x10) to one of the pillarstones of sci-fiction. A book so immense in scope and in imagination, in knowledge and in mystery that even the self-appointed guardians of 'true literature' quail at the thought of dismissing it - well my friends, my knife is sharpened and I'm kinda hankering for some holy cow cutting-down to size.<br />Dune is magnificent, it blows your mind with the sheer scope of the imagination, you really can believe 10,000 years from now human society may develop along these lines. Herbert cleverly plays on the idea that often the future is a derivation of the past - thus this feudal society, with Barons &amp; na-Barons, Emperors &amp; peons, where swords are used, atomics are House heirlooms and huge spaceships depend on the psychic power of their Navigators. <br />It's crazy, it's clever, it's captivating - his use of economics and arcology, his prescience regarding terraforming, the shaping effects of ecology and terrain on peoples and cultures, his synthesis &amp; evolutions of religions - all of this is blinding and really, really makes your imagination soar. Compare it to most standard current sci-fi novels and settings they describe (even pre-made ones like the Star Wars series) and it's frankly pitiful, the paucity of imagination with over-elaboration they display. Compare and contrast if you will with the recent prequels to Dune....oh dear.<br />And yet, yet....it's is sometimes overly pompous, sometimes overly obtuse and sometimes in the later novels it frankly seems the Frank-ly decided to stick in a escape hatch from a story-line when it got too bogged down and ran into the mud that was once the sands of Arrakis.
B00005JKED|4.0|This was a flawless performance by Denzel and Ethan.  This was not a shoot em' up type of flick.  It did not have a lot of action but it did have two solid performances by great actors, which made this movie.  Denzel definitely deserved respect for this role and this is a definite buy for a real dvd lover.
B000002L82|4.0|I basically loved two intrumental songs on this CD, Blue Monday and The Beach. They are very similar songs, but great to listen to none the less. The percussion work is just mind blowing.
0380973650|5.0|A fantastic story weaving myth with regular people, the mundane and the spiritual to tell the story of how simple, yet intricately intertwined life is.<br />We often underestimate the power of perception.  Our view things defines the worlds each of us lives in.  Everyone has an idea of what town life is like -- put all these together and you create a personality.  Gaiman creates this Mr. Town, and many others.  Each is personable in their own way.  Even when you don't agree with the vision portrayed, you can't help but relate to the characters and their stories.
B00000J6AG|5.0|It just sounds like Moby. If you don't know what that sounds like, then buy this album. Anybody is bound to find at least a few tracks that they like. I have to admit though, I do not like the first track... It actually annoys me. But, taking that into consideration combined with the fact that I'm still giving it 5 stars, you can safely conclude that it's an album worth adding to your collection.
B00005Y8CF|5.0|This is a good one, although for 38 bucks, I wonder what we'll get! Buy it and let me know. Thanks.
B000060OWV|5.0|Robben's combination of a great guitar tone, and soulfull  songwriting bring his music to life. The fact that he also plays the piano on this album outlines the talent this man has. For me this is his best album to date. Buy it!
B0000027F8|5.0|My ever First Western Music Pop Cassette was a gift to me 'Make it Big' - the Wham by George Michael and Andrew. Since the day I heard the numbers, I became a great fan of George and he's been an Inspirational role model for me. Later I picked up the whole band from pop, rock to reggae n stuff. Listen without Prejudice is one of the Best Picks of George Michael and his voice is so husky and cool that takes to trance. Soul Free number is one inspiration that took me to name 'Free Souls', a supplement page name for my newspaper and 'Kidsfreesouls.com' followed by. Praying for time and If you got something to Save are great numbers and Mother's Pride is my favourite too. They won't let go when I go...is one number which has a bass and rise pitch up voice of George and thats his real singing voice you'll love to hear. A sure Pick and a great collection - Listen without Prejudice!
B00003CXBK|5.0|This has to be one of the best anime films ever made. The subtleties of this film are truely amazing. At first you might find the film a little light especially if your a fan of Ninja Scroll type violence but the action in this movie is far more different then just plain blood and guts, In this film each act of violence has a meaning and effect, like the real world.<BR>This is a mystical story of wonderment and I would recommend it to anyone, not just anime fans.
B000001GQJ|5.0|This CD is simply a wonder. But for me, one of the main wonders on this disc is Argerich's disarmingly romantic and mysterious Brahms Rhapsodies- works which are so often unjustly thought of as student pieces. The G minor in particular is one of the most moving bits of pianism I have ever heard. Argerich is at one with the music... In some works I find her less mature and commanding than in later recordings (her Jeux d'eau is not amongst my favourite recordings of this piece- I much prefer Lortie and Gieseking here) but on the whole this is simply breathtaking pianism... and when you remember that she was only 19 when most of it was recorded, it boggles the mind (I am 19 and there is no way in the world I could ever imagine playing the piano like Argerich does on this disc!). Particularly when you consider that the Prokofiev Toccata is still considered one of the yardsticks by which others are measured. <BR>The Liszt sonata is gripping from beginning to end, and her Chopin quite easily shows why she is considered a master interpreter of his works. <BR>Argerich is a chameleon, a fascinating chameleon who seems to be able to mould herself into music of any period and style and give almost definitive performances of all of it. If only there were more like her!
B00005QZ7U|3.0|I remember quite clearly, about a year ago I told my best friend Rebecca that I was interested in going to see that new movie that was coming out, Moulin Rogue. After having only seen the whirlwind, loud, colorful trailer that only suggested that the film is a musical and it involves a lot of dancing, a lot of red lipstick, Nicole Kidman, Ewan Mcgregor (sigh...), and some French place called the Moulin Rouge, Rebecca responded with a confused, \\"Moulin Rogue? No way, she's a prostitute or something...\\" After getting one of those pains in the back of my head that I always seem to get whenever Rebecca hurls a statement of just this type in my general direction, I proceeded to sift through the debris that this argument had left between me and coherent thought, and I proceeded to explain the actual reasons that I was attracted to the movie. But honestly, how and why would the fact that the leading female character in a film is a \\"prostitute\\" serve as a basis to write the film off entirely? I really have to let that one go, anyway, I listed several reasons: I thought Baz Luhrmann's cinematography in Romeo and Juliet was choice so I was interested in seeing his work here, I thought \\"hmm, musical...sounds refreshing,\\" and mainly I had been in love with Ewan McGregor's Scottish-turned American actor appeal for quite a while.<BR>After seeing the film I had sort of mixed feelings, more leaning toward disappointment in the film than in admiration of it. While McGregor's voice was more than enough to keep me entranced through the entire two hours, I was disappointed both in Satin's (Nicole Kidman) character as well as the shallowness of the storyline. When a movie's theme can be summed up in four words, in this case \\"truth, beauty, freedom, and love,\\" that leave little more to think about than the universal call of the '60's, the impact is less than noteworthy. The plot honestly relys on little else than a dreamer/writer who falls in love with a woman of immense beauty, but theevils of the world will not let them live for all they ave ever asked, once again, truth, beauty, freedom, and love.<BR>I was disappointed in the development of Satin's character, not so much in the way she was played, but in the choices that she makes in the film. If the love between her and the writer really was true enough to act as the binding force of the film, then she would never have chosen the \\"brave\\" step to walk away from him and perform in the play. I didn't feel the alternative, her illness, was enough to tear her away.<BR>Overall, the film was an outburst of style, racing through a story that shouts its meaning in your face, and leaves you with little to think about afterword. Ewan, you're beautiful, but stick to star wars.
078401213X|1.0|When we watch a movie, we kind of expect to see new ideas, brilliant thoughts, and different ways of telling a story. Films like Memento, Run Lola run, Amelie, Being John Malkovich, Groundhog Day, Traffic, A self made hero, Mother Night, Cube...etc, are such movies.<br />After seeing so many positive reviews of the movie ¡§pi¡¨, I bought it, I thought it is just like the ones I mentioned above and was very looking forward to seeing it. But I was very much disappointed after watching it.<br />It is a well-made student film project, and that is it, nothing more. The story is about a guy trying to find a particular list of numbers (216 digits) to &quot;explain&quot; the world. It is like the DNA of ¡§the world¡¨, you can use it to predict the stock market, just like the golden rectangle theory. But I guess the filmmakers aren¡¦t really good at math, it made the character look like someone who isn¡¦t a mathematician but trying to be one, which is dumb in the eyes of people who actually know something about math. It reminds me so much of the movie ¡¨Cube¡¨. ¡§Cube¡¨ uses a lot of basic mathematical theories, too, and the storyline is even simpler than ¡§pi¡¨ (a bunch of people trying to get out of a cube), but it is so well directed that it made the movie look extremely smart and keeps the audience interested at all times. <br />I think this film is absolutely for people that like movies with weird events, events that they don¡¦t understand regardless of its true meaning, or if there really is one. For others who are seeking for a refreshing and meaningful story, you are not going to like this film.
0446677450|5.0|When I asked my mother what she thought about this book, her reply was &quot;I just wish that I have read it 40 years earlier&quot;.  She bought a copy for each of us kids.  My Brother-In-Law read it in two days.  When I asked him what he thought of it, he replied.  &quot;I wish someone gave this to me 25 years ago.&quot;  I read it.  It took me three days.  I immediately bought the tape and I play it non stop.  All I can say is that I just wish that I knew this stuff 25 years ago.  A great and unique book.
B000003CMC|5.0|This album is a classic in every way. Featuring several timeless cuts like \\"Melissa\\", \\"Blue Sky\\", \\"Ain't Wastin' Time No More\\", etc.. Although some may argue it's a bit too long (The whole disc clocks in it at approximately 70 minutes, due mostly to the ridiculously long \\"Mountain Jam\\".) it is probably the best album to get to know their style by.
0446310786|5.0|The only complaint I have is I waited so long to read it. Buy this book now from this web site, buy a used copy at a half price book store, steal it off your Mother's bookshelf. I was, wow, just blown away. I'm having trouble trying to find something else to read now, it will be a hard book to follow.
0446310786|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read.  It is well written, and is never boring.  I saw the movie, just because my parents were watching it, and I loved it.  I went out the next day and bought the book.  Read it, see the movie, and enjoy!!
0553213105|5.0|Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is one of my favorite novels.  I was the first novel of Jane's that I've read and I could not put it down.  The suspence and humor of this book makes it great.... you must read it.
B000001EC1|4.0|Okay, so maybe I wasn't as much of a die hard Bon Jovi fan as some back in the 80's, but I can relive most of their biggest hits on this one CD. In fact, this CD is better than most compilations in that it is rare when you have to skip a track because you don't want to hear one of the songs.<br />Cross Road certainly lives up to the title of \\"classic grooves\\" and delivers some of the band's biggest hits including Bad Medicine, Livin' on a Prayer, and You Give Love a Bad Name. It's packed full of an assortment of hard hitting rock anthems, love ballads, and the signature harmonious sound of Bon Jovi and the passionate and somewhat smokey voice of lead singer Jon Bon Jovi. For only about $11 to $15 (depending of course on where you get it) it isn't a bad deal. And you don't have to be the biggest, most die hard groupie of the band or have owned their previous albums to enjoy these tracks.<br />This CD, however, shares one thing in common with other compilations - there are a few questionable tracks that I would have replaced with better songs. As far as the track list goes, the songs are listed below in order...<br />Livin' on a Prayer<br />Keep The Faith<br />Someday I'll Be Saturday Night<br />Always<br />Wanted Dead or Alive<br />Lay Your Hands on Me<br />You Give Love a Bad Name<br />Bed Of Roses<br />Blaze of Glory<br />Prayer '94<br />Bad Medicine<br />I'll Be There For You<br />In and Out Of Love<br />Runaway<br />(Just a note...Prayer '94 if you aren't familiar with it is an acoustic version of Livin' on a Prayer)<br />Of course Bon Jovi is coming out with new hits all the time and that is the reason they added songs like Always and Keep the Faith in with the older hits. However, where are some of the great songs like Born To Be My Baby? Or Living in Sin? Personally, the last two tracks I rarely listen to and I have had to buy New Jersey separately to get those songs that this is missing. In my opinion, if they come out with another compilation, it needs to include these two songs...and It's My Life.<br />I would also have put more of the older hits at the front and Keep the Faith and Always nearer to the end. These are great hits, but often I find myself wanting to hear Bad Medicine and Livin' on a Prayer and You Give Love a Bad Name more than the others.<br />All my complaints aside, this CD is pretty good in that I can put it on and clean the house, read, drive, or just relax without having to get up to skip tracks. It is a pretty good compilation for those die hard fans (but you will still need to buy some of the other CD's to get other great hits), and a perfect fit for people who like Bon Jovi hits but don't want to go out and buy every one of their CD's.ese two songs...and It's My Life. <br />I would also have put more of the older hits at the front and Keep the Faith and Always nearer to the end.

B000000993|5.0|After Tool have made a scene across the country with their first album Opiate, this LA quartet showed of what they had to say. With Maynard James Keenan leading, the band pursues a new sound giving out power and originality. Opiate seemed short and haphazard to some people, but Undertow become Tool's full length album in 1993. It became more melodic and refined offering than Tool's \\"Opiate\\" but just as emotionaly compelling. Undertow is the album that kicked off Tool's appearance and their success. Adam Jone's guitar riffs and fretwork give out the emotional figure of the human body and Maynard's amazing vocals shiver and quake accordingly. Sit down and be set off to \\"Intolerance\\", \\"Swamp Song\\", and \\"Prison Sex\\". Everyone found the most popular track \\"Sober\\" both rocking, disturbing, and thrilling. The last track in the alubm \\"Disgustipated\\", reaches up to 15:47 and has to be heard and be believed. Undertow gives out the great value of Tool and must be heard by any true fan.
B00005RY7X|5.0|This album can go both ways.  It can be a work of genius, something that mainstream rock is in dire need of.  Or it can be taken as a rip off of metal and just some big smelly guy screaming about partying.  I personally think this is pure genius, this is EXACTLLY what music needs, a huge breath of fresh air.  Sure it may sound simple, and sound like the same thing over and over, but you have to listen to the whole album to get the full experience.  This album is so full of catchy beats, perfectly melded together piano and guitar parts, huge kicking drums, and the great growl/voice of Andrew.  Mainstream rock will be turned upside down once this becomes more well known and played everywhere.  And I think that this being popular is a good thing (This is like the fourth time I've tought anything being popular is good).  Because millions will hear this, and they will hopefully be woken up and realize that the crap they listen to like Limp Bizkit and Drowning Pool and Puddle of Mudd is nothing compared to this and that this is where it's at.  This is original, and genius.  Don't dismiss this gem of an album as butt-rock or a rip off of 80's metal or whatever else you think it could be.  Andrew W.K will forever have my respect for making this album, and he will hopefully be putting out a lot more work for many years.  Let's all pray that bad bands out there don't start mimicking this and trying to make the same thing, cause it could only hurt the great sound this album brings.
B0000029DD|5.0|What can I say.  Jeff Buckleys music has had such a profound affect on me its unreal.  Its almost spiritual (I know thats really weird but its true..)  You MUST have a listed to this album.  Every time I hear it I get something more out of it.
B00005JKGK|5.0|This movie will touch your heart. Wonderful, if sad and tragic, story keeps you engaged at all times. The direction, cinematography and performances are all first rate. Special mention goes to Rachel Portman's haunting score- a beautiful blend of western music and Chinese themes and instruments. Unfortunately no soundtrack appears to be available so this is the only place you will hear it.<BR>Highest recommendation!
B00005V3Z4|4.0|Let me first get this part out of the way.  This movie has moments of absolute cinematic brilliance.  But, I wouldn't leave it at that.  Calling this a great film would lead to a lot of disappointment because it has some serious flaws, not the least of which are plot contrivances that simply don't work.  It is as if the writers wanted to squeeze too many ideas into a single film, and then couldn't intelligently wrap up the many loose ends.  The film's ideas are oftentimes terrific, but they pull the viewer in too many different directions and end with a far more &quot;conventional&quot; and unsatisfying conclusion for all the effective build-up.<br />What I liked most about the film was its ability to depict a nuanced view of psychosis.  It is perhaps the best cinematic portrayal of a schizophrenic mind that I've ever seen, and in some ways reminded me of Polanski's &quot;Repulsion.&quot;  Unfortunately, rather than playing to this strength, the movie then attempts to &quot;explain&quot; the psychotic state through a somewhat silly &quot;Carlos Castaneda&quot; explanation of secret knowledge, emanations from the solar plexus, time travel, and extradimensional physics.  The lovely ambiguities of the first three-quarters of the film melt away into time-looping conventionality, with a lot of inexplicable throwaway issues.  (The burning down of the &quot;positive thinking&quot; guru's house is a good example.  We're never given any clues as to why the future is informing the present about his involvement in a child pornagraphy ring--and directing him to burn the house down.  Kept more ambiguous, the event would have had far greater and more interesting significance.)<br />With the exception of Drew Barrymore, the performances are top knotch.  Barrymore comes across as a not very bright person overacting and just catching a superficial layer of her character--a character that seems to be a bit of a throwaway in any event.  I think Jake Gyllenhaal is someone to watch.<br />Get this DVD, and think of it as a first draft by an extremely talented novelist.  Lots to savor and enjoy, even if it is a bit messy.atch.<br />Get this DVD, and think of it as a first draft by an extremely talented novelist.   Lots to savor and enjoy, even if it is a bit messy.
B00000K19E|5.0|This action maked movie takes a different perspecive on our life. They say we were taken over by machines and now we are plugged in the matrix to keep us happy and to power the machines. Neo was freed from the Matrix and is supposedly &quot;The One&quot;. He is the one who can battle the machines and free the human race. Though the movie ends where you find out that he actually is the one. A great movie that needs a sequal. I highly reccommend this to anybody who doesn't have it yet. If you have a DVD player this is a must have.
0971855110|5.0|I LOVE this book!  Marla shows us how to transform our life... in 15 minute segments, zones, quick routines and more.  I was TOTALLY in CHAOS (what she calls &quot;Can't Have Anyone Over Syndrome&quot;), and am still amazed that I can walk through a completely clean and transformed home at all times.  It takes NO time to clean my home now, all my years of clutter is GONE, and the positive energy is spilling over into other areas of my life, and completely transforming them too!  God Bless you, Flylady, you're helping women find themselves again.  Once we get rid of the clutter that drains us of energy... voila!  The true woman emerges!  Full of energy, love and great ideas!  I truly feel you're helping us MUCH more than keeping our houses clean.  You're giving us a new way to think.  You're so right.. that you can do anything for 15 minutes.  Thanks again, Flylady!
0671024256|5.0|I am not a great fan of Stephen King in general. I'm not very much into his main genre: horror. But I like some of his stories very much and have always considered him a great writer. And as I am a fanatical reader, I always enjoy reading about how the poor writers struggle to keep me supplied with reading material. And Stephen King makes a great story out of it of course. I got the idea he really enjoyed speaking to the reader directly about his  craft. I always like it when people give very specific advice; do's and don'ts and he is generous with these, though not without respect for any writer out there who is trying. I almost got a mind of giving writing a try myself, not because he makes it seem easy, but because he makes it seem fun.
0446608955|5.0|When I read &quot;The Notebook&quot; some five odd years ago, I really didn't care for Spark's brand of writing.  It seemed so cliched and Harlequin romance.  I really thought I'd never like his work.<br />I was given this book by my mother to read, and I loved it!<br />It starts off great.  It is being narrated by the main character, Landon, at ages 57 and 17.  Landon is a very likable character.  I immediately felt drawn to him, and I wanted to learn more about who he was.  Sparks did a great job of allowing us to get to know his characters.  I grew to love both Landon, and Jamie, who is the female character in the story.  They are in high school, and are both going through a lot in their senior year.  They share a lot of good and bad times together, and eventually fall in love.  It's a bittersweet story, and worth reading right to the last page.<br />This is a very quick, easy to read book, but it also tragically sad.  It is a beautiful story, and it was beautifully written by Nicholas Sparks.<br />It is not just a romantic story, but it is a coming of age story as well.  I think it would appeal to a lot of people as just a good story, even if it is very sad.  It is worth the tears.
B00000IMYA|5.0|I was in no hurry to pick up this CD remaster because, first, I already had the original vinyl album in my collection and, second, I've long felt Paul Gonsalves' lengthy excursion on rhythm 'n blues riffs was not only highly overrated but was decidedly unrepresentative of the Ellington whose genius is to jazz what Shakespeare's is to English literature.<br /><br />I was wrong, and am glad to be proven so--both by the recording engineers at Columbia records and by the Maestro himself.<br /><br />This is as beautifully realized an example of the capabilities of digital technology as any I've encountered. Unlike, say, some of the Ken Burns' compilations on which the digital sound is deader, less present, less ambient than that of the original recordings, this digital recording features very \\"live\\" and \\"present\\" sound--most of it in stereo for the first time--that borders on the revelatory. Moreover, the accompanying documention is extraordinary, a 35-page history of the event as well as its preservation, insuring that the listener not only has the best seat in the house but is there for the entire proceedings: what was at stake for Duke before the concert; the welcome return of stray sheep Johnny Hodges; the failure of 4 key members of the band to show up for the opening set; Ellington's return to the stage for that second late but legendary set; the later studio recordings with \\"fake\\" crowd noise that actually comprise most of the music on the original LP. The remastered CD plus booklet plus photos is practically a \\"course\\" not just in 1950's Ellington lore but in the challenges of presenting live music effectively.  And it's a testimony to the mistakes to which musicians, announcers, and record producers are prone as well as to those rare times, like this, when they ultimately get it right. This is without question as good an investment as you're ever likely to make in a CD.<br /><br />As for the \\"Shakespearean\\" Ellington, this comprehensive set tends to put the \\"Diminuendo\\" in perspective, allowing the surrounding pure Ellington genius to sparkle forth. And as for that much hyped moment--more to Paul's than Duke's everlasting glory--it allows us to glimpse the genial, inclusive, communicative spirit of the musical Bard who, like his predecessor, played as much to the masses as his muses.allowing the surrounding pure Ellington genius to sparkle forth.

B000002UY5|5.0|This is the album that started it all... <BR>and let me tell you something, No Rain is overrated for the rest of this cd rocks like you have not heard.<BR>&quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Change&quot; are really deep and the lyrics move me every time i listen to them. The music is awsome too, the bass lines are smooth and filling, lead guitar is heavy but jazzy at the same time with that grunge escence of the time. The arrangements made with mandoling, or an additional guitar are amazing yet simple. Shanon Hoons voice is simply beautiful.
0060934913|5.0|The author gives us, in excruciating detail and high water scatology, the lowdown on the workings of a restaurant kitchen. He has lived through it for the last twenty-odd years and spares us no detail of his apprenticeship. He has high praise for his Ecuadoran and Mexican helpers because they know their business, are always on time, never call in sick, and work like mad men 17 hours a day for at least six days a week. And that at lousy pay. He tells us about a close-knit fraternity that lives outside civilization as we know it. And, of course, he mentions all kinds of food, their ingredients and the purchase thereof, and their preparation. At the end of the book, you feel that a good chef does the humanly impossible - and solely for the love of food.<br />It is a very, very funny (and Xrated) book that gives you a lot of respect for what goes on behind the facade of that nice restaurant and how much work and knowledge is involved to put that plate in front of you.

B00004U8P3|4.0|I can't remember looking forward to a movie more than &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; after having read the book umpteen times.  The movie does some justice to the book, and should have done a lot more.  The acting is adequate; the casting ranges from good to awful (I liked Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm but Sam Neill was not, and is not, Alan Grant, and Laura Dern was terrible as Ellie Sattler), and the plot changes were unneccessary and detract from the story.  There was no need to make Ellie Grant's girlfriend; there's not enough fire between them to generate any interest; and the movie tried to take P.C. too far with the children and transformed the nerdy older boy and the bratty younger girl (she was so obnoxious in the book I wanted to feed her to a raptor) into the computer whiz older sister with a whiny little brother.  If it weren't for the dinosaurs, the movie would be a washout.  But the dinosaurs save the day.  The computer effects are so breathtaking that one wants to drop the popcorn and gasp, good goshamighty, those are REAL DINOSAURS!!  The dinosaurs, in fact, have more personality than the people.  The tyrannosaurus is the tough guy on the block and the raptors are the boyz in the hood, lean mean killing machines.  I would have liked to see some more plant-eaters (a stegosaur or two would have been nice) but what there was, was terrific -- the gallimimus stampede is so real it makes you want to duck down in your seat, and there's a hilarious spot when the girl goes &quot;kitchy-koo&quot; to a brachiosaurus, and the reptile responds by saying &quot;achoo&quot; and spraying a gallon of brachioboogers into her face.  The movie's ending is far more upbeat than the book, anticipating &quot;Jurassic Park 2&quot;, and the dark undertone of the book, that playing God is one of man's worst mistakes, somehow doesn't come across as strongly in the film.  But the dinosaurs are a miracle in themselves, and make the movie the ultimate fun ride it is.
0804102988|5.0|In the world of fascinating books, Sarum should be at the top of the list.  The author holds the reader's attention without respite.  With the history of the formation of the British Isles as the foundation, the families portrayed with such clarity, move easily from generation to generation.  It is one of the rare books which one hates to finish.
B00005YW4H|4.0|For once, all that noise is completely warranted. Norah Jones' major label debut dropped recently (Come Away With Me), and, if you act now, you may just be able to pick it up before it gets pricey! If things tend to sway as hard in her direction as they are currently, she'll be bypassing Diana Krall before very long. The similarities are both there (smoky-sounding singers who know their way around a piano), but Ms. Jones already has the inside track: while Krall is completely happy revisiting old jazz standards and nothing but, Jones mixes it up by writing a few of her own (Reason No. 1).<br />So while she can work wonders with Hank Williams' \\"Cold Cold Heart,\\" she also manages to pen two of her own, including the title track, and co-writing another. It's on these songs especially that we see her as she wants to be represented: a bit more hushed and intimate than the lot. Additionally, Jones has some talented songwriters under her wing in the forms of guitarist Jesse Harris and bassist Lee Alexander. Alexander's \\"Painter Song\\" is as beautiful as that other oft-covered gem \\"If I Could Write a Book.\\" With lines like \\"And I'm dreaming of a place/ Where I could see your face/ And I think my brush would take me there/ But only if I were a painter/ And could paint a memory\\", this is the sort of torch ballad to be replace \\"Book\\" in coming years. And that's Reason No. 2 right there: Diana's entourage changes far too often to allow them to scribble her out any lyrics.<br />Jones rarely raises her voice above the same quiet whispered growl, which makes things continually interesting. Interesting because all it takes are the mere intonations of certain words during a tune to completely change its destination. Accentuated growling, for example, is all it takes to transform the gently rocking \\"Turn Me On\\" into blues. And backing her vocals with more tracks of her own places \\"Lonestar\\" in the country category. As in the good kind. No. 3: Diana, dear friends, is far too tied to her Canadian roots to be considered a LeAnn Rimes country crossover superstar. Jones could most certainly do it with closed eyes. For now, though, hints of her capability are good enough. \\"But, she's a jazz singer, right?\\" Perhaps, though she's not confined to being that and that alone.<br />While the piano playing never really garners any extra attention on this record, it's clearly obvious what does and will continue to: her Voice. Yes, it's entirely deserving of the capital V as she can whisper and draw comparisons to the cracked splendor of Billie or sing the soft notes and come off sounding like the jazz album Alana Davis hasn't got around to yet (really!). But she absolutely shouldn't have committed the sin of doing Hoagy Carmichael's \\"The Nearness of You.\\" The longing, the conviction, the believability? None of that. No singer should have recorded it past Nancy Wilson. Reason No. 4: Perhaps Diana has the upper hand here. She seems to cover the right stuff most of the time. Unless you count \\"Do It Again.\\" To go where Julie London already has is blasphemy.<br />Okay, now cutting to the quick and easy bullet style for the MTV generation, lest your attentions be lost forever.<br />No. 5: With a name like Norah, she's all set to become a Diva. Jones isn't quite so catchy, but that first name will stick. We've an Aretha and an Ella who've made their respective marks. Now it's Norah's turn. That last name is entirely extraneous. Diana who? Ross? Washington? Exactly.<br />No. 6: Norah comes from royalty. Her daddy is Ravi Shankar. Sure, she says she hardly knew him her whole life, that she's just reacquainted herself with the man in the past few years and that her mom had more to do with her musical upbringing, but, c'mon-it's in her genes, man!<br />No. 7: She's a lot prettier. What does this have to do with anything, right? Diana likes to see how many photos of her wind-blown person she can squeeze onto an album-in the liner notes, on the front, on the back, on the spine. Overkill. Three or four of Norah isn't quite enough, but that-combined with the olive skin and dark, mysterious eyes-makes her all the more sexier.<br />Final score? Norah-6, Diana-1.he spine. Overkill. Three or four of Norah isn't quite enough, but that-combined with the olive skin and dark, mysterious eyes-makes her all the more sexier.<br />Final score? Norah-6, Diana-1.
B0000508U6|5.0|I absolutely love this CD for its vocals and haunting music. This is the kind of album that makes me wish, like Paul Thomas Anderson, I was a movie director and screenwriter and could commission my favorite band to write a song for every scene in my new movie!<br />I cannot wait for a new release from these guys.
B000059ZLH|1.0|How can I possibly decribe the attrocity that was committed when Dream Theater decided to write this album and produce this DVD in less than 1000 words.<BR>     Up until now I have been the worlds biggest Dream Theater fan.  I used to love the atmosphere and complexity of the music.  I never condidered Dream Theater to be profound artists, just good musicians.  This album was an attempt to make themselves look artistic and imaginative.<BR>     The album is pretty bad by itself but the DVD is absolute rubbish.  You might as well buy it on video because the quality is terrible and only in stereo.  <BR>     Mike Portney can keep a beat but as a film director he should be shot!  I think he had a hard time telling the difference between a camera and a drumstick.  Not to mention the laughably cheezy acting scenes spliced in with the rest of the concert.<BR>    Do yourself a favour and do not by this DVD. Their last video was good so if you are considering this DVD buy their last one instead. Also do not but the album \\"Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence\\" it's more of the same [stuff]!
B00003CXXO|4.0|I give this movie four stars for the amazingly sustained performance of Haley Joel Osment. He is a child actor who appears in almost every scene of the film and who holds the whole thing together, against the odds. I say against the odds because despite the big budget (or perhaps because of it) A.I. is seriously uneven. To start we are in a world of quiet, eerie designer-future cool. David, the artificial boy is delivered to his family and an air of understated menace prevails. We know its all going to go horribly wrong, but when and how? Just when we think we know what sort of movie this is it jumps to a kind of violent technopunk scene, completely out of kilter with what has gone before. Next we are introduced to Gigolo Joe in a scene so jarring I thought I was suddenly watching a different movie entirely. By now I was getting used to all this jumping about, so the ending (2000 years in the future!) is almost no surprise.<BR>Each scene on its own is great, each actor does a great job, but overall, AI is a hotchpotch that barely hangs together. Shame really. Having said all that, do take the time to see this movie. It's the kind of grand project that the dvd extras can really do justice to. I liked the parallels woth Pinnochio, and the central question - could humans ever really love a robot?
B000056V73|5.0|On an assignment for Rolling Stone magazine, painfully uncool adolescent William Miller meets deeply cool rock groupie Penny Lane, falls in love and ends up saving her life.<br />First off, this is a great movie for fans of rock movies. At times it shows some of the comic genius of Spinal Tap (especially the scene in the aeroplane). The fictional band Stillwater have some great early 70s tunes that really take you back (or take you there, depending on how old you are...).<br />But it's also worth watching even if you hate all that kind of thing. Almost famous is really an exploration of the meaning of friendship. In a rock-tour world where every relationship is as shallow as a one night stand, William unwittingly shows what real friendship can be, and calls those around him to live up to the best in themselves. I expected this movie to be merely Ok. It far surpassed my expectations. Every performance is superb.
B00005JKL8|5.0|...This moive is more like a action moive then a war movie. And one more thing the movie is NOT \\"pretty easy to predict what is going to happen\\" oh and real cool music to, wish there was a soundtrack, if you know where to get one put it in a review.
B000003TBP|2.0|As Beck Hansen became more of a mainstream artist with the release of this particular album, we see here, a clear turning point.  Beck decided to take the commercial aspects of his music all the way with the release of \\"Odelay,\\" and the two studio albums that followed were even worse, one being a bland stab at straight foward Folk Rock, and other was an experiment in R & B and Funk gone horribly wrong.<br />As for the music on \\"Odelay?\\"  We do discover a few diamonds in the rough.  \\"HotWaxxx\\" could have easily been a sequel to Beck's epic \\"Loser,\\" and \\"Minus\\" is a genuinely interesting Punk Rock song.  But more times than not we are left with the meaninglessness that is \\"High 5,\\" \\"Readymade,\\" \\"Sissyneck,\\" \\"Jack-ass,\\" and the list of bland and over-produced songs just continues...<br />The worst thing about \\"Odelay\\" is that for the most part, we only get to see one extremely polished side of what Beck is capable of in the studio, and for this, we have the Dust Brothers to blame.  Beck lyrics also suffer, do to the mock-party atmosphere that he desperately wanted to create for the album.  The only other good thing I can say about \\"Odelay\\" is that \\"Ramshackle\\" is a fairly decent closing number.  <br />Again, this is certainly not Beck's worst album, but it would be in your best interest to start elsewhere.  Try your luck with \\"Mellow Gold\\" or \\"One Foot In The Grave\\" before you go about purchasing \\"Odelay.\\"
B00005OM4N|5.0|Gosh, those other reviews were harsh...I thought this cd was awesome! Personally, I dont like Britney Spears, but I like her cd. All of the songs are good, my faves being Slave, Boys, I love Rock n Roll, and the last one where she collaberates with Justin. The lyrics may not have much depth, but the beats are strong and make you want to get up and dance. Buy this cd, you wont be disappointed.
0385503954|4.0|Ian McEwan's tale of a woman trying to atone for a horrible act she committed as a young girl is spellbinding. His language is poetic and sticks in your mind after you put the book down. Intricately plotted but not overdone 'Atonement' is remarkably human. The characters are all well drawn and possess real emotions. That is a good thing not just for McEwan's accomplishment as a writer but because it is their emotions that drive the story and make it so compelling. Had they been even slightly off the whole story would have seemed false and lacking in heart. This is a great book, and most certainly worth reading for anyone who loves quality literature.
B00004Z459|5.0|I was so surprised what a good cd this was! I dont know anyone who doesnt own this cd or doesnt like it. All of the songs are great. Some of the songs are heavy, head banging. Others are more mellow. Linkin Park in some songs sound like Savage Garden, or Limp Biskit. My favorites are PaperCut, One Step Closer (where the lead singer continually shouts &quot;Shut Up!&quot; Also, Crawling (my absolute favorite) and In The End. No one should be disappointed if they buy this cd...buy it today!
078322804X|5.0|This was one of the first DVDs I got, for a reason. I love this movie -- it has energy and panache, not to mention some absolutely fabulous music. As I'm sure some blurb somewhere on this Amazon page mentions, the story concerns two blues-singing brothers who are trying to raise money for a good cause. Along the way, they interact with a ton of interesting people (including Carrie Fisher, Frank Oz, Aretha Franklin, and others), perform a lot of great blues, and destroy a lot of property. Mayhem and hilarity seem to thicken around the two leads, whose chemistry is undeniable. The movie feels nothing like some SNL folks' movies can feel -- it's a movie, with depth. I had no idea the Blues Brothers were a sketch originally!<br />Since I probably just told you a bunch of stuff you already knew, I'll step along to the DVD itself. Those who already own the movie on VHS might want to consider this addition to their DVD library -- the goodies are lots of fun, including an extensive \\"making of\\" feature.
B00005V9QJ|5.0|Indeed, the band's triumphant return graces us with their presence and thanks us for &quot;keeping their flame burning&quot; while also reminding us why Sade, the vocalist, and her band, are masters at projecting socially conscious, beautiful lyrics, and expert instrumentation with majesty and purpose, case in point: &quot;Is it a Crime&quot; and &quot;Jezebel.&quot;  Sade's voice is urgent, yet, also pure and sultry, totally dynamic; to borrow a phrase from Sade herself,&quot;It dives and it jumps and it ripples like the deepest ocean.&quot;  It's so refreshing to hear them live here, listening to the wise improvisations on each track, particularly &quot;Cherry Pie&quot; as we surrender our love to this elegant woman and band. The only exception to the Live compilation and perhaps the Lover's Rock tour, are that tracks such as &quot;Tattoo&quot; or &quot;Love is Stronger than Pride&quot; were excluded in favor of other material. &quot;Tattoo&quot; is simply a masterpiece and arguably Sade's most introspective and timeless track -- too bad it was not performed. Also, the segue from Smooth Operator to Red Eye should have been included, if only to showcase the excellent instrumentation of Stuart Matthewman, and others.  Otherwise, this CD should be an integral part of your collection, and played whenever you want to hear the quintessential Diva and her band at one of their most powerful and memorable moments.
B00005JKYS|4.0|We were soldiers paints the vietnam conflict quite well. Showing the inability of those in charge of the war to know very much at all in the form of intelligence of the enemy, or the half assed attempt that was made from the first battle, up to the last, to do anything but strengthen our economy off the lives of our citizens. It also shows the men dying for what they believed at the time to be a righteous cause (remember the battle is early in the conflict) and the way a leader is supposed to act to get the most of his men under any circumstance at any time. Does the movie paint this war is good or this war is bad picture? Not really, you will still have your bias' going in, and coming out, of the movie you have always had about this particular war. This picture shows that people do die, nothing can prevent that, but people also survive, the last thing youd expect in some instances, in battles. If only the movie ended with a nice tagline under the names of the deceased, something like \\"Fought and died so you could have the right to spit on your fellow americans who did survive this war\\", would this movie have had a 5 star rating from me. True americans will fight, and even die for their country, this movie shows what a real belief in your country is, and the sacrifices people make to allow others to enjoy their luxuries.
B00005QK3W|5.0|This is a brilliant album by Macca!!!! <br />I must admit when I first listened to it, I was a little bit disappointed, but I fell into the trap that so many do, expecting EVERY song to be a 'Yesterday'!!<br />However when I played it 2 or 3 times more, I started to realise why he's the still the No.1 Pop Writer.<br />The sheer variety is a delight to behold, from the ballads like 'From A Lover To A Friend' and 'Your Loving Flame', to the Instrumental 'Heather', to the rocker 'Rinse the Raindrops' and closing the album with the anthem 'Freedom'. And all in ONE album!!!<br />My personal favourites are 'From A Lover To A Friend', 'Heather' and 'Freedom'. Each of these brings out a different emotion and you don't have to be driving in rain for it to grab your attention.<br />Paul has obviously put his heart and soul into producing 'Driving Rain', and the lyric exposes a lot of what he has going on in his life both in the recent past and now.<br />Some of his best ever work has come about through events in his personal life, you need only look at 'Yesterday' and 'Let It Be' to name but two.<br />The other songs on this album all have a part to play, like the funky-sounding 'Tiny Bubble' and the dark 'Don't Say A Word'.<br />All which combines to produce an album that will appeal a wide range of musical tastes.<br />Congrats Paul on a marvellous album - arise, and here's to the next 40 years of pop masterpieces!!!

B000003JDO|2.0|The album was remastered from a copy of the British stereo master tape and is the worst example of NoNoise abuse I have ever heard. Try the Gold CD version on DCC to hear what the album really sounded like when it was first released on Island/Chrysalis in the early 70s (that was remastered without NoNoise and from the original master) The bonus tracks sounded better on the 20th anniversary box set.
0425107469|5.0|Of all Koontz's novels, this one started a string of senarios that showed up in later stories.  The dog, as intelligent (or more so) than humans with a sweet, lovely disposition juxtaposed against the Other, so evil and alien in nature, but with a sad, childlike quality (because it is aware of its differences, its ugliness in form and character to any other creature on Earth).<br />This novel is a 1st recommendation to those unfamiliar with Koontz's stories.  One that will leave the reader flipping page after page, making dinner late, the clothes unwashed, bedtime waiting till morning - a great read!
B00005QIPH|5.0|\\"Is This It\\" contains bursting elements of pop, punk, rock and a little dance -- sometimes all in one song. Truthfully, how often is a rock record something you can dance to? Starting with the red-hot drive of \\"The Modern Age,\\" the album's second song, \\"Is This It\\" is practically a license to get crazy on the dance floor.<br /><br />It opens with the deceptively lulling title track, but the pace steadily increases and stays upbeat the rest of the way. In fact, \\"Is This It\\" is one of those rare albums that has the power to put you in a good mood, no matter what state of mind you're in. The Strokes have a highly tuneful, tight sound, with a muffled singer who writes lyrics that are at once mundane and exciting, probably because his real life stories are all events people can relate to.<br /><br />\\"Is This It\\" never gets old; the songs blend from one to the next like clockwork, but each has its own distinct personality. Amid the precision, laserlike drumming and propelling guitars, J. Casablanca recites classic one liners for entertainment value: \\"I'm workin' so I won't have to try so hard;\\" \\"I don't care cuz it's free;\\" \\"you drink too much, makes me drink just the same;\\" \\"boys act too much, girls act too tough, enough is enough!\\" \\"loves his job, takes it home.\\"<br /><br />The 35 minutes of this album fly by way too fast, leaving listeners to salivate for more Strokes material. \\"Last Nite,\\" a great single, is only the start; the rest of the record is every bit as good. The last track, \\"Take it or Leave it,\\" was probably the best tune in The Strokes young, budding career. It's got Nirvana-like elements to it, especially the chorus, which contains provoking lyrics. The best thing about The Strokes is that they're just getting started. However, even if they never make another record, this one, their first, is a definite classic.

I really do enjoy that type of background music.<br />This one is NOT full of strings and Montovani pieces, but it is so relaxing.  The compositions are a combined effort between Metheny and Haden, truly a wonderful pairing.  Hats off, thumbs up, whatever.  Melody spoken here!
0312119038|2.0|I enjoyed this book for it's view into the cloistered life of a nun- pre-Vatican II era, but the problems I perceived from the author's vocation seems to have resulted more from personality conflicts and clashes than anything. I couldn't relate effectively to her plight and wondered why she stayed as long as she did. I was also bewildered by her declaration that she didn't believe in the resurrection of Christ. I'm still scratching my head over that one since she obviously believed in the virgin birth (which requires alot of faith as well) and the divinity of Christ or else why the heck was she there in the first place??? I think there was more going on in her head when she decided to leave  the convent than she leads us to believe, especially considering her more recent books like The History of God. I think maybe one of the mother superiors in her book had it nailed when she said that karen had a problem with intellectual pride.
B000003CUJ|1.0|If you're considering buying this CD, chances are you're not yet a serious Wagnerite.  If you're going to listen to Wagner, do it like you mean it, or not at all.  Unlike other reviewers, I think the idea of a \\"Ring synthesis\\" is silly.  I suspect that Maazel did this project because his is the only ego bigger than Wagner's.  If you're serious about appreciating the vast beauty of the Ring, I suggest that you start with the Ring Disc ... .  It contains the complete Solti recording, vocal score, libretto, and all the information you could want about leitmotifs.  (No, I was not involved with its creation, and I'm not getting paid to promote it.  I just got it and know how cool it is.)
B00005214X|5.0|At first, it seems peculiar that the Beatle who only contributed one or two songs per LP should start his post-fab four career with a colossal triple-album. Even more remarkable is that he managed to pull off all six sides with barely a dent in creativity, insightfulness and skillfulness. A closer examination, however, explains why The Beatles' lead guitarist, George Harrison, should have a wealth of excellent material for his first solo work. When The Beatles' finale, Abbey Road, was recorded in 1969, Mr. Harrison was still only being allotted a very small amount of space for his compositions, despite the fact that he had been writing avidly and maturing quickly for more than six years. The Beatles still thought it best that mainly Paul McCartney's and John Lennon's more proven songwriting abilities fill their records. So while, Mr. Lennon and Mr. McCartney gorged each album with their material, Mr. Harrison, clearly a gifted songwriter as his Beatles songs, few as they were, demonstrated, was quietly composing a reservoir of material, choosing only a one or two for the group's LPs and shelving away other masterpieces for a later day.<br />So what was Mr. Harrison hoarding? Obviously, further astute spiritual introspection than \\"Within You Without You\\" even hinted at. Indeed, the main subject matter on All Things Must Pass is Mr. Harrison's explorations of the metaphysical world. \\"Hear Me Lord\\" and \\"The Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp (Let It Roll)\\" are passionate cries for divine understanding. \\"Art of Dying\\" speaks of an ambiguous cycle of life and death. \\"Awaiting On You All\\" is one of the most scathing affronts to trademarked spirituality ever put into verse (\\"And while the Pope owns 51% of General Motors/And the stock exchange is the only thing he's qualified to quote us/The Lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see/By chanting the names of the Lord and you'll be free\\"). The hit single, \\"My Sweet Lord,\\" however is the album's definitive anthem, a charmingly simplistic, yet wholly moving, ode to the Above. Obviously Mr. Harrison had been very much transformed by his mystical quests. Even the songs centered around the more usual popsong themes of love and friendship, such as \\"Isn't It A Pity,\\" \\"Run of the Mill\\" and the title track have definitively mystical and philosophical qualities to them. Mr. Harrison never comes across as preachy or contrived; he just sounds like a songwriter very inspired and passionate about his subject matter.<br />Aside from his lyrical talents, All Things Must Pass, also displays that Mr. Harrison was an instrumentalist far more dynamic and adventurous than The Beatles and their strict perfectionism ever allowed him to demonstrate. Granted, Beatle material such as \\"Think For Yourself\\" and \\"Savory Truffle\\" displayed Mr. Harrison's ability to construct original, somewhat asymmetrical song structures that always somehow worked to the track's advantage in the end. With the wavering atmospheres and intricate melodies of songs like \\"The Art of Dying,\\" \\"Run of the Mill,\\" \\"What Is Life\\" and \\"I'd Have You Anytime,\\" his delightful practice of side-winding musical schemas continues on All Things Must Pass, but the collection includes an even greater display of Mr. Harrison's talents as an instrumentalist, namely the third, \\"bonus\\" disc (Tracks five through nine of the second disc on the CD version), entitled \\"Apple Jam,\\" that features Mr. Harrison leading a phenomenal ensemble, including his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Billy Preston and close friend, Eric Clapton, through a series of striking improvisational sessions. These smoldering blues-jams, with their ray-gun sound effects and psychedelic wah-wah, sound like what might be playing in the extraterrestrial bar in Return of the Jedi, if George Lucas had decided it would be a juke joint. Apple Jam features some of the most fluid, brawny and fantastic pieces of instrumental rock ever recorded.<br />All Things Must Pass is the sound of George Harrison's immensetalent breaking out. Although few would deny The Beatles their greatness, there are certain ways in which their constant precision and bias towards Lennon and McCartney material hindered this exceptional musician. Mr. Harrison's inspiring spiritual musings, distinctive songwriting skills and vibrant guitar-playing are all bloom to their full glory in All Things Must Pass. The results are spectacular.

B000002UB3|5.0|While Sgt. Peppers is my pick for the best rock album of all time because of how drastically it changed the face of popular music, in my opinion, Abbey Road is the best Beatles Album.  Los Angeles Rock Radio Icon Jim Ladd said that every time the Beatles came out with a new album, they changed the way we looked at rock music and ourselves.  With each album, the Beatles grew better, and we grew with them.  And with this, the final Beatles album, they went back to their roots and played the best rock of their amazing career.    I have approximately 25 Beatles CDs and vinyl albums ranging in time from the BBC sessions to \\"1\\" and including oddities such as both versions of Yellow Sub, three copies of the White Album (incuding one on White vinyl) and some bootlegs.  This is the one which gets played -- a lot.  If I could keep only one Beatles LP, this would be it.    If you have a good stereo with a turntable, I highly recommend finding a copy of the half speed master on the Mobile High Fidelity label because it is so clean and revealing.  I just hope they put it out on DVD-Audio soon!

0375751513|5.0|\\"It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors\\" - Oscar Wilde<br />\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is an excellent novel about the degradation of the human soul. The novel focuses around the handsome Dorian Gray and his interactions with the artist Basil Hallward, who paints his portrait and Lord Henry, who becomes the corrupting influence on Dorian's soul and Dorian's iinteractions with the British aristocracy. Dorian is compared to Narcissus, who was so obsessed with his own beauty, that it swallowed him whole. Dorian seals his fate with one wish; upon viewing his portrait, he wonders if it would be possible for his portrait to show the signs of aging, in exchange for his mortal beauty. Throughout the novel, we see Dorian's decent into total self - absorbtion and evil all of which culminates in an ending that is predictable but still entertaining none the less.<br />Just a quick side note, there is some great social commentary running throughout \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" specifically Wilde's commentary on the stiff, British aristocracy of the late 19th century, absurd views regarding women, who are painted by Gray as blubbering idiots (a sign of the times) and last but not least, the underlying homosexual undertones present between Dorian, Basil and Lord Henry are fascinating to deconstruct.<br />\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was my first introduction to Oscar Wilde and after reading the novel, I was hooked. I would like to return to the quote above, about art mirroring the soul of the spectator, after reading this novel, you will have a sense of how trully frightening that notion is.

Hah.  Ever since I found out the truth about the existence of intelligent life in the universe I have been alone in my struggle, but now the brilliant John Gray has joined the forces of the righteous.  The price is steep, John.  They will tap your phone- they will leave evidence to suggest to your girlfriend that you slept with her sister, and even brainwash that sister into going along with the story, when in fact you never never slept with Cindy!  ...They will hire actors who resemble you to be recorded on department store security cameras exposing yourself to patrons and shoplifting Ho-ho's.  Be strong, righteous John, for only true moral fortitude can help us throw off the yoke of our evil space overlords.  ...
0375751513|5.0|\\"It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors\\" - Oscar Wilde<br />\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is an excellent novel about the degradation of the human soul. The novel focuses around the handsome Dorian Gray and his interactions with the artist Basil Hallward, who paints his portrait and Lord Henry, who becomes the corrupting influence on Dorian's soul and Dorian's iinteractions with the British aristocracy. Dorian is compared to Narcissus, who was so obsessed with his own beauty, that it swallowed him whole. Dorian seals his fate with one wish; upon viewing his portrait, he wonders if it would be possible for his portrait to show the signs of aging, in exchange for his mortal beauty. Throughout the novel, we see Dorian's decent into total self - absorbtion and evil all of which culminates in an ending that is predictable but still entertaining none the less. <br />Just a quick side note, there is some great social commentary running throughout \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" specifically Wilde's commentary on the stiff, British aristocracy of the late 19th century, absurd views regarding women, who are painted by Gray as blubbering idiots (a sign of the times) and last but not least, the underlying homosexual undertones present between Dorian, Basil and Lord Henry are fascinating to deconstruct.<br />\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was my first introduction to Oscar Wilde and after reading the novel, I was hooked. I would like to return to the quote above, about art mirroring the soul of the spectator, after reading this novel, you will have a sense of how trully frightening that notion is.

068484267X|5.0|In \\"Angela's Ashes,\\" Franck McCourt recounts his turbulent childhood in Ireland, ranging from the extreme poverty of the McCourt family, his father's alcoholism and the death of three of his siblings in a memoir that is both witty and full of sorrow. McCourt was able to grab my attention from the first page; unlike other books that tend to drag along at points, I found \\"Angela's Ashes\\" gripping and impossible to put down.<br />Born in Brooklyn in the 1930s, Frank McCourt takes the reader through his early years in New York, the McCourt family's return to Ireland and the daily struggles of his life (including some humorous scenes with his headmasters in school). \\"Angela's Ashes\\" is one of the few books that I have read in the past year that keep my interest, caused me to laugh out loud and feel extreme sorrow, anger (at Malachy, the father) and pity for the McCourt family.<br />The movie version was excellent, but I recommend reading the book before viewing the movie because it is the only way to fully appreicate McCourt's prose, humor and optimism. I'm looking forward to reading \\"Tis,\\" the sequel to \\"Angela's Ashes.\\"
B00003CXAA|5.0|THE GODFATHER is the most powerful film in existence!  After viewing this dramatic film it makes you wonder if there ever will be another that can match its performance.  The all-star cast is just one characteristic that makes this film a classic.  Unlike other movies, the brilliance behind this trilogy is that every time it has been viewed there always will be a new discovery.
B000002MJC|5.0|SOFAD along with Violator represent the peak of Depeche Modes creative output before the band nearly self destructed. While this CD may not have had the sheer number of singles as Violator, do yourself a favor and buy it! Walking in My Shoes and In Your Room are the two greatest songs in their catalog. This album was sadly the last with Alan Wilder as a member and the following CD's suffer for his loss. But while non DM fans might consider this one of the weaker efforts, just ask any true fan and they will assure you that this CD belongs at or near the top of the list.
B000000WCA|5.0|It's not hard to see why the Spice Girls were so successful with their debut SPICE. Still to this day I think it remains a classic in the realm of pop. The mega-hit \\"wannabe\\" was instantly catchy. I still find myself humming along to it sometimes. SPICE is still one of my favorite CDs ever. The Spice Girls were at the top of their game with this one. Mel B and Geri's sultry vocals, Emma's sweet-chirpy voice, Mel C's big-gritty squeals and Victoria's posh attitude were perfectly matched. <br />There's no buts about it that this CD was aimed at pre-teen girls that wanted a sassy role model to look up to. But, it's accsesable to everyone. I didn't really fit into that category but I really enjoyed SPICE. Besides the mega hit \\"wannabe\\" other tracks that stand out are \\"say you'll be there\\", \\"2 become 1\\", \\"love thing\\", and others. Geri even did a little Spanish rap on \\"if you can't dance.\\" <br />That's another thing - the Spice Girls had personality. Each one unique and they blended well together. I think SPICE was a perfect blend of pop and R&B. It was sweet but not too sweet. Just the right `spice' with a little attitude. I became a fan with this CD and it's still one of those albums that you can still play again years later. How rare is that for a pop CD?<br />If you had your inhibitions about this, drop it and pick SPICE up. It's one of those awesome pop CDs that you will want to play time and time again. I still whip it out occasionally and it doesn't sound dated. It's also a great reminder of great pop music. Sassy, up-beat, bubbly fun. SPICE has got it all.

630280082X|5.0|A special treat for guitarists or wanna be (air) guitarists.  I hope it will be released in DVD soon.  This one goes in the collection right next to Blues Brothers 2000.  If you love/hate one.... same with the other. Don't take this if you are a &quot;easy listening&quot; fan, or unless you have fuzz tone, wah wah, chorus, Bach rock, or heavy metal.  This is for the rock and roller, blues brother within. May have side effects.
0780624890|3.0|I am a huge fan of the traditional Dhampir. My mother is Swiss, and so I have access to a lot of the lesser known european stories. One such story is the tale of the Tragic Prince, Alucard (Adrian Farenheights) the illigitimate half human son of Dracula. I know the tale by heart, and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night follows it a bit, but still interpets the story its own way.<br /> Dhampirs are created when a human mates with a vampire, and most vampires cannot mate. It is a powerful magic that allows them to reporduce. In Blades case if his mother was bitten nothing would have happened. Traditional views on vampireism is that it is a curse, not a virus. Had his mother been \\"embraced\\" while she was pregnate Blade would have either died, or become a fetal vampire himself ( a disturbing thought, but there are such stories).<br /> Aside from the inacurate portrayal of Dhampirs Blade also tampers with traditional Vampires. Vampires are not affected by silver, hollywood needs to accept that this is the weapon to use against werewolves. Crosses do work, if there is faith enough to back it up, and the extreamly faithful will ward off a vampire by thier presence alone. Garlic works traditionally, but its a mystical ward, not an allergy, and not every vampire would be warded by it. In short, this movie uses vampires as wall paper for what is not a vampire flick, or a Dhampir (daywalker) in this flick, but a bloody hack fest, and thats what this movie does absolutely brilliantly.<br /> I loved the fighting, the action in this movie was quickly paced, gory and made this movie good. If this movie wanted to be considered great by this long time vampire fan then they should have read \\"Vampire: The Masquerade\\", played Legacy of Kain, or read any of the Ann Rice books prior to making this movie. Character depth would have been great, and it couldn't hurt for them to use Vampire Hunter D as a reference either. All in all Blade is a great action movie, but as a vampire movie it sucks (pun intended.)(pun intended.)

0385335482|3.0|Confessions of a Shopaholic is a book I can heartily recommend if you're looking for a light read. It screams \\"beach read.\\" I read it in a few hours. I did like the main character of Becky. I thought she was funny and she had a certain charm to her. I could relate to her obsession with shopping, although I'm glad mine doesn't go quite as far! The book is fast paced, and it genuinely did make me laugh out loud on quite a few occasions. Kinsella is quite a clever, articulate writer; I literally cringed for Becky at times. The author really got me caught up in the action; I felt as though I was there, spying on someone. Given how talented she is, I would like to Kinsella her try some serious fiction in the future. <br />The downside to this book is that it is very fluffy - more so than it needed to be. I understand that Kinsella was going for a comic novel, and I still believe she could've explored the issue of Becky's compulsive spending in a bit more depth. Even Bridget Jones was introspective at times. Kinsella didn't do that with Becky enough, and when she did it didn't ring true - it seemed tacked on. I found that the novel was predictable at times, although this didn't bother me as much as it has with other books. <br />In general, I think that this is a book that most single women in their 20s and early 30s will enjoy. It is fun, quick, and lighthearted. I would recommend buying the book used if you can, because it isn't the kind of book that I could imagine rereading. It's as light as air, or cotton candy, and once it's finished, it is easily forgotten.
0812550706|5.0|Orson Scott Card wrote a masterpiece with this novel.  Thought-provoking, emotional, creative...an all-around brilliant book.  Imagine being an eight year old boy chosen to save the human race.  This book is as good as most things Robert A. Heinlein wrote, and that's saying a lot.
B00005UW7V|5.0|While watching I was so excited and after movie too. Amazing, wonderful story. It's not just an empty foolish action only story. I see in this the big message to all of us.

B00005QIPH|4.0|First, I am a very generous reviewer. Even if a CD isn't my favorite, I'm still likely to give it 4 or 5 stars. This one's being a little generous... The Strokes are most definitely a good band. I can listen to them without skipping tracks or .... But I think they sound a little... how shall I say this... normal. It doesn't exactly take creativity or talent to sound or play like them. But, considering that almost every band nowadays has that slightly sad \\"normal\\" sound, they're decent. The thing that most detracted from my enjoyment of this CD is that, on most of the songs, the lead singer dude sounds as though he's singing through some kind of metal tube, or just a really bad microphone. Every high note has a weird, metallic, vibrating sound. Maybe this is supposed to enhance the songs somehow, but, quite frankly, it irritates me greatly and gives me a headache. Still, it's not bad. Buy it if you feel like it. But there are much better bands out there.
B00005Y1TL|5.0|Richard D James began making music from an early age. At age 8 he took apart and reassembled a piano, and was forming electronic music from age 14. As his first LP, SAW brings together these melodic electronic experiments in one neat package essential to those curious about this genius.<BR>        ' Xtal' launches the oddessy , with a hushed percussion floating over a muted snare-riff to a blunted bass, in a hypnotically soothing loop. A dreamy vocal sample ghosts in and out in lullaby , apparently taken from a Cocteau Twins recording sampled in a garage. Simply, the feel is lush. <BR>         'Tha' cuts in with a submerged synth hook-loop and remains subliminally minimal through its 9 minute course; A round-robin dreamstate with muffled conversation fading in &amp; out of a seamless ambient soundscape.<BR>         'Heliosphan' is an endlessly uplifting classic, making the mind dance to its gently hypnotic melody and percussion loops...... the track is as fresh now as ten years ago.<BR>         At times James goes into acid overdrive; 'Green Calx' leaves the ambient arena and becomes what it always was, <BR> early 90's floor filling  techno, perhaps as such the least well-aged track here ; But he always returns with beautifully weaved, almost haunting slowburn melodies, 'Ageisolis' a fine example. <BR>         The title says it all. Its a selection of works, and if it doesn't hang together as a classic LP ought, thats in its nature. But the quality of the gems on offer in this mixed bag make that a petty irrelevance. If you have any other Aphex Twin albums, this is where it all started. I have to say, two or three tracks here would definitely make my personal Aphex top ten. Along with 'I care because you do' and 'The RDJ album', this is Aphex at his sublime best .

B00005OOQ5|3.0|This DVD was good, but compared to other Cirque shows like Quidam and Dralion it seems a bit rough.  The DVD was very dark at times making the artists hard to see and the single spotlight in the back was distracting.  If you are a Cirque collecter than this is for you, if you are a novice Cirque fan I recommend one of their later shows like Quidam or Dralion.

B00005IC2H|5.0|This is absolutely one of the most beautiful albums I have ever heard.  I've listened to it probably two dozen times and I still hear things in it I've never heard before.  Though none of it is in English, and much of it is in a language that doesn't exist on Earth, I still find myself singing along.<br />Other people that I've recommended this too are a little freaked out at first, particularly by the ambiguous lead singer's siren-like voice.  It's a lot like jumping into cold water, but after a while you adjust to the temperature and the feel of the fluid all around you, and it just feels great.  That's about the only way I can describe the feeling this album gives.<br />Definitely not to be listened to while driving, or while operating heavy machinery.

B00005NW02|5.0|During the Summer of 2001, I went, as I always do, to the all day music festival, \\"WBCN River Rave\\". I was late because of traffic, but arrived just in time for pretty much the only band that I wanted to see. The stage rotated (to allow the promoters to squeeze more acts in with fewer sound checks etc) and there was Serj. Clad in an orange shirt and considerably less facial hair then he had the last time I saw him (in the \\"Sugar\\" video). I was a little disappointed, they didn't dress up, and he didn't paint his face. But they proceeded to bring down the house for something like 30 minutes with most of the first album. Then he came to the front and said \\"...this is our new one we just wrote, hope you like it!\\" And like a freight train, \\"Choy Suey!\\" drove through my head for the first time. I had to get this album. Months later I finally got it at Newbury Comics, and my friend Scott, who used to hate anything metal that wasn't Godsmack let me play the whole thing in his car. <br />\\"Toxicity\\" kicks off with \\"Prison Song\\" (which incorporates actual research into its lyrics) and doesn't let up for a while. By track #3 I had the urge to start the CD over because I hadn't caught everything yet. (Little did I know, I would still hear something new months after the fact). But I pressed on, and when \\"Chop Suey!\\" started up, I told Scott, \\"This is the single...\\" and suddenly he knew which band it was. \\"Acoustic Guitars?\\" he asked. It's a shame, I had to remind him we weren't in Godsmackland anymore. The lyricism was ambitious, and the politics almost radical in their liberalism. I loved it. The bonus CD had plenty of extras, and was more than worth the extra dollar they ask. <br />Now, the more I listen to this CD, the more I get out of it. They've been filling in perfectly where \\"Rage Against the Machine\\" left off. These are songs that are actually about something. Whether it be about American Politics or worldwide issues, System of a Down handles them and makes it rock. Serjis the metal fans Bono, and it shows. He preaches during his shows like Dolores O'Riordan, but he doesn't beat you over the head with the point. Usually he's singing so fast, and the music is so loud, that with only one listen you'll miss what's he's saying. They are technically superior to most other bands, using time changes, half beats, strange tunings, and studio wizardry to create a sound that is their own. Also, their sound changes from Thrash, to Hardcore, to straight Rock, to Heavy Metal in a matter of minutes. They also pay homage to their roots using polkas, and various middle eastern influences on a few tracks. This is not \\"nu metal\\" as many would have you believe.  This rocks.  But it does so of it's own accord, not because the local DJ wants you to think it does. System of a Down is the new face of Rock, and this CD doesn't let that reputation down.

0553108034|5.0|G.R.Martin does it again and takes us on another trip into his game of kings and savages, heroes and scoundrels, lovers and sinister machinators. He lets us suffer with our favorite characters, he makes us hate the vicious guys (and girls), and he keeps on surprising us with every new chapter, which is one of the most striking features of Martin's work: whenever you think you know where he's taking us (and the story line of some of his multitude plots), be sure things wont turn out as you'd expect them to.<BR>His artwork is brilliant, and the way how he's managing and connecting all the main characters' plots is simply awestriking. I enjoyed every minute of this breathtaking fantasy novel, and the rush of events towards the end of this book, esp. the battle of King's Landing and the developments beyond the wall in the north, dont let you put aside this fantastic book for a single minute.<BR>It's been quite some time since I've read a fantasy series like this, which makes me dream we could just enter the world described and participate in the staggering events that unfold before us.<BR>So, dont wait, get a hand on Martin's 'A Song of Ice and Fire' series - and join us in the lands of Westeros.

Unfortunately, the commercials far outshine the movie itself.  I expected a story about androids (\\"mechas\\" as they are called in the film) in which they rally around this new-age child--a robot with emotions!  A robot who can evolve and take them all into a brave new world where mechanized life is recognized and free.<br />Umm... No.  The message of this film is:  PEOPLE ARE HORRIBLE.
0792844882|4.0|I'm not sure if the director intended for this movie to be as campy, melodramatic, and over-the-top tackiness to the extreme as it is.  If he did though, then he made one of the best movies I've ever seen.  It's so bad that it's good!

B000000OQF|5.0|Guns N' Roses was awesome.  They had a great lead guitarist in Slash, and an often touching but aggressive singer in Axl Rose. \\"Welcome In The Jungle\\" is the perfect introduction to the album, heck, it's even got the word \\"welcome\\" in it.  That song basically summarizes the hard, guitar-driven side of Guns N' Roses.  Its lyrics also give Guns N' Roses the look of a bad-boy band, which it has clearly hung on to.  Sweet Child O' Mine, possibly the best G.N.R. song ever, shows that Guns N' Roses also has a soft side, despite the always screechy voice of the serpent-like Axl Rose.  Paradise City is no worse either, and it along with Welcome To The Jungle and Sweet Child O' Mine are the best songs on Appetite For Destruction.  This album is much harder and grindier than Use Your Illusion, and that is one thing that's not so good about Use Your Illusion: it lacks the hard, gritty sound that this album has.  I'm not saying that Use Your Illusion is a bad album, however, because songs like \\"November Rain\\", \\"Don't Cry\\", remakes of \\"Knockin' On Heaven's Door\\" and \\"Live And Let Die\\", and \\"Civil War\\" are all very worthy of sitting right next to the other hit songs on this album on an imaginary \\"G.N.R. Greatest Hits\\" list.  Overall, this may be the best G.N.R. album ever, no matter how good Use Your Illusion is.
B000065U1N|5.0|Ridley Scott's true tale of the most costly U.S. firefight since Vietnam creates with graphic detail the events leading up to and including the events of October 3rd and 4th, 1993, when 130 U.S. Rangers and Delta Operators took part in a mission to capture key Somali warlords.<BR>        What makes this film work better than Private Ryan is that it does not waste time with cliched characters who sit around and discuss the meaning of war and its motives and consequences. Black Hawk skips right to the story of telling us who these guys are and what they do. Keeping in mind that a majority of the men in the raid were in their early 20s, and one of them was 18 years old. These were just a bunch of rock and rollers who beleived they were part of an army that was undefeated and invincible. Also, Private Ryan's combat scenes revolve around only a few incidents in the film, the first and last 25 minutes of the movie. Although very realistic and graphic, they at times don't capture Balck Hawk's feeling of chaos and confusion, even with advanced technology available. Its amazing that an advanced country with helicopters, computers, satellites can be rendered useless in a city like Mogadishu. Black Hawk actions scenes area ctually one big one, lasting at least 90 minutes and being filmed in a more frenetic pace and style, not like Private Ryan's larger and more grnad setting wheere it is hard to concentrate on the action.<BR>        It soon becomes a mission of survival when two Black Hawk choppers are shot down and if becomes a rescue mission, but soon the RAngers and Delta find themselves cut off, and a convoy sent to find aid them and reach the crash sites gets shot up in some of the film's most realistic and graphic scenes. <BR>        If you have read the book by Mark Bowden you will find many of the details, even minor ones, have been included in the film, giving it a more personal and emotional touch.<BR>        Don't miss out on what was 2001 best film. And don't missout on some of the most realistic and graphic combat scenes ever filmed.
B00004ZB9D|4.0|When I first heard this album, I was completely hooked. It started when I wanted to tab 'Always On The Run' because it featured Guns N Roses' Slash on it. But while I borrow the album from my older brother, I also taped it. After I tabbed 'Always...' I heard the album in full and I was blown away! However, only from ARE YOU GONNA GO MY WAY? to ALWAYS ON THE RUN, with the exception of STAND BY MY WOMAN, are the highlights for me. Anything else is pure weak with a capital WE. I'd recommend this for anyone interested in Lenny.

B00003CXI1|5.0|Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, as you know, is the first installment in the Harry Potter series. And it's quite impressive. It stays loyal to the book, not leaving out one part, and has amazing special effects, almost unlike anything I've ever seen on a movie, not to mention on a PG rated one. The characters are just like the book described, led by a Harry Potter look-alike, Daniel Radcliff. You all know the plot, so there's no use explaining it. And if you've seen TLOR, I just wanna tell you, in my opinion, this is WAYYYYYYY better.

0064407667|2.0|Hello.<BR>I am a vivid reader and when my dad and his girlfriend bought me the series of unfortunate events #1 thru #6, I was not exeption-ally pleased.I read them all, so when I had to do a book review for school I picked the bad beginning.I really liked the story line-three sibling's parents die when the house is caught on fire and burnt to the ground and then they go live with the horrendous Count Olaf-but at cirtain points the story really seemed to be getting nowhere.Also, when Lemony Snicket wries things like the first sentence of the book, (from my perception) it seems to discorage me.<BR>(\\"oops\\" if I have spelling mistakes)
B0000640RX|5.0|Well, when the Rambo movies were re-released on VHS a few years ago in all new packaging and in widescreen for the first time, I jumped on that set when I found it.  But now that I got a DVD player I have been wanting to get these movies on DVD.  Now there's been a Collector's set available for some time using the same prints that were released on VHS.  They were also, I noticed, only in Dolby 2.0 and from what I have read the picture quality wasn't very good.  I was even going to buy that set because it had a great price, but ironically I waited.  I then went back to check out the Amazon link and found that it was no longer available directly from Amazon and I was like, \\"What?\\"  Well now I know.  This new Special Edition is going to rock!  Hopefully. :)<br />Remastered in both Dolby 5.1 and DTS, the Rambo movies should sound the best ever.  With an additional disc to the 3 movie set that is loaded with mucho extras that it will keep you busy for quite a while featuring many new documentaries that tie in the events of the movies with today's post-9/11 world with a documentary on Afghanistan.  This should be the Ultimate Rambo DVD collection.  And with rumors that Stallone is working on a new script for a Rambo IV that takes him back to Afghanistan to fight the Taliban, it should be interesting and nostalgic to watch these movies again.<br />And if the Rambo movies come across as patriotic propaganda now, so what?  Get over it.  Why one would feel shame for having strong feelings for one's country is beyond me.  Besides, I'm anxiously awaiting to hear that Rambo theme in 5.1 Surround.
0451196716|4.0|Stephen King wrote The Long Walk under his pseudonym Richard Bachman.  As Stephen King has said, Richard Bachman is Stephen King on a rainy day.  While most Stephen King books have happy themes intertwined with terror (his horror books) or other terrible circumstances (e.g., wrongful imprisonment as in Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption), Richard Bachman books are depressing all the way through.<br />In this book set in an alternate present, a group of one hundred teenage boys, including the hero, Ray Garraty, start out on a \\"long walk,\\" in which the winner gets money and a separate prize and all the rest of the walkers get a \\"ticket.\\"  The ticket, as many reviews have explained, and as you learn about 10 pages into the book (so it's not a spoiler) is a euphemism for a bullet or two in the brain.  The kids all have to walk at 4 miles per hour.  If a kid ducks below that pace, he gets a warning.  If he gets three warnings he gets shot.  However, if he can keep walking for an hour after he gets a warning, the warning is revoked.<br />As you can imagine, this book is really a 350 page exploration of pain, suicidal thoughts and how strong the will to live really is.  Since very few of us, outside of holocaust or Jim Jones survivors have experienced such a thing, it is a triumph of King's great writing that this all seems very real.<br />The book is very much centered on the long walk, the pain and the anguish.  Much of the book is about the transformation of good, bad, cynical, innocent, smart and dumb people under these extreme circumstances.  Nevertheless Garraty and many of the other walkers do talk about their lives before the walk with each other, and you get a glimpse of what life is like under this totalitarian government.  You also get two hints of why America has become such a horrible place that this is a prime sort of entertainment for America.  (perhaps there are more hints, I only caught two).  These hints were fascinating.  <br />The focus does remain on the long walk itself though, which distinguishes it from Running Man, the most similar King book (also \\"written\\" by Richard Bachman), which also is a book about a horrible life-and-death contest in America for sport in a country that has taken a wrong turn somewhere.  In Running Man, you get much more of a flavor of the surrounding world.  However, The Long Walk is just as interesting.<br />Only one flaw kept it from being a five star book (and it is a problem with many King books).  I was disappointed by the ending (which I will not spoil).  I think the ending is supposed to be a bit of a surprise.  However, rather than a surprise, it was something you would guess as a possible ending early on but hope it turned out differently.  <br />Nevertheless, I strongly recommend this book.
B000063CPL|5.0|#1 The three guitar attack adds a new dimension to the classics.<br />#2 The production sounds as good as Live after Death.  People who complain otherwise are obviously clueless.<br />This album rocks and it shows that maiden is back in true form, up the irons!
B00005JKED|3.0|A brutal and disturbing film that attempts to connect you with the underbelly of the streets of downtown Los Angeles, while examining that fragile, thin line between those who enforce the law and those who break it, \\"Training Day,\\" directed by Antoine Fuqua, is a cautionary morality tale that decidedly points out that what you do and who you are is a matter of free will and personal choice.  Beyond the action, it's a study of human nature that explores the necessity of having a moral code by which to live, especially when confronted with that age-old seductress Evil, who can lure even the best of the best across that line from which there is no return.  The most disconcerting aspect of the film, however, is in it's portrayal of those in high places who with facility betray those they are sworn to serve and protect, with their flagrant abuse of their position and power, and moreover, seemingly always manage to hold the high ground of advantage over those against whom their misdeeds are perpetrated.  Indeed, the burden of proof must always fall to the good guy, and more often than not it is those endowed with a more positive, benevolent nature-- the ones who want to do the right thing-- that find justice elusive and become victims themselves, if only because of their refusal to compromise their own principles.  And that is really what is at the heart of Fuqua's film, which very probably will take many viewers to a place they would rather not be.  But, as Steve McQueen said in \\"Bullitt,\\" when asked by his girlfriend how he can stand doing a job that keeps him so close to the gutter, \\"That's where half of it is--\\"  And in today's world, unfortunately, it may well be that the percentage is even higher; which somewhat elevates the significance of this film.<br /> Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke), a nineteen month veteran of the L.A.P.D., is about to begin his first day on a new assignment, having landed a spot in the Narcotics Division, where he will be a member of a small squad under the direction of Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington)-- if he measures up to Alonzo's stringent expectations.  It's a job he wants, because he sees it as an opportunity to really do some good in the community; it's a place from which he can help rid the streets of drug dealers and other felons.  But he quickly discovers that-- as most worthwhile things are in life-- it's just not that easy.  As Alonzo is quick to point out, \\"If you want to protect the sheep from the wolf, you have to become a wolf.  It's the wolf that catches the wolf--\\"  Jake also learns that on this day he's going to have to make a lot of decisions, and make them quickly, without the luxury of time to consider all of the possible ramifications.  And one of them is put to him directly by Alonzo, who tells him he's going to have to decide what he wants to be, a sheep-- or a wolf.  It's something he's going to have to know by the end of the day; and Jake doesn't know it going in, but this day, his \\"Training Day,\\" is going to be a day that will change his life forever.<br /> Fuqua's film is presented honestly and in such a way that it successfully puts the viewer on the streets of L.A., and Jake and Alonzo are credible characters; but the motivation behind Alonzo's ruthlessness is fairly anemic and under-developed.  The weakness of the film, in fact, lies in the screenplay (by David Ayer), which though it captures a certain sense of \\"street-wise\\" reality, is otherwise rather formulaic and doesn't really have the depth it needs to make it emotionally involving.  ...As Alonzo, Denzel Washington gives an excellent performance-- and, quite frankly, this film would be less than average without him-- but whether or not it is deserving of an Oscar is open to speculation.  Washington is one of the finest actors in the business, without question, and he's taken on some challenging roles (in which he's been very successful) that make this part pale by comparison.  Alonzo Harris is more along the lines of MelGibson's Riggs in \\"Lethal Weapon,\\" or Eastwood's Harry in \\"Dirty Harry,\\" the difference being that Alonzo is the bad guy.  It's a credit to Washington's ability that he was able to make this such a strong character, however, and his Alonzo is certainly believable and real.  And, in retrospect, perhaps it is an Oscar-worthy performance; it had to be to overcome the weakness of the script and what he was given to work with.  And, again, without Denzel Washington, this film plays for two weeks in the theater and is quickly forgotten when it hits the video store shelf.<br /> Hawke gives a strong performance, as well, but that he received an Oscar nomination for it is the stuff of which debates are born.  Like Washington, however, Hawke does do a good job of bringing his character to life, and it is one of the strengths of the film.<br /> The supporting cast includes Tom Berenger (Stan), Harris Yulin (Doug) and Scott Glenn (Roger).  In the final analysis, \\"Training Day\\" is elevated by the performances of it's stars; without them, this one has no legs.
B00000IQCA|3.0|I really had hoped this movie would be better. There really wasn't too much of a plot. There certainly are cute elements.<br />As always Tim Robbins and Julia Roberts were adorable. Otherwise<br />I can't really say a whole lot for the movie--Sorry:(
B000002UB3|5.0|The final album from the Beatles, though technically, Let It Be came out after this, though in reality, this one was worked on after Let It Be, and usually is considered by fans as their final album. And what a grand finish it was too!  This is considered by many to be among their best, and some (including me, though it depends partially on what kind of mood I am in) think it may be their best album ever.  Another plus for this album is that it has George's possibly best two Beatles songs he ever wrote, and also a song written and performed by Ringo (who only wrote a total of two songs while in the Beatles).  Here is my song by song take on the album:<br />1. Come Together: The opener to the album.  A Beatles classic.   A Lennon rocker. Very catchy.  Covered by many bands.  Some fans at the time thought it was giving more clues that Paul was dead.<br />2. Something:  A love song by George Harrison, one of his best.  Very touching.<br />3. Maxwell's Silver Hammer:  A story told by McCartney about a kid who kills people by bashing their heads with his silver hammer.    If this were a true story you were hearing on the news, this would be quite horrific, but in song form, it's kind of amusing.  And who doesn't think about one of their old school teachers when they hear this song ;)<br />4. Oh! Darling:  Starts out like an old style love song.  However this songs turns out to be much more, as McCartney really shows us just how strong his voice is.  A powerful performance, probably one of McCartney's best.<br />5. Octopus's Garden: Ringo writes and sings this one.  From the story I heard, when Ringo left the Beatles for a bit during the White Album recording sessions, he went on a sea cruise.  On the cruise, he happened to be talking to the captain, who told him how Octopuses would find things (rocks, shells, man made objects) on the sea floor, gather them up, and make a sort of garden out of them.  This is how this song came about.  Upon listening to the lyrics, it seems as if Ringo may be dropping clues that  he wants to be away from the Beatles in this song, such as being \\"below the storm\\", \\"no one to tell us want to do\\", and others.<br />6. I Want You (She's So Heavy): A rocking number, Lennon lets lose on this one, though much of it is instrumental, the last portion seems to have a sort of \\"wind blowing\\" effect in it, very cool when listening with headphones.  It seems to stop suddenly, but this is normal, as on the original record, it was purposely done this way, as the Beatles had the track play to the very edge of the record.<br />7. Here Comes The Sun:  The first song of the second side of the original album.  Another George song, one of his best.  Upbeat, happy, a hopeful view of the future, contrasting nicely to the previous song.  Both the lyrics and the guitar playing seem to go together very well in this song as they both have a happy feel.<br />8. Because:  Nice harmony, very strange song, kind of eerie.  Many possible drug references in it.  Still a good song.<br />9. You Never Give My Your Money:  Nice Paul song, beginning part is soft and contrasts well with the previous one.  Half way through it changes pace into more of a rocking number<br />10. Sun King:  The previous song ends with crickets chirping, and this one picks right up from that point.  Another Lennon song with nice harmony on it.  The end part seems to go into just a random jumble of foreign words.<br />11.  Mean Mr Mustard:  A song about a dirty old man who acts inappropriately in social settings, a decent song, catchy. Not really related to the previous song, but picks up from it without a pause<br />12. Polythene Pam:  The sister of Mr Mustard, this song picks up from the previous song too, Lennon makes references to hear being attractive but also looking like a man.  Very fast tempo song, very catchy and fun.<br />14. She Came In Through The Bathroom Window:  A Paul song, picks up from the previous song as well. Seems to be about a rich girl whoknow finds herself out in the real world, not really sure.  Still catchy.<br />15. Golden Slumbers:  A Paul song, very beautiful, we find him once again in superb voice. One of my favorites.<br />16.  Carry That Weight:  Picks up from previous song, but also contains references to \\"You Never Give My Your Money\\".  Catchy.<br />17.  The End:  Picks up from the previous song, as this is the final album, all members get to do a solo, with Ringo's being on drums.  Really almost a jam session.  Which in the end, suddenly slows up, and of course, it ends with the famous line \\"And in the end, the love you take, is equal to the love, you make\\"  A fitting ending.<br />18. Her Majesty:  Never wanting to end a performance on a serious note, the Beatles put Paul's cute little ditty at the end of the album, though there is quite a long delay before it picks up from The End.<br />All good things must come to an end.
B000063DIR|1.0|I recently heard that two of my all-time favorite albums, Ozzy Osbourne's \\"Blizzard of Ozz\\" and \\"Diary of a Madman,\\" had undergone a 24-bit remastering process, and were to be re-released on CD. I couldn't wait to check them out, and I purchased them the moment they became available.<br />The first clue that something was wrong came while I was leafing through the booklet for \\"Blizzard.\\" The old back cover photo of Ozzy on stage with guitarist Randy Rhoads, bassist (and lyricist) Bob Daisley, and drummer Lee Kerslake had been doctored so that only Ozzy was now visible. Strange, I thought.<br />Then I sat down to listen. My first reaction to \\"Blizzard\\" was that the drumming sounded sloppier than I remembered. Skipping from track to track, I noticed some things were sounding very different, and that the album seemed to have not only been remastered, but had been completely remixed from the original multi-track tapes.<br />Giving the liner notes a closer look, I discoved that all of the bass and drum tracks for both albums have been re-recorded by current Ozzy sidemen Robert Trujillo and Mike Bordin, respectively.<br />I'm not kidding.<br />At this point I began to get pretty upset. The bass and drum tracks have been re-recorded in such a way as to mimic the original sound of the albums, but it doesn't work: Trujillo's bass is actually noticably out-of-tune on a couple of numbers, and Bordin's drumming never matches the feel of the original tracks. Of course, \\"Blizzard of Ozz\\" was a somewhat lo-fi album to begin with. What about \\"Diary of a Madman,\\" the album I've long characterized as the \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" of Heavy Metal?<br />In my opinion, \\"Diary\\" has been ruined. From the opening drum triplets of \\"Over the Mountain\\" everything is wrong, wrong, wrong. Every ounce of magic the album had has been sucked out of it. Randy's guitar tones are completely [messed] up. Some of his solos and fills are barely audible, and his various effects and textures have been replaced with adry, shrill tone in many spots. The new mix retains none of the charm, atmosphere, or detail of the original. Even \\"Flying High Again\\" sounds awful. Why on earth would Ozzy mess with one of the greatest sounding albums in hard rock history?<br />Well, according to Sharon Osbourne, Daisley and Kerslake have been removed from the albums because they have been \\"harrassing\\" the Osbourne family. The truth is that Bob Daisley and Lee Kerslake are suing Ozzy for non-payment of royalties and for crediting others (Rudy Sarzo and Tommy Aldridge) for their work on \\"Diary of a Madman.\\" By removing them from the recordings, Ozzy can ensure that Daisley and Kerslake will receive no future mechanical royalties from his back catalog. This is simply an act of monumental greed and arrogance, and I implore you not to support Ozzy in this shameful endeavor.<br />These CD's are being promoted as \\"original recording remastered,\\" with no outward indication to the buyer that they have been re-recorded with sidemen Randy Rhoads never even met. It is an unforgivable affront to Randy's memory, and it is deliberately misleading to Ozzy's longtime fans. Unfortunately, these will soon be the only versions of these albums you can buy, so get the 1995 22-bit remasters while you still can: They sound fantastic and are the only authentic versions of these hard rock masterpieces.

B00005QIPH|4.0|Basically any kind of album can fall into one or both of the following categories: rock or pop. Groups like Cherry Poppin' Daddies and The Brian Setzer Orchestra are considered a little of both; morever, they both rely on a feel and sound from several decades prior to their albums' release. Well, a new group to follow that same kind of formula is the NYC-based quintet The Strokes, composed of vocalist Julian Casablancas, drummer Fabrizio Moretti, bassist Nikolai Fraiture (who looks like a cross between Beck and Ashton Kutcher), and guitarists Nick Valensi and Albert Hammond, Jr.<br />What time capsule did The Strokes dig into? Well, judging by their dress and sound, I'd say the mid-seventies to early eighties. Their songs contain simple drumbeats and enthusiastic guitars...something that not everyone can pull off as well as they can. They work \\"When It Started\\" (replacing the limit-pushing \\"New York City Cops\\") so well, it's hard to believe there's not a DJ hiding in there somewhere. That is one of the best parts of the album, not to mention the preceding song (and their current single) \\"Hard To Explain\\". After Fabrizio starts things off, Albert jumps in to make everything all right, but it's not until Nick and Nikolai give their contributions until you can get the feel of the song...and Julian's vocals keep things on the right track. They continue to shine on songs like \\"Last Nite\\", \\"The Modern Age\\" and \\"Alone, Together\\".<br />Does anything on this album need improvement? Maybe switching up the subject matter a little. There are a few too many relationship-problem-type songs on here. Also, \\"Barely Legal\\" may be a little too out there for many listeners. But Is This It is an above average album nonetheless, and I personally hope to hear more from these guys in the future.
B00005U1YO|5.0|I've read alot of mixed reviews on here about this album. To say the least i was very worried about purchasing this album, but the chemical brothers had never let me down before and i felt like i owed them some money from over playing all the previous albums.<br />When i first got the album i was a little dissappointed. Listened to it a few times and went on. Couple days later i popped it back in (after seeing the star guitar music video) and the rest of the album really began to grow on me. Now the album gets play time everyday, my recommendation is if you love the chemical brothers and don't mind some semi experimental stuff buy the album. <br />Denmark and star guitar are the real jewels of this album, at least in my opinion. The other songs are also solid for the most part and are well worth a listen.
B00000G09Q|5.0|I almost laugh at the people who actually thought that the second movie was better than this one.  The time-leaping aspect of the movie was really interesting, as was the fact that they didn't bring back the Shredder.

B00005NOOH|5.0|This series has remained a marked point in my personal development for over thirty years (I refer to its original screening in the UK in the 1960s/1970s). I first witnessed what seemed to be a surreal set of images to the eyes of a boy on the verge to adolescence, when life was all about 'crash, bang, your dead, no I'm not'. It took a great step into a realm of incredulity to believe that, first, these events all took place within the space of a few years - then only twenty some odd years earlier and a very vivid part of my father's youth (Royal Navy, North Atlantic/Mediterranean 1943-1945), and that the images were real, not the product of Hollywood. The collected images and tone of this series makes for an essential component of any reference to the period. I challenge anyone to remain unmoved by this work. The ominous strains of the theme music have stayed with me along with the effect this series had on my learning process and education.
0780619609|1.0|My opinion doesn't seem to be very popular, but I felt that this was the worst movie of the series.  I was constantly rolling my eyes when I would see the turtles fight an army of foot-soldiers and two indestructable mutants unarmed, though their weapons were (usually) strapped to their backs.  And the times when they weren't carrying weapons, I wondered what they were doing going into battle without them.  I would own this ONLY to have the complete collection.
1563896656|4.0|Alan Moore's The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen asks the question; what would it have been like if comic books had existed in the 19th century as they do in the 21st? The result is easily one of the most entertaining graphic novels I've had the pleasure of reading. This is one of those rare gems, a book so good you want to pass it on to a close friend because you just _know_ they're going to dig it. I approached the book out of curiosity, being a fan of Moore's America's Best Comics work (Tom Strong being my personal favorite, but this work has made him a close second) and a fan of the 19th century characters Moore and artist Kevin O'Neil (who kicks some serious behind in the pencilling department with this book. I wasn't really a fan of his angled, sharp style of drawing in his Marshall Law books, but here in the Victorian milieu of League, it fits perfectly, I could see this being the work of an artist of the 1890s.) make use of. I must confess I know quite little of H. Rider Haggard's Allan Quartermain, but after reading Moore's take on the aging and haunted adventurer I'm tracking him down in my nearest library posthaste.<br /> But beyond art and writing, a good comic has to have one final ingredient: fun. League has that sense of fun in spades, while the characters may be an odd and sometimes disturbing (as in the case of Griffin, the Invisible Man, who is creepy beyond all measure in this book. Imagine Hannibal Lecter with the power of invisibility and a penchant for brutal violence rather than cannibalism and you'll be close), you can tell Moore and O'Neil were having a blast producing this book. I've heard that a Volume II is in the works (and given the wonderful ending I love the intrepid band's forthcoming exploits), and a feature film is in the works. If they can capture a tenth of the enjoyment I gained from this book it'll be a blockbuster. As to why I gave it four stars? Too short old boy! I wanted more!

B00005OM4Q|5.0|Almost Famous has become my favorite movie, ever!  I fell in love with each and every character!  My two favorites are Elaine Miller and Penny Laine.  Two very different, but equally colorful, characters.  I was thrilled that Cameron had his own MOTHER (the inspiration for Elaine) join him in the director's commentary!  It was funny.  I also enjoyed hearing more about Penny Lane from Cameron's own mouth.  Not surprisingly, she was inspired by real-life girls he met while touring with bands.  He names two of them: a Penny Trumble and a Bebe Buell.  I would've loved to see pictures of these two ladies, heard them comment along with Cameron's mom.  But I'll  settle for looking up these two entities online!  Oh well...<br />What else?  I loved watching the interview with real-life Lester Bangs---Philip Seymour Hoffman did an EXCELLENT job! Many of the cut scenes were good enough to be in the actual movie.  Especially the hilarious Stillwater radio interview (what a whack job that DJ was!), Penny and Russell alone at the Riot House, and Penny &quot;cutting the cake&quot;.  The Stillwater concert is a great perk, especially &quot;Hour of Need&quot;, my favorite song by a band that doesn't exist!  The ode to Gram Parsons and Emmylou Harris, &quot;Small Time Blues&quot;, is shown being sung in its entirety at the Riot House!  There are so many great &quot;little&quot; scenes in this movie, I would've loved to zero in on like that.  This is a wonderful movie with wonderful extras!
B00005JKED|5.0|There is no doubt, that on March 24, 2002, justice was served when The Best Actor Academy Award was given to one the greatest actors of his generation, for what very well be his best performance since Malcolm X (the movie he should have won Best Actor for in 1992)  I'm of course talking about the brilliant Mr. Denzel Washington.  Everyone is talking about him playing against type in this one, but I see this as a classic Denzel performance, with all the elements we love about him, just more colorful.  You can tell he's having fun playing that part when you watch the movie.  Let's not forget the Oscar worthy performance from Ethan Hawke, who held his own playing the perfect opposite of Denzel's savage Alonzo Harris.  And of course there is the brilliant directing of Pittsburgh native Antoine Fuqua.  This has to be his best film to date.  Let's also not forget the compelling screenplay by David Ayer, and the rest of the cast, including Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre.  bottom line, Training Day is a must see.  Especially if you're a Denzel fan.  And if your not, after this, you'll become one.
B000056HOZ|5.0|This collection of music videos shows Springsteen's sometimes love/hate relationship with the music video format.  He obviously recognized their value but never quite seemed comfortable in front of the camera.  Not surprisingly, the best videos here are the live performance clips, although some of the conceptual pieces are impressive.<br />Here's a breakdown of some of the highlights (and lowlights):<br />Disc One:<br />\\"Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)\\": This is one of Springsteen's great concert songs, filmed in 1978, which some people consider the best period of his performing career.  The production values are a little rough.  The camera angles are limited and the print quality is poor, but the performance overcomes both of these shortcomings.<br />\\"The River\\" and \\"Thunder Road\\": Both of these were taken from the concert film \\"No Nukes,\\" a record of the 1979 protest concert.  The performance is first rate and the production values are a giant leap forward from \\"Rosalita.\\"<br />\\"Atlantic City\\":  This is the first \\"concept\\" video in Springsteen's career.  In reality, it's a rather low-key montage of black and white images of the eponymous city.  Bruce does not appear in the video.<br />\\"Dancing In The Dark\\": Springsteen's first conscious stab at the music video format.  This is a pseudo-live performance clip filmed at the first couple of shows of the 1984 tour.  Stiff and uninspired, it's better known for having introduced the world to Courtney Cox.<br />\\"Born In The U.S.A\\": Another less-than-successful attempt at a music video.  It features live footage of Springsteen in a shotgun marriage to the studio version of the song.  The lack of mobility for the camera, combined with the poor lip-synching between the film and the music, show Springsteen still struggling with the music video.<br />\\"I'm on Fire\\": Springsteen leaps into the conceptual video with both feet.  A totally non-performance video, it features Bruce playing an auto mechanic.  As an actor, he acquits himself adequately, but I don't think Robert DeNiro will lose any sleep.<br />\\"Glory Days\\": Probably the most successful concept video of the Born in the U.S.A. era, it combines footage of Springsteen as a baseball-obsessed construction worker with a lip-synched performance of the entire E-Street Band in a working class bar.  It also shows why Bruce will never win the Cy Young Award.<br />\\"My Hometown\\": The first of several purely live performance video, this one was taken form the L.A. Coliseum shows of October, 1985.  Simple but effective, it shows Springsteen in his element, playing one of his best songs.<br />\\"War\\": A blistering version of Edwin Starr's classic protest song, this video comes from the same show as \\"My Hometown.\\"  If you look closely, you can see Bruce checking the cheat sheet taped to his arm as he was still just learning this song.<br />\\"Fire\\": A lively and humorous version of the classic song, this was taken from the first Bridge School Benefit concert in 1986.  Although this was to promote the live album, this video does not feature the same version of the song.  Taken from the in-house video system, the video quality is a little spotty but the performance more than makes up for it.<br />\\"Born to Run\\": A live cut from the 1985 stadium tour, it also intercuts this footage with various shots taken from other shows.  No concept here, other to show Bruce Springsteen in his natural element (live in concert) playing one his greatest live songs.<br />\\"Brilliant Disguise\\": This is a bizarre video, showing Bruce alone in a kitchen with his guitar, singing live to a recorded instrumental track.  There are no cuts as the camera slowly zooms into his face in one long continuous shot.  It's an effective performance and certainly unique for its minimalist approach.<br />\\"Tunnel of Love\\": This video shows a formula that Bruce would use a several more times, combining Bruce-less conceptual footage with shots of Springsteen lip synching.  This video probably marksthe first time he used the non-concert video format to its fullest advantage.<br />\\"One Step Up\\": Another video in the \\"Tunnel of Love\\" tradition, feature shots of Bruce as a straying husband in a girly bar (probably includes the most skin of any Bruce video).  The fact that this video predates his affair with Patti Scialfa and his messy divorce from Julianne Phillips makes this one interesting on a whole other level.<br />\\"Tougher Than The Rest\\": This is the first live video from the 1988 tour featuring very well-shot concert footage intercut with shots of various couples kissing and clowning outside the auditorium.  On a side note, I don't see anyone could have seen the goo-goo eyes Bruce and Patti Scialfa were making at each other and not known *something* was up between them.  Okay, maybe they were acting, but history says otherwise.<br />\\"Spare Parts\\": Another live video, taken from a show on the 1988 European tour.  It features a long opening piano interlude with Bruce trying too hard to explain the significance of the song.  There's nothing wrong with the performance but the video quality is a little subpar.  This may have something to do with PAL video being coverted over to American NTSC standards.<br />\\"Born to Run\\": This is the acoustic-only version of the song from the 1988 tour (same show that produced the \\"Tougher Than The Rest\\" video).  This has always been one of my favorites versions of this song and the video shows it well, although a concert video of one guy with an acoustic guitar probably won't excite the casual fan, but then they'll probably tune out during Springsteen's LONGwinded introduction.
B000002KOO|4.0|Just to let you know I am not much of a Fleetwood Mac fan. To me, I feel their Buckingham/Nicks-era material is vastly overrated, and overexposed. If it wasn't for the fact the music of that era was overly commercial, and overplayed to death, the well-publicized soap operas, ego clashes and drug abuse from the band members is enough to make me puke. I find some of the Bob Welch-era material good (particularly Bare Trees and Mystery to Me), but some of their material a bit uneven (particularly Penguin). Then Play On, released in 1969 consisted of Peter Green, Jeremy Spencer, a young Danny Kirwan (not yet 20 when this came out), and of course Mick Fleetwood and John McVie. I heard English Rose as well, with the same lineup, but I thought it was too straight-up blues for my liking (I'm not a blues fan, but I'm not bothered when certain rock bands, like Jethro Tull explored the blues since it still sounded rock enough for my tastes), so I was surprised I'd like Then Play On as much as I do. The band was moving away from the blues, which was actually a good move here. The music is actually more eclectic, with some killer jams (\\"Fighting For Madge\\"), acoustic ballads (\\"Closing My Eyes\\", \\"When You Say\\"), hard rocking numbers, and of course a couple of bluesy numbers like \\"Show-Biz Blues\\" (although with a more rock quality than their previous efforts). My version is the American Reprise LP without \\"Oh Well\\" and with \\"When You Say\\" instead. Many people believe Fleetwood Mac moved away from the blues when Green left, when in reality they were already moving away from the blues when he was still in the band. I can truly recommend Then Play On to even those who thought they couldn't stand Fleetwood Mac (which I don't blame if having to be exposed to the likes of \\"Dreams\\", \\"Go Your Own Way\\", and \\"Don't Stop\\" constantly). Way better than Rumours will ever hope to be, and it comes with my recommendation.
B000002G6J|5.0|Keven McAlester's &quot;stale cheese&quot; remark should be completely ignored. This album is a perfect jewel. If someone can't understand why, there's no use in explaining.
B00004SA88|5.0|Salvatore Accardo has played magnificently! I am not a classical music critic; I don't know what it really means to be a great violinist, but I certainly enjoy listening to every song in this 6 cd set. I am fifteen years old, but Paganini's music has a great impact on me. My mother bought me this album for Christmas, and I couldn't have received a more wonderful collection of music. I tend to have a preference for the first recording I ever hear of certain songs, and I have heard several of these songs performed by different artists. Let me tell you, these recordings are fantastic. My favorites are the 21st Caprice, the second movement of the 6th concerto, and the entire 4th concerto. Accardo's tone is rich and robust, and the orchestra behind him compliments him perfectly. <BR>                     Utterly Satisfied,<BR>                        Bobby<br />P.S. The title for my review was what Franz Liszt (classical pianist and composer) exclaimed when he heard Paganini perform.:)
B00005JKEC|5.0|As great an actor as Denzel Washington is, I had honestly grown a bit tired of all of his &quot;goodie-two-shoes&quot; roles, the most recent being &quot;Remember the Titans&quot; and &quot;The Hurricane.&quot;  His performance in &quot;Training Day,&quot; however, has given me newfound respect for him as an actor unafraid to stretch himself beyong his usual (i.e. type-cast) artistic boundaries.  Not only does he play &quot;the bad guy&quot; in this powerful L.A. crime drama, but he milks its for all its worth - and makes it look easy!  His Alonzo Harris would make Dirty Harry look like Barney Fife on &quot;The Andy Griffith Show.&quot;  His winning the Best Actor Oscar at the 74th Annual Academy Awards on March 24 for this role was well-deserved.  This performance makes &quot;The Hurricane&quot; look like a cool summer breeze by comparison.  He is without a doubt the BEST actor of his generation.<br />Ethan Hawke was equally exceptional.  Any young actor who can hold his own with the likes of Washington in a film like this deserves recognition.  His performance shows that he has a long and stellar career (and more Oscar nominations) ahead of him.<br />&quot;Training Day&quot; is a blisteringly brilliant depiction of a rookie cop's one-day &quot;education&quot; on the L.A. narcotics beat from a veteran and self-proclaimed &quot;wolf among wolves.&quot;  It will slap you across the chops with its intensity, made all the more potent by two powerhouse performances that will stay in your mind long after the closing credits.
B000056HOZ|4.0|This collection of music videos shows Springsteen's sometimes love/hate relationship with the music video format.  He obviously recognized their value but never quite seemed comfortable in front of the camera.  Not surprisingly, the best videos here are the live performance clips, although some of the conceptual pieces are impressive.<br />Here's a breakdown of some of the highlights (and lowlights):<br />Disc Two:<br />\\"Human Touch\\": The first video of the post-E-Street-Band era, this comes from the same director responsible for \\"Tunnel of Love\\" and \\"One Step Up\\" and shows the same basic approach.  The pictures are pretty but the formula was starting to get a little repetitive by this point.<br />\\"Better Days\\": One of Bruce's least known videos, it breaks away from the \\"Tunnel of Love\\" formula, even though its from the same director, featuring a live-in-the-studio performance of the song, interspersed with Bruce clowning with his new band and his kids (someone's kids anyway).  The ragged, uneven end to the song is oddly endearing.<br />\\"57 Channels (And Nothing On)\\": I had never even heard of this video before getting this DVD.  It's as close as Bruce ever got to the too-literal \\"match the image to the lyric\\" school of video.   Probably the least interesting pure-conceptual video Bruce has done.<br />\\"Leap of Faith\\": Another video from the same director as the live \\"Tougher Than The Rest\\" clip and it shows the same basic approach, mixing in footage from other songs and even other concerts.  The performance is energetic enough but the formulaic approach and the lack of the E-Street Band's chemistry undercut the video somewhat.<br />\\"Streets of Philadelphia\\": The video for Bruce's Oscar and Emmy-winning song from the Jonathan Demme movie.  Similar in some respects to \\"My Brilliant Disguise\\", combining the studio instrumental track with a  new live vocal track by Bruce recorded as his walks the aforementioned streets.  Clever editing lets Bruce exchange meaningful glances with Tom Hank's character from the movie.<br />\\"Murder Incorporated\\": A live version of the legendary \\"lost\\" Springsteen song (It was to be the title track of the album Springsteen scrapped in favor of the more upbeat and accessible \\"Born In The U.S.A.\\"), this was Bruce's first performance with the E-Street Band in almost seven years.  Filmed in front of an audience at a small New York club, the cramped quarters limited the mobility of Jonathan Demme's cameras and the inadequate lighting makes Bruce and the band look almost sinister.  The blistering performance, however, carries the day.<br />\\"Secret Garden\\": Bruce's love letter to the fairer sex, he's the only person with a Y Chromosome in this video, showing a large variety of women of all shapes, sizes and ages, emoting for the camera.  Tender and beautifully filmed, this is one of my favorites of Springsteen's recent videos.  There are actually two versions of the video on this DVD, the second using the alternate \\"Strings\\" mix of the song.<br />\\"Hungry Heart\\": This is a really strange bird, apparently filmed for an anniversary release of the song in Germany, it was filmed \\"live\\" in Berlin with a new vocal by Bruce over the original 1980 instrumental track.  Features shows of a Bruce playing with a local band and driving around the city past sections of the Berlin Wall.<br />\\"Dead Man Walking\\": Unlike \\"Streets of Philadelphia\\", this video features significant footage from the film that insprired the song, making it more of a trailer for the film than the video.  Nothing wrong with that I guess, but makes for one of the lesser contribution to Springsteen's video oeuvre.<br />\\"The Ghost of Tom Joad\\": In a lot of ways, this is the spiritual cousin to \\"Atlantic City\\", in that it combines black and white documentary-style footage and nothing of the singer (except as a silhouette in a couple of shots).  This is the more effective of the two because the footage is a better match to the theme of the song.<br /> \\"TheGhost of Tom Joad\\": The second video for the same song, this was taken from Bruce's appearance on the Tonight Show.   I don't have anything against this performance or this song, but if they were going to take a second video for a song from a talk show, I would have preferred the version of \\"Murder Incorporated\\" he did on the Letterman show earlier that year.<br />\\"Highway Patrolman\\": Here's a video with a long, unique history.  A song recorded in 1982 inspires a Sean Penn film in 1991 and the two get combined for a music video in the year 2000.  I'll say this much, it made me want to see the film (\\"The Indian Runner\\").<br />\\"If I Should Fall Behind\\": Shot during rehearsal for the 1999-2000 reunion tour, this features a single camera shot of the E-Street Band trading vocals on Springsteen's 1992 song.  Unfortunately, the vocals are a bit overwrought.  The version on the second disc of the \\"Live in NYC\\" DVD is more restrained and more effective.<br />\\"Born In The U.S.A.\\": If the last video was OVERwrought, this video is badly UNDERwrought.  From Bruce's appearance on the \\"Charlie Rose Show\\", the best description I can offer of Bruce's performance is \\"autistic.\\"  It's a kinder word than \\"lifeless.\\"  If I had been a member of Springsteen's inner circle, I would have sat on Bruce until he came to his senses and left this video off this collection.  It brings the second disc to a limp and unsatisfying conclusion.
B00005JKED|2.0|First, let me say that Denzel Washington puts in a good performance.  It's not an academy award performace, but it's good.  And it's not his fault.  The character is written to be a one dimensional thug, and that's Denzel plays. He's the typical bent cop that turns up in movie after movie.  Ethan Hawke's character is a far more challenging role, and he also plays him well.  <br />The real problem with the movie is the ludicrous plot.  The movie consists of one ridiculous and incredible scene after another.  You'll find yourself muttering \\"oh, come on!\\" time and again, especially toward the end of the movie when the story dispenses with what little credibility it ever had to begin with.<br />...
B00005JKED|4.0|Denzel Washington plays an oustanding Performance.. and one of the best roles hes played. This show wouldn't be good , if it hadn't been for him and his great role play in one of most powerful Crime/Dramas ever told.<BR>It shows how LA, california is all about.. in the neighborhood of how society can reflect to others who haven't lived that moment. <BR>Denzel made this movie what it is. He can play just about any character.  Hes a Legend of hollywood. <BR>Ethan Hawke played well too. <BR>The movie gets real intense.. and gets you on the edge of more and more interests growing in your mind.
B000060OWV|5.0|I've got the Blue Moon fever for a week now. The symptoms are you are unable to get in the car without putting Robben Fords newest release in and turning it up. Blue Moon, Robben's best since 1988's Talk to Your Daughter, is habit forming. Every time I listen it keeps getting better. Do yourself a favor and catch the fever too get Blue Moon you won't be dissapointed.
B000002N25|4.0|Whereas Sailing to Philadelphia gets 5 stars for its brilliant songcraft and music, its predecessor drops a star due to less musical brilliance. Hey, you can't give everthing 5 stars!  Still a solid Knopfler effort that carries on the smooth Dire Straits sound tradition. Knopflers solos definitely take a turn back to the road of beautiful songcraft that early Dire Straits albums displayed and what some of their later poppy (ie 'I want my mtc') tracks went too commercial. If you liked 'Sailing to Phila.' you won't be dissappointed with Golden Heart.  Smooth fretwork and understated vocals equals good stuff.
B00005OAIE|3.0|I purchased this CD after seeing the video and reading some good reviews on this site.  John Mayer definitely shows a lot of promise but I have to admit that I was disappointed in the CD.  Quite frankly the songs all sounded quite a bit alike and the whole vibe of the album was too mellow for me.  Now, I like soft rock but this just didn't do too much for me.  Maybe I'll like his next installment better but I think I'll sample a few songs first before I buy it.  I seriously doubt that I'll listen to this album for very long.<br />I recently also purchased Ryan Adams' Gold and Pete Yorn's somethingforthemorningafter.  Of these promising artists, I much preferred the Pete Yorn CD.  There are some great rock songs on there and I liked the variety he showed.

B000065U1N|5.0|I was one of the soldiers there that fate filled day in the Mog. Although each movie character plays many different actual real life soldiers due to cost of making a movie they did an excellent job showing the general public the intensity of the battle fought there in the 17 hours that seemed like 17 days. I suggest reading the book before seeing the movie as with any book that has been turned into a movie, but just to get an in depth look at the lives of each and every soldier who was there. Keep in mind that not everyone there was recognized in either the movie or the book but we all came back as a team, and in some ways a closer knit family.
B00000K3D4|5.0|I'm afraid not. The path of this classic to your heart is short and direct. This fantastic Jim Henson production truly is an all time classic. One is never too old to watch this film and fall in love with its beautiful creature, adoreable monsters and cute goblins. <br />This film has it all - romance, fear, humor, music. Regardless of the actors' incredible performances, what makes this movie one of its kind it the amazing artwork and set designs. Keep in mind that this film was made back in the 80's, when computer animation was still a spoiled infant, and set designers had to do all the dirty work with their own bare hands. And what an amazing dirty work have they done here...<br />It's a must to all you Brian Froud treasurers, Jim Henson favorers, David Bowie fanatics and Jennifer Connely moon-strucks. Scenes will haunt you on end, the design will inspire, the music will never let go and the demons are with you to stay. *G*
0151003084|5.0|This is a outstanding book. This is a new way to learn your ABC's. Picture if you will, Stephen King teaching kindergardeners the ABC's, that all you need to know about this oh so funny book. It's dark, disturbing, twisted, and a wonderful read. In today world, everything has to be &quot;PC&quot;, well Gorey's book is a breath of fresh air. I was actually laughing outloud as I was reading the book. Once you pick it up, you'll have a lot of chuckles. This is the first book I read by Gorey, and I plan to get the rest of his books. He's that good.
B000002UV1|5.0|If you love the chili peppers or just happen to want to pick up one of their cds you can't go wrong with this one. How they play gives me a sense of freedom and you can tell they really love what they do. As opposed to Blood Sugar Sex Magik this cd isn't as \\"beautiful\\"; it doesn't have ballads like Sir Psycho Sexy, I Could have Lied, Under the Bridge, or Breaking the Girl, but that isn't what the chili peppers were at the time- it was all punk/funk and great tunes. Some of you may be turned off by its rather different sound (such as in Subway to Venus) but it will soon grow on you. Here are my grades for each individual song.<br />Good Time Boys- really one of my personal favorites just because of its autobiography of the bands fun, and overall good times. It has a great tune and there is a part in the middle with rather intersting clips of songs that to this day I have no idea what they are.- A-<br />Higher Ground- perhaps the most \\"popular\\" song on the album, it is a cover of Stevie Wonder's Higher Ground. It starts out with a great bass riff by Flea and then the whole song comes into place with Frusciante and Smith. The chorus is also good.- A-<br />Subway to Venus- this song is nuts. Anthony's vocals are very different, and so is the overall sound. A lot of trumpet and to me this is pure genius.- A<br />Magic Johnson- a funny song; its the whole band chanting about the L.A. Lakers and its full of crazy voices and a great riff toward the end.- B<br />Nobody Weird Like Me- starts off with a bass solo like Higher Ground, but even faster. Also nuts like Subway to Venus it sounds almost Arabian toward the end. Some intersting lyrics.- B+<br />Knock Me Down- a song about the death and grievance of the band's previous guitarist Hillel Slovak. To me this is one of their absolute greats; it has a great tune, chorus, beat, and even has the background vocals of Vicki Calhoun who also appears in Higher Ground, and Johnny Kick a Hole in the Sky; a great song- A<br />Taste the Pain- the most underrated. Flea is a master of the trumpet in the middle and the whole crazy sound adds to its greatness.- A<br />Stone Cold Bush- very fast and to me this shows who the chili peppers were. The middle could be considered disturbing at the solo but who really cares?- B+<br />Fire- to me this isn't a great cover of Jimi Hendrix's version. I guess the vocals can get annoying but it is worth a listen or two.- C<br />Pretty Little Ditty- their total masterpiece, to me the best instrumental and song they have ever done. Once again Flea shows his skills on the trumpet and John Frusciante is great on the guitar. It has been stolen (I shouldn't say STOLEN) but used by other bands such as in Crazy Town's \\"Butterfly\\". So Great.- A+<br />Punk Rock Classic- funny and fast. Uses Guns and Roses guitar solo from Child O Mime at the end. Only about a minute and thirty seconds but thats all that was needed.- B+<br />Sexy Mexican Maid- its a shame this song is so overlooked. Very good with raunchy lyrics, better and more refined than Stone Cold Bush.- A-<br />Johnny, Kick a Hole In the Sky- this and Knock Me Down were my first two favorites on the album. A great song with very powerful lyrics. My only problem with it is it is the same for 5 minutes; no guitar solo or anything but thats no trouble.- A<br />I guess what I've been trying to say is that this album is the 2nd best of the bands older music. Some people say the second half of the album is repetitive and annoying, which I guess could dawn on people because tracks 9,10, and 11 are all under 2 minutes but this is still the most classic Chili pepper album in my book. A fan should definately pick it up but if you are a newcomer you may not adjust to the sound. Overall it loses out to BSSM because it is not as moving but a great effort and a good buy.
B00004SPYJ|5.0|This movie is an example of great acting .The characters are so real and pure.very refreshing and a movie that is truly one of the best romantic movies.I find even their speech,so poetic so light and airy.You'll be completely mesmerized .
B000002JQ6|3.0|This is a pretty good live CD.  It has most of their good songs.  The one thing I don't like that much about this CD is the vocals aren't great.  I think it's a cool album, but I deffinatley preffer the studio versions of the songs.
B000001FT2|5.0|Grace Jones is an amazing artist, and this album comes from her amazing musical period.  Every track is backed by Sly & Robbie who provide groovy, complex soundtextures and soulful, interesting jams.  Just listen to \\"Walking In The Rain\\".  In this song, Grace Jones is surrounded by a thick musical cloud.  The music hangs around her voice like a 3-dimensional aura.  Grace brings in some nice covers, like \\"Use Me\\", \\"Demolition Man\\" ( which will remind us of her role in 'Conan The Barbarian' ) and \\"Nightclubbing\\".  It's amazing how she can turn a song into her own, even when it looks impossible.  The songs suit her perfectly.  There is the famous and sexy \\"Pull Up To The Bumper\\".  As usual, there is the one little more unknown track, \\"Art Groupie\\", which proves to be equally great.  There is the French touch in the famous \\"I've Seen That Face Before ( Libertango )\\" where she brings in some of her old disco flavour and exotica.  Grace Jones is a smart musician.  She won't make her albums too long ( no fillers or flaws on her albums ) and the artwork is stunning as usual.  There is also a nice, suprising jazzy affair, \\"I've Done It Again\\", that shows Grace Jones as a great artist, who can use her voice to seduce and sooth people.  This track shows a totally different side from Grace Jones.<br />If only she would come back with another album...    :)
B00005U11Z|5.0|After many years of waiting for Journey to tour the UK, this disk is the closest I've come to seeing the band live. I waited for Columbia to release a region 2 PAL version but they had no plans to do this, so I was left with no choice but order direct from the US. <br />Amazon delivered this disk within 5 days - AMAZING - WELL DONE!<br />The quality of the recording is the best I've seen for a live concert, the sound excellent - Not quite a live concert in my living room, but the best I'm gonna get...
B00003CY0V|1.0|I find it hard to believe that some people can rate this movie higher than a 1.<br />I'll admit it does have a lot of action -- so if all you want to see are some cool explosions and a cool car chase then sure waste your time on this movie.<br />But in general the plot was not put together at all.  Most of the action seemed completely pointless - as in the director was thinking &quot;Oh this is an action movie - we need to put in a car chase somewhere - hey it can go here.&quot;  The same thing for the nudity.  While I know a big draw to this movie is Halle - it just seemed so pointless - as it really didn't add anything to the scene.  There were several other places where they put shots like that in -- and there wasn't any reason for them.<br />This was one of the few movies that I really wanted to walk out on.  I didn't care about what happened - I just wanted the movie to be over with.<br />There are many many many movies that are much better than this!!
0684859106|3.0|I consider myself to be a skilled baker and have tried the Chocolate Covered Log Cookies, the Lemon Vanilla Bundt Cake, and the Crumb-Topped Cheesecake. The cookies were good but not outstanding (though the recipe has great potential for doctoring up), the cake turned out quite heavy (like a pound cake) and coarsely crumbed, and the cheesecake was ok but the topping was difficult to slice through since it came out really hard.  <br />None of these recipes was very impressive, and I can't say I am very enthused to continue trying the rest.  The recipes look like they would be yummy, but so far, the taste seems otherwise.
B00005JKL8|3.0|Well, we ended up seeing this movie because 'Ocean's Eleven' was sold<br />  out. So we didn't go in with too many expectations, which ensured that<br />  we didn't end up disappointed.<br />  The basic plot is this : Owen Wilson's character, a disillusioned Navy<br />  pilot who wants to quit, strays into the enemy territory and is shot<br />  down. He loses his partner, and must now reach the enemy lines for<br />  his commanding officer (Gene Hackman) to try and save him.<br />  The rest of the movie is about the game of cat and mouse that ensues<br />  as our hero's pursued by two foes : the forces of the enemy, as well<br />  a mercenary employed by them. Also, rescue plans are repeatedly<br />  thwarted by 'complicated international policies'  and 'navy decorum'.<br />  Plus points - Owen Wilson's performance. He brings a likeability to<br />  his character that makes you root for him (even if he seems to do<br />  some rather silly things at times!). Gene Hackman's good, too - but<br />  given his calibre and experience, he can do these roles in his sleep.<br />  There's also some great camerawork and a few good action sequences.<br />  Minuses - The Bosnian situation seems to be treated rather superficially,<br />  and the enemy are almost caricature like 'bad guys'. Also, there are<br />  several sequences which stretch credibility a fair bit, eg the way the<br />  man on the run keeps dashing off in broad daylight and nothing ever<br />  happens to him; similarly a senior office like Hackman's character going<br />  off in person with the rescue team.<br />  All in all, average fare.
B000021YQV|2.0|...this album seems to be lacking something.<br />I usually don't like to trash popular music too badly, because I don't listen to much of it. The Pepsi commercials and \\"we're [messed] up and creepy\\" band names are really enough for me (Hatebreed? Slipknot? Come on. Your killing me!) However, after an insistent friend begged me listen to this album, I succombed to his request, being a person who is always willing to listen to something new.<br />At this point I had already heard \\"Chop Suey\\" and found it hilarious (I mean, I laugh uncontrollably whenever I hear it.) What I found, however, was an album that pretty much sounded like the aforementioned song, only remixed a bit in each different track. Ridiculously low guitar tunings and the \\"rusty nails in throat\\" vocal barks are really becoming a cliche these days. And the supposed Middle Eastern-influences could only be heard on a few tracks, but all they really consisted of were minor key chord progressions with whiney melodic vocals.<br />And song after song, I had trouble telling the difference between them. It seems as if they ran out of material and started recording different lyrics (which were miserably weak, by the way) over the same tracks. If you want to buy this album because you want something loud and fast that you don't have to think about, by all means go for it. But if you are looking for something fresh in modern metal's stagnant musical climate, let me suggest Tool's Lateralus or King Crimson's The ConstruKction of Light. SOAD is largely overrated, but if your just looking to buy the latest fad in the deteriorating metal genre, this album is a must have.
0694013889|5.0|Cute, cute, cute!<br />Perfect way to intrigue and lure the youngster to the pot.<br />I buy this for every parent in the potty-training stage.<br />Highly recommended! Great gift! I journaled our potty trials and tribulations in the back of book, and think my daughter will find this a delight to read when she is older. <br />How fun to even keep as an heirloom book!
B00005MP58|5.0|I was very impressed with this interpretation of one of my favorite books, and I also enjoyed the high quality of the DVD.<br />Normally, I avoid watching film interpretations of books I love, but several factors made me change my mind and watch this production: (1) I heard so many high praises for this miniseries; (2) enough time had passed since I last read Austen's novel that I figured I might be safe from making disappointing comparisons, and (3) I loved Colin Firth so much in _Bridget Jones's Diary_ (another one I finally broke down and watched after having read the book when it first came out), I just had to see him in this role on which his _Bridget_ character was based.  Anyway, I was not at all disappointed but rather completely engaged.  My disappointment came only when the film ended.  A delightful &quot;must-see&quot;!  I agree with previous reviewers that this adaptation stays impressively true to Austen's text.
B00005JKDR|5.0|What a shame that \\"Shrek\\" had an earlier release date than \\"Monsters, Inc.\\" because this is the better movie of the two...\\"Monsters, Inc.\\" is a sheer delight, from start to finish. Cute, I mean REALLY cute, story line about how the monsters actually have a work-a-day world where scaring children is a job for superstars. When a human child makes it to the other side of the bedroom door into the monsters' world, all heck breaks out before the situation can be set aright again...the children in my movie theatre, including 3yr-old Alexander, just squealed with laughter the whole time, as did the adults present, too. And not a fart joke in sight! That's the difference between child and adolescent humor, I guess.  <br />If you want to see the TRUE best cartoon movie  of the year, look no farther than \\"Monsters, Inc.\\"
B00005R2M3|5.0|Shakira is a very sexy lady with excellent music. I have got all of her albums: Pies Descalzos, The Remixes, Donde Estan Los Ladrones, MTV Unplugged and Laundry Serive. they are all great. I eslpecially like Si Te Vas, Estoy Aqui, Whenever Wherever, Eyes Like Yours and No Creo, although every one of her songs are excellent.
B00004XONN|5.0|Radiohead aren't a more intelligent, refined brand of music, and people who have fine tastes may dislike them, and that's not wrong. That being said, I love this album. The booklet is gorgeous and offers extensive art, it's a shame it's been shrunk for CD. The music is very digital and odd, full of girlish warblings for vocals. I'm not sure why I like it exactly, it feels personal, close and deep. Though the lyrics aren't too meaningful and usually nonsensically coded. This disc is preferable to Amnesiac.
6305426651|5.0|To think that Roberto Benigni's \\"Life is Beautiful\\" (La Vita E Bella) \\"trivializes the holocaust\\" misses the entire point and premise of this film.<br />It's not, as some seem to feel, a two part film. It's a seamless account of a man blessed with the ability to laugh at everything and not take himself nor, for that matter, anyone or anything else, very seriously. It's that trait which endears Guido (Roberto Benigni) even to Benigni's critics at the start of the film. In fact it's this gift of humor that allows him to foil a fascist school administrator, confound an imperious public official, befriend a German doctor and win the girl, played by Benigni's real life wife, Nicoletta Braschi.<br />As so often happens in life, just when things are looking up, the world closes in on Guido and his family. They wind up in a Nazi concentration camp, where Guido spends all of his energy trying to shield his young son from the realities of their existence. He tells him, it's all a game and that the winner gets a life sized tank to take home. The rest is a tale of a father's love that translates into self sacrifice for his son.<br />As he (the son/survivor) narrates at the start, \\"This is a very simple story, but a difficult one to tell.\\" Apparently some folks miss the point.<br />Make sure you see the film in its original Italian (with subtitles). It loses much of its emotional energy and charm in the translation.
0780622553|5.0|The best sci-fi movie I have ever seen! I can see why the Matrix may have a more widespread appeal to the popcorn munching masses but Dark city is an out and out classic!<BR>    I have read reviews which criticise the `cold' acting of the cast but disagree enormously because this aforementioned `cold/detatchment' is fundamental to the plot. If the memories of the main characters are so confused that they don't question the fact that they can't recall the daylight hours, it would be absurd to have them portrayed in a more three dimensional manner. I think that Rufus Sewell, Jennifer Connelly and William Hurt convey this state of confused turmoil absolutely brilliantly! I love sci-fi and eagerly devour quality movies in this genre and I cannot understand how this piece of cinematic brilliance can be so under-rated by so many critics!
0679777547|4.0|_The Club Dumas_ takes two mysteries, ties them together, strips them apart, and pits them against each other.  An antique book dealer, Lucas Corso, is commissioned to determine the authenticity of a medieval demonology text, _The Nine Doors of the Kingdom of Shadows_, as well as to shed light on the apparent suicide of a book collector who left behind a chapter of the original manuscript of Alexandre Dumas's _The Three Musketeers_.  Though the cases seem unrelated, Corso soon finds himself drawing parallels between the occult mysteries of _The Nine Doors_ and Dumas's writing career.  As he follows the trails of the two mysteries, he soon discovers that he is surrounded by real-life versions of characters from _The Three Musketeers_ . . . and that he is falling in love with a woman who may be the Devil herself.<br />Perez-Reverte blends the supernatural and the rational into the act of detection as Corso uncovers the secrets of _The Nine Doors_ and its predecessor, the mythical _Delamelonicon_, supposedly written by the Devil.  _The Club Dumas_ possesses a hyper-awareness of itself as a work of literature through its inclusion of myth and story, forgery, and real-life texts, engaging its readers in layer upon layer of analysis regarding what is real and what is fiction in the novel.  Intriguingly complex, _The Club Dumas_ even invites its readers to solve the two mysteries alongside Corso by providing copies of charts, tables, illustrations, and nine hieroglyphic engravings from _The Nine Doors_.  As it alternates between a serial and a crime novel, _The Club Dumas_ lends a sense of adventure to the presumably more often mundane world of book dealing while still standing firm under careful investigation of its literary techniques. Although the book's ending is slightly disappointing and leaves a critical question unanswered - no doubt Perez-Reverte's intention - _The Club Dumas_ is a fascinating study of how literature works, with just enough magic to leave the reader convinced that anything - no matter how fantastic - could happen.
B00000F3KL|4.0|Ridley Scott's film Black Hawk Down does a good job presenting Mark Bowden's book by the same name. After reading the book and seeing this film I was astounded by how little I knew about this particular event.<br />I recall the CNN tape of Corporal Michael Durant held captive by the Somalis and saw the hideous footage of the two American servicemen's bodies being dragged through the streets, but I had little idea that this was the result of a 25-hour battle. I didn't know that we lost 19 of our troops with fifty-seven others wounded.<br />The film starts off with a little backdrop - Somali warlords commandeering the food deliveries being made by the international relief effort. The U.S. stepped in with 20,000 Marines to restore order and order was restored, at least until the Marines were evacuated. As soon as the Marines left Mohammed Aidid an Al Qaeda associate declared war on the U.N. and began to attack the food shipments again.<br />By October of 1993 there was only a few Battalions of Army Rangers and some Delta Force commandos based in Somalia. Washington wanted \\"something done about Aidid,\\" but when the base commander (played by Sam Sheppard) asks for more firepower he's denied. So on October 3rd, 1993 the U.S. forces set out on a mission to capture Aidid at a meeting in Mogadishu. The plan is to cover the four corners with Black Hawk helicopters, while a Ranger Battalion goes in with armored vehicles to take the prisoners. It's supposed to be a no muss, no fuss mission...over and done in a couple of hours.<br />Of course, it didn't happen that way. The Somali militias are well armed with surface to air missiles (RPGs) and automatic weapons. What follows is a twenty-five hour pitched gun battle and that is the focus of this film.<br />The battle scenes are graphically vivid and almost unending...some 80% of the film is compromised of this single engagement. The film is often disturbing, often repulsive - a makeshift \\"operation\\" on a soldier dying from a bullet wound that severed an artery is particularly gruesome.<br />Still, critics who bash this movie for \\"lack of character development\\" and a weak story-line, referring to it as a \\"dressed up documentary,\\" miss the point that THE UNIT IS THE CHARACTER. The battle and the troops response to this unexpected bit of war was the STORY-LINE. The battle itself is the protagonist and the human reaction to massive carnage is the story.<br />It's hard to compare this film to other war movies. It has the terrible reality of the D-Day scenes in \\"Saving Private Ryan,\\" but it's focused entirely on a single horrific event. The battle scenes are grisly, realistic and the acting is first rate. The film depicts an ugly reality, but in my view, it achieves its objective convincingly.bullet wound that severed an artery is particularly gruesome. <br />Still, critics who bash this movie for \\"lack of character development\\" and a weak story-line, referring to it as a \\"dressed up documentary,\\" miss the point that THE UNIT IS THE CHARACTER.

B000024D4R|5.0|When you ask a person on the street what they're favorite Pink Floyd album is, more often that not you'll often hear about either 'Darkside of the moon' or 'The wall', for some reason, but 'Animals' is mine.<BR>This is Pink Floyd at they're finest, even though it's not much of a collaborative effort, Roger Waters and company do take you on a journey into another world, which is what Pink Floyd is best at.<BR>&quot;Dogs&quot; is my personal favorite on the album, although this 10 minute plus song with extened keyboard solos might irritate some people, others feed off of the energy that's put into this track. <BR>&quot;Sheep&quot; is also another stand out, opening with some pretty tasty bass guitar riffs provided by Mr. Waters.<BR>This is a great album, and a must have for anyone who already owns the above mentioned 'Darkside...' and 'Wall'.
B000002J03|5.0|This album was a favorite through my high school years (in the 80's), and was one of the first CD's I bought.  It was stolen about ten years ago, and I decided to replace it.  Listening to this disc again, the songs still stand up as classics.  The only one that doesn't is Moby Dick -- after Neil Peart, Lars Ulrich, and other superstar drummers, John Bonham's solo turn sounds a little silly.  Other than that, this disc should be in everyone's collection.
B000001ELR|5.0|'Creatures of the night' is KISS's finest album to date.<BR>The entire album from front to back is fantastic, and if you like heavy rock music, you will love this album.<BR>Side-A begins with the title track, and the thunderous drums of Eric Carr, and the album just doesn't stop, hitting you with the following &quot;Saint and sinner&quot;, the Led Zeppelin influenced &quot;Keep me comin'&quot;, and the dark &quot;Rock 'n roll hell&quot;.<BR>Side-B begins with &quot;I love it loud&quot;, which is a heavy dose of thunder and roar from Gene Simmons. Following after is &quot;I still love you&quot; which is an early power-ballad, before the days of the late 80's where power-ballads become cliche', and it stands strong. &quot;Killer&quot; is probably the album's weakest song, but is by no means a bad track, and 'Creatures..' finishes with &quot;War machine&quot; which is just as heavy as &quot;I love it loud&quot;.<BR>This album is incredible, and is very overlooked in the rock era. Unlike later KISS albums, this one is KISS sounding original, and not like a poorman's glam band or whatever it was that they were trying to do in the later 80's.<BR>If you purchase a KISS album, let it be 'Creatures of the night'.
B00003CXI1|3.0|(Note: this review is of the movie as released in theaters, not of the DVD, which promises to come out with several more hours of deleted scenes.)<br />I just saw HP for the second time in the theaters yesterday, after practically memorizing all four books.  My brother and I were quite disappointed, while my mother enjoyed it.  Probably because she'd never read the books.<br />The difficulty I had with the movie is that it made *such* an effort to be true to the book, that the 90% of the book that was cut for time was all the more obvious and disappointing.  The end result was a set of disjointed scenes that contained the bare minumum of information that the screenwriters could convey and still advance the plot.<br />Most of the character development (and actually, several of the *characters*) was cut for time.  All dialogue was so intent on getting the needed information to the audience in as short a time as possible, that the conversations seemed forced - quite unlike the natural flow of the book's dialogue.  And the humor - one of the biggest strengths of the books - was eliminated almost entirely (Fred and George, for example, had a grand total of three short scenes and two jokes).  The most touching scenes of the book (Dumbledore's &quot;she loved you&quot; exchange with Harry at the end, and Hagrid's gift of the pictures of Harry's parents) were present, but rushed and not developed, and so they carried no emotional impact.  Particularly since the movie cut most of the information that would have gotten across just how starved for love Harry had been with the Dursleys.<br />As for the acting, it was passable.  Harry's actor needs some work.  Ron and Hermione are well played, as are Snape, Quirell, and Hagrid.  Dumbledore (what little we saw of him) was well-played, but seemed considerably more tired than I pictured.  I saw no twinkle in his eyes, and he wasn't nearly as inspiring as in the books.<br />Most of my problems relate to the cutting, which was of course necessary because of time constraints.  I just hate to see what they'll do to Book 4..
B000002OX7|5.0|I'm not a very big Who fan, but I truly love this album. <BR>I first purchased this album while in high school, and quickly fell in love with it, and even today I still listen to it quite often.<BR>I'm very happy that it wasn't a concept album, (or 'Rock opera' as Pete Townsend likes to call concept albums), because I've never been happy with Who concepts. 'Tommy' bored me to tears, and I wasn't paterically found of 'Quadrophenia' either.<BR>'Who's next' though, is a masterpiece. Songs such as \\"Baba O'Riley\\" (commonly refered as \\"Teenage wasteland\\" by people), \\"The song is over\\", and \\"Behind blue eyes\\" are simply amazing. <BR>Even John Entwistle's contribuiton \\"My wife\\" is great too. This is an album that one can listen completely through, without skipping over an tracks, which is commonly becoming rare these days.<BR>The only thing I'm not too thrilled about is on this remaster, Pete Townsend added in other songs that weren't part of the original album. While to the common consumer wants 'more for your money' I would rather of had the original album, which ended with \\"Won't get fooled again\\", instead of about seven extra songs added, but hey, I guess you could always hit the stop button.
B00003CXBK|5.0|a great anime.. interesting ideas and creatures.. most of the things works great in this film... will be one that i would recommoned the most.. i like the idea where the boars are one of the powerful characters in the film as they are usually seen as stupid and useless.. a great film..
B00005YTFG|5.0|I loved this movie, it was fresh, funny, and kept reminding you that you are watching a movie, which is bold, but they pull it off. The best art is that which sparks controversy, and this one has to be one of the most controversial pieces of art from the movie industry. I've noticed that pretty much all the bad reviews were from men so I'm guessing they can't stand the fact that this film was made to be that, a film. Moulin Rouge wanted the boundry between the audience and the story to be prominent- sometimes pulling you in just to push you right back out-toying with the audience. Films that are strong enough to do this are amazing to watch emotionaly.
0345409671|5.0|This book is one of Anne's best. The plot with heaven and hell, God and satan are realistic. It kinda makes you wonder if that is not what is really going on in the world today.
B0000025RI|5.0|Face the facts...Thriller is not only the greatest achievement in Michael Jackson and Quincy Jones' careers,it is also a groundbreaking milestone in music today. I mean just setting aside the truckloads of awards and the records it broke..the music is timeless. Listening to &quot;Beat It&quot; still gives me goosebumps,today,as it did when it came out,same goes for,&quot;Human Nature&quot; possibly the most melodic tune ever and one of my favorite songs. Even a more overlooked song like &quot;P.Y.T.&quot;,is outstanding just because the pure emotion of Michael's voice makes you want to dance and sing with him like you really feel what he's saying. &quot;Lady in My Life&quot;,is a quiet storm number that has Michael singing tender one moment and bursting with emotion the next. I could go on and on about every song on this album,but what more can be said? If you're one of the only people on this planet that doesn't own this or hasn't owned it before...get it...music and an artist doesn't get any better than this.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This movie is one of those movies you are gonna have to watch twice. After you see the end you are gonna stop and say what the [heck]! The visuals display and filming is amazing it adds to the feel of the movie. It is one of those must see movies if you like movies like \\"The Game\\" (If you have not seen this one it is another one worth seeing) you will enjoy this movie. You never lose intrest while keeping up with the story. you probably are not gonna want to watch this one with the kids but it is rather enjoyable. i have this one on my list to buy right now and hope you at least will spend a couple bucks to rent it if you are iffy about buying this one to add to your collection.
6304826133|3.0|Sylvester Stallone plays the fat sad sack of a sheriff of the fictitious town of Garrison, New Jersey.  Essentially a bedroom community for NYPD officers who managed to end run regulations requiring that cops actually live in their city, Garrison seethes with the underworld corruption bred by crooked cops led by Ray Donlan (Harvey Keitel).  Stallone's sheriff Hefflin - overweight, deaf in one ear and not entirely spontaneous - was the perfect man to guard the \\"town full of cops\\" whom the script posits as at least mildly corrupt from the start of the film.  (If you've heard the old line about foxes guarding the hen house, \\"Cop Land\\" has Stallone playing the opposite - the chicken keeping tabs on the foxes).  Despite an intensive probe by IA Lt. Moe Tilden (Robert De Niro) authorities haven't been able to stick anything to any one of the town's residents.  A lucky break occurs when one the cops, Ray \\"Superboy\\" Babich (Michael Rappaport) is seen apparently committing suicide following a police shooting gone bad.  (Hinting at the Diallo shooting which hadn't even happened yet, Babich takes a potshot at a car thinking its passengers are about to shoot at him.  When the soon killed driver and passenger are found to possess, not a single gun, but at least one crutch, and responding EMS won't allow on-scene officers to plant incriminating guns on them, Babich panics and leaps off a bridge.)  Saving and secreting Babich away to Garrison, Donlan and crew work to get Babich a new identity and a ticket out of NY.  Hefflin, however, picks up on some obvious signs of the Babich conspiracy and, after being taken aside by Tilden (who visits Garrison during Babich's \\"funeral\\") decides to crack the conspiracy.<br />\\"Cop Land\\" was a disappointing story - building up on intricate details that don't so much as beef up the main plot (about saving PO Babich) as reveal how thin it was and why it was so important to keep the audience distracted from it.  The script tosses in Ray Liotta as Figgis, the only one of Garrison's corrupt cops that gets along with Hefflin (the rest of town merely tolerates him), though it's clear that Liotta is only around to say stuff about Heffin that script can't bring Hefflin to say about himself.  (From Fig, we learn of Hefflin's dream to become a cop, a dream crushed when Hefflin went deaf in one ear; we also learn how Heflin lost his hearing when he pulled a beautiful woman (Annabella Sciorra) from a sunken car.  Needless to say, Hefflin does not get the girl).  The script gives Fig a nasty drug habit (imagine Liotta's coke-fueled haze from the last half-hour of \\"Goodfellas\\" and you'll get the idea) and some other dubious baggage, but none of that matters when Fig tells Hefflin what nobody else dares to say aloud.  Because the characters promise so much it's painful when the film comes to a screeching halt - in a gunfight between a battered Hefflin and Donlan (when plans to \\"save\\" Babich become too complicated, and everybody realizes it would be easier if he just disappeared).  De Niro's character is completely superfluous - there to pump Hefflin for action and also to slam him down when Heff doesn't move fast enough.  The film doesn't even look like it's sure about when its set - witness the horrible hairstyle they give some of the leads.  Still, despite the over-hyped storyline and the underused talent, you do feel like you've seen enough to remind you that it ain't easy being a cop.

B000002UAR|5.0|3 years. That's all it took for the Beatles to go from cute teenyboopers to true artists. Drugs have done good things, people. Take a look at this album! All kidding aside, this is probably their best stuff. The band sounds more like an original band, and not like something from the 50's and early 60's. There's hard rock, classical, Indian music, pop, and even electronica in this album. \\"Taxman\\" starts this album. George's best work. A song against federal tax and it's also pretty damn catchy! \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" is a pure masterpiece. Great string arrangement. \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" is very hallocegenic, with some backwards guitar. \\"Love You To\\" is raga and pschycdelic at the same time. \\"Here, There & Everywhere\\" is kinda boring, but nice. \\"Yellow Submarine\\" is just...weird. Good, though. \\"She Said, She Said\\" is a great song from John. A happy rocker. \\"Good Day Sunshine\\" is too happy for me, but then there's \\"And Your Bird Can Sing,\\" which is another excellent tune. Nice riffs. Then there's the nice ballad \\"For No One.\\" Very touching. Then, my 3rd favorite on the album, \\"Doctor Robert.\\" Crazy rocking tune. Cool lyrics. Then there's George's 3rd tune on the album, \\"I Want To Tell You.\\" Happy and dissonant at the same time. There's some weird chord in the song, which really shocked me. \\"Got To Get You Into My Life\\" is a good song with some kick [rear] horns. Then.....the best track, \\"TOMORROW NEVER KNOWS\\"! WOAH! What the hell is this? Crazy stuff...Great album.
6305388458|4.0|Crowd:  &quot;We want the Messiah&quot;<br />Brian's Mum: &quot;There's no messiah in here.  It's just a mess.&quot; [or something similar]<br />When the Python's first got together (in what was to be provisionally called 'Baron Took's Flying Circus', after the scriptwriter Barry Took who died last month), John Cleese insisted that the humour would not be based on puns.  Ten years later, he must have been disappointed by bits of the 'Brian' script.  By 1978 the Pythons had split totally as a TV formation, but came together for the occasional film.  The humour overall wasn't as brilliant, and nothing like as experimental, but it still had its moments.<br />'Brian' was conceived, like Grail, as a series of sketches, which meant that the Pythons could use the rules of sketch production to their advantage, particularly when it solved budgetary problems.  (In what other genre could you find a movie where the main actors get reused in different parts again and again and again?)  But many of the sketches don't quite work -- e.g. 'Shekel for an ex-leper' could have been funnier, and 'Crucifixion?  Good.' just isn't long enough to qualify as a true Python sketch, despite the brilliance of the concept and Palin's acting.  To my mind, the truly magnificent Python sketch in this film, which easily ranks in the Python's Top 10, is John Cleese's  'Stoning' piece, in which he plays a Pharisee mixed up with an awful lot of English public schoolmaster.  This same schoolmasterliness also emerges in the almost-as-wonderful 'Romanes Eunt Domus' sketch, but you need to have endured at least a couple of years of Latin teaching to get the best out of that one.<br />I heard Michael Palin talk about the first Brian draft in the fall of 1977 up at Oxford.  He was visiting Brasenose, his old college, and he spent the Saturday evening in the JCR telling whoever wanted to listen about 'Ripping Yarns' and this wonderful new plot called 'Brian'.  I don't remember much of what he said, but I recall being slightly disappointed by the movie when I eventually saw it two years later.<br />I'm not a great believer, but I think the christian church have some justification in complaining about one element.  Overall the Pythons do a pretty good job of steering Brian in a parallel path to Jesus.  It's only when Brian gets put against the wall among all the soothsayers and prophets that he comes too close.  If Brian isn't supposed to be the christ, then it's unlikely he'd be telling parables about the talents, or a man with two sons, or the lilies in the field etc.  (Goodness knows what uproar would have occurred if the Pythons had tried to do the life of a prophet from another religion.)<br />Despite Eric Idle's 'Always look on the bright side' eventually being adopted by many soccer crowds, the movie ends on an anti-climax, sotto voce, rather like Mark's Gospel.  The Pythons don't even allow Gilliam to explore the afterlife via animation.<br />The Grail is the funnier of the two movies, but that's because it is entirely silly.  Brian has a couple of serious points to make -- that you should work it all out for yourself, and that factions shouldn't devote all their energies to fighting those whose beliefs come closest to their own.  Two serious points in one movie is enough for me.being slightly disappointed by the movie when I eventually saw it two years later.  <br />I'm not a great believer, but I think the christian church have some justification in complaining about one element.

B00005OAIE|1.0|John Mayer is Dave-Matthews lite, and given the fact that I'm not a particularly huge fan of Dave Matthews that isn't saying much to me.  This is girls music to me, let me rephrase that, teenage girls music.  It's so indisputably awful, that only white teenage girls could listen to this and not want to throw up.  All he writes about is love, and while that may be off the beaten angst path, that doesn't make it good.  He's just spouting off inane lyrics that really mean nothing at all, and once you actually try and draw meaning from them, they mean even less.  As you can gather, I despise John Mayer and all he stands for.  I like upbeat music, I like Phantom Planet and other power pop groups, I can even stomach a little Dashboard Confessional, I don't know why.  But John Mayer is pure fluff, and it's terrible fluff at that.  I am done.

I will admitt that the majority of the class was only going to get out of school for the afternoon, but I can honestly say that I absolutly love this movie. After watching it I was touched. <BR>I think that one of the things that makes this movie so enjoyable (other than the great acting, amazing sound track, and the brillant storyline) is how we can all relate to Amelie in one way or another... At least I found that. I urge you to see the movie to see if you agree. <BR>This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and I can't wait to watch it over and over once it's finally realesed!!
B000002IU9|3.0|With all the hype surrounding Manowar being &quot;true metal&quot; and the real place where power metal began, I felt compelled to check them out.  This album was the one most recommended to me, and although some of the songs are utterly boding and uninspiring, others show why this band has the reputation it does.  The opening song, the 28-minute masterpiece, is not quite on par with songs like Symphony X's &quot;Divine Wings Of Tragedy&quot;, but it's sure up there.  With some very awesome instrumentation, it makes that half hour go away like its not even there.  The rest of the songs range from great to cr@p, with the better ones being &quot;Spirit Horse of the Cherokee&quot;, and &quot;Master of the Wind, both of which are super.  &quot;The Demon's Whip&quot; and &quot;Power of Thy Sword&quot; are pretty good, but the rest sound like fillers to me, and don't do much of anything special.  I would buy this album for the opening track alone, and the rest is solid, but not amazing.  I'm sure there are better Manowar albums, since they flash some real kickass talent on here from time to time.
0743420373|3.0|There are some helpful bits of information in this book, not the least of which is the recognition that the vast majority of America's wealthy are not featured on &quot;Lives of the Rich and Famous.&quot;  Most of the wealthy are actually fairly common folk with a propensity to be frugal and invest.  This is helpful information for the rest of us who have always believed that to have a great deal of money, you either had to be very lucky, inherit a windfall, or have a really high paying career.  Turns out that's not necessarily the case.  This book does a good job of helping to dispell some of the myths, such as &quot;high income earners are the most wealthy.&quot;  This book points out that high income earners are also prodigious spenders, and often their net worth is well below what it ought to be!<br />The down side to this book is that it repeats itself a great deal.  You learn over and over again about the spoiled children of the wealthy, and their reliance on &quot;Outpatient Economic Care.&quot;  You learn over and over again about the fact that roughly 2/3 of the wealthy are private business owners.  It is also a little data intensive, which might have been useful for the authors in writing the book, but really is somewhat extraneous for the rest of us.<br />This is good perspective building material, but be prepared for the redundancy.
B000002JNN|4.0|AC/DC RULE MAN. They are the best band that I've ever heard. Their music is so cool the guitars full of rich sound and drums heavy and loud. But the only problem is the singing it sounds like the guy has a gravel voice. By far the two best songs on the album are THUNDERSTRUKE and ROCK YOUR HEART OUT. Both song's Rock. They both have great tunes full of rich sounds of guitar and drums. This is my first AC/DC cd but I'm sure not my last. If you like AC/DC I suggest you get KISS or TWISTED SISTER they are both really cool bands. Just keep on Rocken and Rolling AC/DC.
B000002KD9|5.0|Just as Neil Young's ferocious second album was a dramatic contrast to his folksy debut, so is his third album, After The Gold Rush, a complete contrast to that. Certainly, his work on Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young's Deja Vu album may have lead him to dip his toe back into the waters of these folksy rockers, and he does a very fine job of it here. Some of his best soft, gentle, rolling acoutic numbers are here - Tell Me Why, When You Dance I Can Really Love - are here, complete with splendid rolling acoustic guitars and beautiful vocal harmonies. The beautiful, spirited title track is also a standout, with its gentle piano work, and perhaps Neil's finest vocal. The only real rocker here is Southern Man, one of Neil's most famous songs, and a fine little rocking protest - sparking Lynyrd Skynyrd's famous comeback in Sweet Home Alabama - with a spirited jam at the end of the song. Another highlight is the inspired run through the country standard Oh, Lonesome Me. Although, aside from Southern Man, the longish guitar jams that made Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere so great are completely absent from this album, we get instead Neil's masterful folk ditties, which are just as satisfying. Another major revelation - indeed, perhaps the highlight of the album, and certainly it's distinction - is the uniformly excellent piano work. Nils Lofgren - along with Neil himself and others - turn in fine performances on the instrument, lending such songs as the title track and Southern Man a distinctive air. Overall, one of the man's best efforts.
B00005R2M3|4.0|One of the things I love about this CD is the mix of influences--Latin pop, US pop (she's listened to Alanis Morrisette a few too many times, but since I like Alanis I'll forgive her) and Arabic traditional and pop music. It's really surprising to me that people don't mention the Middle Eastern influences in &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; and &quot;Eyes Like Yours.&quot; Hearing a beladi rythym played on that odd hollow-sounding South American wind instrument on Whenever, Wherever is odd, but it certainly gets my hips shaking!  Lots of fun for belly dancers and anyone who likes good, danceable pop--including my fiance, who is *really* not fond of Arabic pop but can't stop playing Shakira's Latina take on it.
B00003CXTG|1.0|I hope you were not one of the unlucky millions that lost three precious hours on this film.My condolences and apologies to those who did.Now,we all must get on with our lives.
0425170349|5.0|This is quite possibly the best book I have ever read (or will ever read). The plot is gradually revealed, but not too gradually. People often criticize Tom Clancy for using too much detail, but I think that the detail is what make his books so unique. He has just the right amount to keep you going. He describes all situations well and you know exactly what he's talking about with the words he uses. Almost all types of readers can get something out of this book. There's something about the life of soldiers, terrorists, an ex-KGB agent, and a facility in Kansas. But I don't want to reveal too much. Uncovering the plot is one of the joys of reading Clancy's books. It is a bit long, but the content is definitely worth it!
B00003CXTG|5.0|I loved this movie.I am a romance at heart and I loved the story that went on between Ben,Kate,and Josh characters.The acting was great and the directing by Michael Bay was fantastic as well.I think that the story line was well thought out,allowing the viewers to get to know the characters before the morning of Dec 7th.I also enjoyed the fact that the movie didn't end after the attack on Dec 7th but rather continued and showed some of the US's attacks.Great movie and it's worth three hours.
6305363668|4.0|It is popular opinion that the movie Blade Runner was altogether better than the novel on which it was based, Philip K. Dick's 'Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep'. Quite frankly, having read the book before seeing the movie, it seemed quite disappointing to me, when compared with the original. The importance more interesting, philosophical subjects of the novel was cut down meaningfuly; namely, the philosophical consequences of the idea of a humanoid robot that would be superior to man himself in any way. J.R Isidore (transformed into the very minor character of J.F Sebastian), Buster Friendly, Rick's wife and her eery mood-dialer, and most of all the electric sheep, the most wonderful symbolism in the novel. These were all removed. The idea of the artifiacial animals was only hinted, as was the unsolved question of whether Deckard himself is a replicant or not.<br />But IN SPITE OF ALL THAT -- when considered individually by its own right, as it should be (it's no accident that the film and the novel have different names!) Blade Runner is still one of the masterpieces of sci-fi cinema. Harrison Ford - though he plays the exact same character he always does - fits right in. Ridley Scott's directing is superb. His biggest stroke of genius is in his relating to a theme that was very subtle and weak in the novel - the film noir atmosphere. Scott did an incredible job creating a futuristic classic film noir, right down to the electronic-film noir musical score.<br />As an action and an atmosphere movie, Blade Runner is one of the best sci-fi films ever made. Highly recommended for all fans of the genre. Reading the novel is completely unnecessary to appreciate the film.
B00003CXTG|5.0|I think this movie was wonderful.It gave me a better understanding of the horrific attack on Pearl Harbor.Even though the movie was three hours long,it didn't seem too long.At the end of the movie I was left in a awe.It was truly amazing.
B00000DGUG|4.0|While many people were disappointed by this album, I liked it. Actually I think this is the lady's best album, though there are some fillers here - thus the 4 stars instead of 5. The cause of disappointment is clearly the discontinuation of Jagged Little Pill's style and the more complex structure with not so adorable songs that are hard to catch and love.<br />When I heard Thank You on the radio I liked it from the first moment and I thought if the rest of the album is half as good as Thank You it is OK. Then I bought Junkie and was completely confused because I didn't get what I wanted to have. It was a complete departure from Pill and something harder to understand. This album isn't about former lovers, this album isn't mainly about raging, this album is the enlightenment of Alanis Morrisette - with some raging about herself. This process may be welcomed and may be hated, I am one of those who welcomed Alanis' change.<br />There are many standout tracks. The first track Front Row is my favorite from this album. It is a complex song with so many lyrics tucked into it that it is hard to follow it but I got the meaning and the mood of it after 3-4 listenings and since then it has been my favorite. The second track Baba is a shocker. It is about absolvation, how the people want to reach this state and how much money they want to pay (\\"How much will this cost guru? How much longer till you completely absolve me?\\") for this. The Ave Maria lines in the end put goose bumps on my back every time I listen to this song. Thank You is well-known by everyone, I think it is Alanis' best song ever. Are You Still Mad is a lighter and subtler version of You Oughta Know. Sympathetic Character is about a lover and a song about keeping feelings in (\\"I have as much rage as you do, I lived as much hell as you did but I kept mine bubbling under - for you\\"). That I Would Be Good is a kinda sad song but I like it, especially because it has a relaxed feeling to it. The Coach is as complexas Front Row and a song hard to like but after some listenings it is a catchy song. The next 6 songs are fillers in my opinion. So Pure is the second best track, with good lyrics and a light mood. Joining You is in the old Pill style and a very good song with a catchy chorus. Heart Of The House is about a girl's feelings towards her mother and is in fact a sad song. Your Congratulations is a good ending song to this album.<br />All in all this is a good album, though it couldn't be as popular as Pill because most of the people couldn't relate to the songs. Not that popularity is my way of thinking about my favorite singers and that's why I liked this album. It is about Alanis' feelings about herself and the world. This is a love it or hate it album and I love it. But I think everyone should give it a try. It is worth it.
0451191153|5.0|Even though I disagree with Rand's philosophy, you can still learn a great deal about being a person, about not selling your soul. Altriusm doesn't necessarily mean you will sell your soul... because of the way she distorts the true definition of altriusm and self-sacrifice, she garners a lot more attention.... perhaps it was deliberate, I don't know. <br />Even though I have such strong disagreements at the foundation level, the secondary issues of her philosophy are valuable.<br />The part I enjoyed the most about the book were the conversations amongst the characters. The characters are psychologically developed to the utmost... in one sense, it's almost ridiculous at how correct their judgments on one another are, but it is still within the realm of feasibility.
0060920084|1.0|Bill Bryson's lazy shallow 1989 cheap shot of a debut wilts to his exceptional work of just a few years later. Bryson is a funny provocative man - the thoughtful 'A Walk in the Woods' & the informed ecstatic 'In A Sunburned Country' are excellent books, even better on tape/CD as read by the author. (Bill Bryson is a superb reader - I highly recommend you pick up any of the audio versions.)<br />But 13 years on, Bryson may regret \\"The Lost Continent.\\" It's a simple tale of a European expatriate eager to trash America, driving (never walking or meeting) to any city/town/site that might confirm his set opinions and match his sloppy travel planning. It's a tale of a very silly ignorant man.<br />It's interesting that a writer who condemns fast-pace fast-food instant-gratification American culture drops so many phrases like \\"I drove on...\\", \\"Driving on...,\\" \\"Within minutes I reached...\\". These phrases don't happen sometimes - they happen with every other page. This is obviously the work of a writer who spends too much time driving. How American. Even in his best writing, Bill Bryson is not a physical guy. He gets his best material from research, and mostly, just talking with the locals. In this book, he mocks roadside sad-eyes but barely lifts a finger to question, talk or ask. He doesn't give the locals a chance. Worse, Bryson wastes a lot of ink comparing TV commercial excess with his boring truck-pit surroundings. Like TV was ever about reality?...<br />What did he expect? I myself have driven many thousands of miles in Nowhereville, Boondock, Hicktown. In fact, I've driven most the routes Bryson took. Yes, there isn't much culture, yes it's mostly truck pits, sure it's hard to find good food. But I never expected more - I knew what to expect, and took my experience for what it was. I was in the 'nowhere zone' of USA highways - I accepted it as just that. Bryson takes those experiences and condemns the nation.<br />Bill Bryson saves his worst pitch for the last 2 pages. He writes \\"Well, that was my trip more or less.\\" (This is as bad as a high-school student writing \\"in conclusion...\\") He then writes \\"I saw pretty much everything I wanted to see and a good deal I didn't.\\" This says more about the author and his sloppy aimless travel path. What would you say about a tourist who drove through Santa Fe but didn't bother to experience Navajo Nation? What would you say about a guy who drove through the (winter-closed) North Rim Grand Canyon but didn't bother to check unique Sedona Arizona? Or a bizarre clutz who checks out non-descript flat Pueblo Colorado, makes a point to see Aspen, and - like Inspector Clouseu - gets snowed under. Bryson did not see Denver or even Boulder - he just saw podunk towns. He didn't see Seattle, he didn't see Zion or Bryce Canyon, he didn't check out San Francisco, hike Lake Tahoe, experience Yosemete, or even climb a hill in Yellowstone.<br />What would you say about that travel-writer? A jackass. Obviously Bill Bryson has come a long long way in the decade since. Check out his wonderful recent stuff - skip this.s.

B000002IST|4.0|It's no secret that many Genesis fans can't stand when they go the pop route with songs like \\"Invisible Touch\\" and \\"I Can't Dance.\\"  It's also no secret that many Genesis fans like these tunes as well as the longer, more progressive tracks that Genesis became known for in the 70s.  _We Can't Dance_, Phil Collins' last studio album with the band, offers a little bit of pop and a little bit of prog with mixed results.<br />The album works best when it is exploring the darker themes that Genesis sometimes toys with.  Opening up with the emotional (and relatively underrated) \\"No Son of Mine,\\" the album sets up a somber mood with the heavy subject matter of a son walking out on his family only to return later and find that he is not welcomed any longer.  Collins sings his heart out on this one and the chorus is one of Genesis' best.  Genesis satirizes televangelists on the next track, \\"Jesus He Knows Me\\", which now seems a little dated and silly.  Consider this the \\"Illegal Alien\\" of the album - you have to be in the right kind of mood to enjoy it.  \\"Driving the Last Spike\\" is a sprawling piece that shows Genesis still knows how to write longer pieces with smart arrangements and excellent guitar/keys/drums interplay.  Other highlights include \\"Dreaming While You Sleep\\" (which explores the psychological effects of a man who committed a hit-and-run and lives in paranoia and fear while his victim lies in a coma), \\"Fading Lights\\", and \\"Tell Me Why.\\"  The slower songs are hit-and-miss.  \\"Hold on my Heart\\" and \\"Since I've Lost You\\" are very poignant, but \\"Never A Time\\" sounds like a \\"Throwing It All Away\\" retread.  <br />Since it looks like Phil Collins will probably not be returning to make another Genesis album with Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford, _We Can't Dance_ stands as a fitting way to end an era.  It mixes both the commercial side and progressive side of Genesis.  If you love the commercial side of Genesis, you'll most likely love this album.  It you prefer the progressive side of Genesis, but don't mind the pop side, you'll also probably like the album.  The only people who may not like _We Can't Dance_ are the hardcore Gabriel-era Genesis fans...but even they should give this one a shot.  They'd probably be surprised at how much they'll like the majority of it.
0789723107|5.0|This book really made me look at web sites in a completely different way.  While surfing, we've all come across sites that we don't quite \\"get\\" right away; usually we don't spend more than a couple of seconds trying to figure them out before we move on to something else. As the book says - web users are like sharks: if they don't keep moving, they'll die. Of course you don't want people leaving your site because they can't be bothered to figure it out. \\"Don't Make Me Think\\" explains exactly why some sites don't work and how to fix them. <br />One of my favorite things is that Krug asks you to look at actual web pages (pictured in the book in full color) and try to figure out what they are about and how to use them. You become a usability test subject! Turn the page and he gives you his ideas about why it works or doesn't work.<br />Another aspect of the book you may find useful is the guidelines for holding your own usability tests. It's can be a much simpler process than you might think. These sections include a sample test script, the kind of tools and environment you'd need, and URLs to more helpful stuff (including a confidentiality/permissions agreement you can ask a test subject to sign). <br />Oh, and the book was very readable, quite funny, and to the point - it only took a few hours to read.  The size of the book would actually have been disappointing given the price if the book hadn't have been so useful and interesting.

B000002BQK|5.0|Words cannot really express how much this album means to me. It is UP THERE with my favorite albums of ALL TIME. Yes she comes close to Janet Jackson's \\"Rhythm Nation\\" and \\"The Velvet Rope.\\" How people could complain about \\"Buttefly\\" I do not know! This is really a work of art from beginning to finish. I love Mariah and have since the early 90's but this album really got my attention. Maybe it's her incorporation of soft R&B to the scene. \\"Outside\\" is my favorite song on the whole album amd my favorite song of her's period. You really just have to hear it to believe it. A lot of these numbers are relaxing and have a smoothe vibe to them...those include the soulful and peaceful \\"Fourth of July\\", \\"Breakdown\\" ft. Bone Thugs 'n Harmony and the Missy \\"Misdamenor\\" Produced hip hop-ish (but still mellow) \\"Babydoll.\\" She also does a remake of Prince's \\"The Beautiful Ones\\" which features Sisqo of Dru Hill...just incredible! \\"Whenever You Call\\" is another favorite but it feels wierd with just her singing it and should've been a duet (which she included in \\"#1's\\"...which features Brian McKnight. Beautiful!) \\"My All\\" is her best soulful melancholy work to date and is really one of her signature lyrics. Simply stunning it's just incredible with the background acoustic/spanish style-like guitars in the background. \\"The Roof\\" should've been released in the US as it's a great mix of Pop and Hip-Hop. She really is good as what she does and this is my favorite album of her's since \\"MTV Unplugged.\\" You MUST MUST MUST purchase this album...as you will ***NOT*** be dissapointed one bit...and if u are u can yell at me but I don't care because this album is one of the 90's Best. Overall grade: A+(+)
