B001KVZ6HK|5.0|\\"The Avengers\\" is brilliant. This is the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" of comic book movies -- colorful, epic and emotionally powerful.<br /><br />This is one of those rare movies that just gets it RIGHT in every way, weaving together half a dozen superhero movies into one shining whole. You need to have seen some of them to understand what's going on (\\"Captain America: The First Avenger,\\" \\"Thor,\\" \\"Iron Man\\" and \\"Iron Man 2\\") but it's well worth the effort.<br /><br />Loki (Tom Hiddleston) suddenly teleports into SHIELD headquarters, and immediately steals the Tesseract before the entire compound collapses. He also brainwashes a bunch of people -- including master archer Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) -- into being his minions.<br /><br />So Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) decides to call in a group of people with very special skills to stop Loki and get back the Tesseract. --  Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow, (Scarlett Johansson) and Bruce Banner/The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). Thor (Chris Hemsworth) also LITERALLY drops in on them, and reveals that Loki is commanding a monstrous army that the Tesseract will allow into our world.<br /><br />But even after they barely manage to capture Loki, they soon discover that the trickster god is always a few steps ahead of them -- and he's even manipulating them against each other. This fragmented group of volatile heroes must learn to fight together, or face a world where Loki and his Chitauri army reign supreme.<br /><br />\\"The Avengers\\" is the movie that Michael Bay would make if he weren't a racist misogynist hack. It has massive explosions, a flying battleship and a city-smashing finale that involves giant armored eels.... but it also slows down sometimes to allow us quiet moments where the characters can grow, like Barton and Romanoff's talk. It's understated, but powerful (\\"I have red in my ledger. I'd like to wipe it out\\").<br /><br />But since Joss Whedon wrote AND directed this, it's also a witty, tight script with lots of deliciously funny lines (\\"Doth Mother know you weareth her drapes?\\") and moments (the Hulk's assault on Loki).  He knows how to intertwine action and character development, and his explosive, kinetic battle sequences always end with a sense of bittersweetness. There are losses, and there is pain.<br /><br />Jackson, Downey, Johansson, Hemsworth and Evans all slip smoothly into their familiar roles; the white-hot Renner gets fleshed out nicely as the quiet, stoic Barton, and Ruffalo is surprisingly good as the nerdy, fragile man with a \\"rage monster\\" seething under the surface. And Hiddleston is devastatingly good as Loki, who is now desperate to make himself a god-king, but still shows occasional flickers of regret and uncertainty.<br /><br />There are a few changes to the familiar characters, and they work -- particularly Captain America, who is a bit angsty about the loss of his old life. And it's a nice touch that the Avengers don't really get along at first, since all their personalities are so different. It takes a massive shock for them to realize, \\"We NEED to work together, or everything is lost.\\"<br /><br />If I had to criticize something, it would be that the first ten minutes are rather rushed, and Captain America's costume looks more cartoonish (unlike his grittier WWII uniform, which combined patriotism AND practicality).<br /><br />\\"The Avengers\\" joins together a bunch of separate stories into one wild, explosive epic -- a brilliant story that sets a new benchmark for superhero movies.

0345803485|1.0|If you read the book you know will know what I mean about murmuring - I've never read so many people murmur or whisper in such a repetitive way.  I read this because I wanted to know what the hype was all about and really disappointed.  This is one instance where the movie has the potential to be better than the book!!  And the banter emails that they have back and forth - so annoying.  I'm wondering - who do you picture playing the characters of Ana and Christian?

B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this series and the single movie that's been made so far. I found this edition juuuuuust slightly not as strong as the start of the series, or maybe it wasn't as knock-out-powerful after such a sensational opening. Still, well worth my time and money. Great stuff.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|colorful and fun.  kids love it.  can't go wrong with zombies and samurai in one!  works well on kindle fire and droid 4.
B000CPGZHA|5.0|A fun show with a performer who actually seems to be having fun herself.<br /><br />Kylie manages to squeeze in most of her big hits, and stays true to her formula of putting her dancers in the most bizarre costumes possible, engaging the audience, and just plain looking great.<br /><br />Well worth the price.
B005LAIIRQ|4.0|If not for a few unrealistic camera shots this could have been a 5 star movie the shot the most unbelievable was at a camp fire where you could see the wolves glowing eyes and when they decided to back away they all did so at the same time they should have turned their heads and left the scene instead of backing straight up and their eyes going dim the other little quirks are easily overlooked, This movies was really good and is one you will want to view again it's the best outdoor movie since the Edge. This to me is more of a survival thriller movie than action and it will have your full attention throughout. I will always tell it as I see it.<br />  SCOTT M

B007J4T2G8|4.0|Okay, it was a little weird, a litle quirky. But the author brought me along all the way and kept me entertained. A good solid read. I liked it.

B00007FOMP|5.0|Wow what hasn't been said about the great Marvin Gaye the man was a Talented Singer with a powerful Voice, so when What's Going On was Released in 1971 people really started to look at life in a different way. As Marvin Gaye spoke about everyday life like poverty, Racism, Love, Religion, War he really laid down the blueprint about story telling which is why this is my favorite album from Him.
B0051NTSXQ|2.0|With a movie of this gener you have got to have at the very least strong acting and good makeup this film does not have one or the other the makeup is a joke and the acting is the punchline please do not waste your time or money, I turned this film off and threw it in the trash after 15 minutes however I did save the case as to get something for my money. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is there is actually even worse movies of this genre than this one. Don't bother.<br />  SCOTT M
B006N9KFPC|5.0|Great vocals and energy in a cohesive album- the bonus tracks are great - get the deluxe version. Most of the songs are co-written by Adam and there are not enough accolades for the vocals and production, great for exercising, dancing, and chilling out.  Run, do not walk and get yours now!
B0052VUNHC|4.0|I really enjoyed this book... so much that it only took me two days to read it! Abby reminded me of myself when I went to college and wanted to get out of a town where everyone knows your business. I did think the premise of the initial bet was a little odd and I wish the deal between Abby and Adam was explained. Also the ending was a bit abrupt but other than that no complaints. Definitely a great read!
0307888908|5.0|I really wish I read this when I was in high school.  For now on, I will be giving this book to as a gift to any graduate - high school or college.  It teaches valuable lessons and skills that are not taught or given attention to in a classroom.  And its not all about quitting your job and starting your own business or becoming an entrepreneur....its more of adopting a lifestyle and mindset where you treat your job or career as a start up.
1606863622|4.0|Nicholas Sparks does not write \\"formulaic\\" romance with happy endings. But readers know if they're in the mood for a good tear-jerker, they can pick up a Sparks novel. It's a tear-jerker because Sparks is a master at creating characters the reader cares about.<br /><br />I especially enjoy characters that struggle with issues other than (and in addition to) a complicated romance. (Although in my own writing I'm more of a happily-ever-after kind of gal.)<br /><br />Dear John is about what happens to a relationship when one of the participants is in the military (a theme I often explore in my writing). It also has a strong sub-theme with John's father (who is assumed to have Asbergers).<br /><br />All in all, a typical Sparks \\"hero\\" - complex, deep - who loses a lot but still manages to keep the reader's admiration! My only complaint is that our hero was a bit too mushy at times (which may just be my expectations of a soldier character).

0670023329|5.0|You can not put this book down because you can't believe that human beings are living like this.  Such depravity in these camps.  It seems worse to me than anything I've read about the German concentration camps.  One can see why it has been a hard road for this young man to be healed from such trauma.
0385534639|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a while.  If you like Magic, you will like this.<br />I really enjoy the way she set it up into small story lines through out the book and slowly brings<br />them all together.
0345803485|1.0|There are other, more eloquent reviews on this page which detail exactly why this book is so terrible.  I won't be able to compete with other reviewers' thoughtful tallying of overused phrases, horrible writing and tired cliches.<br /><br />Suffice to say that if you choose to read this book, be prepared to roll your eyes and actually feel like you're getting dumber with each sentence.  Honestly, you could (and should) spend the money you'd use for this book on just about ANYTHING else and it would be a smarter purchase.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|An amazing story anyone of any age will love. John Grisham throws us a curve ball right from the beginning of the story. Pete Duffy ran to escape the trail!! And we all expect for the book to be about that. But no! Someone is out to get Theo. The only problem is he has no foes. I would advise not to start reading at night, you will stay up never putting this book down!
B0018087TC|5.0|This late career (1987) recording finds Chet in top form, backed by an absolutely stellar combo. You would never guess that the featured artist on this album is the same withered husk seen in Bruce Weber's \\"Let's Get Lost,\\" a documentary filmed in the months preceding this performance. Chet's playing on the uptempo numbers (e.g. \\"For Minors Only\\" and \\"Four\\") is absolutely on fire but never gratuitously flashy. His rendition of Elvis Costello's \\"Almost Blue\\" more than reciprocates the respect and admiration Costello paid Baker by writing the song with him in mind and having Baker play on his song \\"Shipbuilding.\\" On \\"One Night in Tokyo\\" Chet delivers the ultimate interpretation of \\"Almost Blue,\\" starting with perhaps the most lyrical trumpet solo of his long, erratic career and then following it with what I consider his finest vocal performance. The take of \\"My Funny Valentine,\\" Baker's signature song, is also remarkable, not only for the sensitivity and nuance of Baker's playing and singing, but also for how his quartet really opens up and extends the song. John Engels, the drummer on this outstanding album, was quoted in Jeroen de Valk's \\"Chet Baker: His Life and Music\\" as saying, \\"It may sound sentimental, but Chet opened something up inside me. He went deeper than anyone else. Chet came from another star. He was sent here to convey his message. Now he's back on the star he came from.\\" One listen to \\"One Night in Tokyo\\" will show you what he meant.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Excellent time waster. Had to review to get rid of rate me reminder. Now, back to playing Solitaire.  Muy very good.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was very engrossed in this book. Christian has such deep issues and I couldn't put the book down in anticipation. This man is so scarred and you have to find out why in order to truly understand him. This book proves that looks can be deceiving.<br /><br />BTW....I think people are just a little too stuck on the repetitive wording or expressions used. It's called character building!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|First of all, I have had over 10 years of real experiences in the Leather Lifestyle and this book falls way short of doing it any justice.  NO experienced Dominant would ever take a total newbie and force her to entertain being a submissive by 1) Telling her to research BDSM on Wikipedia?!?!?!  REALLY????  Unbelievable!!!  2) By giving her a glimpse of a bunch of scary toys and equipment that she knows nothing about and not showing her how they are used in a publicly private play party setting so she can get a better idea of what goes on and help to answer questions.  3) Boast about trust being the core of the relationship as well as open communication (which is true) and then be THAT closed off so that the new potential sub really can't get to know you at all.  How does that work???  4)  Even punishment does not go beyond what a sub can handle.  You never go full out on someone and still call it safe, sane and consensual when they don't even know the full breadth of what they can take!  Wth???  5) Nor would a real Dominant who is safe, sane and consensual ever basically close you off like an abusive manipulator.<br /><br />Ultimately this book is BDSM LITE and any scenes use one non-threatening toy and only for titillation.  There is no in-depth play scene involved.  Just foreplay and warm up which jumps into sex and even more quickly to the next orgasm which the build-up to that becomes seriously lacking to the point of boredom and even irritation.  Christian quickly became an unattractive minute-man and Anastasia was unrealistic over-all but especially sexually.  Everytime you turn around she's having another mind-blowing or earth shattering orgasm.  The events leading up to them are less than satisfying towards that end.  Someone else asked if a Teenager wrote this and I had to laugh because I agreed!  The main character sounds like she's in high school most of the book and then suddenly tosses out big words out if nowhere just because she's a college graduate and supposed to be smart?  Not to mention I would have loved to bind and gag her irritatingly annoying \\"inner goddess\\" who never seems to shut up and ultimately takes away from the story rather than adding anything to it.<br /><br />In My opinion, this book has \\"Tried too hard!\\" written all over it and it sickens me that this is what is flying off the book shelves and as a Trilogy!  A Trilogy???  Really???  Give me a break!!!  Total waste of my time and hard-earned money which I would like to get both of them back.  If only zero stars was an option.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great version of solitaire.  the game is running great, haven't had any issues.  nice statistic tracker.  cute animations for solving deals.
B002BWP49C|1.0|I loved the other Twilight Movies but this one is just dull.  If you ever read the book you may remember that about 75% of the book was about the wedding, the preparations, and the honeymoon.  It was very drawn out with little real content unless you're into romance novels then you might have found a little more to be interested in.  But to make a movie out of that book you could have thoroughly covered the entire book in a single movie.  When I heard they were making this a 2 part movie I was dumbstruck as to how they would find enough content to do so.  Well they did it by making lots of drawn out panoramic scenes showing dreaminess and all that you would expect out of a medium quality home wedding movie.<br /><br />For as bad as this movie was there's very good potential for the second movie.  But this one I would say you could crop it down to 30 minutes and then you'd have a decent Breaking Dawn Part 1.
B000002O1P|5.0|It's hard to imagine after hearing this album for the first time that in fact during the mixing process, Tom Petty punched a concrete wall in anger, crushing the bones in his hand.<br />A few seemingly irrelevant songs aside, \\"Southern Accents\\" succeeds as one of the best pieces of music to aptly describe life and points of view in the modern American South. Though Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers are often identified as heartland rockers, and a great American institution like apple pie and Eisenhower, it's sometimes forgotten that Petty is in fact from Florida, farther down from Dixie than the narrator in the brilliantly written and arranged opening track 'Rebels.'<br />Fans then and now tend to set \\"Southern Accents\\" apart as an experiment of sorts, as its technological advances being far removed from the straight-ahead rocking riffs and hooks that buoyed their previous albums, benchmarks of American rock n' roll such as \\"Damn the Torpedoes\\" and the broader \\"Hard Promises.\\" Producer David A. Stewart's influence is apparent, as the record is in most places distinctly 80s, but that was the point - to express life in the modern South, not the eras of Jefferson Davis or George Wallace. And despite the stereotype, we Southerners don't live under a rock that shields us from modern advances; bayous, deserts, dense hills - yes, but not under any rocks.<br />And in the 1980s, Southerners, like the rest of America, were taken by the walkman, aerobics, and lots of hairspray. Southern musicians were no different. Though the Heartbreakers avoided the hairspray for the most part, they were still prone to the new strides being made in the studio.<br />If \\"Southern Accents\\" didn't contain its share of synthesizers, reverbs, and overdubs, its concept - though loose - would be ineffective.<br />This makes the stubborn narrative of 'It Ain't Nothin' To Me' a bit ironic. The song finds Petty in his best affected drawl, resentful and unimpressed with the men on the moon, long distance phones, and every other thing mankind has called its latest triumph. Yet still, 'It Ain't Nothin' To Me' is adorned with horns, abundant backup vocals, and a distinctly modern production.<br />Of course, there's not much Southern about the iconic hit 'Don't Come Around Here No More,' aside from the double negative. But, as the South was not immune to technological forward cries, we're no more immune to the emotions and traumas of a breakup. The success of 'Don't Come Around Here No More' as a single probably saved the album from becoming a fading curio in Tom Petty's cannon, not to mention the groundbreaking video that still stands as one of the greatest MTV pieces of all time; Petty as the Mad Hatter leading a cast of Through the Looking Glass characters supplied the network with one of its most memorable videos, in a time when they were still interested in the format.<br />Aside from this, it's one of the greatest songs of the 80s, the reverb and synth utilized as even more powerful weapons by the Heartbreakers, as well as containing one of Tom Petty's most effective vocals.<br />The title track contains every sentiment the album was meant to express, as title tracks are supposed to do; dressed in a basic acoustic piano, slight percussion, strings that sound suspiciously more real and less synthesized than most strings from this decade, and the occasional banjo flourish, 'Southern Accents' finds Petty's voice drenched in a pain but also a satisfied contentment as he sings of work, jail, family, love, and how the rest of the world views these things differently.<br />It's a Springsteen-like portrait, but only in feeling; Petty says every bit as much as the Boss did with his deep New Jersey poetry, but uses only simple verses and a one-sentence chorus to make his point here. Johnny Cash even saw fit to cover this song. There's nothing in the rock n' roll rulebook that states if Johnny Cash covered your song, it's a bona fide piece of masterwork - but rock n' roll has no rulebook, you make up the rules as you go along, and that's not too bad of a rule to make official.<br />Though it certainly rocks as well as previous Petty/Heartbreakers classics, 'Make It Better (Forget About Me)' uses mostly horns and watery organs to supply the smoke that comes from the song's pipes. The lyrics are just as realistic and easy with which to identify as other rocking observations on relationships like 'Even the Losers' or 'Don't Do Me Like That,' and the Heartbreakers stay in a fine rocking uniform, even if they take more of a backing role to the horns and female choir. All that romantic fury gives way to middle-aged scorn with 'Spike,' sang with the same stubborn point of view as 'It Ain't Nothin' To Me.' 'Spike' features Petty as an older, wiser, more cynical version of himself, addressing the title character, a young, unruly, bitter punk with whom maybe Petty can identify, but to whom he gives no leeway.<br />But the following track provides a compromise between those two points of view, as Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers sound most like themselves on the driving 'Dogs on the Run.' The song likely made die-hard fans the most comfortable, as it resembled the band's hard rocking nature most genuinely. Horns are still here, but this time they're riding in the backseat, as the guitars, signature vocals, Benmont Tench's organ, and drums that sound like drums provide the song's front rank.<br />'Dogs on the Run' may contain thoughts expressed by countless rock n' roll bands in the past and future - that weary lament of fast living and seedy choices that must be expressed in heavy chugging instead of woeful requiem - but there's something more restrained here, despite the rocking delivery. There's something here that may echo what Solomon wrote in Ecclesiastes: \\"a living dog is better than a dead lion.\\"<br />Believe it or not, rock n' roll can be a very Ecclesiastical thing.<br />The following year's live \\"Pack Up the Plantation!\\" release seemed like a compromise; it attempted to capture the energy of a Heartbreakers concert while keeping the advances of \\"Southern Accents\\" in tact. For the most part it succeeded. But if the Heartbreakers were second-guessing themselves they needn't have done so. With \\"Southern Accents,\\" they'd made one of the most unique thematic albums of the decade. The skyline of Tallahassee is now drenched in neon, the sky over Atlanta looms with skyscrapers, and Nashville might see a smoggy day every now and then; it's the same for the hearts of those who live in the South, whether in below-Dixie metropolises or rural small towns.<br />\\"Southern Accents\\" expressed it all perfectly, with music that said an abundance about what was going on in the modern age, and lyrics that new what not to say, as well as what to detail with understated poignancy.s no rulebook, you make up the rules as you go along, and that's not too bad of a rule to make official.<br />Though it certainly rocks as well as previous Petty/Heartbreakers classics, 'Make It Better (Forget About Me)' uses mostly horns and watery organs to supply the smoke that comes from the song's pipes.

B007NYODBS|1.0|This is one of the most boring movies I have watched in awhile, I could not watch it all the way through, my wife watched most of it and also thought it was not worth the $.99 or the time.
0307716546|3.0|I could have become obsessed with the novel.  I could have been so emotionally involved in the plot that I would judge it exceptional.  I thought the story would be brilliant.  A school is on fire and our heroine, Grace, sees smoke billowing from the building and does not see her beautiful daughter, Jenny, on the grounds.  She glimpses her beloved son, but she knows her daughter is in the building.  She runs into the burning school and crawls her way to rescue Jenny on the top floor.<br /><br />Now we enter the Afterwards.  Afterwards, we need to identify the arsonist among the many probable characters.  Who would burn down a school?  This is a horrific tragedy; Grace is comatose absent of cognitive function.  Jenny is burnt and her heart has suffered from the fire and another direct attempt at her life.  Lupton then takes the reader outside of their bodies and they move around unseen.  They see their beloved father and husband, Mike, in wretched devastation.  They tell us about Adam, the darling, over-protected son and brother who is possibly accused of igniting the fire.<br /><br />So far so good, and then the writing becomes too gimmicky.  Told in the second person, Grace is speaking to Mike and telling us the story of their love, every intricacy of their children's personalities and the search for the arsonist.  Who did it and why?  Almost every character was suspect. I did not find it tough to read although the thought processes were often random.  It became cumbersome and endless.  They mystery itself is fascinating but the ending was no surprise.<br /><br />Lupton is smart; she alludes to literature and we know there is an intellectual bent to her writing.  The out-of-body mother and daughter have great dialogue.  Jenny is a smart teen and mother is wise and sacrificial.  Grace, only thirty-nine years old, was depicted as an out-of-touch mother.  No way, she is a young, vibrant, sexy mother and wife.  No emotion is excluded, grief, love and rage, but after 400 pages, I became somewhat annoyed and bored.  The very, very ending is a tearjerker and Lupton finally assembles her random thoughts in smart, concise paragraphs. 3.5 stars0 pages, I became somewhat annoyed and bored.  The very, very ending is a tearjerker and Lupton finally assembles her random thoughts in smart, concise paragraphs. 3.5 stars
0060853980|5.0|What a fun read!! This book is an absolute pleasure to read! A comedic take on the apocalypse certainly provides a unique and entertaining premise - especially when it is so well-executed! Be prepared to laugh out loud through the entire book (so you may not want to bring this one out in public - unless you don't mind getting some strange looks!). And if you are looking for a book to cheer you up - then please, pick up this one - who knew that the end of the world could provide so many laughs?<br /><br />And while the humour is great throughout the novel, it is the characters who really shine in this book. Honestly, I could not get enough of the sections with Crowley and Aziraphale - their relationship was one of the most fascinating in the book. It made for a super enjoyable read! I can definitely understand why this is considered a cult classic - and I am joining the many fans who have their fingers crossed in the hopes that this writing duo will team up again to write a sequel!

B0074MZSWW|5.0|At first I thought it was a little whiny.  I kind of liked it but didn't love it.  After listening several times to the album I decided to see if I could find a video because I was having trouble putting a face with the lead singer.  Boy am I glad I did!  You watch the video of her belting out \\"hold on\\" with all her emotion and I think you'll be sold too.  It really changed the album for me. I think she has a lot of strength in her voice and I can feel it in their songs.  While she is a stand out star, I have to say the band is really what got me hooked enough to make it through those first few listens.  I'm sorry, I can't say enough good things about this album.  Yes it's a little rough around the edges.  It's their first major release that I know of and a little rough is ok with me.  Very good album and it hasn't left the cd player in my car for weeks.
B003XTUZIM|4.0|It's not so unusual in rock n' roll for elegant, exquisite, beautiful music to come from motley, scruffy, disturbed-looking individuals. King Crimson's fourth studio album, and one of their least celebrated, \\"Islands\\" is a disc of tranquility that occasionally snaps you out of your trance with disconcerting musical sounds as well, like tree branches suddenly cracking in an otherwise Tennyson-worthy rainstorm.<br />The relationship between guitarist/Crimson headmaster Robert Fripp and resident lyricist Peter Sinfield was reaching a breaking point, with Fripp telling Sinfield \\"I can't work with you anymore\\" not long after \\"Islands\\"' completion. The rest of the band was in equally shaky form, a seemingly ragtag lineup of Boz Burrell on bass and vocals (later to join Bad Company), Mel Collins on flutes and saxes, and Ian Wallace at the percussion seat. Robert Fripp's recollections of this lineup of King Crimson have rarely, if ever, been cheerful. But even one with such high musical standards as rock's most over-thinking guitarist can admit that it's astounding for such an ill-connected puzzle of a band to produce an album of such deep material as \\"Islands.\\"<br />Crimson had yet to keep a lineup together since its debut in 1969, and announcements of a breakup, both authentic and speculated, abounded in the musical press every few months. In hindsight it seems that the British melody papers used the \\"Crimson Split\\" headline when they were having a slow news day. But they can't be blamed, as Fripp and Sinfield were the only original members remaining, and a host of musicians had come and gone since the beginning, unable to hack the eccentric nature of the prog-rock beast.<br />The \\"Islands\\" lineup would be no different.<br />Not withstanding, the album is one of mystery, alarm, and beauty, released here with a treasure of bonus material. The opening 'Formentera Lady' begins the record with a string bass intro that preludes Sinfield's ever-cryptic lyrics, sung mostly on the album by future Bad Company co-founder Burrell, who had been taught to play the bass guitar by Robert Fripp before recording began; more evidence of the hurried formation of this brief, ill-fated era. Fans have since baulked at Burrell's singing, the reasons for which leave one puzzled. His voice reflects a singer unrefined yet pulling off a distinctly English and somehow up-market performance.<br />'Formentera Lady' becomes engaged with an alluring flute riff, at which Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull would have nodded in approval, and Burrell sings an almost poppy vocal melody over Fripp's tasteful acoustic plucking. The creative percussion flourishes used by Ian Wallace foreshadow the varied techniques of his successor Jamie Muir, minus the animal skin-wearing lunacy the latter would display.<br />The winding instrumental 'Sailor's Tale' is something of an acquired taste, recommended only for prog-rock fans whose wines are more suited for Viking-like pillages and nights in warlord-ridden pubs. It begins seamlessly from 'Formentera Lady' and descends into frenzied percussion-and-saxophone leads, as Fripp switches to a more electric weapon, lending the increasingly maddening sax work some support in its attack. 'Sailor's Tale' appears to wind down, only to give way again to Fripp's brooding, jangly guitar with his signature mellotron in the background, Wallace's percussion still refusing to take a rest.<br />'The Letters' then begins with gentle bass guitar picking, a tale of adultery and betrayal that rivals even Edgar Allan Poe's moodiest work. Excellently written and particularly well-produced, 'The Letters' highlights a colorful arrangement of horn work, and a vocal from Burrell that alternates between heartbroken and maniacally enraged. His lone wearisome voice closes the song, leaving the listener stunned and quiet, moreso than by the erratic instrumentation.<br />'Ladies of the Road' has always been the most heavily examined piece of \\"Islands,\\" but mostly for its oddity than its quality. It is an ill-fitting attempt at raunchiness that lacks the precision or poignancy of later heavy Crimson rockers like 'Easy Money' or 'Lament.' King Crimson just wasn't meant to do raunchy, and 'Ladies of the Road' sounds lyrically like the Rolling Stones' more carelessly crude work (think \\"Some Girls\\"), and musically like the Beatles' \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" brainstorms on a bad day.<br />Fortunately, the string-and-woodwind instrumental 'Prelude: Song of the Gulls' provides much-needed contrast to the preceding 'Ladies,' and maybe that's what makes it work all the better. 'Prelude' brings us to the album's title track and centerpiece, a scenic piece of work that softly boasts Burrell's finest vocal, Sinfield's most gorgeous lyrics on the record, a weary yet distinguished chorus, all leading to a crescendo that ends with a whimper rather than the stark sounds to which Crim fans were accustomed.<br />The first album track fans heard from King Crimson was '21st Century Schizoid Man' in 1969, a mix of early heavy metal and jarring jazz that lived up to its name. Throughout the years, the band has produced some innovatively heavy and stunning music that matched and surpassed the alarm of 'Schizoid Man.' \\"Islands\\" however seems to be a summation of all that, an eccentric mixture of tranquil, smile-inducing textures and fantasy-intruding darkness, neither of which overbear the other.<br />The fact that this lineup of King Crimson was so hastily (and hesitantly) formed, and would not last much longer than its other incarnations, makes the evocative content of \\"Islands\\" all the more fascinating.ts oddity than its quality.

0807014273|5.0|Viktor Frankl is indeed a study in resilience.  He has demonstrated the power of finding purpose in pain, in suffering, in dying.  Man's Search for Meaning is his opus; it includes Frankl's reflections on years of suffering and it provides principles for others who find themselves feeling hopeless and helpless.<br /><br />By his late-20s, Frankl was a respected Jewish psychiatrist practicing in Vienna, Austria.  He specialized in neurology and psychiatry and even worked as a brain surgeon.  His work was primarily with those struggling with depression and suicide.  In 1942, at age 37, Frankl, his wife and his parents were deported to a German concentration camp where Frankl was asked to treat newcomers to camp in order to reduce the risk that they would commit suicide.  After two years in that role, he was transferred to Auschwitz and then on to a third concentration camp where he worked in slave-labor until the concentration camp was liberated by Allied forces in 1945.  By then, however, Frankl's wife and parents had all been murdered as residents of separate camps.<br /><br />The purposes of those concentration camps were two-fold: the methodical killing of millions of innocent people but also the demoralization and dehumanization of the Jewish people (Ainsztein, 1974).  In Man's Search for Meaning, Frankl reflects upon those around him who struggled with thoughts of suicide (p. 31) and even his own blunting of emotions (p. 35).  Pain is not a respecter of persons, a valuable lesson implicit in the book as Frankl discloses his own struggles as being parallel to those without the great intellect, education and opportunity that he possessed.<br /><br />It appears as though Frankl the psychiatrist was not demoralized to the extent that he could not recognize strategies for coping in himself and those around him.  The fact that he was later able to put these observations and reflections on paper is a treasure.<br /><br />In Resilient Adults: Overcoming a Cruel Past, Higgins discusses a number of characteristics and dynamics of the resilient that mirror Frankl's experiences.  Higgins notes that those in her study who demonstrated resilience had above average IQ, exceptional talents, high levels of ego development, attuned empathy, and a strong sense of activism.  One dynamic particularly relevant to Frankl is the component of profound religious faith.  Of those who participated in<br /><br />Higgins' study who were identified as resilient, a number discussed the value that they received in expressing how they overcame their distress.  Frankl demonstrated this decades before Higgins' study noted the therapeutic value of self-expression of resilience.<br /><br />Higgins' study participants reported that being exposed to the resilience of others provided a sense of hope for them in the midst of distress.  Reading Man's Search for Meaning provides encouragement for those who find themselves in distress.  For many people, the tragedies reported and documented from the German concentration camps are of the most heinous of all time.  The resiliency demonstrated by Frankl offers hope for any circumstance.<br /><br />Frankl discusses the importance of \\"simple desires\\" during the times of greatest agony (p. 40).  Those who are feeling hopeless and full of desire should likewise recognize the simple things that they appreciate despite the gravity of their situations.  Frankl's perhaps most important contribution was his disclosure of the role of the \\"vigor of religious belief\\" (p. 46).  This is of particular interest considering the opinions of religion propagated by the two other key Viennese psychiatrists, Freud and Adler.<br /><br />A struggle normalized by Frankl was that of thoughts of suicide (p. 31).  For those who believe that they are the only ones so desperate as to consider the taking of their own life, Frankl writes about the struggles with suicide of the entire concentration camp community as well as his own individual strugglewith hopelessness and doubts about whether he could go on.  Inclusion of such a vulnerable disclosure is helpful to readers who feel that they are alone in the depth of their pain.  To recognize the prevalence of this struggle in the face of such extreme pain is therapeutic, particularly when coupled with the knowledge that those who acknowledged the struggle survived.<br /><br />A thread present at numerous points within the pages of Man's Search for Meaning is that of the preeminence of family.  At various points, Frankl discusses how \\"longing for home and family\\" (p. 33) kept painful emotions at bay, even when they were thinking about their spouses being in similar, or worse conditions (p. 48).  By doing so, Frankl encourages future readers to also treasure those close to them when facing trials.<br /><br />Frankl discusses the role of humor (p. 54) as a means of self-preservation in the darkest of hours, noting that \\"a very trifling thing can cause the greatest of joys\\" (p. 55).  Solitude, often considered the enemy of the oppressed, was treasured (p. 61).  Day-dreaming became a real coping mechanism to get through each day; inner life became intensified (p. 50).  These dynamics may come as a surprise to those in the midst of pain; however, Frankl emphasized the healing component that each provided for those in the midst of the torment found in the concentration camps of World War Two.<br /><br />While the first half of Man's Search for Meaning is autobiographical, the second half is a summation on Frankl's penultimate contribution to his field, logotherapy.  Frankl wrote that his experiences in Nazi death camps taught him to affirm what Nietzsche had said, that \\"he who has a why to live for can bear with almost any\\" (Frederick Nietzsche).  The theory upon which logotherapy is based grew out of Frankl's experiences within the Nazi death camps.<br /><br />Logotherapy is from the Greek word logos.  Logos can be translated as study, word, spirit, God or meaning.  Boeree noted that Frankl was often compared with two other famous Viennese psychiatrists Sigmund Freud and Alfred Adler.  While Freud concentrated on pleasure as the root of human motivation and Adler upon power, Frankl concentrated on meaning.  It was his goal to bring into greater balance perspectives on physiology and spirituality as a means to construct meaning.<br /><br />Frankl posited during his autobiographical section that man \\"can only live by looking to the future\\" (p. 115) and noted that the \\"ultimate and highest goal to which man can aspire\\" is love (p. 58).  Frankl reflects upon his experiences and states that \\"everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms - to chose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's one way\\" (p. 104).  Frankl is critical of those who shame others out of reflecting upon their own suffering noting that suffering that is endured with dignity fosters meaning.<br /><br />Religion is a key construct in Man's Search for Meaning.  Frankl is clear to testify to the importance of relying on God.  In his introduction to logotherapy, Frankl presents his theory in a much broader religious context.  While Freud clearly presented a psychological basis that was hostile to religion, Frankl posits one that recognizes how his own spiritual life \\"was deepened\\" (p. 56) while encouraging others to identify their own relationship with the transcendent.<br /><br />Completing Man's search leads readers to wonder how psychotherapeutic models would be viewed differently if access to the same depth of autobiographical reflection was available for each theorist.  Having a glimpse into Frankl's time in a World War Two concentration camp allows his audience to see into his heart and to recognize the context of his work with patients and students.<br /><br />Filled with hope, Man's Search for Meaning is quite inspirational as Frankl chronicles how he found meaning in life under the worst of circumstances.  It is as though Frankl has found a dozen ways to say that the answer to all psychological problems is to \\"find meaning in suffering.\\"  His optimism has a contagious flavor to it.  Man's Search is a compelling read that prompts deep introspection as to the relationship between the sufferer and the suffering and how to ascribe meaning to that suffering.  Frankl demonstrates that, \\"even in the most terrible conditions of psychic and physical stress,\\" individuals \\"can preserve a vestige of spiritual freedom, of independence of mind\\" (p. 74).

B007ZVSHR0|5.0|Seriously, if you are thinking of getting the album, the deluxe is a MUST HAVE the three bonus songs are amazing, especially Running, which is actually the highest sold individual track on Itunes.<br /><br />Even as a big fan of Adam's I will still say I was really happily surprised and impressed with this album.  Not every song is amazing but genuinely there is no filler in this album, this is a cohesive collection of very strong songs that at worst some will be lesser favorites.  Actually the two that are lower on my list are the two he didnt write, Never Close Our Eyes and Naked Love.  While he sings them well I find the lyrics very generic, but NCOE is his current single and NL considered future single material so both are still quite strong.<br /><br />But most of the other songs are much more unique and have a distinct sound in some way, that wont be found on other albums.  Shady is just a fun funky song, Kickin In, likewise fun and different.  Ballads are heartfelt, there are some slow sexy jams and then the three bonus tracks that are all wonderful but Runnin is a vocal workout that has to be experienced.  Last song on the deluxe, is Nirvana which is such a loving and tender song, the vocal cool down from the roller coaster that this is this album.
0345803485|4.0|I enjoyed the trilogy very much. The worst part about it was the writing. It was horrible! But once you got past that it was pretty good. Yeah the sex was graphic ( not as graphic as some erotica out there) but became repetitious; always started the same i.e.: \\"He rubbed my clit.\\"; \\"Ana you're so wet.\\" That got predictable, annoying and overused. Also overused were \\"Oh my\\", \\"Stop biting you lip\\", etc. And the 'author' clearly didn't know much about the BDSM lifestyle as were portrayed in the books.  Other than that the story was engaging. I got caught up in the characters and the fact Ana helps Christian face his inner demons and that they care enough and are willing to try and change for the sake of the other. There were a myriad of different emotions you can't help but feel while reading it too. And who doesn't like a happy ending? Again, I liked it. I found it hard to put down once I started reading. A guilty pleasure to be sure!
0596009208|3.0|This book is good if you are maybe younger, but I'd rather get a book that has a similar structure to \\"Beginning C++ Through Game Programming\\" or \\"XNA 4.0 Game Development by Example: Beginner's Guide [Paperback]\\" These books have a \\"What I am about to do\\", \\"My code\\", \\"What the code did\\" type of structure to them. This book has pictures, scribbles, and is all over the place for me. If you are a college student and you want to learn Java and you like the structure I described by \\"Beginning C++ Through Game Programming\\" and \\"XNA 4.0 Game Development by Example: Beginner's Guide [Paperback]\\", try searching for another book.<br /><br />Aside from the structure, I really didn't learn much from this book because of the way it's set up. It's too \\"all over the place\\" with black and white pictures and puzzles and whatnot throughout the entire book. This book, to me, is more \\"hey look at this elephant in the corner\\" than \\"this is what I am going to do\\", \\"here's the code supporting what I did\\", \\"here's what every line of the code does\\". I know it sounds monotone, but this structure is, what I believe, the best way to learn programming.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I figured I would give this book a chance seeing how it has been receiving so much hype lately, however, I was greatly disappointed. If this book reminded me anymore of the Twilight series, which I despise, I would scream. Let me give you some examples.The book is even set in Washington state...really?!  Main male character: Extremely good looking young man(god like) who woes all the women he meets. He's beyond wealthy even though he's incredibly young for such wealth(how he got so wealthy never fully explained). Possessive stalking tendencies which are supposed to be \\"romantic\\" and \\"protective\\", not creepy at all. Main female character: Clumsy, shy, meek, lack luster beauty who falls for \\"god like\\" wealthy hunk after one meeting. And some how charms the one man every woman in the world wants...uh huh sure. Starts unhealthy obsession all the while not having any self respect or common sense to run about 12,0000 miles away from a sadistic pig. The whole time I was reading this book I keep thinking to myself \\"oh would you just grow a pair and dump him?!\\" I am incredibly appalled by FEMALE authors who have their \\"heroines\\" be weak and pathetic.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool was recommended on a list of Dystopian fiction that I came across. Several people said it was better than The Hunger Games, and after finishing Wool (the omnibus edition), I have to agree. It is a great story, fast paced, and one I couldn't put down.  I get a lot of books for free or at low prices for my Kindle, and was beginning to think they just weren't worth it. Readers can tell when a book has been self published and was poorly edited. Wool is the great exception. I would not have known it was self published. It is well written and error free. I am recommending this book to my friends and family and to friends of mine who have formed a Kindle \\"book club\\". And I recommend that you read it too. Grab it now while you can. The Omnibus Edition at only $5.99? It's a steal, and a great one at that!
B005IZLPKQ|1.0|I was so disappointed with this movie because I really like all the stars in it.  The movie was so drawn out and boring; if they had cut out all the BS it would have been under 60 mins. I wish they had more action in this movie, instead they focused to much on how small Steve Rogers was before he becomes Cpt America. Over half of the movie was based on this.  I would definately suggest watching it on TV before buying it to see if you like it.<br />Thanks for reading my review.

0439023513|5.0|This novel deeply impacted me. I had to let the review sit for awhile before I could coalesce my thoughts on it because I kept replaying the many aspects of the series over and over in my head, wondering if the series could really have ended any differently. I suppose if some of the key characters had made different decisions, there would have been some difference, but keeping everything else the same, Katniss really could not have responded differently. I felt that this book was much more realistic regarding the behavior of a 17-year-old in her circumstances than many other books I have read of the Young Adult genre.<br />I felt that the second and third books revolved largely around what it would take to break Katniss. The reader can guess the answer quite easily, but Katniss is haunted by not being certain of this answer. She is only a young adult after all, not even experiencing all of the atrocities that the Capital visited on the other Hunger Games victors before her. She is naive in many ways, though her inner strength and determination to survive are great personal motivators.<br />There is maybe one part of the book that I really wish would have happened differently, and that is what happens to Finnick, especially given his reunion with Annie. I could not understand how it was so necessary to the continuance of the main plot, and I felt sad for Annie.<br />I don't want to give away the ending for Katniss's personal story, but in the grand scheme of things, even this was necessary for Katniss's personal survival, as well as the betterment of the remaining districts of Panem. While that statement is appropriately confusing, the way I described the ending to my husband, who still needs to read the second and third books, is the ending was bittersweet - heavy on the bitter and light on the sweet.

B004XJRQUQ|3.0|A great start to a forgettable story.  The first book promised a good story with a fantastic blend of happiness, sorrow, triumph and promise.  The second flat-lined and only kept me interested in characters I hoped would grow.  The third? It abandoned all hope of being anything more than a less than mediocre story of teenage loss. Avoid the books and avoid the coming movies.  The first is best, the second carries, the third and final is nothing.  Let it be relegated to the same literary and cinematic hell of Twilight, money earned be damned.

B001EXE2ZG|5.0|By 1949, when filming on \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" began, the name \\"Gloria Swanson\\" was as forgotten as yesterdays tuna casserole.  And who really eats tuna casserole, anyway?<br /><br />But it's Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond, shoving tuna casserole in our faces.  REMEMBER WHAT IT TASTES LIKE???????  Yes, we remember.  It tastes like something from twenty years ago that we've forgotten about and don't want to eat again.<br /><br />And here is Gloria Swanson giving us something we had twenty years ago and that she still thinks we want today, circa 1950.  She's misguided.  She's a lot of things.  Suicidal.  Drunk.  Outrageous.  Demented.  Manipulative.<br /><br />The plot itself has been hashed to death, not only by Amazon.com reviewers, but by Andrew Lloyd Weber as well.  His musical of this pity party is stupendous.  A true original.<br /><br />But this is not about the musical.  This is about another true orginal: the film and the star.  There's no escaping it.  The film sucks you in and you are in for heady, sorrowful ride.  And it's brilliant.  Gloria Swanson, William Holden, and Erich von Stroheim work wonders not only with the script but with each other.  And the ravaged, aged faces of former silent stars, at the card table, is sad indeed.<br /><br />It's one of Hollywood's best and scariest look at itself, and it works on every level.

The difficult part of this is that anyone displaying an allergy or sensitivity to wheat that tested no on gluten allergies may have latent problems that build up with no symptoms and can occur years later by eating an ancient version that is weaker in gluten.<br /><br />I love the truly gluten free recipes, and wish the spelt ones had a substitution guide since there are no real suggested alternatives. There are no comments as to if the recipe will modify, and no discussion as to if it has been attempted. So it tends to tease one on what they cannot have as well as providing what they can in great forms.<br />I have eaten some of the products at the bakery, and loved them. I wish this book was laid out a little differently with substitution options, and did not make the assumptions as to sensitivity levels.<br /><br />Overall, with what I have cooked out of it and with the review of the contents, I feel it is a good purchase, but one I will limitedly use repeatedly for a few of the basics.

B006MVJ2L4|5.0|I just received my album today and I can't stop playing it, I'm going to buy another one to keep in my car. My favorite track is \\"Underneath\\" but I'm loving the fast, fun tracks too like \\"Kickin' In\\", \\"Trespassing\\", \\"Cuckoo\\" and one of my other favorites,\\"Shady\\". Adam Lambert has such an amazing vocal range. I've never heard another singer that could sing the way he does. This album is a pure delight!
B007ZRZF8I|4.0|This game is good all around. The futuristic character runs from an enemy at an increasingly fast rate. A tap of the screen shifts gravity and hells your character navigate the landscapes. It can get quite hectic and fun at times.

B004JN1D2I|2.0|Having paid for the four volume set, I expected to be rewarded with resolutions to the fates of the primary characters.<br />I was sorely disappointed.<br />By volume four, I suspected that disappointment lay ahead, but I slogged on, hoping to be proven wrong.<br />This is a literary scam, designed to sell mediocre books with some interesting characters that should have been allowed to tell their tales by this author.<br />Instead, we are served with endless exteraneous characters and a complete absence of literary conclusion.<br />I am thoroughly disappointed.<br />I will not be spending additional dollars to find out how this author plans to scam me further.

B0055SWM08|5.0|I am not a huge gamer.  What games I like are puzzle games, to make the effort at keeping my poor old brain in shape, and if I have it on the smartphone, it have to be able to see it easily. Not all puzzle games are easy to see and play on a smartphone screen. This one is, and it's just challenging enough to keep me coming back from time to time.  And my 8-year-old grandson being better at it than I am doesn't even spoil it.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this series and I can't wait for it to come out on DVD.  The story was very believable and futuristic, just like I like them.  I would recommend this read to everyone.  It was an easy read, too and didn't bog down in the storyline.  The characters were \\"real\\" people and their lifestyles were interesting. The books kept me turning pages until I had read all three volumes.
0307959856|1.0|Ms James simply cannot write in the tone of Ms Austen, and it was an unkindness of her editor to have let her try.  She embarasses herself.  Ponderous prose in what she thinks is Austen style, with cringe-inducing spasms of archness as she attempts to insert Austenitic epigrams.  It's like watching a draft horse try to tapdance.<br /><br />And what it worse is the mystery itself.  This is mystery writing by a machine.  I've read good James, and I've read bad James - pretty much all of it, in fact - but I've never seen a weaker attempt.  If this were presented as the first work of a country diarist trying to write a mystery it wouild warrent no more than a rap on the knuckles, but to read such garbage from James makes you wonder if she hasn't gone gaga entirely.<br /><br />There is no reason for this book to have been published.

B007CKNX28|5.0|I'm not surprised at all that Jack White has released yet another great album -- this time as a solo artist. That says a lot of Jack's gift to make amazing music, and this album is no exception. In my opinion, it may be the best album released this year.<br /><br />Although this album is simply under Jack White's name, it is very instrumentally diverse and is very much a band effort. Jack called on an array of talented musicians to assist him record Blunderbuss. Thus, the album is nothing like the White Stripes in terms of minimalism. The album sounds quite full and is composed quite beautifully. Some fans might be disappointed by the lack of electric guitar riffs in this album, but I have no complaints for the music is great. It's hard to really categorize this album with a genre because it ranges, but it's music you would expect from Jack White. The lyrics are sometimes dark and talk a lot about women and their abuses.<br /><br />Overall, this album is amazing. It was only a few months ago that I found that this album was in the works, and I'm so happy that he made it. It's truly a great achievement and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves the magic that is music. Jack has said that he has enough songs written already to start recording another album and I cannot wait!

0316044695|4.0|I read a lot of books on the special forces in relation to my work as an educator.<br /><br />This one is really a great read - despite the tragedy.<br /><br />Why a 4 instead of a 5?  The author - who truly is a hero and an exceptional human being - spends a bit too much time describing the SEALS as Gods.  He tries to make self-deprecating remarks about getting lucky to be one but...we get it, you guys - including you - are exceptional.  No need to tell us.  Just show us what you do and we'll agree!<br /><br />Second small issue - he can't help but applaud George Bush and insult Bill Clinton.<br /><br />I'm a political Independent.  And, I expect our soliders to show respect for both current and former Commanders In Chief.<br /><br />With that said, 95% of the book is great.
B005DC68NI|5.0|I downloaded this book last night. This morning I'm planning out a book project of my own. 'Let's Get Digital' was filled with valuable information, both on self-publishing, and, even more importantly, on why self-publishing can work for you.

0439023521|5.0|Suzanne Collins has successfully combined a highly emotional story (love, familial responsiblity, anger, resentment and desperation) with a terrific adventure, all set in a believable world where America has fallen under the grip of a brutal caste dictatorship. Any student of history will recognize the slide down from a democratic country to a totalitarian one, and the population control measures any dictatorship uses.<br />Although written for young adults, the book is good reading for any age teen and above. It is well-written, although the sentence structure appears aimed at a teen audience. Overall, excellent, with great characters and believable motivations and action at all levels.<br />A unique aspect of the book is the strong female lead represented by Katniss. For a young female audience, she represents a good role model despite the violence she utilizes to survive.[[ASIN:B006O2G6HY Mongoose]]

B007Q2N0HA|4.0|Gideon Cross billionaire businessman, meets new employee Eva Tramell. Eva has a very rich Stepfather so money does not intimidate or impress her, but Gideon Cross takes her breath away. Tall dark and dangerous, is such an apt description for this emotionally scarred man. From their first meeting the sexual tension and chemistry explodes off the page. Eva is a survivor herself, having been a victim of abuse.This is the first in a new trilogy. I have never read anything by this author before, but I was quite impressed.<br /><br />This story has been widely compared to Fifty Shades of Grey. I don't really see much of a connection unless you count a very rich hero with emotional scars, but you can pick up any M&B for that. Plus there is no BDSM theme in this story. This is a more erotic story IMO. the sex scenes are plentiful and hot. There are quite a few characters we are introduced to here apart from the H/h. Most memorable is Eva's flat mate Cary, another survivor whom Eva first met at therapy sessions. He is like a brother to Eva. My feelings about this story are good, but I do have some minor issues.<br /><br />I thought that there were too many characters with emotional problems, that felt like the author was over egging the pudding to me.The relationship between Gideon and Eva does have its problems, which I am sure will continue in the next book. But I felt that every time there was an issue instead of talking they just had sex, it was used like a band aid, to gloss over their problems. Although Eva held her own against Gideon, I would have liked to have seen her stand her ground with him more, instead of her constant running off. I felt he never really answered her questions adequately, and although Eva's character was really strong in the beginning, she became less and less assertive as the tale progressed. There was a scene near the end where he did explain a situation, so I hope that continues in the next book. Like a lot of male leads Gideon is unreasonable when it comes to Eva, he goes off the deep end if she even speaks to other men, but it is okay for him to carry on as he pleases, that's just a pet peeve of mine. But this was a compelling story and addictive, so I will certainly be reading the next two books.e when it comes to Eva, he goes off the deep end if she even speaks to other men, but it is okay for him to carry on as he pleases, that's just a pet peeve of mine.

B001LF3YQK|4.0|This is the second one of these I've bought. I lost the first one. I love this case because it is actually big enough to hold wipes for two kids in diapers. The design allows you to get out just one at a time instead of accordion pulling 10 at once. I gave it four stars because the red sliding button is a tad difficult to open one handed, but that's not too bad once you get the hang of it. Love the style, love the concept, and it would make an awesome baby shower gift too.
B007JWKLMO|3.0|Part 1 of this film is the same Beatles rehash we've all seen and heard before. Part 2 picks up the pace. I personally would have preferred less of the 60's material (which is well documented) and more of the later years. First, George was a musician (gardener according to him). I found the lack of acknowledgement about his albums and music a bit concerning. Several of his albums are not even mentioned. I know time is limited on a documentary but this oversight was tough to overcome. Those complaints being said I did find Part 2 to be informative and learned a lot about the wonderful man.

0446572993|5.0|I have about of Baldacci's books and this one is right at the top with the rest. A real page turner.
B000VDUWMC|4.0|I bought the kindle edition (I use an ipad), since I thought it would be pretty nice to take the book everywhere with me. Nonetheless, I regret my decision: the tables where askew (making it nearly impossible to read them or get any kind of info from them) and the figures where non-existent. This obviuosly had a tremendous impact: some basic facts are exposed in figures or tables, so I totally missed it.<br /><br />As for the book, the author does a great job in compiling lots of info on the origin of human cultures, and its impact on the development of different societies. Sometimes it becomes repetitive, since you get the same info over and over again, but nonetheless it is a great book with lots of facts that would otherwise would be tedious to read.<br /><br />So to wrap things up: A great book for history lovers; a huge FAIL for the e-book (buy the print version).
B003Y5H57E|2.0|Going through divorce is never like this.  Both jump straight out of their admittedly routine nuclear family into bed with even more self absorbed, dull, drab, unsympathetic, tedious, and bitter sex partners.

0345803485|1.0|Fifty Shades of Grey continually came up on my Amazon recommendations. I read the synopsis and passed it over. But with the recent news stories, I decided to do a little more research. When I found out the author admitted this was a Twilight fanfic modified to prevent plagiarism, I was immediately turned off. However, I decided to give James the benefit of the doubt. After all, some good writers needed a fanfic confident boost to write their own original fiction.<br /><br />Only a few paragraphs into the book, I was cringing with the comma splices, run-on sentences, and incorrect switches between tenses. The prose is also very juvenile, like a middle schooler wrote it. James needs to invest in a thesaurus. Arrogant, sterile, and clinical appear multiple times, along with the repeated description about whatever emotion Christian is feeling \\"doesn't touch his eyes\\". Character development was severely lacking. If it isn't painfully obvious exactly which Twilight characters appear in the first chapter alone, the fact that everyone except for Ana and Christian is a virtually nameless blond is extremely annoying. And while the dialog is okay, Ana's seems very forced and contrived.<br /><br />All the technical details aside, I am absolutely amazed this book was published and has not been in a lawsuit over plagiarism yet. The book's setting is the same, the upper Pacific Northwest/Seattle/Vancouver region. Ana's character description is exactly like Bella Swan from Twilight, down to the physical looks that are slightly not right (Bella's was her lip, Ana's is too far spaced eyes) and comical clumsiness. She drives a beat up VW beetle (instead of a late model Ford pickup truck); has an eccentric mother who lives in the South with her new husband and tries some new venture each week; works for a hardware store (instead of sporting goods); and has a single (step) dad who fishes and watches a lot of sports on TV. As for Christian, other than having grey eyes, he's an exact duplicate of Edward Cullen. He's adopted, beautiful, wealthy, comes from a loving family, is copper headed, seems older than his 27 years, etc., etc. etc. It's very sickening, especially once Jose is thrown into the mix: the friend who's tragically in love with Ana but is destined never to receive her affections in return and who's dad was conveniently in the same Army unit as Ana's step dad. And if the character descriptions aren't enough case for stolen art, the prose is. When Ana and Christian first meet, she feels an \\"odd exhilarating shiver\\".<br /><br />As for the plot itself, there's nothing spectacular about it that hasn't been written a million times, a million different ways in other fan fic genres, not to narrow it down to Twilight alone. There's nothing really original or gripping or suspenseful that keeps an experienced reader on the edge of his or her seat.<br /><br />The quality of the book isn't worth the asking price. And there's a reason why authors aren't allowed to profit from writing fan fiction. This is an insult to every writer who has actually taken the time to develop an original story, create a unique universe, and breath life into realistic characters.  Please don't buy this book because it will send a message to publishers that it's okay to plagiarize, not to mention putting forth a poorly developed work.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|A dream of the author trying to revive her sex life by writing a fantasy book about some recent college graduate giving up her virginity to some perverted rich 27 year old man.<br /><br />A love story with soft porn.......not worth reading the next two books.......unless you live a sexless life.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|I'll keep this short and simple. This book was a good book. My only complaints is that Pidge, the main character, was annoying. She kept pushing Travis away (granted he's no model citizen),  but my thing is if you forgive somebody forgive them. Don't keep bringing up old things from the past because it becomes a pain after awhile. As for the love scene it was \\"okay\\". I wasn't impressed by it because the author doesn't go too indepth with her details. Other than that this book was great!

B007JRU2UK|3.0|A few friends have looked askance at me when I said I enjoyed The Descendants.  Tough! I thought it provided an interesting slant on two painful topics: death and infidelity.  Clooney underplayed the role (which, in my opinion, was better than hamming it up or trying to be funny), and the daughters seemed very authentic.  I even cried a few tears for the all of them.<br /><br />Not a great movie, but a very pleasant diversion. What was great was being able to order the movie directly/immediately from Amazon from my Sony Google TV.  I could get used to this!

0553801473|5.0|Anyone who complains about new characters shouldn't be reading. Just wait till hes done and just find out what happens in the end on wikipedia because your clearly not soaking it all in. Just don't expect the same characters as in the last books doing the same thing over again, this isnt that type of series,but do expect to gain perspective.  After this book we finally get a good idea for the what each of the 7 major families/regions and free cities are all about giving context to the entire series. I feel like the series is set up for the final 2+ books now, but still a lot of mystery on how these schemes will unravel. Definitely best read right after 4 if possible since runs with a concurrent timeline. Feel like the first 3 books were something of a trilogy with the war of 5 kings, and now the dust has settled. Can't wait for more but I guess I'll have to.

B003EYVXV4|2.0|I didn't read the book(s), so I don't have that background.  Apparently they're way better than the movie.  But regardless, the premise of this movie/book is just awful!  Kids killing kids...for sport and entertainment?  Some scenes of the movie were too graphic for me and I closed my eyes.  I just don't need or want to see people hurting and dying!<br /><br />I DID think the actors did an incredible job.  But that's the only good thing I can say about it.  It was too drawn out.  I kept waiting for it to be over.  It did end with a pretty good cliff-hanger.  They at least did a good job at that, making people interested in seeing what happens next.  Still, it's sad to me that this is what so many people are interested in watching/reading.
0525478817|5.0|The fault in our stars reminds me why I love books in the first place. Books are in my opinion an underestimated medium of communication theses days. John continually reminds us through his youtube videos and his novels that books were created to pass information on from person to person. Weather you are reading The Fault in Our Stars, a Shakespearian play, or your physics text book you are ultimately reading a message that someone somewhere thought was important enough to write down. And to all of you who are skeptical about reading a soppy cancer book I say to you, yes this book will probably make you cry but read it anyway! While this books is about two teenagers who are sick and do things like play video games and vandalize people's property, it is also about human consciousness, our purpose in life and honest, young, innocent love. So to all the nerdfighters out there, read this book, DFTBA, and best wishes :)

B0083GVG6K|5.0|the below contains SPOILERS so if that bothers you, hold off reading this review.<br /><br />the show unfolds pretty much as i expected it to unfold.  ivy behaves treacherously towards karen, again, but it doesn't work.  ivy can't understand it when the director tells her that karen has something she doesn't have and that's why he picked her.  what ivy is missing is the innocence and heartbreak which was the essence of Marilyn Monroe.  She is too hard and too vulgar, two qualities always missing from Marilyn which made her a star. ivy can't see that the very things which are the core of her character are what doom her from being a star.  the director has been having visions of karen as marilyn.  he can see her doing the role though no one else can.<br /><br />i can't see anything good happening with Ivy.  She is not going to be a star and she is shortly going to be too old for the chorus. She will always be a disappointment to her mother, who was a star. actually, what now happens to ivy is probably going to be a lot more interesting as we've seen the show and we can't go on seeing the show every night.<br /><br />i've actually enjoyed this show more than GLEE this year and I think it is because it is adults who make up the case.  It is hard to keep being interested in a bunch of high school students who never seem to graduate. by contrast.  although i still enjoy the musical numbers on GLEE.
B0071W4KOM|4.0|By this far in the series you know what you are getting.  If you like the previous One Tree Hills, you will like this.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Oh WOW - what can I say. Like the first two, I could not put this down - but had to on occasions to at least eat - I could hear Christian in my ear.  The trilogy was fasinating, fast paced, involved, convoluted and what else! Both Ana and Christian are on a journey of developing there relationship and themselves. She has insecurity issues; he has control issues and does not understand what love is until she comes into his life, even though he has a loving family. She had a disfunctional family and is on a learning curve also.<br />Yep- they jump into bed a lot. But then if you are married, did you not also do that when first married? Did you never play sex games? Maybe not to the extent A & C did but.....<br />This is really a most romantic love story. If you are married and do not look back on your start and how you and your spouse developed your soft and hard limits then you are not being honest. Together A & C learn who they are as a couple and how to make things work.<br />I am sad that my week with the two of them is now over.<br />Also I must say that I have read books that have more graphic sex in them, more public sex (they are really circumspect) and violence in them. I have read books where there is rape which is far worse than anything that has happened in this book. I personally do not think more reviewers got past page 100 of the first book.

B006C45CFG|4.0|I don't know why this hasn't been done before. The title seems like a comedy, but it isn't! The cowboys are the good guys who get help from the indians to battle the bad guys (the aliens). Neat special effects, but not overdone. The bad guys have changed, but the premise is the same. I enjoyed the movie.
0553386794|5.0|This book is easily one of the greatest novels that I have ever read.  Martin executes the story perfectly.  I don't think I need to go off and explain the premise of the story and the specifics of what I like because the other 2,000+ reviews on here cover it all very nicely :)<br /><br />All I will say is that the first one isn't terribly..fantasy-like.  It feels more like a historical political thriller that takes place in another universe than it does a fantasy novel.  So if you're looking for mages hurling fire at one another, dragons flying around and destroying cities, and people turning into animals, you may want to look elsewhere (and/or be patient and see what happens in the following books in this series ;) ).<br /><br />This book deserves more than just 5 stars, in my opinion!

This Live album presents those early songs in a far superior style than the old studio cuts.  These are excellently performed songs with high energy and fidelity.  This is not a Live `Hits' album but a Live collection that shows just how good the `other' songs can be when performed at their best.<br />This is a thoroughly entertaining album and it rates a well-deserved five stars.

B0054JELS4|5.0|I am just bummed because I ended up purchasing the boxed set with Season 1-6, and this set is cheaper than what I got for the S1-S6 set so I had to buy S7 & S8 separately!!! Awesome show,but I think it's getting close to winding down because I'm not really sure just how much more they can delve into the character stories. Season 4 is still my favorite :-P  I still hope they outlast JAG but I think when they do go out, they gotta go out big like someone would have to die to end this show. I wouldn't wish that on any character at all, but it's either that or Gibbs finally gets married to wife #4 or 5 and retires permanently? lol or something then they can just have a spin off. What do you guys think?
B00000DCH9|4.0|Billy Joel<br /><br />Piano Man<br /><br />This album has the great title track and \\"Captain Jack\\".  The rest of the songs are very good but fail to lift this up to classic status.<br />This is a very good four-star album.

0439023513|5.0|I did some research on this book before I read it. I wanted to know how the main<br />characters were going to fare at the conclusion.  I hate reading books where the<br />author takes you to the very end and then kills off his/her main characters, leaving<br />the reader frustrated and empty.  I was very pleased with the way this book ended.<br />All the main characters made it out alright and all of the important themes came together. I know the author took some criticism for leaving too many loose threads<br />in her ending, but I didn't see where any of them mattered. Actually, the best part<br />of the ending, for me, was that Peeta Mellark finally got the girl of his dreams.<br />As far as I'm concerned, that covered all the loose threads. Peeta and Katniss's<br />relationship was an underlying theme in all three of the books and is as close to<br />a fairy tale ending as you're likely to get.  My kudos to Suzanne Collins for<br />providing such a wonderfully satisfying conclusion to her trilogy.
B005ZUR724|5.0|Well thanks to real life we all survive..we put a lot of pressure on u folks.. Thanks for ur time. Order an Chaos is pretty dope..
B00005JN2Z|5.0|I would say this is not exactly a chick flick.  A lot of good scenes and a nice twist to the plot.  Has a nice low budget ring to it.  Minimal animation. Tired of big budget duds.
B0013B350M|2.0|I was looking for a new copy at a good price.  Should have read more carefully.  Product of Canada.  Terrible copy.  My old version on VHS looks better than this.  Surprised, as I always thought anything that came out of Canada was top shelf.  This was the third item in this order that I've been disappointed in.  Spend a lot of money at Amazon as I am disabled and housebound.  Not happy.
0930289234|5.0|Novel was excellent. Passed to my son who is incarcerated. Gave him something to focus on. He said he learned a lot more about the characters and he loves to draw. This work inspired him to create his own scenes. Thanks.
B00785P2QC|4.0|this game is fun and addicting. I really like how easy it is to play and the help it gives u to start. I also like that it continues making profits even when you're not playing. the only thing I don't like is how you need papers to demolish hills which need to be purchased.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Speedy, effective, great tool to use between translations. Use it daily, easy search tools, notes, etc. have really enjoyed this app!
B0063IH60K|5.0|If you need to waste more of your time while waiting for the mortician,  look no further.  The price is right and this app is waiting. so go ahead and give this a try!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This collection is a fast and worthwhile read. Good characters, a fast moving plot and some cool ideas in the \\"what if\\" department.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I have never written a review on here before, but I felt compelled to write one now because of all of the negative reviews I have read about this book.  Everyone is well aware what this book is about and after reading many, many, many negative reviews I decided that I needed to give this book a try and make up my own mind, and I am so happy that I did!<br /><br />I stared this book with an open mind and was blown away how much I loved it.  I was completely engrossed with these characters, their lives, their love story and all of the drama surrounding them.  Yes there are some disturbing BDSM parts in the books, but the good parts far outweighed them in my opinion, and learning more about Christian's childhood helps you understand why he is the way he is and does what he does.<br /><br />It was a total roller coaster of emotions from word one to the final word of the third book that kept me never wanting to put it down, getting up early to read and reading at my desk at work.  I loved and hated Christian throughout the entire trilogy and I wanted to slap Ana half the time for constantly giving into him, and it seemed very unlikely to me that someone as inexperienced as she was to act the way she did with him - but as I read and understood both characters more it all made total sense to me.<br /><br />I have recommended this book to many friends and all loved it as much as I did.  Its not for everyone, but if you have an open mind and can get past the BDSM parts, I think you will enjoy it.
B000EHRVP6|3.0|This movie was alright for the most part, but I guess I'm too stubborn to watch the SAW movies over again. This movie just reminds us of SAW,but with less gore.
0345803507|5.0|I am in love with this Trilogy! They are amazing books. Will definitely read them again in the future! Great way to spice up your love life too ;P
B005K17RU0|3.0|Let me start by saying I like this app. I just think it could be better. It loads slow sometimes and I would like if it would show the high and low on the current tab.
0439023521|3.0|The Hunger Games is about a young woman living in a modessocietyty in which her people are exploited and consistently  on the verge of starvation at the hands of the all-powerful government. She is forced to take part in a competition to the death with citizens from neighboring regions, and one from her own. This dystopian tale possesses a great momentum and urgency that pulled me through the books despite my distaste for the way in which it was written.   I understand the fact that this was written for a young adult audience, and went into it expecting to quickly tear through the books as I did. Yet I still felt violated by the fragmented sentences  (the ones beginning with &#34;and &#34; infuriate me the most). I know this may sound silly to many but it drove me crazy. I will give Collins the fact that those severely halted sentences were a kind of crutch that she used to prop up that immediacy necessary to this story of survival which essentially was its best trait- I believe it could have been done without butchered grammar. Instead, it falls flat on its face in style.  Despite being the worst written (again I blame editing), I say skip the other two and stick with this one.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|If you are a fan of pop music you need to purchase this album. Also if you are into EDM this is the album for you. Hell, if you would just like to hear a recording artist who can actually sing then at least give this album a listen. This is an album that can satisfy the casual listener. Lots of dancy beats and a handful of emotional ballads. Forget that this guy was from a singing competition. His music is fresh and catchy. It sounds great in the car, or at the gym  or wherever you just want to escape for a bit in some good funky synth beats with fun lyrics. BUY THIS ALBUM.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend. I thought it would be better than it actually was. It was something to read and pass the time, but I've read better books. There was a lot of sex and I wasn't prepared for that. It was written well but I laughed out loud a few times even though it wasnt supposed to be funny. Decent plot. I'm not going to read the rest of the series though.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This was the first item I ever read on my Kindle.  The ease of use of the device helped motivate me to read it quickly but the book is just an awesome read.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Really loving this album, have it on repeat. Favorites are Shady, Runnin, Cuckoo, Naked Love. Underneath is gorgeous. Pop That Lock and Kickin In are growing on me too. Give it a spin !

B005OK725M|4.0|I was surprised to see this movie didn't do as good on reviews, but if you are into action movies then it is a must own. Lots of great action scenes and not a bad story.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This was great and it was more than I expected :) I love the idea of how they came together. A structure of not getting along but have a common enemy and goal.
B00785P2QC|5.0|great game keeps getting better. enjoyed all the different kinds of homes and entertainment places. I do wish it was not so expensive to buy upgrades.
0307891372|5.0|Awesome, and life consuming! There is no other way to describe the intense dedication involved in this game. Invite your friends over to see you because you won't be getting out much in the next several months. Just a detailed amount of life going on in this game that will change the way you see plants, people, and items here in the REAL world. This is the only game you will ever need, until they produce an extension for Skyrim to extend the enormous map. I look forward to that, but I'm not even close to there yet.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Normally, CDs don't have so many popular songs but this one does.  The other tracks are great as well.  Awesome purchase.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Works great, just applied a few small amount around the CPU. I didn't have any difficulties or dirty mess while doing it. First time using this product while upgrading CPU cooler.
0345803485|1.0|Or at the very least theft of intellectual property. It's an admitted Twilight fanfic where someone hit find+replace and changed the names. Very little editing was done in between its life as a fanfiction to novel form. At one point I started skipping paragraphs at a time (especially near the end when they had sex every few pages) just to get through the plot.<br /><br />Unless I get really bored or I'm feeling more masochistic than usual, I won't be picking up the second book
B0082K9NBC|1.0|Wow. This episode was so wrong its just sad. I had a really hard time watching this episode because of all of the things they got wrong.<br /><br />1. Maxwell AFB is in Alabama not North Dakota. I know because that's were my paychecks come from, and where I did my training.<br /><br />2. Shooting a propane tank does not make it explode. Watch the Mythbusters episode about that.<br /><br />3. Project Starwars was shut down because the Geneva Convention made it illegal to weaponize space. It was never officially tested. Look it up, it's declassified.<br /><br />4. Blowing up a Nuclear reactor does not create a nuclear explosion. There is not enough U235 isotope to react with an explosive. Nuclear bomb=100% U235, Nuclear Reactor 2% U235. Do some research on the subject and you will see I'm right.<br /><br />This episode had so many things wrong it was almost like the writers were just pulling things out of their head and didn't look anything up.
B007MJ9LA2|5.0|This cd is not for everyone , it's more for us who grew up listening to santana and all of his up's and down's from singer to singer and all kind of musician's and not all so good , but we stayed as fans cuase of the outstanding guitar playing , this cd should be a Carlos Santana solo , this is not a Santana Band sound, This cd is a full out jazz assualt ,  Carlos Santana style, something he's been trying to do for years and finely he's got it right ! congrtas the cd is good !!!!! Good riff's some latin sound's, some every thing , there a spanish song here , it might had a chance in the latin market's , but there's a no name singer , almost sound's like john secada , remember him , might have done better to use him as the singer . Love Santana , always will , I just wish he would get back with Gregg Rolie and make a heavy latin rock cd , with the loud hammond b3 , loud guitars and of course the heavy percussion's which made Santana known world wide.
0385341008|5.0|I can't underscore enough how charming this book is. The characters, events and landscape are woven together so casually and effectively, that the reader is left with a feeling of camaraderie (and a little sense of loss for not having more to read). Many other reviewers have presented the book in more detail, so I will stop here. The point is, you should read this book.
B003297I1U|5.0|We love these products. This was our second time to purchase from Bruder Toys and we are thrilled. It was much larger and more well made than we expected. We hope to buy more to add to our collection.
0345803485|5.0|The books (we have all 3) are great fun. The critics seem to focus on style, or repetition of certain gestures, and comments, and totally miss the point of an erotic story with twists and turns, lots of banter, e-mails, adventures, and sex, plenty of sex.<br /><br />I read through about 50 of the 1 star reviews (50 seemed like a reasonable number) and they were the most repetitive and boring reviews I've seen on Amazon. Some of the angry reviews seemed to think they'd discovered a connection with Bella and Edward, how insightful. Duh.<br /><br />These are adult stories, young adults exploring their sexuality, the mystery of their attraction, and a great escape from the constant bad news we hear about this dreadful economy, and wasteful government spending. It makes people wonder just how the really wealthy people have fun, with helicopters, fancy living quarters, etc.<br /><br />Pure adult escape, very entertaining, and suggestion that you look at the negative reviews and ask yourself why they took the time to lambast the book? For what purpose?<br /><br />Have fun, read 'em all.

B00785P2QC|5.0|so I mostly got this game because it was free. I was afraid it was going to bore me to tears, buthaving played it most of the day today I have to admit that I may be hooked! the only question that remains now is... &quot;How NERDY am I?!?&quot; :) This is a great game for wasting time!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Accuweather is my favorite weather app.  The radar map loads faster than others I have tried.  That is important in Oklahoma in the spring.  I use it on both my Droid Incredible and my Nook color.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is so badly written and so trashy that I can't believe that people are stupid enough to buy the two other volumes. E. L James is making money on the debased values of too many people in thsi country. It tends to glorify the perverse side of society and make women subservient to a amn who is a very sick individual. Women need to wake up so trash like this doesn't flourish in the market place.
1401937519|5.0|I got this book for my husband.  He had asked for it and he read it in two days....he's not a fast reader, but flew through this book.  If you are into knowing what's it like to die and come back, this is a great read.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I took a chance on this book and boy did it pay off! It was amazing! The first couple of chapters were a bit dark, but I couldn't seem to put it down and as I read more I loved it more! I can't wait to read more of this new author's works. . . having read all the classics--from Azimov, Heinlein, Bova, etc.--and quite a few new authors I was in a good book drought but the rains came with this little gem. Save some time and just get the omnibus edition . . . I would have paid much more for this!
B00634GHJA|2.0|The app closes upon opening it every time.<br />HTC One X ics. (this seems to be an HTC issue judging by the other customers' reviews.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I do enjoy reading some erotic fiction - but I did find this a little much. I am hooked on the story line and just finished this book and the only reason I am moving onto the second book in the series is because I want to know if my guess is correct. I have to say it was entertaining - and perhaps I learned a thing or two!
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|What a fantastic CD! Order it now, it will not disappoint.  It is very hard to pick a favorite, but Underneath, Shady, Runnin, Tresspassing, OLOL and Naked Love are way up there. Love it!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. its easy to get money and things build right away. you don't need friends to go on and the animals are cute. almost everything will get you money. ITS AWESOME!!!!!
B0034G4P4O|5.0|This is a GREAT movie, and the boys (scout den of 8yr olds) loved it.  I hope they come out with a few more.  The kids have since discovered the old Tin-Tin cartoons on Netflix, and now watch those.  After seeing those and seeing the movie, they did a fantastic job on the characters and story.<br /><br />Loved it.
B000006IUQ|5.0|\\"The Edge\\" is without doubt one of the greatest adventure movies of all time. The flick is outstanding on virtually every level: cinematography, acting, suspense, score, locations, subtext, etc. The story concerns three men who get stranded in the remote Northwest wilderness. The plane crash that causes their predicament has got to be the best such scene ever filmed, looking very real. Although nature itself presents some harrowing dangers for these men (especially in the form of a kodiak bear), one of them finds out that the biggest danger is HUMAN nature -- in the form of covetousness, adultery, greed and murder.<br /><br />Anthony Hopkins stars as an intellectual billionaire who is insecure about his accumulated wealth of (seemingly useless) knowledge, his money and his beautiful model wife played by Elle MacPherson. He's not sure who he can trust, or who is really his friend just for the sake of such. He's a bit paranoid that people will naturally assume his wife married him just for his money. Then he suspects that she's having a fling with her photographer, played by Alec Baldwin.<br /><br />All this is the character backdrop to what is essentially a grand survival adventure. The entire mid-section of the film involves their encounter with the bear that stalks them. This chapter of the story could be called \\"Claws\\" (\\"Jaws\\" with a bear). The men work themselves up into a savage frenzy in their determination to kill the bear.<br /><br />Hopkins and Baldwin must ultimately face their greatest natural threat: eachother.<br /><br />The movie also has depth in the form of a potent message on the human condition and the power of repentance and forgiveness.

B004EPZ034|5.0|As always, Alvin & the Chipmunks didn't disappoint my kids.  They enjoyed the movie, and I admit, so did I.  I like the music.  We later downloaded the music soundtrack (with some songs left out of the kids playlist).<br />Fun movie.

0307951529|5.0|Here's what I like the most about Chris Guillebeau's \\"The $100 Startup\\": The title.<br /><br />That's not a swipe; it's meant as real praise. We need books reminding us that you don't need a million bucks to start a new business.<br /><br />And fortunately there's much more . . . Guillebeau assembles 50 case studies of individuals who have started businesses from scratch, often after suffering a setback such as a layoff or encountering major frustrations with their careers. To me it's the most inviting kind of how-to book, mixing stories with concrete guidance. The stories entice you to imagine possibilities, and the advice helps to put you on the right path.<br /><br />If you're serious about starting your own business, \\"The $100 Startup\\" is not the only resource you'll want to consult -- others will provide necessary advice on bureaucratic, tax, and legal details -- but it likely will be one you return to for inspiration, ideas, and examples.

0553062182|2.0|The Highly Sensitive Person (HSP) is a self-help book written for people who are nervous, cry easily, and can't seem to handle situations that most endure with ease. Be informed that HSP is not an actual medical condition found in the DSM (mental disorders handbook) but rather a personality trait that Aron has heavily researched and defined herself.<br /><br />Much of the book references Carl Jung, a Swiss psychiatrist whose work typically has the final say in all things regarding personality. Aron relies heavily on Jung using his concepts as a springboard to define her own theory. This weakened the book. Her description of spiritual experiences by HSP's was lost on me, and unless you have visions of little people at the foot of your bed who speak to you via telepathy, you may be lost too.<br /><br />There are some strengths as Aron works to help struggling individuals frame their lives and redefine a weakness as an asset. Aron talks a lot about how the brain works and how you can manage overstimulation, enabling you to step out of your comfort zone and be who you want to be. She helps you consider your childhood, school experience, and family of origin to see where this sensitivity may have originated. She lays out typical high stress scenarios and gives advice on how to handle them. Finally, she gives advice on speaking to doctors, using prescribed medications, and working with therapists. It is a comprehensive book, but maybe a little too much so.

1440503257|3.0|This book is not quite what my children and I expected. We have a Star Wars cookbook that is quite fun and thought this Harry Potter cookbook would be similarly loaded with tasty recipes for entrees and desserts related to a favorite imaginary place.  In reality though, it is astonishing how ordinary, even boring, most of the recipes are in the Unofficial Harry Potter Cookbook. There are recipes for fried eggs and bacon, meatballs with onion sauce, mashed potatoes, and buttered peas.  Perhaps some of these foods were mentioned in the books, but who needs help making peas, for goodness sake?<br /><br /> The author also states that certain recipes are included to represent typical British cuisine, though they may not be described in the series. Therefore, we can replicate things Harry might have eaten at Aunt Petunia's or Hogwarts, but they are not as exciting to make and eat as foods that are given attention in the seven Harry Potter novels.<br /><br />There are directions on how to make various sweets, but again, these include ordinary things such as apple pie and rice pudding, which do not really stand out as something Hogwartian. There are several different kinds of ice cream, including tea flavored and brown bread flavored, which are not specifically mentioned by J.K. Rowling.<br /><br />So what are my kids looking forward to making?  Chocolate Eclairs- which Ron have a weakness for, banana fritters - not consumed in the books, but used as a password to get into the Gryffindor common room, and sugar mice from Honeydukes.  They also wanted to make butter beer, but that recipe is conspicuously absent from this collection.  I have heard that it is floating about on the internet for free, so I will be searching for it.
0307387178|5.0|This book is truly unforgettable. I laughed, I cried, I smiled, I pondered. It tore into the depths of my heart and asked me who I wanted to truly be and why we were all here. Jon Krakauer is an incredible author and write this story so poignantly.<br /><br />I have read this book many times since my first read. Each time, gaining a new outlook on Christopher and the life he sought out to lead. And each time, further moved to look at the life I lead and the outlook I have.<br /><br />While I highly recommend reading this book, I also recommend checking out the movie which perfectly portrayed this book. Also, Eddie Vedder created a beautiful soundtrack to go along with the movie.<br /><br />I own the book, [[ASIN:B000ZN802W Movie]],[[ASIN:B000ULQV0W Soundtrack]], and audiobook and recommend this story to everyone I meet.
0345803485|1.0|What a waste of money. I wish I have read all those reviews before I've purchased the book. It is boring, repetitive, it basically is a cheap porn with cheap story line. Any porn actor would come up with a better book.<br />You are better off reading the Twilight series while watching a porn. Seriously, I can not believe that somebody published this.
B003ES5ZPK|5.0|Fantastic, cheap little adapter. I bought it thinking I would use it to plug in some tough cables behind my TV, but it turns out it has a second purpose. I discovered that HDMI cables are not at all flexible and my cable was man handling my Roku box all over the place. This little adapter allows the HDMI cable to come in which ever way it wants and my Roku gets to sit nice and flat on the mantel with no trouble. Love it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book has been called \\"mommy porn\\" for a reason.  I enjoyed these books and I know my husband loved that I was reading them as he saw some positive results.  It certainly schooled me on lots I didn't know.

B001GXYBY6|2.0|With its Candyland color scheme, videogame graphics, and surrealistic backdrops, \\"Speed Racer\\" definitely has the look of an anime series come to life - not a surprise given that the same team responsible for \\"The Matrix\\" movies, the Wachowski brothers, served as the creative force here. Unfortunately, the cartoonishness extends to the characters as well, and that's where an adult audience quickly loses interest.<br /><br />This gruelingly long film - an absurd two-and-a-quarter hours - features Emile Hirsch as the title character who comes from a long line of racecar builders and drivers, including his father (John Goodman) and older brother (Scott Porter, of everlasting \\"Friday Night Lights\\" fame), the latter of whom may have had ties to some mighty shady characters and died under mysterious circumstances on a cross-country rally. Now Speed Racer is going to compete on the same course in the hopes of expunging the overwhelming corporate influence that is corrupting and destroying the sport.<br /><br />At least I think that's what the plot was about.  For to tell you the truth, the time-shifting narrative is confused to the point of incoherence at times, and the villains are strictly from cartoon-ville in their over-the-top two-dimensionality. There's even a precocious kid brother and an annoying anthropomorphic chimp around to serve feebly as alleged comic cutups. And, worst of all, the race scenes themselves are so abstracted from reality that they fail to generate any tension or interest in the viewer.  We never find anything or anybody to root for.<br /><br />Ultimately, \\"Speed Racer\\" leaves us with the question: how can something so impressive to look at be so boring to watch?
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|\\"Trespassing\\" is a cohesive work, starting off with irresistible dance tracks, trending into sublime ballads, and ending in a beautiful song of hope, \\"Nirvana.\\"  There's not a performer today who could sing these songs with such brilliance.  It's a stunning album.

1612130283|2.0|So many inputs have already been given on this book, so I won't add much further to the already insightful and entertaining reviews. However, I'd like to point out a few things:<br /><br />1. The writing style is very juvenile, given that it's a major release, it puts all the talented authors out there to shame, especially to the romance, albeit erotic, genre. Ana's constant internal monologues are very annoying and unnecessary. \\"Holy cow! Holy crap!\\" I really don't understand how a billionaire, Christian Grey, can find someone so immature to be attractive, one that has changed his life as opposed to the numerous other women he's had in the past. I tried to envision Ana as a sexy, smart, witty, intelligent person, as Christian constantly describes her, but I couldn't. It's just impossible. An image of a teenager in a t-shirt, jeans, and sneakers with \\"Holy cow! Holy crap!\\" imprinted on her lips keep haunting me. She's just so plain and uninteresting.<br /><br />2. As much as I enjoy reading romance in which the hero and heroine engage in sex, this book was too much for me. The entire book consists of sex scene after sex scene after sex scene. This book is approximately 400 pages long, and I'd say that about 350 pages of it are nothing but of Ana and Christian having sex. Eventually the sex got boring and redundant, and I just skimmed to the end, hoping to find out about Christian's past. I never got it, and the book ends with a promise to a second book. Now I'm very reluctant to read the second installment, knowing that there will be more sex. Understandably that this is an erotic romance, but when all the main characters do is have sex, then that leaves no room for character and plot development.<br /><br />3. Along with number two, since the characters spend so much time having sex, the whole time I was reading I kept thinking: doesn't Christian have any friends? Or a life? It seems like everything he does revolves around Ana. So how is he a billionaire if his jobis mostly to have sex with her all the time, and believe me, sex is constantly on his mind, no matter the severe circumstances. They have sex at least 4-5 times a day, every waking hour of the day. Except, of course, when they're eating. Basically the book is about Ana and Christian having sex and eating.<br /><br />4. Don't even get me started on his stalking abilities, it's just too creepy for words. Apparently, some women find this attractive, and I believe that's what makes this novel so popular is because of Christian Grey's creepy character. He's worse than Edward Cullen, who is also an expert at stalking. So this modern culture is stalking = romance. Give me a break!<br /><br />5. Does anyone else not notice how all the female characters' names end with an \\"a\\"??? Anastasia, Carla, Elena, Leila, Mia, Andrea...the list goes on. Be a bit more creative now, Miss James!<br /><br />6. As an English Literature student, I appreciate the author referencing notable literary works in the book, especially presenting Ana as an English Lit student. But her character puts all English Lit majors to shame, considering her immature characteristics, she doesn't have any goals, ambitions, or talents. Christian possesses all of them. Ana, on the other hand, only knows one talent, and that is to have an orgasm.<br /><br />Overall, I wouldn't judge this book too harshly. It's definitely not for everyone. As an occasional reader of romance novels, mostly historical, I gave this book a chance due to the increasing hype, and mostly to satisfy my curiosity. As a lover of books, I like to keep an open mind, even to books that my English professors would deem as \\"trashy.\\" Obviously, this book is no literary masterpiece, but sometimes it's refreshing to read a trashy novel simply for pleasure, and this book is definitely it.

1609613937|5.0|this is possible. you can do this.<br /><br />Because of the principles in this book, I was able to reach a healthy normal weight for the first time since I was about 12.  I was always a bit overweight, and I discovered that starch, the ultimate comfort food, doesn't have to be restricted.  As Dr. McDougall says in this book: \\"Moderation is impossible for passionate people.\\"<br /><br />This book IS: solid, backed up by research, and is now going to be the first book I recommend to friends who are wanting to make a change.<br /><br />This book IS NOT: extreme, impractical, or going to cost you a lot of money to live out.  Living with chronic diseases is much more extreme!
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I checked this book out when I heard about it on TV,something about Barbara W. asking Obama if he read it.After trying to read first few chapters I checked second and third book reviews to see if it's worth suffering to read further.No.<br />There are books written by much better writers about same kind of characters and theme that I don't understand what's the hype about this one.Even the freebies you get on Kindle are written 100 times better than this one.Barbara ,what is wrong with you???
B0016OMFNY|5.0|The CD is like new. Played well.  In fact played well about thirty times so far.  Very happy.  Thanks Much!

0439023513|2.0|Before my basic review, I must comment on the appropriateness of this book for children under the age of 16 (mainly because parents young children in my child's school seem to be asking whether these books are appropriate for their kids). This book contains graphic violence in the form of decapitation, child mutilation, dismemberment, flesh melting, and just about any other form. There is also talk of a specific character being used as a male prostitute. If this book were to be made in movie form as it is written, it would be at least an 'R' rating. So, parents beware what you are exposing your younger kids to.<br /><br />Now as far as the book itself, I found this particular book in the series the least enjoyable to read. Not because of all the carnage, but because it felt like it sort of slogged on forever. It really felt like the author was trying to fill enough pages for a third book by having a lot of little side missions and \\"quasi-action\\" that wasn't all that interesting nor entertaining.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I was billed for this product but can get NO customer service rep from Amazon to assist me in loading it to my Kindle. They have no trouble billing me. I despise Amazon. Let's see if a bad review gets any response. Nothing else I tried worked.
B005LAIIS0|3.0|Expecting another pretty decent action/thriller Liam Neeson film I found The Grey quite entertaining, a little disappointed by some poor story, believability and the constant nagging in my head of the \\"seen this done better before\\". The ending is OK, like the rest of the film, just make sure you watch to the end! (hint hint).<br /><br />If I was asked whether it is worth watching by a friend, I'd reply \\"watch Alive (1993) instead - same thing, true story and a vastly better film\\".
B005LAII0I|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. It was a lighthearted, fun romp through an old classic with an excellent cast. I couldn't see anyone else in the roles. Julia was pleasantly wicked, Lily sweet and determined, and Armie playing the prince and managing to be sweet, goofy, and manly, something that only a few actors over the years seem able to pull off. Brendan Fraser comes to mind. Stunning sets and costumes made it visually stunning. Put your feet up and enjoy. Not deep, but definitely pleasant.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I really enjoyed The Hunger Games and Catching Fire. However book 3 in the trilogy Mocking Jay falls off about half way through for me.  It almost seems like she was rushed to finish the series, without giving away any plot or spoilers I just have to say that she took a very strong character and made her seem very weak in the end.  I would reccomend the series to anyone who enjoys science fiction.<br /><br />Overall I give the series a 4 out of 5 and the only thing keeping me from giving the trilogy a 5 is the weak third book.
B0083GPDBO|5.0|I absolutely loved it. I hate when great movies are so short. I definitely was left craving more. I do have to say the movie may have confused me a bit by the trailers (as most movies do) and maybe didn't live up to the expectations in my mind . But with that being said I thought it was a fabulous tale of fate meets the unknown, or the mysterious. In this case i believe some kind of space meteor to the naked eye but upon closer inspection seems extraterrestial. I very much loved whatever they built to resemble it. I really felt they had something special here and could have made this a lot more than what it was. 3 good guys when something actually good happens to them but takes them for a ride they may not be ready for. It's a must-see for some action movie/sci-fi lovers. Bravo<br /><br />~shauns movie review  (Godbless
0439023521|5.0|As a writing and lit teacher at college level, I'm often skeptical of popular late-adolescent fiction.  However, as I die hard fan of dystopias and after rave reviews from my students (across the board), I had to give this book a try.  What fun!  THG is a fast and thrilling read, very accessible, and pure entertainment.  I look forward to books 2 and 3 as good summer reads.
0385534639|4.0|The Night Circus is a very good and entertaining read. Though the storyline does become predictable at times, the narrative is imaginative enough to offset. The multi-layered story left me wanting to read the book again once i'd finished it. A definite thumbs UP!
B00633W614|5.0|The sequel \\"Sins of the Father\\" was really great. A true page turner; only took 3 days to read. The ending didn't leave you gasping like book 1, but I cannot wait for # 3!!!!<br />elaine j,.
B000IKNZMM|5.0|Very good thriller of a movie.  I saw this movie when I was a kid and enjoyed it then as now.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|After reading the sample chapters and then the honest reviews of this series, I am grateful that I did not spend good money purchasing it. Thanks ladies for the advise to skip this one!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|OK, so this negativity is largely my fault. I don't read romance novels because I don't like them. I was reading some news coverage on Obama, and he was asked about a trending book on the show \\"The View.\\" That should have tipped me off concerning the book's content, but I wasn't in a smart frame of mind today. I read a brief synopsis and immediately blew ten dollars (curse that one-click buy). I got about 22% through the book, according to my trusty kindle, and I had to put it down. Once I got through the first sex scene, my interest evaporated. It was like the climax of Ana was the death of my interest. Why? Because the build-up was what interested me. I wanted to see how the author dealt with the issue of this mysterious man and her reactions to him. But honestly, the book is pretty shallow. James is a great descriptive writer, but the book is so narrowly focused on the butterflies of this inexperienced girl and the dark, sexy eyes of this mysterious billionaire, it makes out to be a pretty superficial read. So, I wish I could have my ten dollars back, but that's the trouble with these ebooks. Save your money and wait until this is 15 cents on the Used copy list, unless you're just dying to know what the masses are reading about (why can't it be about something more interesting, like space flight or sustainability? OK I've just revealed that I'm not part of the masses). Anyway, I wouldn't read this had I known it's a romance novel, and I won't ever make this mistake again. Lesson learned!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I'm an avid review reader so most of the reviews about the Kindle Fire Lightweight MicroShell Folio cover by Marware were right on time.  I ordered it, not only because I needed a good cover for my Kindle Fire, which I am absolutely crazy about, but also because compared to some of the other covers, and the cost was reasonable. It was delivered within 3 days and the stand feature is great.  I have had no problems, matter of fact, becasue I carry it in my purse and at times in my computer bag, it has a tendancy to get bounced around but the cover is just enough protection.  It is definately worth the investment.
0345803493|5.0|I can not believe that book two is even better than the first book.  I could not put it down and read it in 2 days.  I could not wait to start book 3.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I like the game and agree with other reviewers about the glitches. When you access the options feature it will show a little arrow which then gives you the chance to go to your home screen.  Reading the app description it clearly States that you can spend real money playing the game.  It gives parents the option to turn this feature off in their amazon account.  I had the game eat my coins on a land expansion I wasn't ready for.  I contacted gameloft and they offered me coins.l<br />I hope this helps you enjoy the fun.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am not really a reader. Everyone at work was reading this book and so I decided to give it a try.  I cant put it down.  Books normaly take me a month to read and I red all 3 of the triligy in one week.  I cant sleep.  I stay up all night reading the books.  I wish I had bought the package of 3 books in stead, I bought them one at a time.  I loved the books and would recomend them to just about anyone (However, I will not talk to my Mom about these books.  They have a major Adult Content disclaimer)
B006OOHYIC|3.0|I gave this game 3 stars because I found it very tedious. The game play consists of a fixed amount of obstacles and pearls. You also have a fixed amount of raindrops per board. You then bounce the drops from one location to the other trying to catch the pearls as they move to the new location. If you like stradegy games such as chess or checkers you might like this game otherwise do not waste your time.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Great app to access your computer remotely especially when you get it for free. Now if only i knew where i left my computer
B007R41E8O|5.0|I had no trouble with this game I really like it.  Very entertaining much longer than mist hidden treasure games.
B007PKOKTK|1.0|I would have given this movie a lower rating but there was nothing below one star.  Even the kids didn't like it.
B0007XT87G|5.0|There's already some very in-depth reviews of this CD and who needs reiteration? Regardless, I feel compelled to chime in with my five stars. This is great music from inside to out without a weak cut in the bunch -- a CD that will continue to grow on you spin after spin. Like much of PT's music, there's nothing too complex about the chordal structures in any of the songs -- most of them are very pedestrian in fact-- but SW just seems to have a knack for turning the ordinary into the extraordinary.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|The book lacks the development and flow of the first book and arguably half of the second book. Unfortunately it confirms the general critique that she should have stopped at book one. The plot is predictable and the world more fantastical than Orwellian. She strains to recreate an entire world when in reality very little is done to paint the picture of the various districts and the Capitol. At moments when she could have really delved into the intricacies of a moment, revelation, or significant plot turn, she jarringly glosses over the material with crude broad strokes that makes the story feel rushed and disjointed.
B00493E1GI|4.0|I usually don't watch a movie based on a book I really like because it is almost always disappointing. Even though so much of the wonderful background had to be left out, the movie did a great job of fleshing out the characters.  I thought the casting was brilliant.  Only Roberts could have pulled off this part and made it believable.  Her non-classic beauty and charisma can make one believe that a single, non-wealthy woman could plunge into three different cultures and find the best and brightest.
0345803485|5.0|Okay.. So this is my first review for reading a book... Well I read all 3 50 shades and I must admit it kept going till the end when I began to cry because I was going to miss Anna and Christian.... After reading this trilogy I will begin reading more books like this (meaning I found out I like erotica) :)!!! Thanks 50 shades for keeping me interested and I am 1,000% happy customer! A must read while being on the beach or laying in bed with a glass of wine!
B001RIY4WE|5.0|As someone who had previously owned the first Blu-ray edition of this movie, I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought this version, but the price was too good to pass up.  However, I can truthfully say that this is the absolute best rendition that I have ever seen, and I have personally watched this film in every incarnation (VHS, DVD, etc.).  The picture quality is amazing... it almost seems cliche to say- but this is the most pristine transfer of this movie, period.  If you are a fan, do yourself a favor and get this- it's definitely worth adding to the collection.

B004C4IKCU|2.0|I recemtly read a magazine article calling Elvis Is Back his best studio LP. Had never heard it so I decided to buy this twofer. Some history is necessary before proceeding further.<br /><br />I was 9 when Heartbreak Hotel came out and probably never heard it during its chart run. Soon though I received Hound Dog/Don't Be Cruel on 78 rpm and Too Much/Playing for Keeps on 45 rpm. Playing for Keeps remains one of my favorite B sides, but I digress. For the couple of years that followed, I continued to get Elvis 45s. Then he went into the Army.<br /><br />Elvis was never an LP artist then, nor were most others. None of my baby boomer peers bought lps. Hell, most of us had those little suitcase-like record players that only play 45s. The only Elvis lps I had before the 1968 comeback concert were the first two greatest hits packages. As I became familiar with his lps I realized they mostly were movie soundtracks and mostly sucked. His studio lps never rose to the level of great but some were good in the later years. Of course as music fans became more retro there would be the great Sun sessions releases but they too were compilations and not true studio lps made to be an lp.<br /><br />So now I read about his best and I'm hooked on purchasing it. Like most of the early Elvis lps there are some good songs on it and unlike the other couple of good ones, there are no Sun songs. Still good is as far as I can go with this. I speak only of the songs on the original release not the added hits that certainly improve its playback value.<br />And I am not speaking of the second lp included, Something for Everybody. Although Something made it to number 1, had I heard it when released, and amongst it's Elvis 45 rpm rivals I would have concluded it sucks. Actually, I've concluded that now, again commenting only on the original cuts and not the add-ons. It seems like an lp to jetison Elvis into the Bobby Darin mold and prepare him for night clubs.<br /><br />I recently bought Elvis (LP) too and (again without the add-ons) it is a better lp to listen to than either of these. So, I am not buying that Elvis Is Back is his best. This getting two stars for it is the twofer being reviewed and disc two drags it down a notchP) too and (again without the add-ons) it is a better lp to listen to than either of these. So, I am not buying that Elvis Is Back is his best. This getting two stars for it is the twofer being reviewed and disc two drags it down a notch
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I just finished reading about 100 reviews and it amazes me how hypocritical people are-Bella can't be preggers cause vamps are frozen,Jacob and Edward are idiots to love Bella cause she's so selfish and noone is that perfect,Jacob should of &#34;ignored&#34; the imprinting cause he  didn't want to give up his free will……blah blah blah ITS A FRIGGIN BOOK ,meant for entertainment!<br />  I loved the whole series and have read them numerous times. BTW-when I read peoples critiques all I do is laugh because-Vampires and Wherewolves/Shapeshifters  Don't  Exist,so get over yourselves and grow an imagination<br />  Everyone should give Meyers' books a chance.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This book has motivated me to write my first product review, and I've purchased many books and items over the years. The author is a true storyteller and can actual write well also. I'm thrilled to have found this book and will be recommending it to friends to purchase. I hope the second book is released soon as I am already anticipating finding out where the story will go. Another reviewer mentioned the author should raise the price. I suggest leaving the first book at the current price to help pull in new readers, but you should raise the price on the second. I would happily pay more for this quality of writing!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have probably read around 2500 books in my short 42yrs, so  for me to call a book unique is rare.I'm noone important,no degrees in lit.,minimal traveling,and I also watch way too much tv;all that being said,I've loved reading since The Wind In The  Willows and before that Dr.Seuss<br />  The first 2 books I gobbled up in 3 days-would of been quicker but I have 2 kids(both schoolage) The third book took longeroy,for a few reasons.Don't worry-No Spoilers-Suzanne Collins ended EVERY chapter with a cliff hanger. Each one is a shocker too.A few times I threw the book down,stormed out and cursed Collins for being so evil(plus a whole bunch of colorful phrases).After half  an hour of deep breathing and reminding myself it's just a book I delved back in(this time to find myself sobbing hydterically for an hour.Something she wrote brought up pain I had buried.I felt like a baby for having a book conjure up so many intense emotions…but,isn't that what a good book does?<br />  My review,in a nutshell,is read the trilogy and discover all the different emotions that they bring  up for you!<br />  Lastly,I would love to climb inside S Collins head and take just 10% of her imagination-on the other hand,who knows what kind of freaky,psychotic thoughts she has pent up in there-BTW that's a complment.<br />  HATS OFF TO SUZANNE COLLINS!!!!!!!!!!
B007V5CF5K|5.0|really enjoying this game!  it's creative with great graphics. good challenge w just enough guidance as needed. no issues on xoom<br />I will be looking for like this.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|What a great writer. Not usually my type of genre but I have been sucked into this series and can't stop reading! Great books
0345803485|2.0|The dialogue between characters was very good, the prose was redundant and while I realize that this is fiction and the Hollywood effect is accepted, I am put off by that. I prefer when the characters and story-line are a little more realistic and believable. I have read other books recently that not only are more entertaining but have real intrinsic value and are not any where near the best selling list. A shame.
1451673442|4.0|The Secret and The Power are  truly inspirational books that can lift anyone from the depths of whatever to an enlightened feeling of being in control of ones destiny .The Magic takes the messages of these books the secret and The Power and tries to create a step by step operating manual for the user to reach this enlightened state. As such it loses the fluidity of the previous two books and I found this step by step approach quite tedious while at the same time appreciating the possibly unintended humour of the carefully  laid out instructions  . As a fan of any positive intention books i applaud this piece of literature and would recommend it to any fan of the secret or the power. However I think that there is more to come from Rhonda that can prove more inspirational and enjoyable to the reader and look forward to her next creation.
B001GCUNWQ|3.0|Good game but the mini games are simple. The story level is fun and accurate to the movie. The mini games are really only 8 with 4 different ways to play them. My son and I beat the game in 3 days.

0345522478|4.0|It's 3.5 stars rounded up because I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />First of all the problems: Atticus is a 2100-year-old Druid, but he's really 21 as his appearance shows. He's bit juvenile and bratty. I liked him more when he showed his experience and knowledge, I don't think there's much wisdom in him.<br />Then: the world building is rich, but being the first book in the series there is some info-dumping in the form of people asking gazillions of questions. It's a bit less annoying than flashbacks or asides, but still something that you notice.<br /><br />The plus side is a rich mythology where all beliefs co-exist, the relationship between Atticus and the earth from which he draws his power, his Irish wolfhound that provides a few comical moment. I liked the secondary characters and I'm going to read the next book for sure, to learn more about a few of them. Atticus' only real weakness is that he's easily seduced, but there is no romantic interest yet, even if there's a sort of harem of goddesses ready to help him at their own terms.<br /><br />Entertaining.
B003MC5N28|4.0|The book overall was great. The Giver talks about a utopian society that aims for sameness. The receiver escapes and causes the memories he has received go back to the people. It is all good except that in the last chapter it is a terrible ending. The receiver is ending his journey and yet the author cuts it off with that he saw lights and remembered love. Then it all ends. No mention of how it was like to get to the houses or anything. Completely terrible ending. And the trilogy as described in wikipedia is loosley connected. In fact, not even the same main character is used in the next book, gathering blue.
B007UXSPK2|2.0|Someone took a risk and put a lot of humor into this story, but I think it cost the film its sense of danger.  I could never really believe that this group of people were involved in something as serious as they wanted me to believe they were.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|a lot of fun. quick and easy to play. even kids love to play just be careful as its easy for them to make purchases if you don't have parental controls on.
B005LAIIS0|5.0|as far as survival movies goes, this is 1 of the most realistic ones i ever saw. everything was perfect, the sounds, the intense antisipation of what may come for these survivors, crazy suspense, the score. and of course liam neason at the helm. as i watched this, i couldnt help but feel like i was with them for i was a little scared for their saftey. any movie that can suck u into its world is a winner. oh and watch the movie all the way till after the credits. this movie shows why liam is one of the greatest actors of our time.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Don't waste your time and money on this worthless book.  I found it rather repetitive, juvenile and  mind-numbing plus the sex scenes aren't even good.  Controlling and mentally abusive \\"hero\\" and inexperienced bimbo \\"heroine\\" do not a good story make.  Silly me, I expected a real glimpse into the S&M lifestyle but light bondage and spanking do not constitute S&M.  I will never read this author again.
B0009VSB06|5.0|I just started the hobby. Didnt want to spend a lot of money if I found out the hobby wasnt for me. Turns out im hooked. No, seriously, hooked. Ive ''been sick'' from work alot latley. This detector is fantastic. Ive had my ace 150 for @ 3 months and have half filled a large mason jar with coins. All kindsa cool trinkets and about 9 billion pull tabs. It has found coins 14 inches deep. 2 weeks ago I found my favorite prize to date. A 1893 barber dime in really good condition too (was only 3 inchs deep in my back yard). The machine does its job. My only complaints are...1) nickles almost always pings on the pull tab icon. Thats why ive dug 9 billion tabs. 2) dug tons of nails when its pinging wildly on coin/silver icon. But thats about it. For what I spent on it theres no way I could really complain. Im sure a more expensive one would have better target ID but this machine is great. I also just got the garrett pro pointer. That is one truly wonderful tool. It saves so much searching and sifting time. Dig a hole, stick the pointer in,follow the beeps. It picks quarters up at around 2.5 inches and dimes around 1.5 inches away. Easy. Fun. Nice way to pass time. And profitable. I would totally reccomend this detector (and pro pointer) to anyone. Its light, easy on batteries, easy to use. Hope this review helps you out. Happy hunting!
0064430170|5.0|Inexpensive, and good book to foster relationship with toddlers. Highly recommended. We spent some good time reading this book, rotating with the caterpillar and other series.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|I have to say right upfront that I don't like much pop music. I don't like the simple-mindedness and arrogance, the lack of freshness, the sub-par instrumentals, I don't like the over-the-board electronics and production. The state of the genre in 2012 is in my opinion abysmal: studded with self-involved \\"stars\\" with little talent, no real vocal ability, a lot of auto-tuning, gang-borne posturing, non-innovative songs.<br />  So, although I am a fan of Adam's first album and of Adam as a person, I was wary of this album. I have spent weeks searching out the accoustic versions of these new songs online, feeling certain that the studio versions on the album would fall short for me.<br />  I was wrong. On so many levels. Adam Lambert has re-introduced me to what I loved about pop YEARS ago. This album is an absolutely amazing collection of songs that speak to your need to get up and dance, to your mourning for lost loves, for your yearning to take a stand for yourself in a difficult world. They are musically, sonically superior to much of what is out there, and Adam's soaring, sure-footed vocals are the icing on the cake. There is not a single song on the album that I haven't played on repeat. The fact that Adam was heavily involved in writing 12/15 songs and is executive producer for the album, speaks to his enormous vision and talent.<br />  As others have mentioned, don't deprive yourself of the Deluxe version: the three extra songs are some of the best on the album.<br />  This collection is destined for greatness when Grammy nominations come around.
B005LAIIS0|4.0|If Hollywood has taught us anything, it's that you want Liam Neeson on your side in a tough situation.  The man can do anything: travel halfway across the world to rescue his daughter; train a Jedi master, a Sith lord, AND Batman; even lead a Scottish revolution.  What, you may be thinking, could a plane crash possibly do to Mr. Neeson?  Ruffle his hair?<br /><br />Indeed, Neeson and his fellow actors walk away from the plane crash...into the jaws of some very hungry, very demonic wolves.  Sound improbable?  It is.  And that's part of the fun.  Because THE GREY isn't an action film.  It was marketed as such, and as you can judge from many of the reviews, this was the viewpoint a lot of people took when watching it.  But THE GREY is more of an existential survivalist film.  These wolves aren't really wolves--they don't look like wolves, they don't behave like wolves.  The plane crash, beautiful though it is on film, isn't very realistic.  The fact that Neeson's character just happens to be a man paid to kill wolves?  Yeah.<br /><br />But Joe Carnahan does what most filmmakers wouldn't dare: he uses the absurdity to tell a bigger, more meaningful story.  Years from now, when people are debating whether or not Carnahan is a good filmmaker, the \\"pro\\" side will put forth THE GREY as their proof.  It is beautifully shot--the wolves are achingly rendered, shadowy creatures whose minimal appearance reflects the overall ambiguity of the film.  (Their attacks are effectively brutal while presenting a minimum level of gore.)  The afore-mentioned crash is stunning, and the various small action sequences are tightly drawn.  This is truly a film to be watched--the special effects, combined with the cinematography, and the actors' rugged appearances, makes it hard for one's eyes to wander.<br /><br />THE GREY isn't without its flaws.  It's slow in spots, and has a few weaker moments--hence the 4 stars.  But when it hits, it hits true, making it that rare film that defies expectations, bends genre conventions, and becomes something truly different.  An accidental hit, you might like to call it--or possibly the proof that there is a great filmmaker lurking within Joe Carnahan's imagination.ons, bends genre conventions, and becomes something truly different.

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I have to say that I was intrigued from the very beginning.  I did find that the final book was a bit of a let down.  Seemed a little chaotic and anti-climatic.  Over-all, I was very pleased!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|For months I waited on buying this book because I bought into the negative reviews. \\"Nothing happens!\\" and blah blah blah. So, I waited. Finally I saw the price also dropped a bit too, and bought the Kindle edition. Great book! It's verbose. Descriptive. I find I like reading about the people, the cultures, the beauty of the land in vivid details. That's why I READ. I'm not a 12 year old who wants his Harry Potter schlock-style story written for...12 year olds. If you liked the other books, you will like this, especially that it mostly focuses on Jon, Arya & Tyrion, which I find most entertaining to read - especially Tyrion!! He's like the Raistlin Majere of Dragonlance, you know he's bad but love to read what he does next. Anyhow, if you had been waiting like me, just buy the book. I can't wait for the next one!
B00633W614|3.0|Bought the Kindle version of this second book in the Clifton Chronicles with high expectations as the first one was a 5-star book.  What a huge disappointment!  After having to pay $17.24 for the Kindle edition of this 352-page book, I was even more disappointed with the contents.  Like many other renowned established writers, Jeffrey Archer seems to be putting less and less effort into his work and has just dished out a book that wouldn't make the book stands if written by another author.
0545123267|4.0|Life is fragile, particularly in winter. In extremely cold climates, the landscape of survival is especially brittle. No one knows this more than Grace and Sam. Their love escapes the boundaries of place, sense and species.<br /><br />When she was eleven, Grace was dragged from her backyard and brutally attacked by a pack of wolves. It had been a long, cold winter, and food had been scarce. As she lay there, calm during what should be her death, one of the wolves pressed his nose into her hand. As Grace made eye contact with the wolf, they created a connection that went beyond the now. Something caused that wolf to become her protector instead of her assailant, and he called off the other wolves, sparing her. Six years later Grace looks for her wolf each winter, for that is when he comes. He waits at the edge of the woods behind her house and watches. Grace's heart aches for him and for the howling pack.<br /><br />Grace, at seventeen, is the responsible one. Her parents do what they like, when they like. They treat Grace as the adult, knowing that she will be fine on her own and will take care of everything. They don't know of her connection to the wolves or her love for her yellow-eyed savior. After a boy is missing and presumed dead because of a wolf attack, the locals decide to empty the forest of the pack. That's when Grace finds the dirty, naked boy with the yellow eyes, on her back porch. Her wolf. Shot.<br /><br />Shiver is a magical tale of love and inevitable change. Who is this boy, Sam, and how did he become what he is? What is the meaning of Grace's pull to the wolf pack? Can their love override Sam's yearly transition? Is Sam becoming more wolf and less human? What makes a family?<br /><br />With her mesmerising writing, Maggie Stiefvater has created a wintry world that can feel snug and hot chocolatey one minute and threatening and sharp the next. It is so easy (and common) to make the secondaries ciphers in contrast to the main characters, but they all feel three dimensional, real. There is an over-riding sadness to the tale; they are doomed, like Romeo and Juliet, right? It seems to have ended before it even started. Or did it?<br /><br />4 out of 5 stars<br /><br />Shiver by Maggie Stiefvater was published August 1, 2009 by Scholastic Press. The remainder of the Wolves of Mercy Falls trilogy are Linger (published July 13, 2010) and Forever (published July 12, 2011).<br /><br />More book reviews can be found at [...]There is an over-riding sadness to the tale; they are doomed, like Romeo and Juliet, right?

1401937519|5.0|Having recently lost a relative, I found much comfort reading this book, and am now living my life \\"fearlessly\\", as the author suggests! In fact, I have purchases a book for a friend who recently lost her mother, to pass on the wise words of the author.
B007PS0X0W|1.0|***May Contain Spoilers***<br /><br />I didn't see the prequel one (which I believe was the third one) but really enjoyed the first two movies.<br /><br />This movie is about an hour and a half long, but if you cut out the action scenes (by action I mean anything with violence in it) you'd have a movie about 15 minutes long that is nothing but back story. The graphics were pretty pathetic and every scene involved the lights flickering off and on. Very obvious special effects, especially in a scene where Selene is holding someone up to a window. That scene the green screen effect was very low quality.<br /><br />My husband and I watched this together, and after and hour and a half we were both like \\"Finally! The movie is really going to start now!\\" and they left a cliff hanger for the next movie instead. -.- My only other comment was \\"the writers were reading Twilight\\".<br /><br />Very unimpressed with this movie. I believe my exact words were \\"that's an hour and a half of my life that I will never get back.\\" I am just glad that I spent $3.99 to rent it instead of $23 to buy it!
B007R12TNQ|3.0|It kept starting and stopping so it was not so enjoyable to watch, I have not order another movie to view and see if the problem still happens..
B005LAIIRQ|5.0|SPOILER<br /><br />If you come at this expecting the story about wolves to be \\"real\\" wolves, you'd probably hate it.  But the wolves are obvious symbols of death.<br /><br />It was a very emotional movie, starting with a near suicide - prevented by the howl of a wolf... and then the accident.  To me it was a story of the wolves saving the men - ironically by \\"taking them\\" - similar to Jacob's LAdder's reference to \\"Demon's appear as demons taking our attachments from us.\\"  In one killing we see how the wolf really is a man's dead daughter, who appears to him, but the others see it as a viscious wolf taking his life.<br /><br />I saw the movie as the men were already dead... and the wolves were symbols of the last step to cross over.  It's scary. It's terrifying.  But that's only the fear of loss.  There is really rest, and it's the loved ones who are coming to take the individuals through the process... which is why the main character of Liam is taken by the Alpha wolf... and none of the others.  Possibly his wife, or father, come to help him move over.<br /><br />He just couldn't see it... so he saw the wolves as icons of the end, of enemies.<br /><br />The wolves wanted him to learn to live life, and face death fighting (not giving up) - just like the poem he often quoted throughout the movie... which is why they stopped the suicide... and yet, they brought him to the end.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|best book ever!!!!i love it so much<br />also the movie is GREAT<br /><br />its kinda sad like kids killing other kids and stuff  buti think its such  good story!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I resisted reading this for quite a while, thinking it was for kids.  The books are awesome, I am glad I got the triology and could just go from one to the next without stopping.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read this book because of the hype and I believed it had to be at  the very least ,an interesting love story. I knew the content when I started the book , but was still appalled. As a volunteer in a shelter for victims of domestic violence-this book sets the tone for violence against women. Many abusers start out as control freaks in just one area -sex perhaps (- all right disgustingly kinky sex,) then  proceed gradually take over more and more of a woman's life.  Then before you know it ,every single facet of your life is under his contol.<br />  I don't see any redeeming qualities in the relationship of Ana and Christian. I don't understand how anyone can have any type of  pleasure reading this book when the main character is a sexually inexperienced woman who gets to call her supposed boyfriend  not his name but sir or Mr.or Master, then gets to be tied up-has to beg for sex- not ever touching him,of course. Then our big manly Christian gets to slap and spank and abuse her.  What fun for her-not to say totally demeaning.I don't care what you it is-dominant- submissive-more like master-slave- How is this supposed to be sexy? Or is it supposed to be okay because he is rich, attractive, buys  her pricy books ,can pilot his own plane ,buys Ana a car,clothes, not to mention  Sunday OBGYN house-calls(as a nurse-this was most unbelievable part-like that happens!) is insanely jealous but hey amazing stamina with very large genitalia? As my  grandma used to tell me-'crazy is still crazy.'<br />  And the characters - a 21 year old attractive college graduate who is not only a virgin ,but also has never had any boyfriend much less even a kiss? The abuse  the 4 year child Christian had ,has forever marked him. Child abuse is truly terible,absolutely horrific & scars do remain.  However he  was adopted into  in a rich family that certainly must have  paid for therapy-and does  he not  still get it? But wait  then of course there was that exciting exposure to sex by Mrs Robinson ,another nutcase. He is what he is because he wants it that way. This book is not satisfying in any way and has set women back  to the times 40 years when they were to be adoring vapid and submissive to our smarter manly men who had control us in every way for our own good !
0385534639|1.0|I normally do not write reviews on books because I do feel that how much you love or hate a book depends on many personal factors depending on what a reader looks for in a book. However in this case I cannot help but be perplexed as to how this book received so much critical acclaim as well as so many great reviews from readers. In all fairness I did not read the entire book because after 100 pages I wanted to poke my eyes out rather than spend any more time reading this utterly boring book. I always finish a book and know that many tend to get better once you \\"get over the hump\\" but I just cannot do it in this case. I can care less if both of the main characters fell off a cliff in the end and in reading other's negative reviews it seems like many things remain unexplained and unanswered. I am not interested in going any further and am disappointed that I wasted $14 on this book.

B0071MDA2U|4.0|Title: Pandemonium<br />Author: Lauren Oliver<br />Rating: 4 Stars<br /><br />My Review:<br /><br />First let me apologize for the voraciousness of my reads compared to the snails pace at which I review them.  Yes, I read this the day after Delirium...but it's only just now that I am getting to review it.  If you read my review for Delirium, you will find that most of my impressions still hold true for this sequel in the trilogy.  To sum up...Oliver's prose is beautiful, poetic, and haunting.  The story is good and the romance enjoyable.  But at times I still long (personally) for more of the science in this nefarious world.  As well as the political backstory.<br /><br />With that being said, let's get to my specific thoughts on this book.<br /><br />Title - ???  Not that it really matters but I really couldn't get Pandemonium out of it.  Maybe?  I don't know.  Yes, the dystopian world is unraveling (as all good book 2 dystopian worlds must), but I'm not sure if it really fit.  I can say that this is really a nit pick because it didn't affect my perception of the story.<br /><br />Julian - For someone who was never allowed to be around boys for the better part of her life, Lena is sure quick to develop strong attachments to them.  :)  So I won't give any spoilers except to say that Lena is thrown together with a boy whose father is basically the bad-guy-in-chief of this world.  It is Julian's father that is pushing for everyone to be cured, even Julian, with full knowledge that the cure could kill his son.  In other words, daddy is definitely a world-class ****.  Lena's kind heart is moved by Julian's predicament and over time he goes through the same awakening that she went through with Alex.  At first of course you are like, 'what are you doing??  Alex just died!'  And you are crazy?  But then you think about the fact that Alex was not from their world and never felt the same loss as part of the awakening process.  In this way Julian and Lena have a lot more in common and you can understand why they would draw together.  And to be fair to the human experience, Lena believes Alex to be dead and she's grieving.  It's not unheard of to fall into another's arms as part of the response to that grief.  In the end, I forgave her.<br /><br />Ending - Again, without any spoilers, I saw the very end coming a mile away.  The whole story away actually.  Did that kill the surprise?  Yes.  But is it a good ending regardless?  Also yes.  Oliver set you up for some SERIOUS Pandemonium in book three.<br /><br />Mom - In the end, I do feel that Lena's connection to her mother is the real pivotal piece of the story.  Many reviewers focus on her romances with Alex and Julian, but for me her real heart is in finding out why her mother didn't come back for her.  If she just didn't love her enough.  Lena has experienced a lot of heartbreak and survived terrible ordeals, but she knows a mother's love when she sees it...in Raven, with her love for Blue.  Raven isn't even Blue's real mother and she loves her fiercely and desperately.  In fact Raven gave up everything in her own society (though her life did totally suck) in order to save Blue's life.  I think that the theme of mothers and daughters is what I find most compelling and I look forward to that resolution in book three.<br /><br />Structure - As an author, I found the structure of this novel to be incredibly interesting and impressive.  It is told all from Lena's perspective, but using two different 'Then' and 'Now' timelines.  I doubted it at times and lost myself a WEE bit, but ultimately I think she pulled it off and I enjoyed the point when the two timelines finally streamed together like tributaries.  It was an interesting and risky choice and showed me how much Oliver has honed her craft.<br /><br />I recommend this to anyone who enjoys dystopians that are very literary in feel.  It's not going to have a lot of science or apocalyptic detail like some dystopians, but the character story is the true heart of this trilogy and that is excellent.

B006IDG2T6|4.0|Sam Harris presents a very engaging and easy to comprehend argument (suitable for armchair philosophers like me) against the existence of free will. He argues we merely perceive the sense of free agency, while much of our decision making takes place as a non-conscious process as evidenced by the huge body of research data gathered by neuroscientists and cognitive scientists over the past decades.

B004UIOUHC|5.0|Several months ago I side loaded Opera Mobile from my phone onto the Kindle Fire. I like it more than the built-in Silk browser. It seems much faster, and I like the way that tabs work on Opera Mobile better.

It works great on the Kindle Fire. When I update Opera Mobile on my phone, I side-load the updated version onto the Kindle Fire, too.

B0083GRZ10|5.0|The arch enemy returns and for once he is more than a match for Bones & Booth.  This was set up when Palant, the new Brainy Extreme Intellect villian out did the Jeffersonian Team back in episode 6, (the one where they made us watch the pilot for, 'The Finder'), before Brennan gave birth.  I can see real potential in this going any number of ways, and we already learn that Brennan's Father (played by Ryan O'Neal) comes to the rescue and wisely makes Brennan escape arrest by being on the lamm.  How a famous author who has been on TV and acts so unnatural most of the time can become inconspicuous enough to escape the FBI and arrest should make for a really good thriller. The threat from Palant is so extreme and far out beyond the Jeffersonian forensics teams standard fare he adds a sense of panic to the episode not seen before.  One could see Booth getting his old sniper nemesis Jake Brodsky out of jail to take down the villian the way he did 'The Gravedigger', rather than risk Brennan and the child with this new threat. Personally I'd like to see them seek out the smartest person they have and use this as the vehicle to bring back Dr. Zack Addey from his rubber room gig at the mental hospital. Zack could out reason the Palant Character and build a trap for him. We find that Angela plays a more involved role than before, and contributes a lot more, as does even Jack Hodgins the 'Bug & Slime' guy she married.  The interplay of these characters has been altered by this unique episode, and it raises the bar quite a bit from the usual \\"Body in the ___\\" episodes we have grown accustomed to watching.<br /><br />I have made the Sherlock Holmes comparison with Bones before, and this fellow has more of that 'Professor Moriarty' feel than any of the previous arch-enemies.  If they add a few more episodes to this and continue the character development and tension this could be the equal of Hound of The Baskervilles, or The Sign of Four tales from Conan Doyle. It is unusual to see a TV series devop this well, and this radically after so long a run.  If they keep it going the Bones series could set records for longevity like MASH did.  I personally hope they do that, it is one of the most entertaining series I have enjoyed in a very long time.  The producers, actors, and writers all deserve great accolades for a job very well done.

B007IPJMCM|5.0|I have to admit, I've taken some time off from listening to Pantera.  For a while.  I wore out every album to a ridiculous point when they came out, none more than Vulgar Display of Power.  This was when Pantera hit it big, when every metalhead in the universe became a fan.  It's great listening to these songs again.  Kind of simple, but it's the truth.  What happened to Dime has made it tough to listen to Pantera albums over the years, and that's had a lot to do with not listening to them for a long time, too.  But this album is so awesome, so perfect for what it was when they released it.  Dime's riffs and solos on Vulgar scream confidence and power; Phil's vocals have a flawless blend of venom and melody; and now, with this re-mastered edition, the album's pounding rhythm gets a bit more punch thanks to a crisp sound.  I've heard some other re-masters that bring the bass up for some added thump, and while it seems like Rex could still use a little more volume here, the drums sound great.  They're right up front, emphasizing the unique dynamic Vinnie gave Pantera's sound.  The guy was like a steamroller on this album, driving every song with gigantic force.  It's still depressing to listen to this and hear how great Pantera was knowing that Dime is gone, but it's a good feeling to celebrate all the unforgettable times I had back when this music was brand new.  They were one of the most important bands in metal history because they were one of the best, and this is their true landmark album.<br /><br />Besides the re-mastered sound, this edition includes the excellent previously unreleased bonus track, Piss.  About half the riffs on the song are familiar because they ended up on the Far Beyond Driven track Use My Third Arm.  But most of the lyrics are different, and so, of course, is the other half of the music, making this song a must-have.  Next, there's a DVD featuring part of a concert in Italy at a huge outdoor festival, with the songs Mouth For War, Domination/Hollow, Rise, This Love, and Cowboys From Hell. It also has the music videos for Mouth For War, This Love, and Walk.  The live footage captures the beast Pantera was onstage as they whip the thousands in the audience into a frenzy, with Phil and Dime owning the stage like they always did.  Finally, there's a nice booklet with an article about the album, including bits of interviews with the band members, and all of the original photos and lyrics from the old inlay.  I can't believe it's been 20 years since I counted down the days for Vulgar Display of Power to hit the shelves, then bought it and proceeded to listen to it roughly three million times.

It also has the music videos for Mouth For War, This Love, and Walk.  The live footage captures the beast Pantera was onstage as they whip the thousands in the audience into a frenzy, with Phil and Dime owning the stage like they always did.  Finally, there's a nice booklet with an article about the album, including bits of interviews with the band members, and all of the original photos and lyrics from the old inlay.  I can't believe it's been 20 years since I counted down the days for Vulgar Display of Power to hit the shelves, then bought it and proceeded to listen to it roughly three million times.

0439023513|3.0|All in all I enjoyed The Hunger Games trilogy.  But this definitely is the weakest book.<br />It feels really rushed, and isn't really a page-turner like the first book.<br />However, it's not like you can read the first two and then not read this one!<br />Don't want to spoil anything, but she ended up with who I wanted her to, so that's good.<br />But I wish Collins would have written a stronger last book for the trilogy, it really seems like this one was half-assed.<br />But, you have to finish the trilogy.....
B005JCT4B0|5.0|I thought this was a cool idea and wish other artists would do it as well. I won't be playing mine since I already own these discs but am very glad I purchased this!!
0439023521|4.0|I figured I'd read the book before I saw the movie so finally got around to reading this.  I really enjoyed it and thought it was a good book.  It was a page-turner and I couldn't put it down.  Read it in an afternoon and wanted to know what happened next.  I couldn't wait for my prime shipping so ordered the rest of the trilogy on my kindle app and read both books the next day.  This book is definitely the better of the three, but it's not like you can read this one and not the next too.<br />It's not really life changing or meaningful literature, but it's an enjoyable and interesting easy read.  Perfect beach reading!<br />I would definitely reccommend this book!!!!

0375842209|1.0|I can't believe all the positive reviews of this book, it is literally the most boring book I have ever opened.  Really wish I got it from the library and didn't waste my money.<br /><br />I really wanted to love this book.  I heard lots of good things and I loved the plot idea of Death narrating WWII Germany.  I kept reading, waiting for this to get really interesting, and it never did.  I don't like how the author writes, and I find the way Death narrates to be really annoying.  But that complaint doesn't compare to how unbarebly boring this book really is.<br /><br />If you like page-turners, this is not for you!!!

B000083C49|5.0|This one doesn't depend on the situation left by the last episode so much, so I don't think it constitutes a spoiler. So far, this is the best of the series. I had so much fun!<br /><br />For one thing, the captured Klingon ship is the only thing available for the crew of the Enterprise to get home from Vulcan. (Just in case you haven't seen the third one yet, I won't tell you why they were on Vulcan, or how they captured the Klingon ship.) As they approach Earth, they find there is a major crisis going on. There is some alien probe disrupting all energy sources and communications, and the President of the Federation orders them not to dock, because it is too dangerous.<br /><br />Spock really demonstrates some excellent guessing in this one. First, he speculates that the reason the probe is stirring up the oceans is that it is trying to communicate with someone or something which it expects to find in the water. So Kirk asks Uhura to modify the signal it is putting out to how it would sound under the ocean. She does, and it sounds like whales. Specifically, humpback whales. Problem is, they have been extinct for some hundred years or more.<br /><br />So the crew decides their only hope is to go back in time to the \\"late 20th century\\" (presumably 1986) to try to find some humpback whales, carry them forward to the time when the alien probe is screwing everything up, and see if they can communicate with the aliens.<br /><br />So a good part of the story is the amusement value of these 23rd century people trying to fake it in a 20th century version of San Francisco -- and Sausalito, where the cetacean research center is where George and Gracie, the humpback whales, reside. In fact, I was living in San Francisco right up until 1986; they were filming in 1985, actually, while I was there.<br /><br />One of the most amusing situations is when Uhura and Chekhov go looking for a nuclear reactor to \\"steal some protons\\" (I think it was) at the Alameda Naval Base. Chekhov, with his thick Russian accent, gives the security people some real problems.<br /><br />But the bottom line is they manage to bring the whales back and the whales save the planet. Incidentally, they are no longer extinct, because Gracie is pregnant. Whether whales can repopulate the oceans with just one breeding couple is not discussed; presumably they can get cloned if necessary.<br /><br />I had a great time with this one, played quite a bit more for laughs than the earlier movies.th his thick Russian accent, gives the security people some real problems.<br /><br />But the bottom line is they manage to bring the whales back and the whales save the planet.

B007BLCGNU|4.0|Good movie about the history of J. Edgar Hoover. My only concern was that they portrayed him as a good guy. He was a good guy when it came to catching and stopping the bad guys, however, he stomped all over our civil liberties in the name of justice. Not nice and not American.
B000HEWEDK|3.0|I believe this was the birth of Robbie the Robot. He shows up in a few other things, of course, including \\"Lost in Space.\\"<br /><br />Leslie Nielsen plays the captain of a space ship (flying saucer design) that is assigned to rescue the survivors of a colonizing ship to Altera 4 that has not been heard from in 20 years. When they arrive, a cultured, mature voice (Walter Pidgeon) warns them not to land. He says he does not need rescuing, and they should go away. But they have their orders, so they are given coordinates for a landing site. They go out and look around, and spot a vehicle coming toward them at high speed, kicking up a huge cloud of dust.<br /><br />Robbie is driving the vehicle. He takes them to Dr. Morpheus' home, where it doesn't take long to find out that all the other members of the crew of the earlier ship are dead, including the woman Morpheus married en route. And all of a sudden, there's his daughter (Anne Frances), very young and sexy, and knowing nothing about men. The spacemen have been out (all male crew) for over a year, and to them, she looks like candy.<br /><br />Of course she falls in love with the captain. Rank has its privileges, you know.<br /><br />Meanwhile, there is some sort of monster out there, and Morpheus says he doesn't know what it is. But he shows the captain and his officers the huge machinery of the Krell, who died out in a single night millions of years ago.<br /><br />Turns out the monster is attacking the space ship, and it's invisible. And if I tell you any more than that, I'll ruin it for you.<br /><br />Good, not great but good, movie. Seen in the context of 1956, when it was made, it's really quite good. But for today, a wee bit corny in spots, a little hard to swallow here and there. But it's a nicely made film, and entertaining.

6305754969|3.0|To say that this is a \\"typical\\" John Wayne film of the 1960s is not to say anything bad about it. Imagine, if you will, that you are a Hollywood producer in, say, 1966. (This one was made in 1966, released in 1967.) You have a character in the script that would be good for John Wayne. But so do hundreds of others; he's a big (physically and economically) star, and he's capable of playing essentially any character for whom a husky 6'4\\" male is appropriate. So Wayne gets to pick and choose, and he did a pretty good job. This is one such job.<br /><br />Wayne plays Cole Thornton, gunfighter with a conscience. He hires out, true, but he picks and chooses -- like Wayne himself does about movies. So when he arrives in El Dorado and his old friend the sheriff (Robert Mitchum) tells him what sort of crook he's been hired to fight for, and what good people he's expected to go against, he decides he doesn't want the job. So he goes out to the cattle baron who had hired him (Ed Asner, who's good at being the bad guy boss) and gives him back what's left of the expense money he has advanced.<br /><br />But the McClouds (the good people) don't know he's turned down the job until after the youngest son shoots at him and gets killed, and the youngest girl shoots Cole in the back and gives him a problem. Turns out the bullet lodged near his spine, and periodically pinches a nerve and paralyzes his right arm. His shooting arm.<br /><br />The doc says he doesn't have the skill to remove it, but Cole should get it out as soon as he finds a sufficiently skilled surgeon. And of course, Cole puts it off. He's so macho.<br /><br />Then he meets Allen Badillion Traherne. Call him Mississippi; he was born on a riverboat, and raised by Johnny Diamond, a gambler. Diamond was killed by a gang of four, and Mississippi has been tracking them down and challenging them. Apparently unarmed, he goes into the saloon where Cole is waiting for his dinner to be ready and challenges the fourth murderer. When the killer goes for his gun, Mississippi reaches behind his neck and tosses a knife that goes directly into the center of the killer's chest.<br /><br />So Mississippi is at odds, having completed avenging Johnny Diamond, and decides to follow Cole to the town of El Dorado. Asked how he knew Cole was headed for El Dorado, he explains that he saw the look on Cole's face when a guy in the saloon said that the sheriff had turned into a drunk. Finally, Cole accepts Mississippi as a traveling partner, and takes him to a gunsmith who sells him a gun that looks exactly like a sawed-off shotgun, though they never call it that. He said it was previously owned by a man with poor eyesight who used to just shoot at the sound of a voice. Eventually, he killed the wrong guy and they hung him.<br /><br />I won't go through the entire plot, but it has enough unexpected twists to keep the audience guessing about how Ed Asner will be defeated. Since it's John Wayne, we know he will be defeated, but he'll keep you guessing as to how it's all going to happen.hen the killer goes for his gun, Mississippi reaches behind his neck and tosses a knife that goes directly into the center of the killer's chest.<br /><br />So Mississippi is at odds, having completed avenging Johnny Diamond, and decides to follow Cole to the town of El Dorado.

B00005JSGK|3.0|This is one of those movies that demonstrates the obvious fact that John Wayne had a lot of fun during his career. And in this one, the audience has a good bit of fun, too.<br /><br />Wayne plays Sean Mercer, a big game hunter who brings them back alive, selling them to zoos. The opening story has his oldest assistant, the Indian, getting gored by a rhino. The team rushes him to a hospital, some five hours away, and while they are there, a cocky young Frenchman asks for a job, hearing that one of his men has been injured. Then the doctor comes out and says the Indian has AB+ blood, which is pretty hard to find. Turns out Chip, the Frenchman, has AB+.<br /><br />The team consists of Kurt, a handsome young German, Pockets (Red Buttons), Brandy, the daughter of Sean's old partner who was killed by a rhino, Luis Gomez, who is Mexican, and eventually Chip, the Frenchman.<br /><br />And then there's Dallas, the girl in Sean's bed when he gets back from the hospital, drunk because they were celebrating that the Indian is going to be OK. Turns out she's a photographer hired by a large Italian zoo, one of Sean's best clients. She's also very pretty (skinny like a model), and it doesn't take long for her to fall for Sean.<br /><br />When the team goes on a camping trip to gather animals, they come to a village where a game warden has just shot a rogue elephant that was tearing up the village. Turns out the elephant had a baby, and Dallas won't let the game keeper shoot it. They buy a couple dozen goats for milk to feed the baby, and name it Tembo, which means \\"elephant\\" in the local tribal language. When a second elephant shows up, the tribe hears about it and creates a ceremony to name Dallas \\"Mama Tembo\\" and an honorary member of their tribe. Eventually a third one shows up.<br /><br />One of the best things about this movie is \\"Baby Elephant Walk,\\" a cute song which was a hit back when the movie was new. It's used twice. The first time is when Dallas takes the elephants to the local watering hole because it's hot, and Sean follows her with a rifle and scolds her for not having someone with a rifle go with her. And then a herd of full-size elephants show up and Sean scares them off by shooting over their heads.<br /><br />The second time we here the theme is when Dallas leaves without giving Sean a chance to ask her to stay, and the team uses Tembo as a tracker to go find her. There's only room for Tembo in the pickup truck, but the other two elephants follow. It's a very funny scene, with the elephants going in and out of buildings following Tembo, who is following Dallas. Of course, she is eventually cornered and Sean persuades her to stay by marrying her.<br /><br />Fun, light-hearted, and with marvelous animals and beautiful scenery.the local watering hole because it's hot, and Sean follows her with a rifle and scolds her for not having someone with a rifle go with her.

B00005ASGG|4.0|Almost the entire movie is Senator Ransom Stoddard (James Stewart) telling the story of Tom Doniphon (John Wayne) when he returns to Shinbone for Tom's funeral. His wife Hallie (Vera Miles) is with him.<br /><br />Senator Stoddard tells about when he first arrived in the territory (which I don't think was ever named) with a brand new law diploma, a bag of law books, and some $14 and change. The stagecoach was held up by Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin) and his gang. Valance is a vicious killer who carries a silver-handled bullwhip and has a slightly hysterical sidekick who sounds like he's ready to come as he watches Valance whip people. They beat up on Rance Stoddard when he tries to defend the other passenger, a widow who does not want to give up the brooch her husband gave her.<br /><br />Tom Doniphon and his man Pompey find Rance on the trail and bring him to Hallie at the Swedes' restaurant where she is a waitress. Hallie is Tom's girl. (Note that she eventually married Stoddard.) When Rance has recovered sufficiently to do so, he takes up washing dishes for the Swedes to pay his rent. (He's sleeping on the couch in the kitchen.) He makes a shingle to hang announcing \\"Ransom Stoddard Attorney at Law\\" and Mr. Peabody, the editor and publisher of the Shinbone Star, agrees to let him hang it up outside the newspaper office.<br /><br />Rance discovers that Hallie has never learned to read, and offers to teach her. In fact, he ends up starting a school. Marshall Link Appleyard (Andy Devine) has all his children by his Mexican wife in the school. There seems to be at least a dozen. But who can run a school with Liberty Valance menacing everything? Rance has been secretly practicing with a gun, and when Tom discovers this, he offers to teach him. However, he plays a trick on Rance that gets him covered in white paint. Tom has discovered that Rance is his rival for Hallie's attention, and he tries to intimidate Rance with his superior shooting and says that Hallie's his girl.<br /><br />Shinbone holds a meeting to nominate two delegates to the statehood convention, which is a hot contest between the cattlemen north of the Picket Wire (which I think is a river), and the farmers and townsmen south of the Picket Wire. Valance has been out recruiting bad guys to throw a fear into the farmers in support of the cattlemen. Valance shows up at the meeting, and even though he's told he doesn't live in the region involved, he bullies his way in and has two of his henchmen nominate and second him for delegate. Rance Stoddard and Mr. Peabody are also nominated. Obviously, nobody votes for Valance except his henchmen. Stoddard and Peabody are to be the delegates. Valance challenges Rance to be outside alone with a gun that night, or he will come and drag him out of the Swedes' place.<br /><br />Valance and his henchmen trash the newspaper office and beat Peabody to within an inch of his life. In fact, I thought he was dead until he showed up at the statehood convention.<br /><br />There are some secrets here, and I won't give them away. Suffice it to say this is not your typical western, even though the cast list might make it sound like one. It is in fact a very interesting and thoughtful look at how the west grew up.rl.<br /><br />Shinbone holds a meeting to nominate two delegates to the statehood convention, which is a hot contest between the cattlemen north of the Picket Wire (which I think is a river), and the farmers and townsmen south of the Picket Wire.

B000B8QG4A|5.0|Of all the Disney full-length cartoon stories, this is my favorite. I love Fantasia even more, but that's not really a story. This is the one that will always tug at my heart. I saw it when it was new and I was pretty new myself: eight years old.<br /><br />Jim Darling gives his wife a cocker spaniel puppy for Christmas. \\"What a perfect little lady,\\" she says, and the puppy has a name. And of course, she is completely charming. So when she just can't handle sleeping in the dog bed in the kitchen, the Darlings let her sleep on their bed \\"just this once.\\"<br /><br />Dissolve to a nearly grown Lady sleeping on their bed. She's six months old and time to get a license and a collar. Her friends Jock (a Scotty) and Trusty (a bloodhound) are impressed. To them, it is a symbol of respectability. \\"Everybody knows,\\" Trusty says, \\"that a dog's best friend is his human.\\"<br /><br />But soon, Lady is feeling neglected because Jim and Dearest are acting so strange. She describes the situation to Jock and Trusty, who explain that they're going to have a baby. \\"What's a baby,\\" says Lady, in one of my favorite lines. Tramp, walking by, tells her they are nothing but trouble.<br /><br />And so it turns out, although Lady likes the little critter once she is introduced. But then Jim and Dearest go off for a vacation and leave the baby (and Lady) with their crabby old aunt. And her two Siamese cats. Their song, \\"We are Siamese if you please. We are Siamese if you don't please,\\" is such fun, as they sing while demolishing the house. When Auntie is finally alerted to the mess, the cats pretend they are injured and that it was all Lady's fault.<br /><br />So Auntie buys Lady a muzzle, but Lady escapes the pet shop and runs away, until cornered by some brutish junkyard dogs. However, Tramp intervenes and saves the day. When he sees she has a muzzle, he takes her to the zoo and cons the beaver into chomping it off, claiming it's a log puller. And in fact, the beaver finds it very useful.<br /><br />So Tramp gives Lady a tour of the town, and then ends up at Tony's Italian restaurant for dinner, where Tony and his assistant serenade them with the beautiful song \\"Bella Notte\\" while they eat a plate of spaghetti \\"heavy on the meatballs.\\" Then a chorus with very lovely voices sing it again while Tramp takes Lady on a nighttime stroll through the park.<br /><br />The next morning, they go chasing chickens at Tramp's suggestion, and Lady ends up in the pound. There's Peg's immortal song, \\"He's a Tramp,\\" with her multi-ethnic chorus, and then Lady is bailed out. But she's put on a chain attached to a dog house in the back yard. When Tramp comes to visit, she snubs him because of what Peg said about all the girlfriends he has had. He slinks off.<br /><br />Just as it starts to rain, a rat creeps unto the roof and into the baby's room window. Lady barks and barks, but Auntie just hollers at her and doesn't understand. Tramp hears the barking and comes to the rescue. He kills the rat, but creates some chaos in the process, including knocking over the baby's cradle. Auntie is just calling the pound to have him taken away, with Lady locked in the cellar, when the Darlings come home. Trusty and Jock track down the dog catcher's van and Jim Darling and Lady follow in the car once they see the dead rat and figure out what happened.<br /><br />In the end, we're back at Christmas (presumably two years from the opening scene), and Tramp is a part of the family, wearing a collar. There are three adorable girl puppies who look just like Lady, and one boy who looks just like Tramp.

B000055Y0X|5.0|Peter Sellers plays three characters in this unique film: (1) Group Captain Lionel Mandrake of the RAF, on loan to U.S. General Jack Ripper in a officer trade program. (2) U.S. President Merkin Muffley, and (3) Dr. Strangelove himself. You will also no doubt recognize George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden, Keenan Wynn, Slim Pickens and a very young James Earl Jones.<br /><br />General Jack Ripper has gotten \\"a little funny,\\" as President Muffley puts it, and gave the order for the Strategic Air Command (planes always in the air) for Plan R, which was intended to be the American response if the Soviets had blown up Washington and higher command (presuming including the President and the Joint Chiefs) were unavailable. A \\"disclaimer\\" at the beginning of the film states that the U.S. Air Force assures us all that it could not happen like this.<br /><br />Anyway, General Ripper not only set the planes carrying nuclear weapons to bomb Russia, he cut off all communication from his base to the outside world so that no one could countermand the order. Only he had the code which could recall the planes.<br /><br />Much of the action takes place in the Pentagon war room, where a huge map displays the paths of the SAC planes as they head for targets in Russia. I'd ruin half the fun of the humor if I told you too much, but suffice it to say that this movie puts forth the obvious fact that nobody -- not generals, not politicians, not anyone -- was prepared to cope with this kind of an emergency. Except Dr. Strangelove, of course. He has an idea for everything. Now if he can only remember to stop calling the president \\"mein fuhrer.\\"<br /><br />One wrinkle occurs when the Soviet ambassador is called in and talks to the Premier on the hot line. He discovers that the Doomsday Bomb will be automatically triggered if any of these planes reach their targets.<br /><br />You wouldn't think the destruction of the world would be funny, would you? Still, when you hear General Ripper explain to Captain Lionel Mandrake why he did it (\\"our precious bodily fluids\\"), and then see Keenan Wynn soberly warn that if he obeys Captain Mandrake and shoots the lock off the Coke machine to get change for the pay phone so he can call the President, the Captain will have to \\"deal with the Coca Cola Company,\\" you just can't help laughing. There are hundreds of laughs in this movie, just to show you that annihilation of the planets human and animal life is indeed a laughing matter.<br /><br />Try to believe the Air Force's disclaimer, and learn to stop worrying. After all, the Soviets are no more, so we don't have to worry about the bomb anymore, right? Isn't that right? Sure it is!

Except maybe my friend Paranormal Princess, who is herself a stage magician.<br /><br />Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) worked together as \\"shills\\" that tie up the magician's assistant, who just happens to be the wife of one of them. At one point, they decide to try a different knot to tie her hands. Her husband ties her feet. She is put into a tank of water which has a trick lock; as soon as the curtain is put over the tank, she's supposed to spring the trick lock and get out of the tank. Something went wrong, and she drowned.<br /><br />The husband's theory is that his partner who tied her hands used the wrong knot. He admits he does not know for sure what knot he used. Thus begins a deadly rivalry between the two that seems to know no limits.<br /><br />When it gets really complicated, one drops a hint to the other than Nikola Tesla is the key to a really impressive trick that he can't figure out how he did it. So he goes to Colorado Springs, where Tesla has electrified the entire town in exchange for being permitted to use the electrical plant for his experiments in the middle of the night when everyone is asleep.<br /><br />The question becomes did Tesla build an apparatus for the first magician? Is the one he built for the second real magic? And after awhile, you have a more general question: what the heck is going on? It is not made easier by the story being told out of time sequence. It starts with the trial where one of the magicians is charged with murdering the other. Then it jumps back and forth without much regard to whether or not the audience is totally confused, because that's what magicians do: they totally confuse their audience.<br /><br />This movie is very, very successful at doing that, although I had some pretty clever guesses as to what happened along the way. I didn't really figure out very much, but I think it's impressive that I got anything right.ened along the way.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I know i'm just adding to the like 3,000 people who have already reviewed this product...but believe the hype.  I do this video (or ripped in 30) every day before work.  I did go through it to start in order, waiting until i felt comfortable to go onto the next level, but after the first 30 days, i just started mixing it up.  I don't find it boring to do just a few videos or a few work outs on a rotation, but i can see that people might.  I started in February and its May, and I really have done it almost every week day since then (with some exceptions) and I have noticed a huge difference in my fitness level. I can do the arm moves 10 times better than when i started.  My ab strength has improved in leaps and bounds.  By the time you feel like you want to stop, its 5 minutes from being over.  I've recommended this video to no less than 5 of my friends. Sometimes i feel like i talk about it too much.  Buy it, its so worth the $6.  I canceled my $50 a month gym membership and am in better shape than i was when i had one.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|The scene is 1950s in one of New York City's poorer neighborhoods. If you can accept that juvenile delinquents are all attractive, and sing and dance superbly, you can appreciate this retelling of Romeo & Juliet with the Jets and the Sharks substituting for Montagues and Capulets. With music by Leonard Bernstein and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim. It got ten academy awards, including best picture. It earned them all.<br /><br />The Jets are native-born, but probably second generation Polish, Italian and the like. The Sharks are Puerto Ricans. Tony (Richard Beymer) is a Jet, and Maria (Natalie Wood) is the sister of Bernardo, the head of the Sharks. But even the fights are carefully choreographed dances, and this creates an agreeable unreality, which is heightened by sets and lighting and costumes and everything. Little details, like the window at the school auditorium that looks like a cathedral window when Tony starts singing about Maria.<br /><br />The story is basically told in its songs, and they are beautiful. If you don't have the DVD, I hope you at least have a CD of the sound track, because it is just superb.<br /><br />The Jets Song is sung a couple of times under various circumstances, but it is basically the bragging song of the Jets. \\"When you're a Jet it's the swingingest thing. Little boy you're a man; little man you're a king.\\"<br /><br />Something's Coming is Tony's song that he sings over wooden crates of Coke bottles, where he's stocking Doc's store. He anticipates something wonderful is coming to him. (Namely, love.)<br /><br />Maria is the song Tony sings about her once she has been hustled out of the school dance by Chino, the Shark her brother Bernardo expects her to marry.<br /><br />America is an amusing song describing the different perceptions of the Puerto Rican girls compared to the boys. \\"Puerto Rico, you lovely island, Always the hurricanes blowing, and the money owing, and the babies crying, and the bullets flying.\\" \\"I like to be in America, OK by me in America, Everything's free in America\\" sings Anita, and Bernardo finishes the line \\"For a small fee in America.\\"<br /><br />Only You is a short intro to Tony and Maria's \\"balcony scene\\" (on a fire escape; this is New York City), and then the first version of Tonight is their duet.<br /><br />Gee, Officer Krupke is the Jets' mocking song to \\"explain\\" themselves to an absent Officer Krupke. \\"Dear kindly Sergeant Krupke you gotta understand, it's just our bringing upkey that gets us out of hand. Our fathers all are junkies, our mothers all are drunks; Golly Moses, naturally we're punks.\\"<br /><br />I Feel Pretty is Maria's song in the bridal shop where she works. \\"I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel giddy and witty and bright, and I pity any girl who isn't me tonight.\\"<br /><br />Then Tony sneaks in the back door and they play with the dummies that display wedding gear, introducing Mama and Papa, and Anita as maid of honor, Biff as best man. One Hand, One Heart is the song where they magically transform the bridal shop into a chapel and kneel to make their vows.<br /><br />Next comes a complicated production of Tonight which has a variety of people anticipating what's going to happen. The Jets and the Sharks are going to rumble, Anita's going to \\"get her kicks\\", and Tony and Maria are going to be together. \\"Today the minutes seem like hours, the hours go so slowly, and still the sky is bright. Oh Moon, grow bright and make this endless day endless night, tonight.\\"<br /><br />The two gangs have agreed that it's going to be a fair fight between Bernardo on behalf of the Sharks and Ice on behalf of the Jets. But it gets out of hand, and Bernardo stabs and kills Riff, then Tony stabs and kills Bernardo. They all run away when they hear sirens.<br /><br />Tony climbs in Maria's window just after Chino has told her that Tony has killed her brother. After she gets over pounding on him and calling him a murderer, he tries to explain and she forgives him. They sing There's a Place for Us, convinced that they must go away together.<br /><br />One of the most unrealistic scenes and songs is Play It Cool, sung by Ice to Action to explain that that's what the Jets will need when the cops start asking questions.<br /><br />When Anita comes home and finds Tony and Maria in bed together, she knocks on Maria's bedroom door, which is not usually locked. Tony climbs out the window and when Maria opens the door for Anita, she sings A Boy Like That to Maria. \\"A boy like that wants one thing only, and when he's done he'll leave you lonely. He'll murder your love; he murdered mine.\\"<br /><br />Maria counters with I Have a Love, and Anita accepts it. Then the detective shows up and Maria asks Anita to go to Pop's to \\"get a headache remedy,\\" but really to tell Tony why Maria is going to be delayed meeting him. But when the Jets hassle her to the point where they seem like they would have raped her if Pop hadn't intervened, she is really angry. She says to tell Tony that Maria can't meet Tony because Chino got a gun and killed her.<br /><br />Tony goes screaming for Chino to kill him too. But Maria is not dead, and she finds Tony. Just as they come together, Chino shows up and shoots him.ng There's a Place for Us, convinced that they must go away together.<br /><br />One of the most unrealistic scenes and songs is Play It Cool, sung by Ice to Action to explain that that's what the Jets will need when the cops start asking questions.<br /><br />When Anita comes home and finds Tony and Maria in bed together, she knocks on Maria's bedroom door, which is not usually locked.

B00006G8HX|4.0|WARNING:<br />If you have not yet seen the earlier movies in this series, THIS IS A SPOILER! I cannot tell anything about this movie without explaining its connection to \\"The Wrath of Khan.\\"<br /><br />So anyone still reading has either already seen \\"The Wrath of Khan\\" or doesn't mind spoilers. Right? OK: here we go.<br /><br />At the end of the last episode, Spock was dead, having sacrificed himself to save the Enterprise. He was placed in a coffin-capsule and shot to the surface of the Genesis planet. So Kirk and the remaining crew returned to the Starfleet dry dock for extensive repairs. Unfortunately, the bureaucrats see it differently: they are going to scrap the Enterprise. It's 20 years old, there's a whole new generation of ship design, and it's no longer worth repairing.<br /><br />Then Spock's father Sarek visits Kirk and discovers that Spock had shared his \\"essence\\" with McCoy just before he died. Sarek says that Kirk must bring Spock's body and McCoy to the sacred mountain on Vulcan \\"so that both can have peace.\\" Obviously, having Spock in his head is driving McCoy crazy, literally. But the commanding officer of the Starfleet denies Kirk the ship he would need to go fetch Spock's body, and also tells him that the Genesis planet is quarantined and top secret.<br /><br />So Kirk hijacks the Enterprise with the assistance of Sulu, Chekhov, McCoy, Scotty, his son David, Saavik and (though she stays back at Starfleet HQ) Uhura. They get to Genesis only to find a cloaked Klingon ship that starts firing on them. Fortunately, they have to lower the cloaking device in order to fire, so Kirk gets a second or so to see them and fire his own weapons.<br /><br />Well, there's a lot more to the story, but the bottom line is they manage to destroy the Klingons, get Spock (in a sense) and McCoy to Vulcan, and restore them to \\"normal.\\" But Kirk's son David sacrifices himself to save Saavik and Spock. And the planet Genesis destroyed itself just after they left. Apparently David had used the wrong sort of material for the Genesis Effect, and it was unstable.<br /><br />I enjoyed this one, although not quite as much as \\"Wrath of Khan.\\"y David had used the wrong sort of material for the Genesis Effect, and it was unstable.<br /><br />I enjoyed this one, although not quite as much as \\"Wrath of Khan.\\"

0767847431|3.0|Ah, yes, Ray Harryhausen and his special effects! This is probably the last great master of special effects before computers took over. And he certainly used every trick in the book in this film.<br /><br />Sinbad (John Phillip Law), one of several rather sexy men in this film that has them stripped to the waist often enough to be fun, takes the Grand Vizier of Marabia on a voyage to the Island of Lemuria. The Vizier was horribly burned when something blew up right in his face, and so he wears a gold mask through which only his eyes can be seen.<br /><br />Just before he leaves on the voyage (\\"We sail with the tide\\"), a merchant persuades him to take his stoned-out bum of a son with him. His payment is to be 400 pieces of gold. Sinbad doesn't want the kid (although I did; he's hot once he wakes up), but a slave girl appears who has a tattoo of a single eye on the palm of her right hand. So the merchant throws the girl, Margiana, into the deal, and Sinbad agrees.<br /><br />The reason the Vizier must get to the island involves a wicked magician, Prince Koura, who is attempting to put together three pieces of a gold \\"circle\\" which is elaborately intertwined openwork studded with gems. Sinbad is wearing one part on a thong around his neck, the Vizier has another, and they have no idea where the third part is.<br /><br />I don't want to give away the plot, but I will try to list just some of the special effects animations: Sinbad's ship's figurehead comes to life, there's a small \\"homunculus\\" which looks like a humanoid lizard with bat-like wings, a cyclops centaur, a griffin or something (winged beast rather like a lion), a statue of Kali (six arms; that's Kali, right?) that comes to life AND has a sword in each of her six arms, and various effects on the settings, as well. A fountain that changes color, for example.<br /><br />It's a fun story, the younger characters are all sexy including, of course, the slave girl. It's not great art, but it is fun.

B000VWYJ86|2.0|As everyone knows by now, Matt Damon is the essentially invincible Jason Bourne. He has ice water in his veins, a computer for a brain, and physical strength and agility an Olympic athlete would envy. He's also the best at car chases, car crashes, motor scooter chases (up and down stairs, etc.), chases on foot, fights with any sort of weapon or none at all, and inspiring women to risk everything helping him.<br /><br />Of course, he has some formidable opposition, too. He has worked out that the CIA is behind whatever it is that was done to him, and they are after him with all their technology, a huge staff of \\"assets\\" and a thoroughly cold-blooded chief. The action is so fast that you would probably need to slow down the speed four or eight times to actually figure out what's going on. If you feel you need to know what's going on. Ultimately, the action seems to be more for its own sake than to advance the story line. I won't call it plot, because there's already enough plotting in the story already.<br /><br />If you've read the books, as I have, don't count on having any major advantage in figuring out what's going on. The details are enough different from the books that you can't trust them, and nearly all the characters have uncertain loyalties and motives. Except the women somehow end up helping Jason. Wonder why? Two stars is the best I can do, though I do like Matt Damon. I can't take the pace.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|But in a lot of ways Steve Jobs wasn't a nice or good person. And the book is open and honest about that. To me, that is what made the book worth reading.<br /><br />To see the mistreatment of relatives, lovers, and employees documented was good. But on the other hand, the book argued that Steve Jobs was a jerk, but that change agents had to be jerks. I think there is a little bit to that argument, but I also think that the way he handled himself at times was unprofessional and had he been anywhere but the company he founded he would've joined the likes of Scott Thompson and been kicked to the curb pretty quickly.<br /><br />The author couldn't predict the antitrust suit that was filed a year after this book was released. Still, the fact that that was only mentioned in passing diminished the book for me. As an avid reader, I think the outcome of that case is crucial to access to books going forward. It's not whether the book is $9.99 or $12.99 that matters--it's that if Apple is found not guilty, publishers will be free to set similar terms and not compete on library books. And that is (in my view) an issue that will determine whether democracy survives the age of ebooks.
B000GPIPT2|3.0|Yes, the one with Boris Karloff. One of the great horror films of all time, but I must admit that it's possible to see once too often. I like it for historical reasons, and I'm quite a Karloff fan, but once you know what happens, the bloom goes off most horror films. After all, how can you be scared when you know what's going to happen?<br /><br />By the way, Frankenstein's assistant is NOT named Igor. He may have been in the book (Update: He wasn't), but in this film he is Fritz. Actually, I thought Victor was Dr. Frankenstein's first name, But it's Henry. Victor is the friend who is to be best man at Henry and Elizabeth's wedding.<br /><br />I expect you already know the story, and the film. But just in case you don't, Henry Frankenstein was a medical student but quit because he wanted to do experiments his teacher felt were over the top. He wanted to create life. He didn't really start from scratch, of course; he started with spare parts from corpses. Fritz went and stole a brain from the medical school lab. When something startled him and he dropped the normal one he had picked up (oddly, he takes the lid off the first jar before he picks it up, but leaves the lid on the second one), he took the other one, which had come from a pathological criminal. Not only were the jars so labeled, but the professor had been describing them in the class that was taking place while Fritz stared in the window.<br /><br />Anyway, Henry used the criminal's brain and some parts, sewed them all together and was ready for a good electrical storm to provide the electricity for his fancy apparatus. Meanwhile, Elizabeth and Victor, who is obviously in love with Elizabeth himself, are sufficiently disturbed by a letter Henry wrote to Elizabeth that they decide to go see his old professor. The three of them then go up to the spooky old tower where Frankenstein is conducting his experiments, arriving in the middle of a downpour as the storm Henry had been waiting for reaches its height. Reluctantly, he lets them in to get out of the rain, and then when accused of being mad, decides to let them see the experiment, as well.<br /><br />He raises the inert monster on a platform up to the roof, where the electricity of the lightening can operate the apparatus, and sure enough, it works. \\"It's alive! It's alive!\\" cries Frankenstein in one of the classic scenes in the movie.<br /><br />But the monster is just that; he does not know his own strength, and even when obviously charmed by a little girl who shares her daisies with him, he ends up killing her by accident. Her father carries her through the middle of the happy throng celebrating Henry and Elizabeth's upcoming wedding, and quiets the crowd as they realize he's carrying his dead daughter. They go fetch torches and hunting dogs and take off looking for the monster to destroy him. They track him to an old mill, and burn it down.<br /><br />The thing that makes this movie unique is Boris Karloff's essentially pantomime performance (the monster cannot speak, but only make inarticulate sounds). He makes it clear that the monster is frightened, bewildered and confused, has no idea what has happened to him, does not know his own strength, and becomes a somewhat sympathetic character. Movie audiences were not accustomed to feeling pity for a murderous monster, and it thrilled them. The movie was a huge money maker and guaranteed Karloff's career.<br /><br />It's one of those you simply have to see at least once, if only because it has become such a cultural icon. Also, it is entertaining, especially if you like horror films.eluctantly, he lets them in to get out of the rain, and then when accused of being mad, decides to let them see the experiment, as well.<br /><br />He raises the inert monster on a platform up to the roof, where the electricity of the lightening can operate the apparatus, and sure enough, it works. \\"It's alive!

There was some kind of time error that prevented me from being able to collect money from my buildings. The whole game is based on collecting profits from your buildings so this was a major issue.

B00003CXCD|4.0|In the 1950s, one of the ways Europe attempted to recover from World War II was to promote tourism. This movie is one of those attempts, and no doubt one of the most successful.<br /><br />Gregory Peck is a reporter for an American news syndicate. Audrey Hepburn is Princess Anne of some unnamed European country. Eddie Albert is a photographer who has frequently worked with Peck in the past.<br /><br />The Princess has been touring Europe, doing the \\"so pleased to meet you\\" and the canned speeches and the poised, gracious young princess. But she gets so tired of it she starts to scream and cry, so her doctor gives her a sedative. Before it has time to take effect (which is poetic license, since it was given in a shot, which would take effect at once), she dresses in a simple skirt and blouse and sneaks out of the embassy where she has been staying during her tour of Rome.<br /><br />Peck finds her asleep on a bench, but does not yet recognize her as Princess Anne. Out of kindness (presumably), and thinking her drunk, he takes her home with him in a cab. He tried to get her to say where she lived so he could send her home, but she just says \\"the Coliseum,\\" so what can he do? He takes her home, loans her a pair of his pajamas, and then goes out for a cup of coffee while she changes, telling her she can sleep on the couch. But when he returns, she's sound asleep in his bed. So grumbling, he goes to sleep on the couch.<br /><br />He wakes up at like 11:00 a.m., and he was supposed to have interviewed the Princess at 10:45. So he hurries to his office and tries to persuade his boss that he has done the interview. However, the boss has a local paper telling him that the Princess has fallen ill and canceled all her appointments. He waves it under Peck's nose, at which point he freaks out because the picture is of the girl asleep in his apartment.<br /><br />She has told him that she has run away from her school, and indeed she looks young enough to be a high school student. So he does not let on he knows she's really the princess. After some finagling, he manages to convince her that she deserves an entire day for her Roman Holiday, and they start at the sidewalk cafe where he knows he will meet up with photographer Eddie Albert. Played for slapstick, he eventually is able to get Albert aside and tell him what's going on. Albert has a tiny camera set into a cigarette lighter, and he snaps pictures of the princess and her newsman escort (he says he's a fertilizer salesman) all over town.<br /><br />One great scene is the Mouth of Truth. There is an ancient sculpture, a god-like mask, set into a wall. The mouth is open, and Peck tells the princess that there is a legend that if you put your hand in its mouth and you are a liar, the hand will be bitten off. She's obviously nervous, since after all she is a liar, having said she was a school girl. But she puts her hand in the mouth anyway, just for a second. Then she tells Peck it's his turn. He puts his hand in, and then pretends it is being bitten off, whereupon the princess jumps and screams and tries to drag him away. He pulls his arm out with his hand stuffed up his jacket sleeve, and she screams again, and he pops the hand out, showing he was just teasing her.<br /><br />The special features of the DVD tell us that when this scene was originally planned, Peck had the idea, and nobody told Audrey Hepburn that he was going to pretend to be bitten. So her shock was completely authentic, as was her flying at him with \\"Oh, you!\\" and pummeling him. I daresay she expected it to be edited out of the film, but the director loved it, and they used it.<br /><br />There's lots more, including some \\"plain clothes investigators\\" from the princesses home country who are all dressed in black suits with black fedoras, and look comically like \\"The Blues Brothers.\\" They attempt to capture the princess and take her back to the embassy, but with the help of nearly everyone on the dance barge, she escapes by jumping into the river right after Peck, and they swim to the far shore.<br /><br />Of course, she eventually has to go back to her duties, and the closing scene is a press conference where she discovers that Peck and Albert are with the press. It's all quite a lot of fun, a really pretty picture, and Hepburn makes a superb princess. She's so graceful and high class!s by jumping into the river right after Peck, and they swim to the far shore.<br /><br />Of course, she eventually has to go back to her duties, and the closing scene is a press conference where she discovers that Peck and Albert are with the press.

B00003CXC7|4.0|James Stewart and Grace Kelly, two of my favorite actors! Alfred Hitchcock, one of my favorite directors! How can I lose?<br /><br />Stewart is an action photographer whose leg was broken in getting a special shot of a car race. He's in a cast, and bored to tears with nothing to do. So he looks out his rear window into all the other windows that face it. We get to follow quite a few sub-plot stories along with him in those rear windows. Because this is Hitchcock, several are pretty amusing.<br /><br />Grace Kelly is in love with Stewart, but she's just \\"too perfect.\\" She's a buyer for a top dress shop, or perhaps the dress department in a posh department store. Evidence: in 1954, the dress she's wearing is \\"a steal\\" at $1,700. That's at least $30,000 today.<br /><br />He goes gallivanting all over the world to take pictures; she is strictly Park Avenue. She says she could get him great work doing portraits and fashion photography, but he hates the idea. What can they do?<br /><br />They can turn amateur detective watching Raymond Burr apparently murder his wife and cut her up into pieces!!!<br /><br />Of course, being a photographer and an outdoorsman, Stewart has binoculars and telephoto lenses. He also has a friend who is a detective. He tells his friend about his suspicions, and the friend is skeptical, but checks out the facts. It seems Burr has covered his tracks well enough that Stewart's friend decides there's been no murder. The wife just went on a visit in the country for her health.<br /><br />If I tell you any more, it will wreck it for you. And this is one mystery movie you really don't want wrecked for you. I loved it.
B002PHN76K|5.0|Consider yourself lucky enough to see this film.  It truly is a hidden gem of a film.  \\"IF\\" you are a person who's interested in the characters of a movie instead of just getting suspense, drama, or action, then this movie might be as pleasurable to watch as it was for me.  This amazing thing about this movie is how the two characters, Jesse (Hawke) and Celine (Delpy), can carry the movie from the beginning to the end without breaking too much of the beauty of in their conversations.  In these conversations, is where one can connect to their views and ideas about each character.  Hawke and Delpy work wonderfully bringing the viewer along on these two \\"sudden\\" strangers' lives and how they magically become drawn to one another through their one day experience with each other.  Each shares his/her opinions, fears, and dislikes as they slowly get to know each other and both become almost inseparable when eventually they will soon have to part with one another once the sun rises.  Their relationship leads to a very climatic ending which you have to see for yourself.  It is a very engaging film especially if you love to learn about the beauty of character interaction.
B00005JKGZ|4.0|OK, I'm biased. I love St. Louis. Been here a year now [in 1008] and I feel quite at home. So if you're going to meet me, it will have to be in St. Louis. OK, University City, but that's in St. Louis County.<br /><br />It's all about the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, which was referred to as the world's fair, in 1904. Well, actually, it's all about the year leading up to the fair; the fair itself is at the very end of the movie.<br /><br />Vincente Minnelli was the Director; Judy Garland was the star, and they fell in love during the filming of this movie. So there's a special sort of romantic halo about it. Margaret O'Brien plays Judy's little sister. She has another somewhat older little sister, and a sister older than she is. Also one brother, also older than her. The family includes her mother and father, her grandfather, and their housekeeper/maid who acts like one of the family. They live in one of those gorgeous Victorian houses that still survive in considerable numbers in St. Louis.<br /><br />Everyone is extremely hyped up about the fair, although when the story opens, it's still nine months until opening day. But the city is all abuzz with it's planning and construction. Then Papa comes home with big news: They are moving to New York just after Christmas so that he can be in charge of a New York office of his firm (he's a lawyer).<br /><br />Nobody wants to leave but him. The oldest girl, Rose, is halfway engaged. Esther (Garland) is falling in love with the boy next door. Their brother is in college, the two little girls both have friends they don't want to leave. Tootie, the youngest (Margaret O'Brien) says it will take her weeks to dig up all the dolls she has buried.

She has four fatal illnesses!)<br /><br />The movie is a musical, and of course Judy Garland sings most of the songs, although not always as a solo.

B00003CXCW|4.0|This is a very, very spooky movie. Strange in a great many original ways. The only thing I can think of that comes anywhere close is \\"Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?\\" and that's not very close at all. This is Hollywood telling about Hollywood's dark side. It opens with a corpse floating in a swimming pool. So it's a little disconcerting that the narrator of the movie is William Holden, who plays Joe Gillis, the guy floating in the pool. Narrating from beyond the grave? Not exactly; the opening scene they decided not to use had him telling it to the other corpses in the coroner's morgue.<br /><br />Gloria Swanson plays Norma Desmond, a typecast role if ever there was one. Desmond had been a real big star in the silent movie days, and is still quite wealthy, and imagines she is going to make a \\"return\\" to the movies (she hates the word \\"comeback\\"). Joe Gillis, a rather failing young screenwriter (William Holden) is being pursued by the repo men in his car on which he is three months late with his payments when a tire blows and he turns into the driveway of an old mansion on Sunset Boulevard.<br /><br />It's Norma Desmond's place. Turns out she has spent some ten years writing a screenplay for \\"Salome,\\" and naturally expects to play the lead role. She talks Joe into reading the script, and of course it is awful. So after some hesitation, he agrees to rewrite it for her. She says she's going to pay him $500 a week.<br /><br />She manipulates him every step of the way, aided and abetted by her butler, Max von Mayerling, played by Erich Von Stroheim. We find out later that Max had been the director that had first discovered her, and also her first husband. He protects her by protecting her illusions.<br /><br />At the New Year's party he went to after leaving the one Norma had elaborately staged just for the two of them, he goes to a party hosted by Artie Green (Jack Webb) and his fiance, Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olsen). Betty is a reader for one of the studios, and Joe witnessed her explaining to her boss that one of the stories he had submitted was lousy. Now, at the party, she wants to apologize to him. She said she had gone back through the files, and found a story he submitted some time ago. No, she didn't like it, but there was one segment, about ten pages, that was very good and she believed it was the kernel of a really good screenplay. She wants to work on it with him, but he declines, realizing that Norma would never tolerate his going out to work with an attractive young woman.<br /><br />He had decided to leave Norma, and asked his friend Artie to put him up for awhile, so now he calls Max and asks him to pack up the things he came with (i.e., not the expensive gifts Norma had given him). Max says he cannot do that, because the doctor is there. Norma had slit her wrists after he walked out on her New Year's Eve party. He hurries to her, feeling guilty, and of course she uses his guilt to lure him into her bed. She buys him expensive gifts, coos and pets him, and he tolerates it but never goes too far in faking affection for her. It's clear that in addition to enjoying her wealth, he is trying to be kind to her.<br /><br />Finally, Norma sends the reconstructed script to Cecil B. DeMille, and gets in an army of beauticians and masseuses to try to make her look young again. They do the best they can. One day, Paramount calls her, but it's not DeMille (who plays himself in this movie), it's some \\"flunky,\\" as she puts it. She refuses to take the call, saying if DeMille wants her, he must call personally.<br /><br />After repeated calls by the \\"flunky,\\" she decides to go see DeMille at the studio in person. Traveling in her beautiful old custom-made touring car, she drives up to the Paramount gate and is at first refused admission. But one of the older guards remembers her, and lets her in, telling her where DeMille is shooting. She accepts all the attention, saying that the old guard should teach his younger associate some manners. She says \\"without me there wouldn't be any Paramount,\\" and the old-timer agrees.<br /><br />DeMille is kind to her, but he calls the employee who had been trying to get in touch with Desmond, and finds out they want to lease her car for a couple of months to make a movie. DeMille hasn't the heart to tell her this, and strings her along.<br /><br />While waiting outside in the car, Joe spots Betty Schaefer up on the second floor walkway of the building where they are parked, and goes up to say hello to her. She urges him to work with her on the script she had mentioned, and adds that Artie is out of town, shooting on location in Arizona. He says no again, but of course he ends up doing it, sneaking out after Norma is in bed.<br /><br />Naturally, he gets caught. The entire situation has destroyed whatever was left of her mind, and she kills Joe. Then when the police and reporters, with their cameramen, come to take her away, she imagines that the cameras are there to film her as Salome, and the police encourage this as a way to get her downstairs so they can take her away.<br /><br />Like I said, very spooky film.

B000001GEM|2.0|Having bought this CD based on most of the glowing reviews posted on Amazon, I feel a bit cheated. in fact, now I understand why this recording sells at such low price!<br />It is not a great one. First of all, the performances are not bad. If you like you Requiem slow, listening to it with your eyes closed, well: this is it. But that happens to be a matter of taste, and such is the human condition in perception. What disturbed me is reading somewhere here that this is not the \\"blended\\" sound Karajan used to give us towards the end of his career, when in fact, it is; and at its worse! This is the clear example why Digital is not necessarily better when you have an egocentric, aging artist who influences the engineer in the kind of sound he wants (whatever his hearing was telling him at that age).Typical Karajan.<br />After listening to this, I played a Gardiner recent release of choral Brahms and the difference was evident. I could hear all consonants and vowel, the recording was airy, crisp, clear and powerful. This 1985 release lacks perspective and depth; everyone and everything is situated in the center, on the same plane. Not even the VPO sounds like it should. Alas, the only thing you hear with some clarity, once in a while, is the organ! In summary: I felt I had bought the cheapest seat in the hall, up there on third level.  With this sound, it proved difficult to me to appreciate this performance fully; which is a pity. But this makes you understand why time and objectivity has been kind to early Karajan more than the digital one. Your call.
B0000683DH|4.0|I like this one better than the first one, although I'm not sure my reasons are fair ones. When the first movie was made, they did not know how the public was going to react. By the time they got to this one, they'd already had millions of fans screaming \\"More! More!\\" and they knew it would sell. So they could afford to spend a bigger budget, including for script writers.<br /><br />Ricardo Montalban is Muy Macho as Khan, a criminal who had been been born in the 20th century, was frozen for long enough to emerge in the 23rd century with his band of genetically altered hippies (OK, maybe they are not quite like hippies, but that's what I kept seeing). Fifteen years ago, by Federation time, Kirk had pronounced sentence on him and marooned him (with adequate supplies) and his crew on an apparently barren planet. [Anyone remember the episode? Can you write the title and a brief synopsis in the comments?]<br /><br />Meanwhile, Spock is in command of the Enterprise, and out on a training mission with a bunch of inexperienced recruits, including an attractive female Vulcan who, for some reason, is consistently referred to as Mister. But when word comes that Space Station Regula One, which is commanded by an old girlfriend of Admiral Kirk's, is in trouble and they need to respond, Kirk takes over as commander of the ship and Spock goes back to being science officer.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Chekhov has been assigned to another ship, apparently second in command to an elegant black captain whose name I unfortunately cannot recall. Their ship is captured by Khan, who takes them over as puppets with the aid of the larval form of \\"the only natural life form\\" on the planet. A nasty thing, it enters through the ear and renders the victim a puppet to be controlled by Khan. So they are running the other ship for Khan, and of course Kirk trusts Chekhov and so believes what he says in communication.<br /><br />That's the set-up; just in case you haven't seen it, I won't give anything much away. Suffice it to say that you should keep your eye on the chief scientist's son.ch away. Suffice it to say that you should keep your eye on the chief scientist's son.

B0000AUHOH|4.0|This is the other one I saw when it was new; I am seeing it in a very different light now. Well, yes, I suppose this is about the FINAL frontier: the Enterprise goes searching for God!<br /><br />The crew of the Enterprise do not get to enjoy their shore leave for long, as there's an emergency for them to deal with. It seems there's been a revolution on the neutral planet which has served as a sort of galactic Switzerland for quite some time. The place is taken over by a band of religious fanatics headed by Spock's half-brother, a renegade Vulcan who decided that Vulcans should embrace their emotions, not suppress them. He's quite the charismatic leader, and manages to brainwash most of the crew of the Enterprise so he can take over.<br /><br />Why? So he and his followers can go to the galactic center in response to a vision he had that all life originated there, and they would find God. Well, they did -- sort of. But he's not very nice. To say more would ruin it, I am sure. Learn about 21st century brainwashing techniques, then watch this movie again. It's worth it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|When I was in high school we used to read romance magazines.  This book is right out  of one of one of these issues.  Innocent, young. virgin overcome by the virility and strength of a handsome multi-millionaire.  That is the entire stupid story.  What has made it so popular, by word of mouth, is soft core \\"lady porn\\" presented as acceptable reading on Goodreads and Amazon.
0790749815|4.0|Cary Grant certainly was sexy when he was young! Actually, as I recall he was also pretty sexy when he got old, too . . .<br /><br />This is one of Hitchcock's best films. Grant plays a playboy advertising executive who gets mistaken for a spy. James Mason plays a real spy. Eva Marie Saint plays a counterspy. And you will recognize a lot of other faces, too. It all starts when Grant is kidnapped by the \\"other side\\" (presumably communist) spies because they think he is Mr. Kaplan, the spy who is trailing them. He's not, but they don't believe him. They pour a whole bottle of bourbon into him and put him behind the wheel of a \\"stolen\\" sports car, to go off a cliff. But he doesn't go off the cliff, drunk as he is. Instead, he does one of the best chase down a mountain road scenes I have ever seen.<br /><br />The spy who kidnapped him used someone else's house and name, and so when Grant goes to the house to try to clear himself of the DUI and the grand theft auto, he encounters a woman who is supposedly the wife of the man who kidnapped him the night before, who is addressing the United Nations general assembly. He goes to the UN, and has the guy paged, but it's not the same guy. It's the real owner of the house. So who were all those other people at the party where he was shanghaied? As he is talking to the owner of the house to try to explain what was going on there while he was in New York, someone throws a knife into the back of the man, and Grant, like an idiot, grabs the knife to pull it out. Of course, this puts his fingerprints all over the knife, and he runs.<br /><br />Oh, that's very much only the beginning. There are some marvelously complex plot developments, culminating in one of the most intriguing scenes in movie history, where several people climb down (and fall from) the giant heads of Mount Rushmore. This is a real classic of the unexpected twist and twist again.

B00005JKHP|3.0|This first movie was as much for the purpose of creating a movie audience out of the loyal TV show audience, and providing a thrill for those of us who just wanted to see our old friends again, no matter under what conditions. And frankly, it does drag a bit, especially when the long sequences of watching out the front viewer at computer-generated gosh-wows that seem rather pedestrian by today's standards. In fact, they look like they were copped from 2001. But once we confront the mechanical stuff, and you really can get a sense of the size of the alien vessel in comparison to the Enterprise, even I am capable of gosh-wows. And I already know who V-ger is!<br /><br />The Enterprise has been completely refitted, and is still quite a bit short of ready when the word comes in that three Klingon vessels have been disintegrated by some incredible cloud of energy that is heading directly for earth. Kirk, now an admiral, persuades Star Fleet Command to let him take over command of the Enterprise, considerably annoying Captain Decker, a handsome young upstart who has been involved in the entire refitting process and had been assigned to command it. Instead, he is shunted aside as second in command.<br /><br />Then when the Vulcan science officer and the navigator are scrambled by the defective transporter (\\"What we got back didn't live very long, thank God\\" says the sending station.), Decker is assigned to double duty as science officer as well. The beautiful Ilea (played to perfection by Persis Khambatta bald-headed, no less.) replaces the navigator, and it turns out she and Decker had been lovers back on her home planet when he was assigned there.<br /><br />But Decker is not science officer for long; Spock shows up, having intuited that something was out there for which he would be needed. He gave up the spiritual discipline that would have given him considerable honor, and apparently something akin to the Vulcan version of enlightenment, in order to rejoin the crew of the Enterprise.<br /><br />The basic story involves several levels, but primarily (1) trying to figure out what this huge energy entity is (Spock can tell it is conscious), (2) the tension between Decker and Kirk, and (3) Ilea's use by the alien entity as a pattern for a robot probe, which gives poor Decker fits. How he finally resolves that issue is most of what makes the finale so spectacular.<br /><br />No, I won't tell you who or what V-ger is, just in case you could possibly have missed it. It's a good movie, overall, partly because of the sleek redesign of the interior sets and obviously advanced special effects, partly because Ilea is so darn beautiful, but mostly because it is great to see the old crew again.

B000ANVPPQ|3.0|John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara worked together on several movies. This was probably the funniest one. It's loosely (very loosely) based on \\"The Taming of the Shrew\\" by Shakespeare. But it's primarily Wayne's response to the \\"women's movement\\" that was just getting started in 1963.<br /><br />George Washington (G.W.) McLintock (John Wayne) is a cattle baron who owns a good portion of the town named after him, as well as a huge cattle ranch and a beautiful Victorian mansion. He and his wife Katherine (Maureen O'Hara), whom G.W. calls Katie, have been separated for two years. But she returns to town because their daughter Becky (Stefanie Powers) is coming home from school back east and her mother is determined to take her with her to New York, and to Europe, and prevent her from becoming a crude westerner.<br /><br />Katie, you see, is a terrible snob. G.W. is just as determinedly not snobbish. He is friends with the local Comanches, and is in fact asked to speak for them when there is a hearing -- kangaroo court, really -- held by the territorial governor in response to a fussy little bureaucrat of an Indian agent who reported to Washington that they were defying him about being moved to a fort somewhere else, location unspecified. In fact, nobody ever said what territory we were in throughout the movie.<br /><br />One of the best scenes is when G.W. has been up all night playing chess with Birnbaum, the storekeeper when word comes that the settlers (a band that has been offered 160 acres of unfarmable land per family) are going to hang an Indian. It seems one of the settler's daughters is missing, and it is assumed the Comanches have kidnapped her. In fact, while the chief (G.W.'s friend) is standing on the scaffold, the daughter and her boyfriend ride up on a horse and explain that he had taken her for a morning ride and \\"the horse ran away.\\" But her father had already made an ass of himself poking a sawed-off shotgun in G.W.'s belly and bullying him about his protesting the chief being hanged. Then G.W. wrenches the shotgun out of the jerk's hands and starts poking him in the belly.<br /><br />Did I mention that all this was taking place on a hill which was part of a mining operation, and there was a muddy slope and a pool of slurry at the bottom? Well, once G.W. takes a good hard swing at the indignant father and he slides down the muddy slope into the slop, the fight is on. The chief walks through the melee saying, \\"Good party, Maclin. Where's the whiskey? Eventually, G.W. and Kate and Birnbaum and just about everyone else ends up in the slurry pit, and comes home covered in caked silt.<br /><br />There's really too much to tell in this story. The handsome young farmer (Patrick Wayne) McLintock hires who falls in love with his daughter. The farmer's mother (Yvonne de Carlo), who takes a job cooking for them and falls in love with the sheriff. The silly college boy (Jerry Van Dyke) who makes a total fool of himself trying to win McLintock's daughter, and on and on. It's a romp, but if you don't find men spanking the women they love amusing, don't watch it.ting the chief being hanged.

Published by Little Simon, an imprint of Simon and Schuster Children's Publishing Division, in 1995. By Sandra Boynton.<br /><br />Once the sun goes down, it's time for bed and the animals all get ready, bathing, brushing their teeth, putting on their pajamas and exercising.<br /><br />This is a book that children seem to love and certain parents seem to freak out about. Exercise? Oh your god, no! The horror! It's ridiculous that this should bug out so many adults. These are animals who brush their teeth, so the complaint can't be that exercising isn't realistic. And these critters dwell on a boat, so the complaint can't be that your kid might want to emulate them, or they'd be more freaked out by the boat thing than the exercise part. People are weird, weird, weird - and they should relax, because kids will, magically, grow up just fine even if you read them this book.<br /><br />The rhyme is fun and attempts to set a pace - everyone rushes to take a bath, hurries to exercise, moves slower toward bed, and slowly-slowly rock to sleep. The illustrations are somewhat primitive by Disney-Pixar standards and are flawlessly perfect nonetheless. A multi-generational favorite.<br /><br />- AnnaLovesBooks

B006PHD0RW|4.0|I liked this game, it was a pretty simple premise and easy to play.  The graphics were cute and added to the enjoyment of playing the game.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this game is fun to play....if you like pictionary then this is the game for you. I'm glad that I downloaded it...
B00722ZIBA|4.0|If I were to ever write a screenplay or use music to tell my life story, the music of Incognito would be front and center.  It doesn't seem to matter what is happening in music because with Incognito you can't go wrong.  On this latest effort, Surreal, it took me two plays to fall in love with the project.  Currently, my favorite tracks are 6,2,1,&9 but I'm sure, depending on where my head is this list will likely change but it's all still good.  Thanks Bluey for always being just what I need at the right time!
B005HSG3TC|4.0|When I took my case out of the packaging, I was a bit disappointed. I even wanted to send it back. It seemed so flimsy and not worth $30. I faced instant buyer's remorse and I hadn't even put my Kindle into the cover yet.  I am glad that I gave it a shot though.<br /><br />The fit is snug. It takes a bit of effort to get the case off of the Kindle, which means that it won't just pop out by accident. The cover, which looked a lot more flimsy when it had nothing underneath it, covers the screen well. The elastic band is a great way to keep the cover over the screen in my bag.  As for the stand, it takes a little bit of use to get the flap broken in to use the stand well. When it is new and stiff, it is a little stubborn.  The openings on the top and bottom leave the speakers and headphone jack/charging jack/sleep button accessible. I like the smooth, rubberized feel to the case.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase, despite my initial disappointment.  After putting the case on my Kindle, it feels really protected and sturdy.
0062124293|4.0|Caitlin Moran can be very funny, and at times \\"How To Be a Woman\\" had me laughing out loud. I'll recommend the book on that basis.<br /><br />The negative part is that every chapter or so the author inserts a couple of pages of her views on various feminist (supposedly) issues, and those parts feel like an interruption. The book frequently goes from excellent humor to somewhat half-baked feminist philosophy and then back to humor again, and that was a distraction. For example, early in the book she spends a couple of pages saying that men like women with shaved pubic hair, so women shouldn't shave that area. I was like, \\"Huh?\\" - and then I was asleep. I mean, who cares if women shave their pubic hair? I don't think that's a feminist issue at all, nor any kind of issue except personal grooming.<br /><br />I suggest you buy the book, enjoy the excellent humor, and try not to be put off by the forays into... well, whatever they're supposed to be.
B007MJ9LA2|3.0|\\"Shape Shifter\\" Santana's latest album is the best thing he's released since \\"Milagro\\" in 1992... but considering how bad some of his albums have been since then, remember \\"Guitar Heaven\\"? that's not saying much. \\"Shape Shifter\\" is good but not great. Compared to \\"Milagro\\" and everything released before 1992 it doesn't hold a candle, but compared to \\"Supernatural\\", \\"Shaman\\", \\"All That I Am\\", and the new tracks from \\"Ultimate Santana\\" as well as the afore mentioned \\"Guitar Heaven\\" it's fantastic. I've listened to it three times already today, and I find it to be just OK. Pleasant, but unremarkable is how I would describe it. Carlos's guitar solos start to sound the same after a while, and none of the other musicians really stand out either. \\"Shape Shifter\\" has some nice moments on it, but I don't think it'll be in my top ten list of favorite Santana albums of all time. HTH

0345525558|4.0|Great book. Quick read. I love flowers. Author has a smooth writing style. Enjoyable. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a good book to read.
1401233791|5.0|Even knowing how this book would end still couldn't keep it from being a fantastic read. Definitely worth picking up for any Batman fan, one of my favorite Batman titles I have had the chance to read.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a must see series for anyone who loves period pieces. It is so well done! You must see Season 1 first but then you won't be able to wait to see Season 2! The acting is superb and the storyline so well thought out. This is a must see. Can't wait for Season 3!
B0042J6VUS|1.0|I have never had something break this fast. I opened it. tried putting my phone in, and the top section of the holder came off. The thing is held by a little spring inside, and that spring is not secured well. The tripod part is fine. The phone holder (which is the main reason I got this) is completely worthless.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This story was just as long and bad on fan fiction. Why spend $30 on ebooks to re-read the same ridiculous remake of Twilight with BDSM overtones?
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved this series so much I read the whole 3 book series in a week! I cried when it was over I so want there to be other books in this series I'm sad now!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!. It was very descriptive and detailed which made it easy to picture in your mind what was going on in the book. I read the entire series and each book got better and better.  I thought the books were way  better than the movie. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys to read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Much better than the film (although the film is also quite good). The main characters and the story are deeper developed, with some interesting plots that don´t appear at the film. It´s good that there is a second an a third part, because when you finish it you ask for more.
B005LAIIS0|3.0|OK I wasn't sure what to make of this movie it kinda reminded me of The Edge with Anthony Hopkins when there were getting stalked by the Man Eating Grizzly Bear. I thought the cast was excellent, my only complaint was the ending, if I didn't read one of the Guys comments on here, I would have been more pissed because I didn't know there was another scene at the end of the movieafter the credit are done. So with that scene I feel the movie ended the way it was suppose to.
B0059XTUVI|4.0|I understand that many people out there believe that Hollywood has gone to the dogs and that the Oscars are now a bunch of hogwash. However, when a movie like this comes along, my faith in cinema gets renewed! Let me say upfront that I didn't know a single thing about Margaret Thatcher, so I had no preconceived notions on how they were going to portray her or any comment on whether the movie was accurate. That being said, I took the film as it was presented to me, a story about a strong woman in power who is slowly losing her wherewithal to Alzheimer's. The film is told mostly in flashbacks so the viewer can piece together Thatcher's past and her rise to power in England. While I wasn't exactly fond of her, or many of the characters in the film, I thought the acting was divine. Streep has almost always played a kind-hearted woman you would want to befriend. However, this character was more like the character she depicted in Sophie's Choice in which there is a great deal of moral ambiguity. No one these are the two roles that got her Oscars. Still, you don't need to cheer for her in order to enjoy the film! But let me warn you, it will haunt you and even after you've walked away...you'll still be thinking about it!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME I PLAY IT ALMOST EVERY DAY I HATE LEAVING REVIEWS BECAUSE I HAVE TO PUT IN 20 OR MORE WORDS!
B004EPZ034|5.0|Love the chipmunks and I am not disappointed with this one, Alvin can always fix it, even when he is the problem. Great special effects and wonderful storyline for the young at heart. The island will never be the same after him. The ideas are different and on the move to keep our childrens minds going.Fantastic animation keep up the good work guys, love this kind of entertainment given A plus for enjoyment.
B007HJ90JY|4.0|it was a good movie as far as storyline.  it really did not need the nudity.  it is too bad our society is so jaded.
B004A8ZWWO|5.0|I found this to be more serious with the expectations of a comedy, with Ben and Eddie<br />but was surprised that it turned out better than expected, less comedy and more action something worth watching and I love the storyline totally different, didn't think much at first but soon got more intriging and interesting as the show went on. Alan played a role really befitting to him wonderfully done with the cast it was a great show.<br />Worth buying for the collection and something to watch with your popcorn in your hands and relaxing in front of t.v. for all.
B007R41E8O|4.0|This a really well made point and click hidden object hybrid. I don't care for pure hidden object games because they don't really force you to use your brain. However, this game strikes a good balance between the two genres. The hidden object sequences are used to provide you with an item you need to solve a puzzle and progress the story. Each hidden object scene is used at least a couple of times and you need to pay attention to what is in the scene as you may need it later in the game. If you've been paying close attention then you'll know just where to go to find the item you need.<br /><br />The game is much longer than similar games I've played such as Lost City and Grisly Manor, which is a plus. I think this game is superior in the graphics department as well.<br /><br />Many people have mentioned that the ending is confusing or doesn't make any sense. I actually thought it made perfect sense and was an interesting twist.<br /><br />The only reason I can't give this game 5 stars is because it crashes a lot. Fortunately it autosaves often and I never lost more than a minute or two of progress. Overall, I highly recommend this to all fans of the genre.
B003L77GH4|5.0|We definitely got our money's worth! Have watched multiple times. Arrived earlier than expected. Mint condition. This series is one of the best vampire series made. Highly recommend. The casting is perfect.
B003K16P3M|5.0|I've never read a story like this.  Extremely unique and well written.  You fall instantly in love with the characters and can't put the book down.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Really!! Are there people out there that like to be ordered/slapped around.<br />Sorry it just isn't for me. Being beat on just isn't my cup of tea.
B005LAIHPE|2.0|The movie Battleship is supposedly based on Hasbro's boardgame. Funny, I don't remember any space aliens being in the game.<br /><br />Anyway . . . .<br /><br />The movie deals with a thought that has been kicked around in the past few years: in our desire to contact alien civilizations . . . is that really such a good idea? The underlying assumption is that if they are technologically advanced enough to receive our transmissions, then they must be benevolent, right? I mean, just look at us, we have the technology to create atomic bombs and human beings are benevolent, right?<br /><br />Riiiiight.<br /><br />The movie more or less begins with a disheveled loser being tasered for breaking and entering and a few months later, he is not only in the navy, but an officer.<br /><br />Riiiiight.<br /><br />Then, at the same time, there is a 15 nation naval war game going on near Pearl Harbor, Hawaii---of which, inexplicably, only Japan and the US are involved (beginning as rivals, then ultimately cooperate. FIRE THE SYMBOLISM CANNON: KABOOM!!).<br /><br />Anyway . . . .<br /><br />Aliens arrive in behemoth transports near Hawaii, land in the ocean and set up shop. They put up a force field that keeps everything out. Three alien dreadnoughts appear. Three destroyers are already inside the dome and two are dispatched quickly (one of them being the Japanese one) when they attack the aliens. As long as one does not attack the aliens they pretty much ignore you, except for the forces in Hawaii, where this rule doesn't seem to apply. The loser officer becomes captain when the ship's former captain gets killed and he shapes up in time for the struggle. The aliens are humanoid, of course, with hands, eyes and even teeth and tongue, which makes you wonder when are we going to ever come across a truly alien alien.<br /><br />The special effects are great and so are the battle scenes and they will keep you interested and excited and oblivious to the obvious blunders (except for the in-your-face blunders, like the black guy with no legs beating up an armored, weaponed, alien. Riiiiight).
B00A9D0JMM|5.0|Ture story and one. Of the movies you'll love from beginning to yhe amazing end and the book is even better
B006OCM0G0|5.0|lots of fun.get bakery story too! you can build a great restaurant without spending any money. spend your gems wisely unless you want to pay real money for them!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I wanted to read this book because of all of the talk about it. Well I was not let down!!  I fell quickly in love with Ana and her \\"inner goddess\\".  I loved the characters and cried at the end.  When I finished this book, I had to imidiatly buy the next two in the triligy.  And now I am re-reading them for the second time.  It's not even the sex that's in the books, althought there is a LOT of it, but it's the love story.  I was very pleased with all three books and look forward to more from this writer. Maybe a little less S&M.
B005K17RU0|4.0|All the weather i want any time. i like that i can see the whole week or just right now.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|good game but it starts to say Internet not working when it clearly is operating. Maybe a glitches but still a fun time consuming game...great for airports
0345803485|1.0|Im actually biting my lip in hope that someone will smack the memory of reading this book out iof my head. Painfully bad. No better than a dime store romance novel. I cannot figure out what all the hype is.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have read all three books TWICE in the last week. The first time, it was all about Christian. The second time I read them I realized how funny this book can be. There was a lot of sex. I got tired of all the sex. But Ana's subconscious is hilarious. I have told everyone I know about these books. I plan to read them again, but I need a break and I'm switching to another book for now. I heard rumors of a fourth book....oh I hope so.
B006ZVCQJG|5.0|This is a review for the new Deluxe Edition remaster of Dio's Sacred Heart.  This remaster is outstanding.  I always felt the production on the original version of this album was sub par.  This one is crystal clear.  I listened to it with audiophile headphones, and almost had tears in my eyes as i listened to it.  Every instrument sounds clear and beautiful.  Dio's vocals sound amazing.  This blows away the Japan remaster from a few years ago. I have both, and the sound on this one is far superior to the Japan remaster. The bonus disc and overall packaging is great as well.  I recommend this if you are a true Dio fan.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|I've seen The Dark Knight several times since its original release and it's a movie that gets stronger with repeated viewings much like many other film classics. The story takes the characters in directions that show an extraordinary level of directorial skill that frankly makes Tim Burton's previous films almost amateur by comparison. The opening sequence is one of the most engaging first 10 minutes of a movie I think I've ever seen, quickly establishing The Joker as a formidable villain. The rest of film is both equally complex and completely gripping as the stakes are continuously raised.<br /><br />The most amazing part of the movie is Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker. I've rarely been terrified by fictional villains but Ledger makes his character grotesque and perfectly in control as a master strategist. There are genuinely points in the film where his goals are so far ahead of the good guys that he seems completely invincible. And in creating his Joker, he's made it a character than nobody else is ever going to be able to live up to - truly the hallmark of an extraordinary actor.<br /><br />The Dark Knight is as complicated, entertaining, thought-provoking and well-formed as cinema gets. Once a decade, a director produces a film that transcends the limits of the screen and creates something truly iconic. It's a testament to Nolan's skill that he can add such depth to the material and deliver something so finely balanced that it's impossible to think of how it could be better.

1849514003|5.0|One thing I always love about cookbooks is how the book is mostly filled with code, because a lot of us learn best by looking at code examples rather than reading through long explanations.<br /><br />If you're developing games using cocos2d then you definitely need this book. It covers just about everything you need and it is definitely going to save you a lot of time. The best part of the book is the AI and Logic chapter with the A* path finding recipes.<br /><br />Even if you're going to develop with cocos2d-x instead of cocos2d-iphone, you can easily translate the Obj-C parts of the code to C++, and some of the code is already in C++ (i.e. Box2D and OpenGL calls).<br /><br />The only thing I feel is missing from this book is recipes on 2D Skeletal Animation. I would really love to see an example of a animating 2D skeletal body which can be easily turned into a Box2D rag doll. There is a lot of information on 3D skeletal animation, but not so much for 2D.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a fabulous game. It's incredibly easy to play and to manage settings. This is a definite thumbs from me!
B008133DO8|5.0|I think this is the best yet of the Sherlock episodes. Nicely paced and intriguing.  When I thought \\"Is Holmes being seduced ?\\", I found myself being seduced ... Not cat and mouse, but lion and tigress !  I really loved the humorous references to Conan Doyle's works in the opening of this episode.  Must see for any Holmes fan !

B004QK5N5W|3.0|I've owned my iPad 2 for over a year and always meant to buy this connector but never did. Then I purchased NBA Gametime for my iPad to watch basketball games online. I wanted to output to my TV for when I was in my room and so finally found the need to purchase this little overpriced connector. I launch my app, plug it to my TV and i get the little error message. Something about Airplay not being compatible with my app. After doing some research I learned the sad truth, APPLE GETS TO CONTROL WHAT YOU WANT TO OUTPUT TO YOUR TV AS WELL. I was really upset with my purchase. It turns out that if a greedy app developer wants, you will not be able to output the content your purchased a right to , to your television. It is upsetting that Apple places such control over your hardware at the hands of a developer. Its like if your radio let the record producers control if you get to listen to the music on headphones. In conclusion, please research if it will fit your needs before overpaying for a simple piece of hardware. I wish someone told me this beforehand.
B008359JXI|3.0|Did anyone think this episode really dragged, esp the first half? I kept looking at my watch. Maybe it was so blah because it showed Betty's pathetic life. Sorry to be catty, as a female who has been cheated on I have tried to feel sympathy for Betty and have found none in my heart.<br /><br />Betty is too ugly  that she would use Sally like that then yell at her for spending too much time on homework. Her last condescending line reminded me of a bitter old woman I used to know who liked to hurt people for kicks.<br /><br />Liked that this episode showed an interesting pitch for a Pepsi Sno - Ball. They have gotten away from the business part, which I have sorely missed. Don  doing the  devil impression into the recorder rocked. Roger exonerated himself a little  when he apologized for hurting someone and tried to make it better.<br /><br /> Ginsberg made this episode.( I can't believe the things he says out loud though ) Ginsberg makes Don so mad he can't explode and Roger's tan face blanch with shock and embarrassment. Don is slacking and cheating. Peggy is sick of being dumped on and ready to do something drastic.<br /><br />Cooper is watching and I have a feeling as the season closes a major character will be getting fired or they will quit.
030758836X|5.0|STOP reading reviews...get this, read it....don't ruin it for yourself by reading too much about it.  Here's what you do need to know...if you can answer yes to any of these...then read it.<br /><br />1. love good writing?<br />2. love characters that are real?<br />3. love realistic suspense whereby you do not have to suspend disbelief to buy the story/plot line?<br />4. ever been confused by your spouse or significant other?<br /><br />SOLD<br /><br />Read it!!  I've read this author's prior two novels and they were good.  This is fantastic!  Start with this one if you are new to Ms. Flynn.
B000FBFMIO|4.0|I'm writing this a) after reading the whole Tawny Man trilogy and b) after reading the Farseer trilogy a year ago (note: that is the one where all the books have \\"Assassin\\" in the title, also by Robin Hobb). This is thus a review for all three the books in this trilogy, for people considering starting it.<br /><br />1. Do not read this trilogy without first reading the Farseer Trilogy! It will make no sense and the main character will seem annoyingly whine-y and boring.<br /><br />2. This lacks the tragedy and grandeur of the first trilogy - that is a true work of art; this is competent, well-written fantasy.<br /><br />3. (MINOR SPOILER ALERT) If you're coming to this after having read the Farseer trilogy, think long and hard. Did you secretly appreciate the fact that that ended, not on a happy, everything-is-resolved note? I know I did - I had immense respect for an author who didn't feel the need to write a happily-ever-after ending. However, if you were furious at Hobb for leaving the protagonist miserable and alone, please go ahead and read this b/c, although I won't reveal how, everything does come together - all too conveniently, I felt - in this series.<br /><br />4. (SPOILER ALERT) If your main source of pleasure in the Farseer trilogy was the humorous, painful, complicated, acerbic relationship between Fitz and Nighteyes, don't start this series - Nighteyes is not a major character, and we sadly hear only too little of his voice.<br /><br />5. I still give this four stars for the quality of the writing. There are very few real action scenes (most of book 1 and all of book 2 are all character-building) but the dragon scenes in Book 3 are magnificent.

0345803485|1.0|The book chronicles, in abundant detail, the honeymoon phase of the relationship of two 20-somethings who both have emotional paper bags over their heads and so fail to realize they are in love, even though they shag nonstop. When not shagging, they send scads of cutesy emails, because the author is in her 40s and fails to realize that 20-somethings text instead, and because men love, above all, to constantly send and receive emails full of inside jokes and clever repartee from their significant others every moment that they are not physically together. Eye roll. Oh, yes, there is also an abundance of eye rolling in the book. In an attempt to make the unrelenting athletic coupling more palatable, the author makes the couple's issue not about religion, children, money, or a wagon wheel coffee table, but about kinky sex. Cheap thrills. Skip the hopelessly-juvenile perspective of relationships presented in this book, and if you want erotica go straight to the shocking debasement of \\"The Story of O,\\" or the nonstop sex of the Anne Rice trilogy. The BDSM window dressing here barely hides the standard theme of how do you get a guy to commit (hint: it will take two more books, a small additional cash sacrifice from you, and a couple more hours of your time, to get to happily-ever-after).<br /><br />No need to comment on the lack of quality in the writing as this is well-documented in other reviews.

No hassle at all.<br /><br />I liked it do much I bought 3 of them.<br /><br />Tom

B00190N4E4|5.0|This awe-inspiring biographical film about Gandhi - the activist lawyer who stood up against British rule in South Africa and India and became a symbol of peace and nonviolence resistance to oppression. The action in the film starts with Gandhi as a young activist lawyer fighting apartheid in South Africa and goes on until his assassination shortly after leading India in its struggle of independence from the British.  A critical masterpiece, GANDHI is an intriguing story about nonviolent activism, politics, religious tolerance and freedom. My feeling about Gandhi's work in this movie is summed up by Mirabehn in the last few minutes of the film: \\"I may be blinded by my love for him. But I believe, when we most needed it, he offered the world a way out of madness. But he doesn't see it. Neither does the world.\\"

B0054JZC6E|3.0|I like this game, but the controlls stink. Every time I play the game I get so angry that my little character, or whatever won't respond to the actions I'm telling it to do. Sometimes I have to turn it off because it so frustrating. Other than that, the app has some fun games like the umbrella game and the oil one. The soccer game is pretty fun too. I would say you should get the app but you can't play it too long.
B004GYY714|4.0|This does exactly what it claims to. I'm going to use it to listen to AM radio broadcasts of my local baseball team while in the ballpark. I like it, it looks good and has lots of features.<br /><br />I was going to just get the paid version but read a bunch of reviews both here and on Google Play about how the paid version was forcing advertising upon the users. Yes, Tune in Radio Pro has pop ups and even has advertising on the notification bar.<br /><br />I can recommend this app for those who need to listen to AM on their Android(s) or want a station from far away.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I wish hadn't bought this book .  Not that well written, very repetitive.  Wish I could get a refund.  I am mad at myself for spending as muchasi did for it. Lots of sex in it.....if that flips your switch. Reminded me of a cheesy Harlequin novel.  I don't write bad reviews. I never really have.  This is a first.
0439023513|1.0|I saw the movie, \\"The Hunger Games,\\" about two weeks ago.  I just finished the third book last night.<br /><br />I drove home from the theater and immediately downloaded the books (on sale, even!) and read them on my iPhone with every minute I could spare.  I was hooked.  I was enthralled.  I could NOT STOP reading.  I'm mainly a writer, and partly an analyst of books - not exactly your typical avid reader - so my being absolutely gripped by these books was quite a surprise for me.  These last two weeks, I've been recommending The Hunger Games to everyone I know.<br /><br />The books obviously play on some very popular themes (strong female protagonist, a young person coming of age, romantic love triangle, post-apocalyptic survival, the issue of slavery), however...  Collins' treatment of these familiarities expertly infuses a delicious blend of flavors to set her story apart, such as politics, ethics, and core humanity values.  You read the books in first person, from Katniss' perspective, hearing the complex thoughts and feeling the confusing emotions that this very memorable teenage character endures as she faces an endless onslaught of threats and challenges.  Collins does a remarkable job of sinking her teeth into you and forcing you to keep turning the pages.<br /><br />The first book so powerfully transports you into Katniss' struggles, you can't help but be hungry when she's starving, and hurt when she's injured.  We learn to love and value Katniss for the way she braves the dangers, unpredictably prevails against the odds, and outsmarts the competition.  THIS is a great book, and a great beginning to an epic tale.<br /><br />The second book is every bit as powerful as the first, but it covers so much more than just the games.  It deepens the plots, it raises the stakes, it opens your eyes to her entire world and a unique cast of characters.  This buildup toward the climax of all the main plots is positively legendary!  It's stunning, breathtaking, exciting!Catching Fire might be one of the most enjoyable books I've ever read.<br /><br />The third book you read because you MUST KNOW what happens!  However... it's absolutely, totally, completely... DISAPPOINTING!  Allow me to elaborate:<br /><br />Katniss vs. Herself: Collins continues to put Katniss in mercilessly difficult positions.  In the first two books, she outsmarts, shines through, and somehow puts her best foot forward while stuck between a rock and a hard place, painting pictures of realistic human qualities that inspire us to be true to ourselves.  But, in the third book, Katniss is nothing short of an irrevocable train wreck, a whining schizophrenic juvenile, and a total and utter failure THE ENTIRE TIME.  (Although a nice little epilogue tells you she turns out okay.)  It was a horribly lacking deterioration of potentially dazzling character development.<br /><br />Gale vs. Peeta: Collins does an amazing job of pitting Katniss' two love interests against each other.  In the first two books, we explore their similarities and differences, their passions and talents, and feel Katniss' confusion because we love them both for different reasons along with her.  But, in the third book, Collins' neglect of this subject leaves you feeling like Katniss never even makes a choice; instead of seizing her own destiny with one or the other with her courageous confrontational skills, she instead lets herself fall victim to circumstance and leaves her fate in the hands of happenstance, mundane details.  It was a flatly impotent conclusion to a potentially sizzling romance.<br /><br />The Rebels vs. the Capitol: Collins delivers us into a very believable extension of history, creating a fantastic story around the vicious cycle of humans enslaving one another to seek recompense from their former enemies' children.  The first two books debate this issue from a multitude of perspectives, infusing objectivity and a sense of higher reasoning into the conversation, as you watchthe characters play out their parts on every side of the issue.  But the third book calls a conclusion to this argument that leaves you feeling hopeless for humanity, confused instead of clear, and utterly shocked at the way everyone breaks character and fails to make better choices or act more productively.  It was a disappointing vote to abstain on a real issue ripe with compelling potential.<br /><br />I wasn't hoping this would be another predictable fairytale of a novel.  I was only hoping for Collins to finish what she'd started; to give me the same sense of enjoyment in reading this third book as with the first two; to let her characters grow and flourish instead of falter and wilt; to make her story a model argument why we shouldn't hate the offspring of those who've wronged us... This book did N-O-N-E of these things!!!  It's an atrocious, bitter end to a story I was head-over-heels in love with.  WHAT HAPPENED?  Did Collins slip into a coma just to have her publisher subcontract some lesser author who'd never read the first two books?!?  I keep wishing Collins would rewrite this concluding book and republish, saying, \\"Sorry! Just Kidding!\\"  Oh well, maybe the movie will depart completely from the book and stand some slight chance of reconciliation.<br /><br />Ultimately, if you've read book two, you'll probably buy this regardless of the reviews.  So, prepare for disappointment of epic proportions.
B001UV4XIS|1.0|I have recently purchased the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows, Part 2 and have no problems with the movie.  The digital copy is not a digital copy, but a service to load the movie as requested from the internet.  The web site to register for the movie has been no operational for over 1 week!  I will no longer pay for a digital copy, when in fact it is not a copy and in this case should be illegal as false advertising.  Amazon should correct this practice or not sell the product.

B000VRSTEQ|4.0|I grew up listening to Aerosmith and a lot of other Rock groups. This is a good set of tunes from a hard rockin, hard partyin band. For me there is no \\"old\\" or \\"new\\" Aerosmith. It's Aerosmith. Toys in the Attic is also a good one. Still remember my Dad's face when he came home to \\"Big 10 Inch\\" rockin out of his console stereo (that was a stereo system with AM/FM, a turntable, and usually a reel to reel tape player in a fancy wood cabinet with 2 speakers built in.) Give it a shot & open your heart for some great rock! ;)
0307460444|1.0|I just threw this book away.  I have now prepared four of the cupcake recipes.  All were dreadful.  Very dry and nearly tasteless.  I do not believe that ANYONE had tested the recipes that I tried.  The topping for the Streusel Cupcakes was so dry and flour-y that they were inedible.  Luckily I had made only a half batch.  I ate half of one and gave the rest to the chipmunks.  They seemed pleased.  Unfortunately, I prefer a recipe that can be enjoyed by humans.  DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I didn't want to read the Hunger Games because I never did like those morbid \\"Battle Royal\\" plots since you kinda know how the story is going to end. But let me tell you something. You do not know how this story is going to end. Collins does a quadruple twist that makes you go: \\"Oh no...yay...oh no...yay!\\" Starting out on page one I didn't want to like the book since I'm also a young adult writer (who hasn't had her break yet) and will admit am a bit jealous by Collins recent success...so as I was reading the first page I had this skeptical frown on my face, but by page two that frown had turned upside down. She hooked me right away and led me on a roller coaster ride of suspense! Collins deserves all the attention she is getting and more. She has inspiried me to work even harder on my own stories. This is one of those stories that you can't stop reading - that you take off work to finish! I haven't read a fun story like this since Harry Potter really. Well-crafted, great plot, interesting characters, romance - a little bit of everything for everyone. I'm in my twenties and enjoyed this even though I know it's supposed to be for young adults. My father who is in his 60s also enjoyed this book series. It's definitely a book series for all ages. Enjoy!
0345803507|5.0|I am at the point where I feel so physically and mentally  tired after so much love and mellow Christian, and so much physical activities( if u know what I mean)  at the beginning of the book. I am simply exhausted.<br />I am on the edge here really wanting to see him get mad and punish her and frustrated that he has become so soft.<br />The shaving scene was outrageous.<br />I find it quite boring after two previous book to read again and again about Christians \\"shy smile\\", \\"lips in a thin line\\", \\"mercurial\\", \\"fifty\\" and of course Ana's \\"inner goddes\\".<br />After the car persecution Ana still manages to feel turned on when my reaction would be to scream and live in terror and fear knowing someone is out there chasing me around.<br />Awkward how she made such a big deal out of the last name, I would be honored to have his last name.<br />What was he thinking when he went to see Elena after finding out he's going to be a dad? And why didn't she make a big huge deal out of it? I would be furious! But the writer threw Jack Hyde in there to makes us forget. Didn't work. I'm still mad.<br /><br />On the bright side, when Elena's story is finally told I was squirming in my chair, what a woman she is. Slapping then kissing Christian then slapping him again. That was hot.<br /><br />Christian Grey is the man who gets what he wants, in the first book he talked about playroom, contracts, Doms and Subs, it seemed outrageous at the time but book 3 makes it a reality and it was very hot and satisfying.

B007Z9QS5K|3.0|This film had moments of humour peppered with sappy moments and some emotional strings pulling. Great cast, almost too great because no ONE had a real moment to shine. When I saw the cast I thought the film would be a flop, but overall very entertaining and had laugh-out-loud moments.
067144901X|1.0|Was very excited after reading these reviews. When I skimmed the book, was not impressed, but figured my 2 yr old may enjoy. Not the case, he kind of looked at mea as if to say \\" and then what happened\\". Must say that the art / color was very nice and the stock / binding quite sturdy and well made. The story seemed to be missing something.

B005LAJ17M|5.0|Howard Gordon, the co-showrunner of 24, and Alex Ganza, also a veteran of 24 as well as THE X-FILES and ENTOURAGE have crafted an extremely realistic, compelling, and tense journey into the hunt for a terrorist who may or may not have allies on US soil. There have been several comparisons to 24 in that both shows are about hunting terrorists, but that is where the comparisons end. 24 was an adrenaline blast of gunfights, car chases, explosions, conspiracy, super-technology and an indestructible government agent from a fake government agency named Jack Bauer. And while I miss Jack Bauer, I welcome the addition of CIA Case Officer Carrie Mathison (the INCREDIBLE Claire Danes) to the hunt. I also welcome the distinct lack of orgiastic violence (not knocking it, necessarily) and chases and \\"action\\". What THE WIRE is to most cop shows like SVU or CSI or NCIS, HOMELAND is to 24, but the main difference is while shows like SVU and CSI are lame and cliched procedurals, 24 was actually quite a powerful show. HOMELAND and 24 are both terrific shows, but for different reasons. We like 24 because it gives us that immediate sense of satisfaction of knowing that the bad guys are going to end up very dead just about every episode; we like HOMELAND because it takes the same concept to a much grittier, much smarter and MUCH more realistic conclusion.<br /><br />With this show, we have Mathison, informed years prior by someone on the inside of a terror network, that a U.S. soldier that is being held prisoner has been turned by master terrorist Abu Nazir (Navid Negahban, another veteran of 24) and intends an attack using this soldier. Years later, Marine Sergeant Nicholas Brody (Masterfully played by Damian Lewis) is rescued from an Iraqi compound after eight years. Not only does this affect Carrie, who has kept her ear to the ground ever since, but it also affects the family of Brody, who some time ago were told that he was dead. Just recently, his wife Jessica (the talented and extraordinarily beautiful Morena Baccarin of FIREFLY fame) started dating Brody's best friend and comrade-in-arms Mike (Diego Klattenhoff). His kids Dana (an excellent Morgan Saylor) and Chris (Jackson Pace) have largely not even known him. Before he gets to see them, though, he has to be debriefed by the CIA, and naturally Carrie is there to confront him indirectly about his captors. She is certain that he is the lynchpin to Nazir's attack. So certain that she has her friend Virgil (THE SHIELD's David Marciano, great here too) install illegal surveillance in his home. Virgil discovers also that Carrie has been taking anti-psychotics because of her rather severe bi-polar disorder. She obsessively watches Brody and his family, and then her mentor/father figure/superior Saul Berenson (the always fantastic Mandy Patinkin) finds out about her illegal surveillance. She pleads with Saul to allow her to keep it but only for a short time since he had to blackmail a federal judge for the warrant. Carrie then begins her obsessive watch of Brody, looking for any clues about his behavior that might give him away as a sleeper agent while also avoiding her superior, the bureaucratic, scheming David Estes (excellent work by David Harewood).<br /><br />Meanwhile, Brody seems to be exhibiting all of the classic symptoms of a soldier released from years of captivity and torture, both physical and psychological. His behavior is erratic, and there are definitely things that he's hiding from his loving but guilt-ridden wife. He's trotted out in front of the cameras to present himself as some sort of recruitment poster-boy at first, but it soon becomes apparent that the government and the present administration have different plans for him. While all this comes at a surprise to the family, there may be a bigger scheme at work here. Really the question becomes: Has Brody truly turned, or is there simply nothing there other than a human being whose suffered a great ordeal?<br /><br />Seems simple enough from a plot perspective, and maybe a little reminiscent of THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, and that actually works in its favor. The existence in the popular consciousness of THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE causes people to look at this show and the character of Brody in one direction, but the show is really going somewhere else with Brody. Gordon and Garza are smart enough now to keep things mostly contained to the major plotlines, without allowing (as we saw several times in 24's run) several different and unrelated subplots to arise. They're also smart enough to contrive a situation in which Carrie and Brody have to meet with one another that seems totally organic and not just a total deus ex machina.<br /><br />The best episodes of the show and the best moments for Danes and Lewis are their characters in the outside world with one another. They're essentially reflections of one another: both living and lying to one another and the people around them, and they're both broken people. Danes plays Carrie as strong and confident in her work, fully aware of her abilities, but also is seriously damaged and isolated in every other aspect of her life. We're also briefly introduced to her family and particularly her father (the great James Rebhorn), who is also suffering from the same condition. After seeing people in manic states, I can honestly say that her portrayal of bi-polar disorder is absolutely flawless. I'd never been particularly enthusiastic about seeing Danes in anything due to her more teen-oriented roles, but after seeing her in HOMELAND, I can honestly say that her performance is genius. Lewis also plays Brody with an earnestness and believability that is almost unmatched in current television. Patinkin plays Saul with the kind of wisdom and world-weariness that you'd expect from someone who's been in the game for as many years as he has, but he refuses to ever become a cliche. Just when you think he's going to say or do one thing, he does the other and it's another great performance from him in a career full of them. The supporting cast, being particularly impressed with Baccarin and Saylor, is also excellent. By the end of this season, you really understand the characters and you get a real understanding of them as well aso sometimes feeling for them, which is a very fine line to walk when you're doing a show about terrorism.<br /><br />The directorial team behind the series with directors like Clark Johnson (who directed the feature film S.W.A.T., but also did some of the best episodes of THE WIRE as well), Michael Cuesta (who has worked on DEXTER, TRUE BLOOD and a terrific indie feature called L.I.E.) and Jeffrey Nachmanoff (who made a very similar feature film called TRAITOR with Don Cheadle and Guy Pearce) keep the show moving at a very good clip all throughout. Stylistically, this is a rather straightforward program with the exception of when it delves into Brody's period of captivity. Harsh lights and dull focus is used primarily, giving the viewer a good feel of disorientation.<br /><br />All in all, the only complaint that I could make about this excellent first season is that I think they could have really shaken things up in the finale, but it became more about preserving the narrative of the program rather than taking a real chance to do something that would cause even more interesting potential plot lines for the future. That's not necessarily a complaint, but more of a personal preference.<br /><br />HOMELAND is one of the strongest new shows on television and hopefully Season 2 will be, at the very least, on par with this season's excellent work.ple enough from a plot perspective, and maybe a little reminiscent of THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, and that actually works in its favor.

B003V1WXKU|5.0|This book assembles autobiographical anecdotes that Feynman published a few years before his death at the early age of 70.  Very lightly written, very enjoyable, and sheds light on a special likeable character who is extremely talented in many areas.  Nobel laureate - but in many respects so much one of us mortals.
0743289692|5.0|In 1960-61, the United States Postal Service issued a set of six stamps known as the \\"Credo of America Series.\\"  Each stamp had a statement by an American who played a major role in U.S. history.  It is a fine series of stamps.  The one stamp that I think has relevance to Ayaan Hirsi Ali's, \\"Infidel,\\" has a quote by Thomas Jefferson.  The stamp says, \\"I have sworn...Hostility against every form of TYRANNY over the mind of man.\\"  I think Jefferson's credo is Hirsi Ali's credo as well, with special emphasis on swearing hostility to the Islamic worldview that seeks to control the minds and bodies of Muslim women.<br /><br />Hirsi Ali grew up in Somalia in a Muslim family.  At the tender age of five she underwent genital mutilation.  As she grew up, she did seek to be a good Muslim woman.  She memorized verses of the Koran, attended mosque, and spent time learning the Koran from a couple of teachers.  However, she had questions that she could not find any rational answers to with respect to how women were treated within Islam.  Her father, who was often an absentee father while she was growing up, arranged a marriage for her out of the blue.  She was heartsick about the prospect of that marriage.  On her way to Canada to marry that man, she had a short visit with some relatives in Germany.  Reading her observations of walking around Germany, and her thoughts about how she was treated in Holland by the Dutch, makes for some very interesting reading.  Seeing the difference between Islamic culture and Western culture through her eyes is truly exciting.  Her observations about what she was seeing heightened my appreciation of our democratic way of life, even though problems exist within it.  Eventually she made her way to Holland in order to avoid the forced marriage.<br /><br />I am impressed by Hirsi Ali's emotional balance.  She expresses appreciation for her family.  She speaks of the positive things that she learned from different family members.  I think most people,if they were in her situation, would be much less charitable to her family, given the misery they put her through at times.  In addition, she is not bashing Muslims.  She is, however, taking issue with their religion.  Again, many people in her position might not be able to make such a humanistic distinction.  I detect no bitterness in her, only clarity of thought (since she has thought about Islam so much) and a love for truth and a respect for others.<br /><br />The book goes on to recount her intellectual discoveries, and the solidifying of her new worldview based on her observations and experiences.  Not willing to embrace the dichotomous thinking of religious fundamentalists, she eventually became an atheist---an infidel.  She gives details of her time as a Dutch parliamentarian.  Of course she writes of the brutal murder of Theo Van Gogh, and of  having to go into hiding because of threats to her life.  To this day she is protected from religious thugs by armed guards.  I'm quite certain fear is the tyranny Jefferson was referring to on that stamp.<br /><br />Bertrand Russell sums up the matter beautifully in his \\"Why I Am Not a Christian\\" address that he gave in 1927.  He said, \\"Fear is the parent of cruelty, and therefore it is no wonder if cruelty and religion have gone hand in hand.\\"  Or again, he states, \\"The whole conception of God is a conception derived from the ancient Oriental despotisms.  It is a conception quite unworthy of free men (or women!).\\"  I think Ayaan Hirsi Ali has beautifully made this very point in her magnificent book.  What a remarkable human being she is.  How brave!  She does not allow fear to have dominion over her. And isn't that the essence of freedom in all of its manifestations?
B004T4KQJS|4.0|Can you get something for nothing?<br />Apparently, according to today's dogma, based on the present state of quantum physics, this may be so.<br /><br />A Universe which was created by chance due to random fluctuations of nothingness and virtual particles?<br /><br />I hope I understood a good part of the book.  It is very interesting and mostly digestible to non physicists.  However, it leaves one with the thought that we actually don't understand anything and simply keep on peeling the infinite onion layers, trying to fit theories to empirical data.  Nevertheless, it is still remarkable that mainstream quantum theory has been able to predict some aspects of physical behaviour.  Physics is therefore not purely empirical and does not always \\"run\\" after the facts, but can also be a kind of a \\"prophet\\".<br /><br />It remains to be seen how future \\"knowledge\\" accepts (or rejects) Krauss's ideas about the origin of the (our) \\"known\\" universe.
0307716546|4.0|I wasn't sure I was going to like this book at first. Grace is mother to Adam and Jenny. She goes to their school for sports day, Jenny is working as the school nurse because another person dropped out. The day is Adam's birthday and he goes into the school to get his cake. Grace then notices smoke coming through the windows and there is an explosion. By the time she gets to the school, she sees that Adam is now outside but there is no sign of Jenny. Grace runs in to save her daughter.<br />Next thing, Grace is waking up above her body in the hospital as the doctors work on her. She is able to walk around unseen and she meets up with Jenny who is also outside her body, which is in the burn unit. It is discovered that the fire was arson. Jenny and Grace are able to hear everything and Grace can even leave the hospital. Grace fears that the arsonist is the same person who was harassing Jenny previously. Jenny and Grace start to put things together but they can not communicate with their family and Grace can not protect Jenny.<br /><br />This was an interesting way to write a mystery and I did enjoy it once I got used to it. I don't think it is as good as the author's previous novel, Sister, which I loved, though this did have some twists. It was also very moving as neither Jenny nor Grace are expected to live and they have to watch their family deal with that. I would definitely read more by this author.
B007549W62|3.0|The horror of a nuclear holocaust is one of the things that horrifies every one of us. I know, most of us are afraid of the actual explosion, while some are afraid of the nuclear fall out that fallows (photos of the Japanese people stricken with radiation sickness is indeed horrifying) and most of us wonder how we are going to cope if indeed the world falls under a nuclear holocaust. Well, director Xavier Gens' \\"The Divide\\" attempts to take a look at what can happen to a group of survivors if such an attack does happen. His vision is not very pretty, and really, the film is a little hard to sit through.<br /><br />The film begins during a nuclear assault on New York as seen through the eyes of Eva (Lauren German). Eva alongside a number of the apartment's tenants manage to join the `survivalist super' of the building, Mickey (Michael Biehn) into the basement-made up fall out shelter where he has stocked piled some food and water. Days past, and the folks begin to crack, panic and then remain or turn into what we can call like \\"stock characters\\" in a scenario like this-there is the guy who turns psycho (Milo Ventimiglia), the sensitive geek (Ashton Holmes), the imbalanced one (Michael Eklund), the mother (Rosanna Arquette), the French guy (Ivan Gonzales) and there is the shaky one (Courtney B. Vance). You know exactly where the film is headed--imagine a pressure cooker where different personalities and paranoia come together too close for comfort....<br /><br />I guess the way to describe the themes tossed around by writers Karl Mueller and Eron Sheean are the likes of what we've seen in \\"Lord of the Flies\\" and \\"Night of the Living Dead\\". There is something to be said for a little ambiguity and maybe restraint that can make such themes work. The trick is having a build up that makes the characters grow within the viewers' perspective, and add a little more drama with powerful dialogue to get its points across. There is a commentary here that is all about human behavior and rather than doing it in a subtle, methodical manner, Gens opts to put everything in your face.<br /><br />I know, what we see in \\"The Divide\\" is possible, but for some reason, finding different layers and dimensions in the script becomes such a chore because of the way the film is executed. Not really sure why, I know most of the characters are supposed to be something that was truly meant to be despised and their behavior is excruciating to watch. But I am not sure, I felt that the characters were empty and a little too exaggerated. Yeah, the direction did have some points where it seemed to display a credible character shift (example Eklund's scene to chop a dead body up and German's strong-willed realization of the desperate situation), but by then, most of the film has already been hampered by too much cartoonish interaction that all appears to be heavy-handed and perfunctory.<br /><br />The film is violent, however, I have to say that because of the way it was structured, some scenes become a little `funny'. Josh and Bobby are genre characters and despite their scenes of depraved behavior, I find them quite ineffective and a little dull. Most of the other characters are either tortured physically and mentally but none was more humiliated as Rosanna Arquette's character Marilyn, as I could not believe the lengths of humiliation the actress exposed herself to. I mean, having a menstrual scene and a duct tape bra while being sexually abused should be unnerving, what is more sickening is what the character's state of mind would be to allow such things to happen to her. German is the strong-willed female who maintains her cool and she serves her part well; but frankly, the other characters such as Adrien and Sam feel like minor fillers because they were underutilized.<br /><br />The direction by Gens have that dirty and grainy atmosphere to add a gritty feel around his shots. I also saw some Sam Raimi-inspired camerawork that looked kind of cool. I did feel that the direction relied on visuals and in trying to make things over-the-top, rather than developing the roots and core of the narrative. The film feels like it is all about looks and visual and aural manipulation--no ambiguity at all, it is as straight-forward as one can get. I guess while I appreciated the ambitions behind \\"The Divide\\", and admittedly, the first half of the film captured a solid sense of discomfort and paranoia among its characters. I questioned its shifts, and maybe it tried a little too hard, and then pulled itself back. There is a good film in \\"The Divide\\", but it comes up a little short.<br /><br />RENTAL [2 ½ Out of 5 Stars]<br />The movie was intentionally shot with a lot of grain and dirt, so the dvd transfer is nothing special. The film was shot in a dark environment to add to its tone and mood. It is pretty bare-bones save for a commentary and trailers.hat the direction relied on visuals and in trying to make things over-the-top, rather than developing the roots and core of the narrative.

0345803485|4.0|[...]<br /><br />Holy Mother of Emotions!<br /><br />The ending of this book was so intense. I wanted to cry, and slap Anastasia, well maybe not slap her because she might enjoy that. *Haha*<br /><br />I definitely understand where all the hype this book got comes from, and how it got so much attention. It is good. A different good. While reading Fifty Shades, I was immediately hooked by the way it was written. The characters are so real, and the author is not trying too hard to make them over the top. They could really be anyone. It is was a little uncomfortable, because the sexual detail is shocking, and E.L. James definitely pushed the boundaries.<br /><br />I have recently been reading reviews in blogs, websites and news, and I noticed that the majority of the responses were negative. In my honest opinion, leaving my coyness behind, I liked this book. Yes, I cringed several times when it got hot and steamy & rough and dirty, but the love story is pretty damn good. It does indeed go far beyond society's line of acceptable sex talk. But I think this book has a lot more going than just sex. I liked how the characters were developed. I love how awkward and honest Ana's character is. I love the mystery behind Christian Grey's past. And I cant wait to know what happened in his childhood, how did he get so messed up?<br /><br />So here is how I would sum this book up:<br /><br />Ana is a very nice and insecure college student that is about to graduate. She interviews Christian Grey, a multimillionaire self made man, for the university's newspaper. There is instant chemistry between the two of them and after seeing each other a couple of times, Christian warns Ana to stay away from him. Ana is in awe with him, he is described like a gorgeous, tall, muscular man with a lot of power and money. I mean, who wouldn't be mesmerized by him? Their relationship grows and Christian says that if she wants to keep seeing him, he has to show her something and go through some rules. He whips out a contract that basically states that everything that might happen between them must be sworn to secrecy. This of course, because... he is into BDSM. Well Ana does not go running for the hills when she discovers his little secret, instead she stays and decides to think it through. And so the story continues and I will not get into any more detail because I do not want to spoil this book for anyone.<br /><br />I really recommend it, and join the hype. Just let go a little bit of society's uptight ideals of right and wrong, and explore new things. JUST DO IT!at everything that might happen between them must be sworn to secrecy.

0307352145|5.0|Being youngest of three brothers, I was essentially destined to be a shy kid. But as I grew up, went to high school, and emerged from my shell of shyness, I still never felt particularly comfortable being loud or overly gregarious. I enjoyed quieter atmospheres, one on one friendships, and reflective outlooks. I first heard about the ideas of introvert and extrovert during my introduction to psychology in college. Finally, there was something that made sense to me. I was not an exception to humankind, I just processed the world differently.<br /><br />I am not your typical student affairs professional. I am not loud. I am not effervescent. I am not excessively animated. I am not desperate for attention.<br /><br />So what does an introvert do in an openly extroverted profession?<br /><br />\\"We don't need giant personalities to transform companies. We need leaders who build not their own egos but the institutions run.\\"<br /><br />I chose my profession because I love the connections I make with students and helping them succeed. True, my job does require me to be regularly extroverted, however it is my natural tendencies as an introvert that that make me great at my job. In Susan Cain's work you are shown the evolution of character in western society, how the introverted mind works, and how introverts have and can succeed passed their extroverted counterparts.<br /><br />Anyone who feels that their introversion hinders them should read this book. Susan Cain brings an abundance of personal experiences matched with data and research.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Love this book.  I'm glad I bought the digital trilogy.  I couldn't put it down!  It was an easy read and after I read all three books my husband and I went to see the movie.  They did a great job with it.  You can't expect them to squeeze everything into a 2 1/2 hour movie.  I definitely will read the books again.
B000BDLJBU|5.0|After five years of use, the right channel became intermittent on my Etymotic ER6i's. After some quick testing and gathering empirical evidence (wiggling the wire at the connector), I found the source. It took about 30 minutes to install this new connector, but most of that time was spent trying to get my caffeine-powered hands to stop shaking long enough to prepare the conductors. Otherwise it was a breeze to install and I look forward to five more years.<br /><br />As expected, there was no difference in sound quality. The plug is slightly larger than what it replaced, but it has excellent strain relief and build quality. I was more than willing to trade size for those aspects. I would recommend this to anyone in a heartbeat.

A story that will leave you thinking about it for days.

0345803485|3.0|Have not finished reading it yet. Actually for some reason it is pretty slow going for me. I am just posting here because of the price drop! I paid 23.00 at Amazon for this trilogy a few weeks ago, yes a few weeks ago and I think I am on Chapter 16 of the first book! lol.. Happy that the price has dropped, as it should have but I wish I had waited! It might have been worth the 10.00.. Happy Reading.

B000VZFTDW|5.0|I first heard of QOTSA from seeing a poster in the window of a local music shop in Venice, CA. I was going through a \\"thing\\" at the time and was really beginning to branch out musically. After chopping my way through \\"Is This It?\\" and \\"White Blood Cells\\", I decided to look up QOTSA on Limewire. After hearing \\"No One Knows\\" and \\"Millionaire\\", I decided to pick up the full album the next day. I was not ready for it. I was not ready for how much I would obsess over each track, over the percussion gun that is Dave Grohl. I don't think the album left my CD player for weeks. This album is a freaking journey. Seriously epic, at least to me. The crunchy sound of the guitars on the opening track to the haunting acoustics on ending track, this is truly a saga. 10 years later, this album still makes me feel like a millionaire. You won't be disappointed.

0307716546|5.0|Afterwards is a thriller, a mystery, a gripping story of perseverance and of hope, but most of all it's the story of a mother's love for her children and husband. Grace Covey is a mom, living in England, who is at her children's Sports Day celebration when she discovers her children's school is on fire. Her son Adam, eight, is safely outside, but her seventeen-year-old daughter Jenny, has been assigned to work as the school nurse is working and probably trapped on the third floor. Grace goes in to save her and the next thing she knows, she wakes up in a hospital, unable to move or communicate in any way. But her mind is very much alive and able to move around the hospital and beyond. The rest of the book is about her trying to discover how the fire started (They find out early on that it was arson.) and trying to find a way save her daughter who is also in a coma.<br /><br />The story is told in Grace's voice as she speaks to her husband, a journalist for BBC. It's a total paranormal, \\"out of body\\" experience but is amazingly believable to this reader. The pace moves quickly and it was a difficult book to put down. Trying to guess who started the fire becomes more challenging with each new twist as more information becomes available. But this book is more than a mystery, it's about a mother's love for her family and about her growing realization that her children are separate people, with lives and thoughts of their own, and about letting them become people in their own right as they mature. It's a touching story and I loved Grace right from the beginning. It's a book I will continue to be haunted by for many years to come. Two thumbs up for this great novel!

Comes in great shape new.<br /><br />About the movie, you have to keep an open mind to really enjoy it. I don't know how it gets reviews of 1 star, but, meh. To each his own.<br />Great buy and worth having in a collection if you're a fan of Hunter S. Thompson or Johnny Depp. :)

I just loved the design and color so I thought it would at least be worth a try.  It's fits perfectly and the elastic bands are stretched over the corners enough to feel secure.  A lot of the reviews mention that it's difficult to get the Fire to fit in the case, and the Fire is just slightly bigger than the Touch.  Also, some people complain that the case doesn't close all the way with the Fire.  It closes just fine with the Touch.  It was certainly worth the risk!

1439127700|4.0|Even if you think you're familiar with contemporary American political history, this book will give you details that you haven't heard.  Beginning with Truman's relationship with Hoover and coming forward to touch on President Obama's evolving relationship with Bill Clinton, this book is full of examples of how former presidents have worked together (and sometimes not) and with the current president (and sometimes not).  It's written in a non=partisan way that doesn't overlook a former president's achievements or failings.  I highly recommend it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Noooooo, I don't want it to stop!  I've just set Wool down after days of coming to work late because I was slowly walking from the subway to the office, making every step last as long as I could, just to get a couple more pages in before I had to stop reading.  This is such an enjoyable series of books that I'm welling up inside with feelings of gratitude for the author.  Rarely does a science fiction book of this calibre also manage to make you feel for the characters like this book does.  The situation you are presented with is unique and interesting both from a scientific and engineering perspective, as well as from a sociological, human perspective.  I will no doubt spend many nights in bed, thinking over this story, and I can't wait for my girlfriend to read it so I can relive the moments and discuss their trials and tribulations.  Really an outstanding piece of literature.<br /><br />This is a book that could transform people into lovers of science fiction.
0230754902|5.0|John Puller is Army CID and this book introduces this interesting man who is flying solo on his newest assignment out of his normal area.  His help is mostly local and of course, there is an attractive lady cop.  Both characters are given a complicated life history intertwined with the death of 7 people in this small coal mining community.  I enjoy Baldacci's character development and that was true in this story (even the lesser characters).  There is plenty of suspense, misdirection, and action. It was very difficult to put aside for any amount of time.  For those of you who enjoy technical details (think Tom Clancy), you can find that here as well.  A little about problems of coal mining and pollution and government duplicity (who can you trust these days?)are thrown in with some unexpected twists at the end.

B000FBFN1U|5.0|This book is amazing. Like all the others in the series A Song of Ice and Fire, George RR Martin has created a setting and characters that delight, frighten and entertain. The action is well done, the dialogue is wonderful and the overall setting of the Seven Kingdoms is amazing.<br /><br />In the pages of this book, and the others in the series, you'll find yourself swept up in the political intrigue, the court formalities and intrigues, and you'll find yourself rooting for your favorite character and hissing your favorite enemy. Definately worth the read.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Yes,I do agree after reading the Mockingjay you can feel a little angry. Or in other peoples' reviews, very angry. I will not say that reading this book was a waste of time. But I will say it is not as great as The Hunger Games or Catching Fire. It took me a while to finish this book because it didn't seem to be part of The Hunger Games trilogy. But I was only a few chapters in the book when I made this comment. I kept reading though knowing this must be worth reading. I was right!!!!!!<br />This book,to me, is a THRILLER!!!!!!!!!!!!! The MOCKINGJAY is something to give you happy moments, sad moments, and pure anger moments. Which I've been waiting for my whole life and this comment goes for all The Hunger Games books.<br />I recomand this book 100%.<br />True or not true?<br />TRUE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The characters are damn frustrating as they go from one extreme emotion to another and everything is completely unbelievable from the way they act, talk and interact with eachother and everyone around them to the plot lines.  Just some of the stupid plot lines and annoying occurances that you will find in this trilogy:<br /><br />*SPOILER ALERT*<br /><br />1)This couple gets engaged after knowing eachother for 3 months and then she FORGETS to get her birth control shot not once but twice and ends up getting pregnant at 22.<br /><br />2) She rescues her sister in law from her old boss who tried to rape her and who was in the same foster home as Christian. HOLY COW! DOUBLE JEEZ!<br /><br />3)Christian constantly tells her to USE HER BLACKBERRY and then when she gets into trouble with her boss Christian has to do damage control and have all her emails wiped from the main drive and she sniffles and doesn't understand WHY he's so mad??!!!!!!<br /><br />4) She doesn't want to take his name as she wants to 'make it on her own' in her industry. This is hysterical as she was given the job as editor once Christian bought the company she works for so that he can protect her. What?!!!???!<br /><br />5) She's always lamenting on how she hasn't worked for all the things she has now that she's married to a billionaire but that doesn't stop her from telling her husband he can buy her a sports car for her birthday. Or a $500 bikini.<br /><br />6) Her best friend ends up marrying Christian's brother??!! And her brother dates Christian's sister???!!<br /><br />There are no original thoughts, actions, ideas or characters in this book. Phrases are used over and over again and it's just snoozeville. It's comical reading about his 'hooded eyes' and his long index finger (gross and creepy) and her OH MY's and HOLY CRAP's and all the faces her subconscious makes.<br /><br />I hope this author never writes another book, it's too embarassing.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|This book was painful for me to read. The character, Christian, is the only reason for reading any of the series. The pointless events in Book 3 are too numerous to list... Ana's father's accident, the trip to Aspen, the pregnancy...on and on and on. A better writer would be able to express all the sentiment without all the absurd events. I was very disappointed in the ending of the series.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Like everyone else, I had heard SO many great reviews about this book from friends, co-workers and strangers talking about it in the nail salon. I got the sample on my Kindle and could not even get through it because (let's say it all together) 'The writing was SO BAD, the plot was WEAK, the characters UNBELIEVABLE and the 'hot' parts were definitely NOT hot.' After even more cajoling from friends I bought the book and trudged through it. WHY GOD WHY?!!!!! It took me about 6 hours of reading to get through it and that's 6 hours I'll definitely want back at the end of my life.<br />The bad reviews on Amazon were a better read than this book. At least they were funny, thoughtful, in-depth and evoked some sort of emotion. How much did I hate this book, let me count the ways...<br />1) Anastasia: (terrible soap opera name) is the worst heroine of any novel EVER. Her insipid thoughts were rage inducing because she's so stupid, immature, juvenile, ridiculous and annoying. Being naive is one thing but being a total non-thinker DINGBAT is another. Having to read her thoughts was DAMN DAMN annoying! Everything is in italics! HOLY COW! JEEZ! DOUBLE JEEZ! I HAVEN'T EATEN ALL DAY AND NOW I'M IN TROUBLE! (BITE MY LIP) YES MR GREY (AS I LOOK UP FROM BENEATH MY LONG LASHES) I HAVE A FUNNY FEELING 'DOWN THERE'. HOLY CRAP! DOUBLE CRAP! OH MY! And that's just in the first chapter...I'm supposed to believe that she's a beautiful (\\"So beautiful..\\")22 year old virgin who has had zero experience with men?!!? And she somehow graduated college without having an email address or a computer??!!!<br /><br />2) Christian Grey: is a creppy stalker extraordinaire and an abusive control freak and any rational woman would run away from him but because he's HOT and RICH it somehow makes it ok that he's these things? He's a 28 year old billionaire who's also the hottest thing on the planet and is SO captivated by a girl who can't get out a sentence and wears old navy? puhleeze! And he speaks fluentfrench, flies his own helicopter and plays piano like Beethoven.OKAAAAY....<br /><br />3) Anastasia's inner goddess. Double OKAAAYY...<br /><br />4) Her subconscious. For cripes sake, we are NOT aware of our subconscious! It's SUBconscious which means it's below our conscious and we are not aware of it. For Anastasia though, her subconscious is an older woman who alternately smiles at her and gives her a thumbs up or frowns at her above her reading glasses as she's reading Jane Eyre.<br /><br />5) The writing is just so bad, so awful.<br /><br />6) The sex is...uninspiring and robotic. It doesn't flow and seem natural or at all exciting. Probably because it's peppered with all of Anastasia's sophmoric thoughts.<br /><br />What does it say about women (in general) who fell in love with this character who is so abusive, lost, controlling and damaged? Is it the 'my love is enough to fix him!' delusion? Is it, 'who cares if he's a stalker and controlling? he wants me and showers me with affection, attention and gifts!' Is it the mother in us that is attracted to the lost little boy in a man's body that needs taking care of? I just want someone to explain it to me why they find this man so appealing and why they think this is such a great love story??!!!!!<br /><br />BLEH! Don't waste your time and money!

B0072OFM28|1.0|(sorry for the typing errors if there are any.  I typed this on my iphone.  Not the easiest thing to type on)<br /><br />(also, i should add that I'm a HUGE fan of season 1 AND the prequel)<br /><br />REVIEW:<br /><br />How can anyone honestly say this season was any good at all?  I won't go into the writing much, but my god... It was just atrocious.  I wont go into it because it would just take forever.  Lets just leave it at that.  I'll just highlight the low points real quick.<br /><br />1) When did everything that came out of everyones mouth sound like they were attempting poetry?  I'm sorry, but I doubt they talked like that back then.  The first 2 seasons had exceptional writing where the way they spoke didnt sound so utterly rediculous.  Now, its like they are just reading right off the cue cards.<br />2)  Is there even a debate as to the writing being worse than a soap opera?  How implausible could things really get?  Again, the first 2 seasons were AMAZING.  What the heck happened?  Did they let the interns write this instead?<br /><br />3) Did the entire budget go into all the excessive blood they used?  Becasue obviously the budget wasn't spent on anything else.<br /><br />4(A)  Now the 2 characters they replaced.  First off, Navia (or however you spell her name).  Couldn't have chosen a worse actress, especially for that character.  I'm sorry, but I don't buy that Crixus was in love with..... that.  The old Navia had a certain confidence.  The new chick just plain didn't.  That is a combination of bad writing and her acting... So not ALL her fault.  But she was a terrible actress none-the-less.  Hey Starz... Maybe you should try to secure your actors contracts in your top shows for more than 1 season at a time.. Because when you don't, this is what you get as a replacement.  I guess this is a STARZ policy from what I've read.  They never sign anyone to a contract for more than 1 season.<br /><br />4(B) Now onto the most unforgivable.  The actor portraying Spartacus.  Now, I'm not a hater when it comes to actor replacements.  In fact, I actually liked Kutcher in \\"2.5 Men\\".  Not as good as Sheen, but a worthy replacement.  But I'm sorry.  This Liam guy doesnt hold a candle to the one and only Andy Whitfield (RIP).  Has Liam ever made an expression before?  If so, then he sure as hell didn't use any in this show.  It seems like the producers walked down the street looking for a replacement for Andy, and saw this model/pretty boy walking down the street and asked him to portray Spartacus.  Im sorry, but the man just is NOT an actor.  He is a womans magazine cover model.  The guy doesnt even look like he could kill my grandma let alone the entire Roman army.<br /><br />I'm sorry if it sounds like I'm overly harsh, but im just mad that the producers/writers have screwed up such an awesome show.  If they could do 1 season without its title character, then we know it can be done.  Because frankly, I'd rather say screw it to the Spartacus story line and go back to the Batiatus House... Oh wait... I forgot... You've already killed off your best actor/character.  To bad.<br /><br />So in short, I most definetly will NOT BE BUYING SPARTACUS VENGEANCE.

0061478784|5.0|Sophie Hatter is certain she is doomed to a boring life. As the eldest child, she is bound to fail while her younger sisters go on to happiness. This inevitability seems to come to fruition when their father dies. Lettie, her middle sister is sent to apprentice at the town's bakery where she is likely to catch a fine husband, and Martha, the youngest, is sent to Mrs. Fairfax to apprentice the witch and learn her spells and power. Sophie, fatefully enough, is stuck managing the family hat shop with her step-mother. Resigned to her woeful inheritance, Sophie breaths life into her work, creating hats of beauty that bring in business from all corners. Intrigued in her skills, The Witch of the Waste pays a visit to the shop, where she ends up cursing Sophie with old age, while ensuring that she won't be able to tell a soul. Sophie determines that there's little point in staying around, and decides to strike out and seek her fortune. As her fortune would have it, she ends up at Howl's door.<br /><br />This book. I loved this book. It was so much fun, full of fantasy and wonder, I honestly don't have a bad word to say about it. This is the kind of book that makes me cry over not having read it as a child, and I want to push it into the hands of anyone and everyone I know who loves middle grade and fantasy, no matter their age. Diana Wynne Jones's writing is so very whimsical and smart. I love middle grade authors that are so utterly intelligent. I feel like too many times the age group gets written down to, but not in this case. In fact, the characters in Howl's Moving Castle aren't even middle grade themselves! Sophie is eighteen (or about 90, respectively), Howl is in his 20s; in my mind Howl's Moving Castle brilliantly includes characters of all ages, managing to write them faithfully to their differences and similarities.<br /><br />Sophie is timid, and lacks confidence as a young woman, but almost instantly upon becoming 90, she sheds the uncertainties and delicacies of youth. She doesn't have to be self-conscious of the things a teenager does, and so Sophie allows herself to be the hardened, nosey, insistent woman she really is. I love it. I love that Sophie is constantly doing things she knows will upset Howl, but she never lies about them when he confronts her, she just owns up. Howl, of course, is a wonderful character. What he appears to be on the surface, and what he really is underneath don't quite line up, but yet he manages to be completely himself at all times. They're both rather saucy really.<br /><br />The other characters in the castle, Michael and Calcifer, are equally wonderful. Michael is the 15 year old apprentice boy, and Calcifer is the fire-demon who helps to power Howl's moving castle. Calcifer entreats Sophie to stay (and she very much wants to, because honestly, where else would she go?) and break the contract locking him and Howl together. Michael, obviously annoyed with Sophie initially, quickly softens and begins to take to her. So many of the characters in this book seem to have such large hearts, despite their appearances (and possibly their intentions).<br /><br />The story of Howl's Moving Castle is full of magic, whimsy, and spectacle. I loved that while the story stayed strictly tacked on to Sophie, it was very clear that everyone else was having marvelous adventures as well. I find it enchanting that we get to know this, to glimpse these other stories, without really being privy to the details. Also, I found Howl's Moving Castle to be pleasantly unpredictable. I was never sure quite which way the story was going, and I loved that Sophie and the others seemed to figure things out before I did. I hate always being the first to know! I really couldn't recommend Howl's Moving Castle more, and I'm certain I'll be reading it again in years to come.of youth.

B0052VUNHC|3.0|I have read this book twice, and my honest opinion was that I enjoyed it. It was quick, fast-paced, relatable, and compelling. I love a good romance story, and this one was passable. However, I will admit that I also developed a \\"love/hate relationship\\" with the book. While I did not want to put the book down, there were also quite a few incidences where I wanted to chuck my Kindle Fire across the room due to sheer annoyance and anger with the story.*******SPOILERS AHEAD********<br /><br />PROS:<br />1) COLLEGE SETTING: I am in college myself (although not a freshman or sophomore like main characters Abby Abernathy and Travis Maddox), and it was refreshing to see a book taking place during college. Most of the YA books are in high school and then jump straight into Adult Fiction, with no in-between. The college setting is probably what initially appealed to me most when I made the decision to purchase this book several months ago.<br /><br />CONS:<br />1) UNREALISTIC: I found it extremely hard to believe Abby, who was a supposed \\"good girl\\" wearing pink cashmere cardigans, not a big drinker, and a virgin, would ever agree to staying in Travis's apartment for a MONTH and sharing his bed. Let alone then changing in front of him, wearing his T-shirts, snuggling in bed with him, and going on dates with him! All while INSISTING they are \\"just friends\\"! Talk about leading a guy on. And I find it equally hard to believe that Travis would not make a move on her while they shared the same bed. He is a clear man-whore and loves sex and women, plus was attracted to Abby. I find it hard to believe that he wouldn't try anything with her (despite getting drunk almost every night) simply because she was \\"different\\".<br /><br />2) WHAT KIND OF A UNIVERSITY IS THIS?! What university has a \\"cafeteria\\" instead of a dining hall, and no adult supervision? Why wasn't Travis kicked out for violence and beating innocent people up during lunch? Why weren't Abby and Travis kicked out of class for such inappropriate PDA all the time? Also, no RAs in the dorms (especially Abby's all girl dorm) that would provide any security and stop Travis from barging in and stalking her?<br /><br />3) ABBY IS A BITCH/TRAVIS IS BORDERLINE ABUSIVE: She is rude to her roommate Kara, who is only trying to actually STUDY. She and America (the best friend) make fun of Kara, which was a HUGE character flaw for Abby. Abby is also whiny, conceited, selfish, stupid, and never seems to think anything through. I wanted to slap her across the face for being such a terrible protagonist. Travis was also a stalker with severe anger management  issues and aggression. He was violent towards others and red flags were everywhere.<br /><br />There are other issues that other reviewers have noted that I agree with, such as the poor writing, excessive drinking, Vegas, and loose ends. Overall, while this book certainly pushed my buttons and was a true \\"Beautiful Disaster\\", it kept me reading and is worth a shot if you like to thoroughly critique books.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I gave this two stars because I managed to finish reading it but really this was just unoriginal, poorly written porn. I bought this to see what all the fuss was about and I don't get it. I was more annoyed than turned on or interested in reading more. Most annoying parts of this book: repetitive, repetitive, repetitive. Also, the random use of big words (ridiculous that the author found this necessary or that it fit with the characters or moment), Ana's inner goddess (lame), the condradictory nature of Christian (she can't touch him but it seems like she does a lot, he doesn't sleep with anyone but he sleeps and cuddles with her, etc), you get a physical description of some characters but not of her (is she really plain because three guys in this book want her?), her constant eye rolling, lip biting, oh mys, banter, releasing, gasping, frowning, glaring and pressing of the lips in a hard line made me want to roll my own eyes and shut off my kindle. I don't get why he's so into her, I don't get her desire to be with a man she just met who wants to spank her into submission (hot or not, I'd head for the hills especially given the fact that we don't even have an established connection), they do not speak or seem like 22 and 27, no one has sex that much and is able to walk afterward much less do it again a few more times...really, I could go on and on (like the book). Bottomline is this is horribly written and in need of editing and better character development.

The first half offers uptempo, fun dance music that will definitely get you chair dancing or motivate you to get on the dance floor and move your booty. I'm a very hard to please music lover and until Trespassing I didn't care that much about buying anyone's music since Adam's debut album FYE. This album goes to a much higher level in cohesiveness with each song being a part of Adam's life so far. It's hard to pick a favorite and it changes daily. But if you want to try buy the album and you won't be disappointed I promise.

1451626657|5.0|\\"Catch-22\\" has been sitting in one of my bookshelves staring at me for more than thirty years.  I've always been meaning to read it but kept putting off the effort.  Why?  I guess the book intimidated me.  I saw it as complex and obtuse.  I thought I might not understand it.  But what foolishness was all this?  The book is a masterpiece of modern English.  How could I have been so mis-informed?  So naïve?<br /><br />Where to begin?  Well, in the first place, the book has no real plot.  Rather, it is a series of events regarding \\"Yo-Yo\\" Yossarian and his attempts to be sent home to the US from Italy in the Second World War.  In the process, we are introduced to a host of bizarre characters.  Some are his peers, some are more senior officers.  But despite all his efforts, he seems destined to remain on the Italian island of Pianosa from where he is sent on missions to bomb various targets in France and Italy.  Every time he gets within striking distance of the requisite number of missions that would grant him a ticket home, his nemesis, Colonel Cathcart raises the bar.  Yossarian's hopes are always being dashed.<br /><br />In essence, \\"Catch-22\\" is a book about the futility of war.  In spite of its chaos, one side will win.  Along the way, maddeningly insane decisions will be made.  Welcome to the world of Yossarian.  He is simply struggling against the system.  The reader is also introduced to a mad cap cast.  Each character is crazy in his or her own way.  Joseph Heller clearly had a wonderful and often hilarious imagination.<br /><br />When, I first began \\"Cath-22\\", I was thinking of awarding it four stars.  However, after about fifty pages, it was clear that it warranted five.  The pity is that more cannot be awarded.  It would certainly deserve them.

B0058YPILY|5.0|\\"Criminal Minds\\" returned for its seventh season in 2011-2012, with a fresh set of disturbing and violent crimes to be solved by the FBI's elite Bahavorial Analysis Unit (BAU) and its ecclectic collection of agents.  A highlight of the season was the return of profiler Emily Prentiss \\"from the dead\\", with emotional ramifications for the whole team.<br /><br />The show continues to thrive on its crime-of-the-week format, as the BAU races the clock to identify and stop a violent killer or killers while saving victims.  Clever plots continue to take unusual twists and turns.  As in past seasons, the spotlight shifts from episode to episode among the actors in an outstanding ensemble cast, giving each a chance to lead on a case.  This season has featured increased insight into the personal lives of the characters.  One member of the team gets a girlfriend, another gets a marriage proposal, a third is haunted by an old case, and a fourth decides to leave the BAU.  A senior supervisor goes to pieces on the job.  The extended season-ending cliffhanger will have long-time fans on the edges of their seats, as the whole team is put in danger during a violent hostage standoff during a bank robbery.<br /><br />The Seventh Season of \\"Criminal Minds\\" is highly recommended to its fans for its consistent delivery of solid, scary stories and good to excellent acting by its cast.

B000007VCO|5.0|Up until 1974 and his collaboration with Alice Coltrane the Santana name had referred to an oft rotating band with Carlos Santana as it's lead player. At the end of the 70's however that started to change. Carlos for his part had become fascinated with Sri Chinmoy and began a \\"solo\\" career that spoke of his burgeoning interest in spirituality. In accordance with this he is credited here as Devadip Carlos Santana. With members of his band such as Tom Coster still in attendance this album serves as both a tribute and a collaboration with Chinmoy,who provided not only a lot of inspiration but apparently a lot of literal creative input as well. While commercially this was basically the disco era there was still a great deal of that 60's/early 70's spiritually based creative energy left in music to make a something like this work.<br /><br />  The first five numbers on this album represent a very firey jazz-rock fusion jam recorded with the lives of Coster on keys,as well as drummers Narada Michael Walden and Graham Lear from Gino Vannelli's band this gets things off to a great start. The title song is a spiritually soulful ballad which is either sung by Coster or Carlos himself-not sure. But the fruity,otherworldy vocal works quite well. \\"Cry Of The Wilderness\\" showcases an upbeat danceable pop/funk groove that's very melodic,orchestrated and has a mildly EWF flavor about it with the carnival type atmosphere. \\"Guru's Song\\" and \\"Oneness\\" both carry this jazz-soul ballad flavor where Greg Walker's vocals on the hard urban funk of \\"Life Is Just A Passing Parade\\" actually tells some of the story of Carlos himself and is a strong highlite. The closing \\"Song For Devadip\\" is another highlite,showcasing that carnival type groove very well again.<br /><br />  In a lot of ways this album contains some of Santana's best playing and stronger musical ideas. Because it was aimed directly at the soul of the listener and not at their pocket book,it probably wasn't quite as well known to people who weren't huge Santana followers at this time. At the same time it's emphasis on Buddist/Eastern philosophies and melodies often based more in abstract style jazz than pop music,it raised some larger issues of Carlos's music in general. Santana has always very nicely walked that line between the spiritual and the accessible in his music. He never lost sight of that cooperative San Francisco musical melting pot from which his band first came to be. And honestly? To this day I think it's a key aspect to what he is. This is an album of music that deeply respects the connection of strong music to strong melody. An enormous amount of care was put into it.  And the apparent peace of mind Carlos's spiritual journey took him on expresses itself here in a series of not primarily slow ballads but joyous and funk rhythms too.o people who weren't huge Santana followers at this time.

B004478GN8|4.0|Product was received in a timely manor and it was not damaged, however the packaging of the product was tacky, as the box was damaged.  Packaging should have been better insulated.
B007MJ9LA2|5.0|Obviously there must have been a good deal of questions as to Santana's musical motivations when his last trio of albums,beginning with 1999's [[ASIN:B00000J7J4 Supernatural]] gained success largely built on \\"A\\" list guest artists. It seemed like music of the moment-pop in it's most obvious state. At the same time Carlos Santana hadn't really changed a thing. All of these albums contained at least one or more instrumentals of the type he had made so famous. Still there was an impression it was guests selling these albums,not the artist himself. So musically this album was meant to represent a return with the Santana band to their classic sound. What that means in the end is no guest stars and few vocals,placing the emphasis on instrumental talent. Interesting part is this album represents the end result of a long labor of love. This was in fact something worked on and off on since the early 1990's. While that era effects some of the production quality,there's no question where the music comes from.<br /><br />  All of the music on this album is informed by some type of socio-cultural spiritual context or another. The opening title song blends Afro-latin influences with that of aboriginal American dances. The only song here that actually rocks out pretty heavy is \\"Nomad\\",although the guitar playing is rather piercing and abstract for Santana's usual style. \\"Melatron\\" does something similar as does \\"Dom\\" only in a more dramatic and melodic kind of way. On the other angle \\"Angelica Earth\\",\\"Never The Same Again\\" and \\"In The Light Of A New Day\\" are both moodily chorded R&B/jazz type ballads that...well they have an early 90's flavor and rhythm but work very well in this context. \\"Spark Of The Device\\",\\"Macumba In Budapest\\" and...well the remainder of this album in fact is a full on re-imagining of the sound of Woodstock era Santana,abound with fierce afro latin percussion and Santana's transcendent way with the guitar.<br /><br />  In more obvious terms this is the kind of album that will get real musicians talking pretty fast,as it is largely instrumental. For the \\"I like the songs but wish someone would sing\\" crowd? This may not be the Santana album for them if their very closed minded. On the other hand,Santana's guitar has this almost vocal quality about it sometimes. But a vocal the human voice couldn't easily make. This is an album of music that,as with a lot of what Santana does,is something more to be experienced than merely listened to. He's always been one of the most musically distinctive artists operating in the rock world. And that aspect of his art hasn't changed a bit on this album. Now truth be said,this is not the album I would send someone to for a beginners education on Santana. That would...probably be recordings such as [[ASIN:B0000062FL Abraxas]],[[ASIN:B0000A2I1B Caravanserai]] and [[ASIN:B0012GN47C Amigos]]. But at the same time this is a superb example of Santana's true musical energies shining through by the emphasis being put back on his musicianship.f album that will get real musicians talking pretty fast,as it is largely instrumental.

B001AQO400|4.0|I am not a ScarJo or Bill Murray fan (except for his golf movie), though both have done several good works.  For those seeking action, this movie will disappoint.  For people who like character studies with more than a touch of real-life situations and choices, this is a GOOD movie.  Though Hollywood would have us believe such encounters always end in sex, and often regrets, my own experiences, and those of many others I know, found companionship on lone trips that made the trip nicer, even if no follow-up was expected or done.  It's ok to meet (in my case) a gal where sex is not on the menu.  I enjoy meeting people.  I'm not married.  So while some think me a potential threat, I'm not handsome or debonair, just an intelligent guy who likes to share experiences with someone interesting.  Some women don't care for that, some do.  The movie reflects the latter, and I found it interesting as an older/younger relationship based on two bored people looking for that companionship.  I thought it well done, and just realistic enough to enjoy.  Too much gratuitous sex in too many movies to titillate the youngsters, and this brought it back to more human.  Good movie for a relaxing evening, even with a girlfriend (it's not threatening) or casual date.  Some nice scenery in Japan, and points up Tokyo's horrendous urban jungle.  I recommend it for those who aren't looking for slam-bang action or new sexual thrills, that just want to see how men and women can enjoy each other as people.  And the BluRay version is a good transfer.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Please don't read this just because the media is hyping it. I did and I am regretting it. The book is poorly written and the main character spends half the book talking about her \\"inner goddess\\". (She calls her dirty thoughts her \\"inner goddess\\" Barf.) The main character is timid one minute, then alternately, scared, lovey, pushy, whiney, sarcastic, then timid, then sarcatic BACK to timid... The author couldn't seem to stick with her characters personality so she was pretty all over. The character of Christian is mildly interesting at some points but then the 'inner goddess' comes out and more nonesense occurs. I have never read a less erotic \\"romance\\" novel in my entire life.<br /><br />My advice is to not read it. I wish I hadn't.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I was highly dissatisfied with this book.  Katniss is agitated throughout the book (understandable, given the circumstances) but oddly passive and disengaged.  This passivity is not consistent with her character in the first two books.  Also, many of the most important events in the book happen while Katniss is unconscious, catatonic, or hiding in a supply closet.  Why did the trial turn out the way it did?  We'll never know.  We didn't get to see any of it.  When major events in a story are not shown, only conveyed in brief summary, it feels as if there is no logical reason for them besides the author's whim.  Still, if you read the first two books you should probably read this one to see how things turn out.  If the first two books weren't so good, I couldn't recommend this one, though.

0345803507|1.0|Fifty Shades of Grey was a guilty pleasure, based on the book's ability to make me escape into a romantic, sexy world where mousy, shy milquetoasts capture the passion of hot billionaire dominants.  I read it and Fifty Shades Darker in a couple of very entertaining days.  By Fifty Shades Freed, due to excruciating character inconsistencies, loose story ends, uninspired plot devices and less sex, I was barely able to finish.  I expected a certain amount of ridiculousness from the book, but Anastasia's job promotion in publishing after having written up a couple of manuscripts was so far-fetched that I completely sympathized with her pissed off and distrusting co-workers.  I was no happier when Anastasia, who in the first book was the self-doubting but modern and relatable Everygirl, became old-fashioned and submissive (not in the sexy Playroom way--in the Cold War era housewife way).  I was highly distracted by storylines that were started and quickly forgotten:  the status of Ethan and Mia's relationship, Gia in Aspen (why?). Ray's hospital drama was pointless.  Worst of all, Christian became the Ralph Kramden of BDSM--\\"I'm going to put you over my knee...\\" and then he wouldn't follow through!  Or he would follow through but I didn't get to read about it because EL James didn't describe it.  That is the crux of my problem with Freed--not enough sex.  I got the books because of the sex. I know nothing about the BDSM world am not a connoisseur of erotica, but I know that what kept me reading the first two books the series, and Fifty Shades Freed didn't have it.

0439023521|5.0|Oh Katniss, how I love thee!  What is up with the controversy around how she lacks agency within the context of the Hunger Games?  Exactly how does one define agency?  If one was to define agency in a very simplistic way - - as \\"being the aggressor\\", then ok, she lacks agency.  If one was to think of agency as actually developing a plan and using your brains to survive, then she really, isn't she actively participating in the Games?<br /><br />I find it ironic that this argument about Katniss lacking agency is emerging from feminists (this, coming from a feminist), because the criticism is based on the concept of \\"agency\\" from a masculine perspective (agency = aggression). I've also recently read the argument that Katniss is a strong feminist character because it's ultimately her use of feminine characteristics (i.e., nurturing, bonding with other female characters, etc.) that saves her.  Right, she didn't play up her \\"relationship\\" with Peeta to get food, medicine, etc.  She didn't twirl in her fire dress to get sponsors...  Hmmm...<br /><br />Regardless of whether Katniss is a feminist or anti-feminist (I like to think of her as a girl thrown into despicable circumstances), I think we can all agree on one thing...she's not Bella.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is a fantastic book for a number of reasons:  strong characters, great plot, and solid writing.  Ok, the story itself reminded me of the Running Man but because we are actually in the thick of \\"reality TV\\" obsession and because there are children involved (and I'm a parent), it was that much more interesting, albeit disturbing.<br /><br />Really though, at the end of the day, Suzanne Collins is a brilliant writer.  It's the writing that carries this book.  I haven't read the next two yet (they're on the ever-growing list!) but I'm hoping they will be just as good.

B0034G4P8A|5.0|In the magical and mystical realms of Asguard where Norse legends are told, a brave but arrogant warrior named Thor (Chris Hensworth) has caused a ruckus on another realm and making his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) upset, indeed so mad that his father banishes him out of Asguard on Earth where he is a mortal man who will learn humility as punishment. Odin even sends the mighty hammer down on Earth in a stone much like in \\"Sword in the Stone\\" where only that worthy person can obtain the hammer, Thor falls in love with a scientist named Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) where she teaches him things he might soon learn about. His half-brother Loki (Tom Hiddleson) has plans like terrorizing the people on Earth and taking over Asguard as the new leader, when Thor's 4 friends (Ray Stevenson, Tanabou Asandu, Jaime Alexander and Josh Dallas) hear about this they head to Earth to warn Thor but can the god of thunder learn what it means to be a true hero?<br /><br />An outstanding and worthy companion in the Avengers-Marvel saga as it started with the prequel \\"Captain America\\" and ends with this movie as the final piece of the linking puzzle that leads to the excellent \\"Avengers\\" movie. This fantasy-adventure is a nice throwback to those wonderful 80s fantasy epics like \\"Willow\\", \\"Conan 1 & 2\\", \\"Heavy Metal\\", \\"Excalibur\\", \\"Clash of the Titans\\" and others. The acting is great as is the special effects that make Asguard look fantastic as if you were transported to that magical world and the storytelling is great as well as it follows the comics nicely. The film co-stars Samuel L Jackson, Colm Ferroee and Rene Russo, director Kenneth Brangh who is one of the most acclaimed directors around has brought some shakespearian opera level drama to this movie and a great sense of fun as it was something different for him. I should say if you are know the chronology to The Avengers movies then start with Captain America, Iron Man, Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2 and finally this to link the story that leads up to the best Marvel film ever made.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray contains absolute crystal picture and theater quality sound as it makes the movie come alive and the extras are good like commentary, 7 featurettes, Road to Avengers: Behind the Scenes quick featurette, 11 deleted scenes, an amusing Marvel short film and teaser/trailer.ry that leads up to the best Marvel film ever made.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray contains absolute crystal picture and theater quality sound as it makes the movie come alive and the extras are good like commentary, 7 featurettes, Road to Avengers: Behind the Scenes quick featurette, 11 deleted scenes, an amusing Marvel short film and teaser/trailer.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Pros:<br />- Great-looking design. I don't need to describe it since there are a ton of pictures, but I love the way it looks.<br />- The 37 mm size is totally against the trend of bigger and bigger men's watches, and in my opinion that's a good trend not to follow.<br />- Probably the most affordable automatic around, and a proven and classic movement as well.<br />- Love the skeleton case back.<br />- Mine gains about 8-10 seconds per day, which works out to about a minute per week. That's better than my other affordable automatic, an Orient Mako, and great for an automatic watch this inexpensive.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- If you don't care about the aesthetic differences between a quartz and automatic movement (like most people), there's no reason to put up with a watch that gains a minute per week and has to be reset any time you don't wear it for a couple of days.<br />- I wish it had a bit more water resistance, not because I plan to go swimming in it, but just so I don't feel like I have to be careful with it around water.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this is a great affordable watch for watch nerds who like automatics, and it has become my go-to casual watch, especially in the summer. It will look good on anyone's wrist, but those who just want a watch that tells time and don't care how it does it should probably stick with something quartz.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I am so grateful for this series! After I finished reading the Game of Thrones books, I found myself in a state of depression. Nothing sounded appealing to me and I waffled about, trying to find something creative to read.<br /><br />Enter the Name of the Wind. The premise appealed to me and it had been recommended to me by someone also in that post-Game of Thrones funk.<br /><br />I should give you a heads up--the story takes a bit to pick up, a couple of chapters in before you get to the meat. Once it does pick up, though, the pages fly.<br /><br />Kvothe is a brilliant character, but he's not clearly good or evil. He is arrogant, conceited, and impatient. He's overly concerned with appearances and money (though understandable) and a good portion of the books deals with him trying to manage his finances. He's willing to commit \\"malfeasance\\" to make ends meet, but it all tends to be forgiven because he is so obviously smart. The pace moves fairly quickly--his entire childhood to the age of 15 or 16 is covered. The Chandrian are seen only briefly but manage to make a lasting impression of slimy, malicious evil. I do wish Rothfuss put a little bit more emphasis on Kvothe's friends, as he is generally pretty isolated. We'll see how the next one goes.<br /><br />I really enjoyed reading this book--so much so that when THIS book ended, I again went into a post-reading funk. (Oh, the perils of reading...). I cannot wait to read the next one!

B0000048CP|5.0|Yes!  The finest album by Bathory.  Insanely influential and deep, not a track on the album disappoints, but in fact grows on you like a fungus.  Much different than the bands previous efforts, this album is more melodic and insidious, felt strongly in the instrumental opening track 'Odens Ride Over Nordland'.  The jaw-dropping 'A Fine Day to Die' (which references the Robert Chambers short story 'Cassilda's Song') attacks like a gauntlet, as does the title track, an epic in itself, clocking in at 10 min of raw nihilism.  The loss of Quorthon has left an indelible hole in the genre and there is no better example of just how influential he was than with this album.
B007PS0X0W|2.0|I loved the first movie.  I enjoyed the second movie.  The third movie....<br />If you think of it as watching someone else play a video game, it will be OK.  Don't expect much in the way of plot or even dialogue.  It is pretty, though. I'm happy I didn't waste theater money on it. It's pretty modest for an R-rated movie.

B007C4ZJ3K|1.0|This movie could not decide what it wanted to be. One the one hand, it tried to be an intelligent Le Carre style spy thriller, but the plot and the acting were simply not good enough to pull that off. On the other hand, it also tried to be the female Bourne, but the action sequences felt contrived and thrown in for no logical reason. Gina Carano is not going to be the next action heroine, and I would be very surprised if we see her at all in another film. Haywire is a perfect example of how amalgamating a significant amount of talent in one place does not necessarily result in a  good or even decent product. Half way through the movie, I grabbed my laptop and just kept the film running in the background; I simply did not care about what happened next.

0393327345|5.0|Like most, I read this book after seeing the movie so many times I can practically recite it from memory.  I can't say the book is better or worse than the movie, just different.  Of course, 99% of the movie is verbatim from the book, but there is that small 1% that is very different.  I believe that the main difference that stands out to me is that the book is largely metaphorical, even in the words of the author, \\"the book could have been about anything, it could just have easily been 'Barn-Raising Club' or 'Gold Club', and it probably would have sold more books.\\"  I don't think this is true, but the point is, the book is largely a metaphor for confused men that feel resentment because they are out of touch with their own society, and the anger that that resentment breeds.  Another quote from the author, \\"Bookstores are full of books like 'The Joy Luck Club' and 'The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood' and 'How to Make an American Quilt'.  These are all novels that presented a social model for women to be together, but there was no novel that presented a new social model for men to share their lives.\\"  As a man, I feel the pain of the characters in this book, but I don't feel the need to rush out and break things, or burn kissy lips into my hand, or form an army.  These are all metaphorical, representing REAL outlets that we do attempt.  However, regardless if you take the book at face value like the movie, or you read deeper into it, most people will undoubtably enjoy this novel, especially men of course, to whom the novel is written for.
B007HJ84ZK|5.0|Having read the books years ago when they first came out I was skeptical of the HBO series.  The original Game of Thrones books are a complex rendering of a world in which four noble families vie for rulership (or 'The Iron Throne') of the land of Westeros.  Ned Stark and his family are the primary characters (among a few others) to whom the reader/viewer attaches.<br /><br />The HBO series was created with great integrity and such perceptive and delicate handling of the characters, the plots and sub-plots (I understand that George R.R. Martin assisted with much of the screenplay), that I went from skeptical to thrilled by the end of the first episode.<br /><br />This is NOT a show for the faint of heart or for the young; the violence is brutal, shocking and (at times) heart-rending. One of the things I like best about Game of Thrones is the realistic portrayal of human nature.  The social complexities inherent in life and death, love and hate, politics and religion are all exhibited with breathtaking honesty by the actors.<br /><br />This is an adult show that respects the viewer's intelligence and titillates, hints and implies without spelling anything out. The acting is superb, the characters are multi-dimensional and realistic.  The special effects are mind-blowing. In short, it is a well-done approximation of the world created by George R.R. Martin in his Game of Thrones books. If you liked or loved the books this is one time that you will also like the screenplay.

1594202842|5.0|People seem to get all worked up over this book. I'm not sure why? I found it funny and was drawn into her family experience completely. My wife read it in a few days and then I started and was done in a week. I was half way through today and then I just couldn't put it down! I went running this morning and then spent the day reading, at Jamba Juice, and then Starbucks, before finally coming home to finish it with some dinner and tea. One rip of a story.<br /><br />At the end, I LOL'd when she recalled in the afterword how one interviewer (whom obviously did not understand how a satirical memoir might go) asked, \\"does your children's happiness mean nothing to you?\\". This was towards the end of their conversation and Amy Chua was about out of energy for the impossible task of conversing with a foregone mindset, but mustered, \\"(Sigh) It means everything to me. If I could push a magic button and choose either happiness or success for my children, I'd choose happiness in a second. But it's not as simple as that.\\"<br /><br />My wife is Chinese (Hong Kong) and also thought the book was an easy read. And like me, she found no controversy in the parenting style of setting the high-bar. If you approach the book with a fun spirit you will enjoy it a lot more. She tells us in the end that, \\"it's a genre problem\\". People get uptight when they read it without realizing that, \\"it's intentionally self-incriminating. and it's filled with intentional contradictions.\\" I loved it!  I doubt that either of us has the energy and drive of Amy Chau and her husband Jed, but we hope to also push the happiness button for our children (when they come =)) by believing in them and helping guide them to success.

B0058VW36U|1.0|THIS GAME WAS THE SECOND ORDERED ON MARCH 16TH. AS OF MAY 16TH IT HAS NOT BEEN SENT TO MY KINDLE FIRE.
0439023491|1.0|SPOILER ALERT I thought the first book was OK, although I wasn't happy with the overuse of coincidence. When I first picked it up, I thought the heroine would surely lead her fellow tributes in a revolt in the arena, not win the contest. That she won the contest while making relatively few kills herself (self-defense, a mercy kill) struck me as a copout.<br /><br />But &#34;Catching Fire&#34; was disgusting. Why in the world did Katniss, who was contemplating rebellion anyway, not rebel BEFORE she ended up in the ridiculous arena? If she had to go to the arena, she could have vowed not to murder any fellow tributes there. If many of the tributes were in on the revolt, why do a number of them kill each other? The book made NO sense AND it was filled with gratuitous violence. I definitely do not think this is good reading material for teenagers.<br /><br />I am shocked that so many people are comparing this to Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter.
0385341008|5.0|I borrowed this book from a friend, and I regret that.<br /><br />I need to own it.<br /><br />There are so many quotes and passages that I wanted to annotate and underline and write down and paste on my wall that I was extremely sad that this wasn't my book.<br /><br />I also want a hardback. Did it come out in hardbacks? It should. This is a book that should stay on your shelf to be read and re-read many times throughout your lifetime.<br /><br />And this just attests to the style of the author. Mary Ann Shaffer (the original author) has managed to capture many, many different voices and characters within their own letters and the letters of others. Since this is an epistolary novel, she had to develop the style of each of her characters and keep their letters within their own unique style. She did it. That's impressive.<br /><br />There are realistic gaps in the letters as well. For example, Juliet will be responding something her friend Susan wrote her, but we won't have the letter Susan wrote. That is exactly what a collection of letters would be like: some of them would be lost. So the structure: spot on.<br /><br />The plot is interesting. It look me a couple weeks to get through this book simply because it's slow moving, and I had other important things to do (like graduate). But it does pick up and grip you near the middle of the book, and then you are sad to put it down and eat. (Who needs dinner anyway?)<br /><br />There are some gaps at the end of the book that I wish weren't there. Some may be disappointed with the ending--I was a little--but the style is too good to pass up. I can't tell you what or I'd give the ending away, but the book does move away from the original plot a little and I wish it returned to it at the end instead of branching off completely.

B0053O89Z6|1.0|HIMYM'S season finale was the disatrous end to a disastrous season. Unfunny, implausible, and utterly lacking in the heart that often redeems HIMYM's lesser outings.<br /><br />Instead we discover that Ted, far from being a romantic with an occasional roguish streak, now looks to be little better than a sleazeball with no conscience about doing unto others what was done unto him.  At a stroke, he is no longer a sympathetic character, but is just a junior league version of Barney.<br /><br />The two finale episodes were rife with implausible and impossible situations that effectively neutered the humor.  We laugh when we can relate, but Barney's adventures with airport security were so impossible as to drain any empathetic humor - and of course, finding out at the end that it was all for nothing because Barney's intended is destined to get dumped helped matters not at all.  Another pseudo-climactic conclusion that promises much and delivers nothing.<br /><br />This was compounded by the return of Victoria - in a wedding dress at a bar. Naturally. Oh sigh, here we go again - another recycled romance - and of course, again, not THE ONE.  This pedal on the organ has been pumped way too many times to be even remotely interesting let alone funny.  This is no longer plot twist or even plot tease - it is just tiresome.<br /><br />As to the birth of Marvin Ericsson - and don't get me started about the absurd middle name - it lacked all emotion.  Marshall's miraculous turn from stone drunk to cold sober just in time for his \\"just in time\\" appearance in the birthing room, sans sanitized hospital garb, was nonsensical, unrealistic and so lightning fast as to be utterly without warmth or depth.<br /><br />This was a problem made worse by the fact that, yet again, we are treated to the presence of the whole group gawking at the baby instead of what would have been a far more touching family moment between the parents of the new baby.  I don't know what it is, but whenever the writers of HIMYM attempt a touching moment between Marshall and Lilly, it falls flat - see their wedding as Exhibit A - and about the only thing that can be said about the baby Ericsson birth is that it continued the tradition of failed moments.<br /><br />This season started awful, improved only slightly in the middle, and now has ended as it began - vapid, stalled, repetitious and unfunny.  Clearly HIMYM has exhausted its premise - even the acting has become formulaic and \\"phoned in\\" as the stars begin to pursue new projects and are devoting less energy to the show.  It is time to have Ted meet the girl of his dreams and put this show out of its exhausted misery.ters of HIMYM attempt a touching moment between Marshall and Lilly, it falls flat - see their wedding as Exhibit A - and about the only thing that can be said about the baby Ericsson birth is that it continued the tradition of failed moments.<br /><br />This season started awful, improved only slightly in the middle, and now has ended as it began - vapid, stalled, repetitious and unfunny.

B004XWLN20|4.0|Having been a big fan of Superman since the age of 5 I was very happy when the announced that they would be making a TV series detailing Clark Kents life before becoming Superman. It was never thoroughly addressed in the comics other than he discovered his powers at a young age so getting to see it all in action was amazing. The series had its ups and downs (the negatives were absolutely horrendous and almost caused me to stop watching about 5 weeks into season 9)but I stuck with it and was overall pleased with the series as a whole and the way it ended. I know some people complain that it was too \\"modern\\" and made Superman too human but that is what I liked about it, they showed that he's not just some omnipotent ruler but that he actually understands why humans are the way they are. Adding that human compassionate side (granted he was always considerate of humans) really added some depth to the character.<br /><br />Enough about my thoughts on the show though, you all want to know about the box, is it worth the money? While that answer is a bit complicated...all 10 seasons with 2 bonus discs totaling around 10,000 minutes of TV. A lot of bonus features, some that were not included with the individual releases, providing some interesting facts about the series. Let's get right down to it though, as far as complete boxes go this one is awesome BUT is mainly for avid fans of Superman or just Smallville in general; casual fans should avoid this and I will explain why in a moment. Upon first opening the box I was ecstatic to see images from the series plastering each \\"page\\" of the DVD books. The episode guide and especially the full issue of the Daily Planet (yup, a miniature replica Daily Planet news paper) were a very nice tough but this is where the box leaves me pretty disappointed; as with everyone else I too have noticed the discs are jammed a bit too tightly in the wedges of the book pages. If you do not remove the discs very carefully (I mean VERY carefully andslowly) you risk peeling the disc labels, scratching the disc, or both. That is the particular reason I say casual fans should avoid. A big fan such as myself may be able to overlook this problem but for someone who just wants to watch the series will probably not want to struggle and risk damaging the discs especially when they paid so much ($170 when I ordered). The easiest way to avoid this problem, besides downloading the series somewhere, is to have extra case(s) on hand. When you pull out a disc to watch, rather than slipping it back in the big box, stick it in a standard DVD case till you're done and repeat the process for all the discs. This way hear you are not pulling out or putting back the discs as frequently and you lessen the chance of damaging them.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br />Awesome show, every comic fan needs to watch this at least once. In my opinion (that of a huge Superman fan for 20yrs now) I can't recommend this to anyone but the other diehards out there who are obsessive about their collections. The problem of the discs being damaged rather easily (quite a few of mine have some pretty noticeable scratches after being removed only once...I always make sure to check any and all DVDs/Blu-Rays I buy for disc defects before doing anything else) is just too frustrating and will leave many people wishing they had just bought the single season sets instead. I'm now left with the task of checking each disc, episode by episode and feature by feature, for any errors caused by these scratches and scuffs. A task I will enjoy so long as no issues arise...if I do have an issue it may be too late to return it to Amazon and that would be an absolute shame.<br /><br />I hope this review has proven useful.
0062119044|5.0|This was a truly gripping novel that is particulary interesting and timely given the public's concern about bullying and school shootings and the recent article in the New York Times Sunday Magazine about early diagnosis of pychopaths/sociopaths (who may be diagnosable as early as age five.) Though fiction, this novel raises interesting questions about nurture versus nature and cause and effect (does a difficult child lead to a detached parent which leads to an even more difficult child?) Perhaps what is most frightening about the book is its absolute believability. The narrator is not sympathetic - a mother who has recognized from her son's earliest years that there was something \\"just not right\\" about him and repeatedly says so - and yet, given the other options (the sociopathic child himself, the father who refuses to see the truth) this unsympathetic mother somehow gets the reader on her side. As a mother myself, it was hard to read about a mother who had such cynicism about her own son, yet I found her painful, unimaginable situation compelling in a way that is hard to describe. I could barely put this novel down and only common sense (I do have a job, after all!) made me put this book down at night. Definitely one to read!!
0780626966|5.0|this is the best movie my son has seen he loves these horror movies he collects them freddys actually really funny
0525478817|5.0|Ok here I go...<br /><br />WOW, Such a beautifully written story that The Fault in Our Stars will hold your heart in its metaphoric hands.... a must read!<br />When I first heard about The Fault in Our Stars,  I thought.. really do I want to read about dying teenagers? If you have spent anytime around an ICU or CCU the last thing you want to do is read a story about watching someone you love die. All that said, I am so very glad that I was coerced convinced by my dear friend Nancy to read this book. Mr Green told the story in such a way that even though you know somewhat what the outcome will be, you will laugh and cry along with the wonderfully witty and dare I say delightfully twisted characters.<br /><br />  I love each and every one of them. The sick teens, the Horrifically twisted writer, the best friend who has problems of his own, to the parents who are just trying to make the best of a very bad situation.<br />One of my favorite scenes has to do with throwing eggs at someones house... a delightful side story. If you have read The Fault in Our Stars you already know the what and whys, if not, there will be a BIG ol' smile on your face when you get to it.<br /><br />  When our teens take a journey to Amsterdam, Mr Green paints a beautifully descriptive and picturesque moment in time that I will not easily forget, for it is etched forever in my heart and soul.<br /><br /> I give The Fault in Our Stars : 5 out of 5 hearts Tis Awesomeness!!

B003L77G06|5.0|I love love love this show.  Best show on the tube.  Being able to get the season on disc without the commercials was a bonus.  Being able to see a rerun of the show was a huge plus as watching it as a family prevented ME from getting the whole scene as my family was to busy laughing through parts I was trying to hear.  This is the best show on TV ever.  It ranks with Good Times, Happy days, Heaven.
B003O86FMW|3.0|The second book in the Hunger Games series seemed lacking in many areas that the 1st and third books had. Although there are many increasing plots created by the second book, it seems Collins just used it to set up for the third book. The introduction of new characters was the best part of this book. Still worth the read, especially since you need it before you can start the third book.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Overall, I love the app.  A really big pet peeve:  the NKJV of the Bible doesn't use quotation marks.... ever.  There's been a few other typos,  like a missing space between words and the like.  Overall,  great app!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Was skeptic at first because of all the hype created by the movie. However, The Hunger Games did not disappoint! This book beautifully displays both external and internal struggle in a repressive almost Orwellian type of world. Some parts of the main characters reactions to situations were a bit predictable at time, but all in all a great book.
B00009P1O0|5.0|While TTN comes in at a close second, On The Beach is my favorite album. Can't say enough good things about this album. Some other reviewers have done an excellent job of giving you the history behind this release, so check those out for track by track breakdowns. In short, you won't be disappointed with OTB. Moody, brooding Neil is my favorite and in abundant supply here.
0307716546|4.0|Like Rosamund Lupton's first novel, \\"Sister\\", her second book, \\"Afterwards\\", is written from the perspective of a female character bent on discovering the reasons and the people behind something bad that has happened to a loved one.  In this case, Grace looks to uncover how the fire in a school started and if it was directed at Jenny, her daughter.  As she investigates, Grace realizes Jenny is in danger, and struggles to keep her safe.  The main character in \\"Sister\\" directed her narrative towards her sister.  Grace directs her narrative towards her husband.<br /><br />Lupton is good at creating women characters who face unusual obstacles in getting to the truth, and this is particularly true of \\"Afterwards\\".  During Grace's search for the cause of the school fire and the person or persons behind it, she discovers she has not always seen the people around her clearly and that she has taken, too lightly, things she should have noticed.  In this way, the novel is about revealing not only the mystery behind a fire, but also the mysteries and the secrets that the people Grace thinks she knows best have hidden from her.<br /><br />Readers may be able to guess at least one of the characters behind at least some of the bad things in the book before Grace arrives at a solution, but it's the way Grace gets there that holds the readers' attention.<br /><br />Although it is clear why Grace is so focused on Jenny, I did dislike the character a bit for giving short shrift to some of the other family and friends in the novel.  The \\"unusual\\" obstacles Grace faced seemed  little too much of a stretch at times, although the author's technique is interesting.<br /><br />Four stars.
B000002KCV|5.0|If it weren't for albums like On the Beach and Tonight's the Night, Comes a Time might be my favorite Neil album. Songs like Goin' Back, Look Out For My Love, Lotta Love, and Peace of Mind are the real standouts, not just on this album but Neil's entire catalog. As other reviewers have mentioned, this is one consistant album. Even Motorcycle Mama, the weakest track, works on this album. A great album to listen to and drift away.
B005GHN2GG|5.0|Master of Crows is a rare creature; it is a high fantasy novel with completely developed romantic elements. The passion is as explicit as the world building is nuanced. There aren't a lot of these books out there for readers who enjoy competent story telling without the fade-to-black romance. Readers of the Tairen Soul series or the Kushiel series will find a good investment here.

0062082353|4.0|Chris Kyle is a great American and I thank him for his contribution to his fellow serviceman and this country. This book provides a good basic account of Chis Kyles activities and his perspective on the Iraq conflict.  I personally could have done without the commentary from the wife, but I understand its purpose. He makes several references to the Marcus Lutrell \\"Lone Survivor\\" and I personally found that book a better read.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|My girlfriend introduced me to the music of Adam Lambert.My own personal tastes have run from some pop to soft and hard rock to southern rock and some alt rock. But I've also always valued great vocal and interpretive ability in a lead singer.That's where Lambert hooked me.He has an incredible range along with versatility and perfect phrasing as well as power and control.I don't believe there's anything he CAN'T sing.<br /> The direction he took on this one is, in my opinion, remarkably different than he did on his first album (which I've listened to many times, again, thanks to my GF)<br /> He seems to have really come into his own on this one.I won't go into who produced or wrote what track because unless I'm writing their checks, I don't really care. The end result, the product is what interests me. In a word, this product is fantastic.(I was going to say \\"awesome\\" but I've seen that adjective so much I wanted to change it up)<br />Though I can certainly hear influences that harken back to others (Queen,Prince, MJ, Cher to name a few) Lambert manages to take classic pop and rock sensibilities and bring them into the present for a fresh feel and sound that is a unique talent itself.<br /> I won't bore you with which tracks are my favorites or why....that changes anyway.I'll simply say that there is not a track on this album that I fast-forward. I don't dance but some of the faster (funkier) tracks make me want to move and tap my toes! In short, if you are thinking about purchasing this...think no more. Just do it.You'll be glad you did.I know I am. Enjoy!

0439023513|3.0|I loved Hunger Games and I loved Catching Fire. I was addicted and had to know what happened to all the characters, because they are awesome. That said, I was really disappointed with this book. I'll admit right off that my favorite character is Peeta, although I love Katniss, but my problem with this book is that Peeta isn't really in it. Peeta and Katniss' relationship is my favorite part of the series, it's so uncertain and has a true feel to it. I didn't need this book to have a perfectly happy ending like it sort of had, and I think that the epilogue was unnecessary, all I wanted was the strength and determination and the glimmer of hope that was in the first two books. To me, it feels like Suzanne Collins got to the end of the third book and was like \\"Well...guess they'll never really recover from all that!\\" Loads and loads of depressing with an \\"and they lived happily ever after, sort of, okay not really\\" tacked on at the end.
B000W4KSVA|5.0|This lovely album of ballads has generated many different explanations of how it came about; however, I think it's enough just to be glad it did. For those for whom Coltrane's sustained attack, note-bending, or simply sheer blowing power is too much, you'll find a sanctuary here. The discipline of the ballad form, allied to a marvellously sympathetic quartet (Tyner on piano; Garrison on bass; Jones on drums) ensure that his blowing is restrained, yet far from inhibited.<br /><br />The intuitive interplay between the group members seems perfectly normal, until you realise that, with the exception of the enchanting 'It's Easy to Remember', they had never played these pieces prior to recording. Coltrane's horn caresses the notes, but can also inject a little bite from time to time, while Tyner's keyboard work brings colour and warmth to each number. Garrison and Jones rhythm section propel each piece with effortless poise. Sound quality is very good, while the attractive gatefold case has liner notes and timings. This album comes highly recommended in both Gramophone and Penguin Jazz Guides, should you need any further persuasion.<br /><br />My only disappointment is the short running time of 32 minutes, so you could choose the 2cd version with out-takes bulking things up. However, my advice would be to resist having the spell this album casts diluted in any way; the riches here far outweigh reservations over length. This album, coupled with the warmly lyrical, melodic 3cd set [[ASIN:B003XLMYZ2 Slowtrane]] demonstrates a warmer, more emotional, and much more accessible Coltrane than some of his other work. Well worth exploring.
0553801473|3.0|It has become clear from the nearly 2000 reviews of this book that Amazon reviews are no longer a reliable way to determine the quality of a book.<br /><br />I agree with most of the criticisms of Dance, but not to the degree that many reviewers have taken it. This is neither a great book nor an awful book, but rather a so-so continuation of the Game of Thrones series. Thus it deserves 3-stars. However, almost all of the recent reviews here are either fake 5-star reviews from people being paid to praise this product or 1-star reviews from cynics in the nerd-herd who automatically hate anything that doesn't conform perfectly to their expectations. Ridiculous.<br /><br />If you want to read more objective and rational reviews of books, I recommend goodreads.com
B004XDYJRU|1.0|I used an older \\"cracked\\" version for testing purposes (To be honest, I do that sometimes - if the App is good I buy it of course, doing the same on iOS Devices) and rated it ok for me, besides the fact, that own registered URL´S aren`t well implemented and often don`t work - but hey, I have an iPhone too and these Apps are working much better :-P.<br />Now I must recognize, that this App has been \\"updated\\" in a way I don`t like.<br />Besides the change in GUI, having Twitter rubbish talks to any playing station (I love Twitter, but what sense does it make to read some Trashtalk  marked hashtags from the station I am listening to?) There are Ads now inside a üaid APP; THIS IS A NO GO IMWO.<br />Developer and Publisher should stop this immediately, I will use my old version insted, no money from me, guys! Sorry for my bad English, I am not a natural English speaking person, always having trouble with grammar and tenses :-P

B002ZFOMAW|5.0|A classic book that colors the cheeks with its portrayal of a lady-of-the-manor and her gardener having an affair. I read this is college and enjoyed it, so when I saw it on my Kindle list I had to purchase it. It may have been outlawed back when it was published, but I am glad it is back and available for purchase. It was nice reading a story that left some things to the imagination and didn't feel the need to write every erotic detail.

0345803485|5.0|I absolutely loved the book.  Can't wait to get book 2.  I don't normally read but have heard about this book through my sister and other friends.  Picked it up and quickly finished it.  Even took it to work to keep my occupied at lunch.  Great read and recommend it!!
0545265355|1.0|Disclaimer: this review has NOTHING to do with the content of the literary work!  Only the condition of the product itself, and the packaging it came in.<br /><br />I bought these books on recommendation from a friend, and while the books themselves seem readable, there are bent corners (of the dust cover AND the hardcover books), which should never have happened since the books come in a BOX set.  And speaking of the box, it's piece-of-crap corrugated cardboard.  So while it's thick, don't expect to feel proud to have it sitting on your bookshelf, because it's ugly and unseemly.  Expect to recycle it immediately when you get the books.<br /><br />The packaging job was abysmal, as well.  My books shipped from Amazon, and I've never been so utterly frustrated and disappointed with their packaging standards as I was when I opened this package.  To make a long story short, the box the product shipped in was twice the size of the product - literally - and there was no packaging material beyond the slashed-open carcasses of two fist-sized, plastic bag air pockets.<br /><br />So while I offer no opinion on the content of the books themselves (as I JUST got them and have yet to read them), I definitely DO recommend considering purchasing them elsewhere.  Like - maybe a local bookstore.  Which is exactly what I will do from here on out with EVERY book I intend to buy.
0307460444|4.0|Whenever I want to bake cupcakes (which is fairly frequent I must admit) this is my go-to book. It has an easy to follow layout and I am a sucker for the big glossy photos that are provided for every single cupcake.<br /><br />I have used the \\"One-Bowl Chocolate Cupcake\\" recipe countless times and it has always met with rave reviews! The fresh strawberry cupcakes are also insanely fabulous, especially when made in the month of May with fresh North Carolina strawberries!<br /><br />One of my favorite things about this book is its abundance of flavors and ideas. Unlike most cupcake cookbooks I have encountered, which repeat the same basic recipes and decorate the resulting cupcakes differently, this book has a flavor for just about everyone.<br /><br />A major drawback for me, however, is the complexity of some of the recipes and ingredients. Beware the tiramisu cupcakes and anything that requires vanilla beans! For me, the need for extra special ingredients is always a bit off-putting, but I suppose these make for good special occasion cupcakes.<br /><br />Another thing I dislike are some of icing recipes in the back. The frostings tend to be a bit too complicated for me and not to my taste, so I usually revert to my grandmothers classic buttercream instead and make up my own flavors.<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves these little cakes! It is my only cupcake cookbook and it has been thumbed through more time than I can count, flour falling out from between the pages each time. With over 150 some recipes, I am always finding something new I want to try. True to form, Martha Stewart also provides decorating and delivering ideas as well as templates for cute toppers in the back.<br /><br />Buy this book and grab your apron because you're going to want to start baking right away!
B0034DGPEU|3.0|This book was well written and even though sad, makes you want to keep reading.  I'm sure that life was very hard at that point in time, so from that perspective, no wonder every third page someone is dying.  I only gave it 3 stars, because personally, I hate to feel depressed after reading a book.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this cover.  It's very lightweight and secure.  I just wish it had a place to store my stylus.
B000M4RG42|5.0|Flag of our fathers<br /><br />Flag of Our Fathers is a movie made from a book with the same title, written by James Bradley and Ron Powers. This incredible movie, directed by Clint Eastwood, is about the famous photo of the Marine Soldiers raising the American Flag, taken during the Battle of Iwo Jima at the end of the II World War in 1945. The main characters; Rene Gagnon, Ira Hayes and John Bradly, were the survivors of the Battle and they were the ones on the famous photo.<br /><br />This movie is told by one of the soldiers' grown-up son, who wants to find out what happened to his father. He interviews his father and the fellow soldiers in order to reveal the story of the famous photo.<br />The movie takes place in three different times: during the battle, during the celebration of victory and in the present in 1994.<br /><br />Flag of Our Fathers is not just about war violence and blood, as much people would think. It is much more of a drama than a war movie. It shows a mixture between emotional and battle scenes that are extremely well done, making an impressive viewing.<br />All along the movie they showed random flashbacks of Suribashi being shelled by US Marines. Incredible special effects were used and, even if those scenes are brief, they manage to show the hardships of the war. However, the main focus remains on the feelings of the soldiers, when they go back to the US and were greeted as heroes. They were forced to lie about the reality of that historical moment. The photo used as a memorial event wasn´t the original one; it was taken with a replacement flag. Those soldiers weren´t the ones who fight against Japanese. The survivors were the soldiers that avoid being wounded and their mission was to save the wounded Fighters. Real heroes died days after raising the flag.<br />The tour they had to make in order to collect money was a farce, and the guilt and nightmares of war made a huge difference to their lives giving the movie an emotional dimension.<br /><br />This is a great representation of what government is capable of doing for raise money for its own benefit and how terrible, sad and intense the war was for soldiers during and after being on the battle field.<br />I think that Flag of Our Fathers tries to give two important messages; the first, is that the experience soldiers have being treated as heroes isn´t as great as civilians would imagine and, the second is that what happens in the battle field stays in the battle field.
B0006IIPIK|5.0|I love everything about this movie, it is very reminiscent of the old movie serials.  The only problem about the movie is it should not be watched on a small screen.  The stylistic effects are great on a big screen but suffer when viewed on small screens.  The acting is deliberately over the top reflecting the typically bad acting in the movie serials that were more about the special effects.  I bet it would look great in 3D on the big screen.  Recommended for those with big TVs.
B0079R8KXG|3.0|This case isn't real leather like the [[ASIN:B005KDYBIO Kindle Fire Genuine Leather Cover by Marware, Black]], but it is very light. The mounting system works OK, but I find the system in the leather cover by Marware to be simpler, and work better.  The imitation leather case is half as cheap as the leather case, though. If keeping your Kindle Fire safe from shocks and scrapes is all that matters to you, this case will work fine for you. If you would like a smoother feel in your hands, go for the leather case.  If you would like the lightest case possible, go for this case.<br /><br />Overall, there is nothing wrong with this case, but you get what you pay for.<br /><br />3 stars.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Asgardian Loki breaks in to SHIELD headquarters uses the Tesseract, a cube of pure energy that can destroy the world, and plans to conquer the world using it to open a portal to let an alien race called the Chitauri. No one on Earth has the power to fight these extraterrestrials, so Nick Fury in desperation, calls in Bruce Banner (the Hulk), Tony Stark (Ironman), Thor, and Steve Rogers (Captain America) to band together and stop Loki. However, they are a volatile, unruly group that simply don't get along and don't trust SHIELD's motives. Can they put aside their petty differences and distrust of SHIELD long enough to save the world?<br /><br />I was very excited to see The Avengers because I enjoyed all of the films leading up to it and their characters, but especially because Joss Whedon was directing. I think this is one of the best comic book movies I've ever seen and I believe it is thanks to Whedon. He brought a lot of humor throughout the film, even during the most heartbreaking moments. I don't remember ever laughing so hard in any superhero movie. There were even moments when dialogue was unintelligible because the whole audience was roaring with laughter.<br /><br />He also fleshed out the minor characters wonderfully. In the previous movies, I couldn't care less about Hawkeye and Black Widow. Hawkeye had a super small part in Thor and did practically nothing. Black Widow in Iron Man 2 was super flat and only really there for eye candy and cool fight scenes. In The Avengers, Hawkeye is instrumental to the story and he updates the bow from a practically obsolete relic (compared to guns and other firearms) to something useful and dangerous. His sense of loyalty and justice really made him a cool character, as well as his relationship with Black Widow. Black Widow is also very important to the plot. She gets to show off how she is actually a good spy by playing the victim and getting those who would think themselves above her to reveal their plans. She is muchmore than just a pretty face and we get to see how is she is underneath her strong exterior. I liked that these two characters aren't marginalized because they are weaker than the other super heroes. They prove to be important in their own right and are allowed to actually develop as dynamic characters.<br /><br />One of the things I was afraid of was one superhero or another dominating the movie. This film masterfully balances each hero. Each make mistakes and look silly at one point and they also all have great, shining moments of heroism. They all bring something that the others don't have and make this disparate, hodge podge group into a real team. Captain America is a great tactician who sees each person's strength and how best to utilize that strength on the battlefield. Iron Man thinks outside the box and has incredible intelligence beyond that huge ego of his. Bruce Banner is also extremely smart, but also turns into a huge, strong rage monster when he transforms. Thor is practically immortal with a powerful hammer, the ability to fly, and power over thunder and lightning. These larger than life characters are lot to stuff into one movie, but they end up being a well balanced, powerful team.<br /><br />The last act of the film is the giant splodey extraterrestrial battle for New York. The comparisons to the Transformers are cringeworthy, but not complete unfounded. There are a few key differences, one being that The Avengers is actually a good, coherent movie that doesn't entirely rely on special effects. Another is that while the Transformers movies have cool shots of buildings exploding and falling down and CGI fight scenes, but the human element is lost. In The Avengers, the people running and screaming from the attack are a focus in the middle of this battle. We even follow a particular waitress as she runs from location to location and is finally saved by Captain America. This makes the audience care about the civilians and actually worry when buildings collapse and debris is falling everywhere.<br /><br />The Avengers is a spectacular superhero film that takes the characters we know and gives them portrays them in a much deeper way and keeps that human element in a huge, epic fight. I also really liked the banter between the characters, the humor throughout, and especially the deviously manipulative, sinister Loki. I have seen it 3 times so far and wouldn't mind seeing it again. If you want a truly enjoyable film with action, adventure, aliens, and superheroes, The Avengers is definitely for you.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love love love this game! it is amazing. add it bro! la la la la la la la la &lt;&lt; space filler.
086571701X|5.0|I bought this book within minutes of it coming on the market, but I'm a bit late to the party with a review.  Like many other reviewers, I found Sylvia's book to be very helpful.  It's a great tool to introduce newcomers to Aquaponic Gardening and to help them get started. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more on the subject.<br /><br />Although I'm a huge Kindle fan, I think the hard copy version is a better choice, because you're going to want to mark it up and refer back to it. You'll want it close at hand as you begin to build your first system.<br /><br />Thanks, Sylvia, for this helpful tool.
B005LAIHIQ|3.0|This film is lightweight eye candy. Its the Tim Burton stock players going through the motions in yet another film. Its visually appealing. The casting isn't bad. But the plot and story are lame.<br /><br />Vampire Barnabas Collins shows up after 200 years and encounters his 1970s era degenerate descendents. He proceeds to fix everything up in everyone's lives and then does battle with a witch. Too much of the film was spent on witch-related melodrama and action. Too little was spent on fixing up the family.<br /><br />The visual jokes at Michael Jackson's expense were obvious but well done.<br /><br />But they missed alot of good material in the original premise. Elizabeth Stoddard in the original had killed her husband and refused afterward to leave the house for years. In the film, she has no problems whatsoever. The original premise where a treasure-hunting Willy Loomis unearths the vampire was better. Roger and David they got generally right aside from having the ghosts david sees be only his mother. Carloine, aside from one thing done at the end, was probably an improvement on the original. Victoria Winters, for whatever reasons, comes across in the film as a shallow non-entity. They don't really use her at all. Dr. Julia Hoffman as a drunk was good in some scenes as a drunk, but then written off in a rather shallow way as a one-note joke.<br /><br />Everything to do with Angelique is terrible. All the fishing industry competition stuff (Angel Bay) was a waste of time. The character is reduced to a obsessed stalker. Eva Green does the best she can with what she is given. But its not much.<br /><br />Jackie Earl Haley turns in a good character preformance as Willie Loomis. Michelle Pfeiffer turns in a good performance in spite of the role not giving her all that much to do. Depp is good to a point but he is somewhat playing his stock character rather than doing anything interesting.<br /><br />For all the good little bits in the film, they somehow missed the premise of the original material altogether. They had dark shadows and they decided to go for Mary Poppins. What they have done isn't bad. But its probably not worth looking at more than once.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Mulholland Drive is a psychological thriller. In this case I subscribe to the notion that the film depicts the dream sequences of a woman who can't live with herself after her murder of another woman over a man. Whatever happened to the young woman who was once so hopeful and confident? How did she ever become so unsure of herself? Betty finds Rita hiding in her aunt's apartment. Rita can't remember anything. Together they begin following the clues towards Rita's identity which gradually lead to the awful truth about both of them. Betty is Diane Selwyn, a lonely, depressed woman, whose career as an actress is pretty much finished and in love with a woman, Camilla Rhodes a.k.a. Rita, who now scorns her. How did two such lovely young women lose their lives?? Diane put out a contract on Camilla and received a blue key when the deed was done but now she can't live with herself and takes her own life. Martin Scorsese finishes the thought in his film, Shutter Island, before they take him away for a lobotomy Teddy Daniels remarks, \\"one can live as a monster or die as a good man\\". Apparently Diane agreed. She couldn't live without Camilla and afterwards killed herself when she couldn't deal with the consequences of her own actions.

B002MQYOFW|3.0|I imagine this book would go down well with readers who enjoyed the twilight series. It revolved around a girl who battles with relationships and emotions in a post-apocolyptic USA with the usual evil, corrupt government supressing the ordinary citizens. She has to deal with family issues until she is plucked away to participate in a deadly fight to the death. The story is more about her appearance and emotional battles than any real action and in my opinion fails to deliver any real impact in either area. While it was midly entertaining, the story was very predictable from start to finish and didn't grip with suspense so I felt somewhat dissapoointed in that much more could have been done with it.
B004SUWR2C|2.0|Buggy. Hangs up on color selection.  Never lets player win challenge. Slanted so computer wins. Disappointment when it should be fun. Glad it only cost 99 cents.

B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I really do like this game, however,  my timers reset to 572 hours, which was frustrating. That happened to businesses,  homes, and livestock.<br /><br />Another issue is the people would get ill and need medication or they would die. the problem with this was I would have up to 5 people ill at once and the medication would take such a long time to produce. the only way to save each person would be to spend real cash.<br /><br />It would be nice if you only had one disaster each day or even each visit. I no sooner replant crops from a flood and then have a tornado then have to once again replant.<br /><br />Now my animals and crops are all ready for harvesting but it will not let me collect on any of them which makes it impossible to do anything else frond here on out.<br /><br />There are a lot of issues with this game, but I do like the concept and humor of the game.  If the issues are not taken care of soon I will uninstall it.
B007Q2N0HA|2.0|Given so many raving reviews for this book, I was expecting a really good read.  Unfortunately, it was anything but.  I read a lot of romance novels and thought this book really should have been in the Erotica category, not Contemporary.  The sex scenes are extremely frequent and explicit.  Perhaps I wouldn't have had so much of a problem with that if the characters had been at all people I could relate to.<br /><br />The female character is, of course, very beautiful, gorgeous body, fantastic job, and rich.  She has the requisite gay guy best friend with whom she lives.  Okay, I guess I'm on board with that.  Then we meet the male protagonist.  He is 28 years old, a multi-millionaire (billionaire??) who owns his own company, plus multitudes of others as well as countless prime real estate properties on the island of Manhattan.  Did I mention HE'S TWENTY-EIGHT?  He's so gorgeous that he renders the heroine incapable of coherent thought, speech or movement.  She spends many paragraphs in the book describing how perfect he is - his looks, his style of dress, his body - ad nauseum.<br /><br />After a very short playing-hard-to-get period, the characters have mind-blowing, earth-moving, best sex of their lives.  Then the girl gets upset with the guy and runs away.  He apologizes and they have mind-numbing, earth-shattering sex again.  Rinse, repeat.  The one time they weren't having sex, they were working out (in a gym which he owned, of course, AT TWENTY-EIGHT), and spent an inordinate amount of time ogling each other's hot bodies.<br /><br />The book is written all right - no grammar/punctuation issues - but it seems like it was written to capitalize off the 50 Shades craze (which I haven't read so can't really compare - just going from what other reviews have said).  The characters' \\"issues\\" (childhood traumas) seem cliche and their method of resolving them poor.  I wasn't invested in either character or their relationship, such as it was.<br /><br />I would not recommend this book.
1439192812|5.0|Even though this book is written in a language that is more intended for a younger audience anyone would enjoy reading it.  I particularly liked how every chapter started with a few myths and then the author would explain the real magic of science behind it.  I have enjoyed reading every page of this book.  I think everyone on this planet should read this book.  It is fun, well written and very informative.  Again, you need to remember that this book is not written in the same language as the Extend Phenotype, the Selfish Gene or the God Delusion.  Thank you Richard Dawkins for all the books you written.

0545403359|5.0|The story of the War Horse is about a young boy and his horse that fought in WWI. It starts in 1914 when the horse was born and a boy named Albert names him Joey and raises him. Albert and his parents are having difficulty keeping their farm and the bank is threatening to take it back. Albert tries to save the farm by training Joey to work the land in order to make the money his family needs. But soon after, Albert's father decides to sell Joey to the army to raise money for the farm. A man named Captain Nichols tells Albert that he will look after Joey and use him as his personal horse. Albert feels terrible and promises to see Joey again. Joey is shipped off to the western fort in France.<br /><br />At the outpost in France, Captain Nichols and the other officers notice that Joey is one of the fastest horses. Joey makes friends with another fast horse called Topthorn. After a few weeks of training, it is time for Joey and Topthorn to go into the war. Joey and Topthorn are officers' horses and become used to riding in battle together. One day, there was an ambush. While it looked like victory in battle, enemies seemed to be retreating into the woods. However, in the tall grasses the enemy was hiding waiting for the army to charge. The enemy open fired on the army with gatlin guns and after passing this line, only the horses remained alive. Joey and Topthorn were caught by the enemy where both had lost their riders.<br />Joey and Topthorn are taken by the enemy and used to pull guns and equipment. During this time, two young brothers help to take care of the captured horses. It is decided that one brother move with the equipment and one remain behind to care for the horses. The brothers do not want to lose each other so they use Joey and Topthorn to escape. They find a place outside an old farm to sleep but the enemy soon finds them and kills them. A young girl named Emilie who lives at the farm with her grandfather finds the horses. Emilie cares for the horses andfeeds them. After a couple of months, The German army finds Topthorn and Joey and return with them. Emilie is devastated.<br /><br />Several years go by and now it is 1918 and close to the end of the war. Joey and Topthorn are being used to pull and carry heavy cannons and Topthorn's legs are seriously injured. He is not able to walk very well and eventually lies down to die. Albert has joined the war and is now only miles away. Albert is determined to find Joey and hopes he is still alive. However, Albert and other soldiers are running into gunfire but manage to make it to the enemy's side and defeat half of the troops. Unfortunately, Albert is injured by tear gas.<br /><br />After Joey sees Topthorn die, he finds an opportunity to escape. He runs through trenches and avoids getting shot on the battlegrounds. Joey runs through a field and gets stuck in huge rolls of barbwire and falls to the ground. Later, soldiers see something moving in the field and one soldier from each side of the war goes out with wire cutters to cut Joey loose. Once Joey is released he is taken back to a field hospital where the soldiers find him to be extremely hurt. They decide that he must be shot because they do not have the money to treat animals. When Albert is told that a horse has been brought in he goes to see if it is Joey. Albert is blind from the injury with the tear gas so he decides to whistle for him. Joey hears the whistle and knows that it is Albert. Joey follows the whistle to find Albert and the horse and boy are reunited. However, the war is ending and the soldiers say that Joey is owned by the army. It is decided that Joey will go to market for sale. Joey goes to market where Emilie's grandfather buys him. The grandfather tells Albert that Emilie cared for the horse and that she died from an illness. He decides that Joey should be with Albert and returns the horse to him.<br /><br />Joey and Albert return to their farm and find Albert's parents to welcome them home. Theyare surprised that Joey has survived the war. Finally, as the sun slowly went down, the two best friends were back with their family forever.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|I very new to playing games on my kindle fire and most do not keep my interests but this game is really fun. Hard enough to keep your interest but easy enough to keep you going.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|\\"The Innocent\\" is a masterfully written novel with twists and turns that make it difficult to put aside for even a short while.  Many readers will discern the villian rather quickly (or at least they will believe they did).  This is an easy read and rates right up there with the Camel Club series for pure enjoyment.  But, as with all good series authors, it left me wanting more and wanting it now!  Hopefully Mr. Baldacci is at work developing the next novel in what promises to be an interesting series (assuming that is what is to become of the lead characters in \\"The Innocent\\")- if it is not to become a series of novels, then Mr. Baldacci deserves to be punished for cruel and unusual punishment by leaving the reader wanting more!

B000X2H8G4|5.0|For the price i couldn't beat it.  i purchased for a hospitalized family friend who was very hard of hearing.  I specifically purchased this one over the others based on the reviews of voices being amplified but not so much the buzzing from fans or other electronic equipment.  The first time i gave him the unit.  he put it on.  a few minutes later i went to heat up a cup of coffee in the microwave which was a few rooms over. once the microwaves buzzed he immediately sat up and said i havnt heard the microwave in years. he was immediately able to have normal conversations with his wife along with all the other family members.  I cant stress what a relief it was to order this and have it actually work as described and for the price.  i recommend this for any senior who hard of hearing.  at least as a temp relief and more budget friendly while you waiting for something like an actual ear piece.

B00479SVBU|5.0|This MP3 player is very compact and easy to use.  It transmits over FM crystal clear with a very healthy bass.  The remote makes it very safe to use while driving.  When you re-start your car it stays on the same song/file.  The controls are easy to understand and use.  It also has an external 1/8\\" stereo jack and included cable to plug in other MP3 devices like your IPod.  The USB port allows you to use memory sticks or charge other devices.<br /><br />It did fit a little tight in the socket but the contacts should fatigue out and soften with use. Over all this is a very affordable and cool little MP3 player.  So far I highly recommend it.
B0079R8KO0|4.0|I've put the Marware Vibe case through the paces with my Kindle Fire (KF) and it is a good product thus far.<br /><br />  -It's easy to pop my KF into the case's holding clips and then quickly pop the KF back out if needed.<br />  -The case appears to have a good durable build quality yet is very light.<br />  -If you're going to get a portfolio-style case then might as well have the ability to use as a tv stand.  This case makes it easy, just bend the stand & you're good to view.<br />  -The outside closing strap is nice to keep the case closed together when needed.<br /><br />But actually for around the house I prefer the JustCase Slim Snapon (in clear color) which I also got on Amazon (only $5).  The JustCase is just a backing (no screen protection) but less intrusive.  I use the Marware Vibe more for travel outside the house since it has screen protection and also I (or my kids) are more likely to watch videos on the KF while on the road.<br /><br />Overall a nice case but a bit on the high price side at $25.  Overall I give 4-stars for price/value.

B003ES61EE|5.0|I had never used a lens pen before so I did a little research on you tube and I'm not sure how I got along without one.  It's one of those things you don't need every day, but when you do need it, it is wonderful to have.  The pen shaped design makes it ultimately portable and fits into any camera bag or vest.  The retractable brush is fantastic and the part that I thought I would use the most.  It did everything I hoped for in removing dust from optics.<br /><br />What surprised me, due to ignorance is the fiber pads opposite of the brush.  I had not used it, and initially was pretty leery of it.  The reversible pad stem with the round and triangular pads are fantastic.  Like I said I was leery, so initially I only used it to clean the viewfinder on my dslr's and my binoculars.  The triangular pad easily got years of gunk out of the tightest corners of the viewfinder and the circular pad works great on the bins.<br /><br />It took a video to fully understand that there was carbon in the pen cap and that you twist it to reprime the pads and clean them.  If I had one bit of constructive criticism it would be lack of even the barest instructions in the box.  Turned out there was more than met the eye for me. Also, a little overpackaged for something the size of a pen.<br /><br />But, all in all, this is a great, solid, functional tool.  I really don't know why I didn't get one years ago.
B0070Z97LG|5.0|This was an unexpected ride, it kept you guessing and on edge.  I love movies that draw you in and keep you wanting more, especially at the end.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love reading .  It is thrilling, exciting, and not since The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series have I been so addicted to characters I am reading about.<br /><br />Oh and the sex...the glorious sex!<br /><br />Not only is this book sensual, erotic, it is suspenseful, dramatic, and insightful. I am halfway through the second book, and already dreading parting with Anastasia and Christian.  The flirty sarcasm, the difficulty trying to cope with the vast differences in lifestyles, and trying to meet somewhere in the middle has kept me gripped in this series from page 1!!!
B006OOHYIC|4.0|I love quell! the puzzles are increasingly difficult and I'll usually do one until I get lowest moves possible. If I can't figure it out I use the hints because it drives me crazy not knowing!  Anyway - this is the second one and I'm ready for the third! Only four stars because it's a little glitchy, sometimes I have to restart.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I thought this purchase was WELL worth the money.  Story was well written.  Pulled you in a kept you there until you just couldn't believe it was ending.  I would recommend this book to everyone!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|The stabbing murder of a young boy in an upscale community leads to intrigue and drama. A classmate is accused of the crime. A real thriller. I loved it.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|a true classic. i have always wanted to read this book, and i was not disappointed.Although set in the 1800s it continues to teach life lessons and I highly recommend it.
1416955070|4.0|If I was to describe City of Bones, I would say that it is the lovechild of Harry Potter and Twilight. Why do I say this? Well, I feel that City of Bones could appeal to both the Harry Potter and Twilight fandoms. Harry Potter fans would love to read City of Bones because like Harry Potter, City of Bones has intricate world-building. Twilight fans would love to read City of Bones because it has the complex-love-triangle-romance dynamic that so characteristically defines Twilight. In addition, City of Bones has a lot of paranormal and fantasy elements. Within this book you will find vampires, werewolves, pixies, magical elements and newly created creatures, lands, and groups of people who live in a secret world totally unknown to humans (whom Cassie Clare has dubbed 'mundanes')<br /><br />What I liked about City of Bones was learning about this whole  new world Cassie Clare has beautifully created where you have shadowhunters (humans who hunt demons and have angel blood in their veins) and downworlders (who are hybrids of humans and demons and include: werewolves, vampires, faries, warlocks etc). Clary the main character, suddenly finds herself being a part of this world by a series of events which change her life forever. Clary is a likeable main character. She is clever, artistic, and strong willed. She also has a secret past that not even she is aware of and it was great to go along with her on her journey to discovering who she truly is.<br /><br />The best thing about City of Bones are the secondary characters. They are all very well developed and all have very unique personalities. For instance, you have Jace Wayland, a shadowhunter teenager, who is so sarcastic and funny. He's your typical bad boy but he insists on doing the right thing. You also have Simon, who is Clary's best friend and he is just a delight to read. He is so witty and smart. Loved him. Magnus the warlock - oh there are no words. He is so awesome. He has so much personality and so much fun toread. Also, the villain in this book is just wow - there are no words for how evil and twisted he is. And those are just a list of some of the characters. There's much more and they are all very unique and fun to read.<br /><br />City of Bones is really action packed which I loved. You also have a complicated love triangle and Cassie Clare throws such a big twist towards the end of the book. And, I was not expecting it at ALL. I felt like I got book smacked when I read it. Way to surprise us Cassie. Such a huge cliffhanger, can't wait to see what happens in the rest of the series. Overall, you can't go wrong with this book. Its a a great read.<br /><br />And what I loved the most in City of Bones, I have to say, is Cassie Clare's word usage. She just uses the most interesting words I have to admit that I had a dictionary next to me the whole time while I was reading this book. That never happened to me even in college, and I read some tough stuff in college (Anyone up for reading a Saskia Sassen essay? Yea I wouldn't like to be in that spot again either). But yea I kinda loved the word usage of Cassie Clare. I learned a bunch of words I have never heard of in my life before. I was kinda always looking forward to the next cool word Cassie would use. And that may be a geeky confession but I like to keep it real. So there you go :D<br /><br />Rating: 4/5
B007XWFZSA|5.0|this is a wonderful book. i am just getting back to the workplace after a couple years and it really provides a fundamental stepping stone for those of us who have lost touch with whats happening out there.thank you victor cheng, for this and the website.
0525423281|5.0|Favorite quote from this book: \\"It's easy to talk about things we hate, but sometimes it's hard to explain why we like something.\\" - pg. 55<br />To say that I liked this book would be an understatement. I LOVED it. Lola and the Boy Next Door is the companion novel to Anna and The French Kiss (which was a superb book) so I had high expectations for Lola and I am glad to say that my expectations were exceeded.<br /><br />Lola and The Boy Next Door was a magical read for me. It just evokes in the reader all of the feelings that come from falling in love. You literally feel like you have entered a relationship when you read this book. It just whisks you away on a pink cloud of awesomeness without you even knowing it. The highs. The lows. The misunderstandings. Everything that you would expect when establishing a relationship, you feel while reading this book. What's even more interesting is that this book covers really heavy issues (family drama, alcoholism, extreme perfectionism, abusive relationships, bullying, stereotypes, insecurity, drug addiction, etc) but you never feel like the book is dark or depressing or too raw. It always remains quite charming and adorable and I just don't know how Stephanie Perkins manages that but it's quite an amazing feat.<br /><br />The main characters of this book are quite amazing. I loved Lola and Cricket. I know that some people might feel like Lola is an unrealistic character because of how extravagant and unique she is when it comes to dressing but I have to say that she is not that at all. Stephanie Perkins truly captured the essence of a person who has a true love of costume and design and a knack for art and creativity. I loved that Lola's wardrobe was so eccentric and expressive. The wigs, outfits and makeup Lola would use sounded like so much fun. She totally reminded me of a younger Lady Gaga. I thought she was a very brave and unique character. I just loved how she didn't want to be the same person everyday, that she experimented with her style. Cricket on the other hand was such an adorable character. I loved how he knew so much about inventing new things and was such an amazing brother, friend, and son. Overall he was just a charming guy.<br /><br />The secondary characters in this book were also very fun to read. I really love how Stephanie Perkins creates such well rounded and fleshed out secondary characters in her books. They always have a unique talent or interest and I just think that it's great that her secondary characters never fall flat or feel boring. We also have guest appearances from two of our favorite characters from Stephanie Perkins' first book, Anna and Étienne, who are always so cute and adorable and fun (Étienne is hilarious and witty).<br /><br />The romance in this book. Wow. Stephanie Perkins is a master at YA contemporary romance. I just love that her characters never fall in love in perfect conditions. That you always meet her characters in other relationships or confused or in denial about their feelings. It's as if you know that these characters are meant to fall in love but you never are quite sure if it will happen. It creeps up on you and Lola and Cricket were just such sweet people. They had what I would call, a refined sensibility. The really cared for what their loved ones thought about them and what they thought of each other. There were just some scenes between them that were beautifully written because they just evoked such genuine love. Such sweetness. Lola and the Boy Next Door is just a really lovely lovely book and the setting of San Francisco was so much fun to read about. San Francisco felt like a character of it's own in this book.<br /><br />My advice: Read this book. You will fall in love with it.<br />Rating: 5/5
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I had this game on my phone and I'm so excited its on my kindle fire now!!!!! I'm playing it all the time!!!!
B007549W62|1.0|At least the tagline for this movie was pretty accurate, \\"The lucky ones died in the blast.\\".<br />If I had a choice of watching this movie or going out with the blast I would've chose the latter that's how bad it is.<br />The best parts of the movie are the beginning and end!<br />Only reason I watched it was because I really liked Milo Ventimiglia in Heroes but take the worst episode of Heroes it's even better than this movie...<br />I don't know how they got money to make this movie? They probably only showed them the trailer which was way better than the movie and made it look like it had lots of action and was actually worth watching?<br />Didn't seem like the writers even make an effort. So many plot holes like location of bathroom, lack of any explanation of militarized science workers, etc. No background given on almost anyone except for the 9/11 firefighter so for the most part you didn't care if anyone lived or died and couldn't wait for all of them to actually since most were idiots and not the kind of people you would want to repopulate the world anyways!<br />There was one point in the movie where I actually had a bit of hope it might turn around where hey maybe this is all an experiment by Homeland Security or something but no wild tangents like that but no...<br />Basically, just like a bad dream where you are the only one with brains left in the basement of a skyscraper with a whole bunch of morons.<br />Don't take a rocket scientist to figure out it's gonna end bad for all.

B0072GPQNG|5.0|Steven Spielberg has made a magnificent movie with his splendid 'War Horse'. It is breath-taking both for the scope of the story and the broad panoramic scenery displayed for the viewers. A friend and I watched it recently at her house, and after it was over there was a long silence. 'I'm now going to adopt five senior horses for my rescue shelter', my friend finally said in a tremulous voice. 'This is surprising coming from you', I replied attempting to steady my voice and added: 'I thought you weren't too keen on horses; you've never mentioned them before these beautiful and courageous animals'. 'War Horse' made me think of all the many centuries through history when horses have been sent into deadly combat. The legendary Bucephalus came to mind, the mighty scar-battled stallion that Alexander the Great rode through many conquests to create his vast empire until the charger died of his wounds in 326B.C. The young Emperor went on to found the City of Bucephala in memory of his horse, whom he deemed immortal. And, then there are the unsung heroes symbolized by Joey the horse in Spielberg's movie. A colt raised on a farm lovingly by an adolescent boy, Joey and Albert are eventually swept up together in the terror of war, and it's all about the loyalty, courage and the noble bond shared between man and horse. It brings to mind the quote 'The winds of Heaven are those that blow between the ears of horses'. In remembrance of Traveller, Gimcrack, March and countless other brave hearts, and with appreciation to Mr. Spielberg for his latest and outstanding masterpiece.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I'm ordering my THIRD sweeper.  The first one had the old battery. I purchased the red battery and it once again runs great and at the same time  ordered a new swivel sweeper for our cottage.  The first sweeper is so old though that the top cracked and altho I could order just that piece I am ordering my third.  I love these sweepers for small jobs.  It's great for the cottage cuz we don't have padding under any of the rugs and the sweeper runs almost as good on those rugs as on the wood floors.  The red battery just goes and goes.  I don't underestand why so many people are having problems with theirs.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|I have listened to this CD none stop. I Love It! 5 stars...I was very pleased and would recommend to other Stevie Nicks Fans
B0067LY4WG|5.0|Simply wonderful.  That's all I can say about this album.  Very relaxing and enjoyable to listen to all times of the day.
B007HO392S|5.0|Just bought this album last week, and I think it's her best one yet! Love it, she is a great performer/singer/songwriter!
B000VLE3GA|5.0|When my friends and I were  growing up in the seventies I didn't pay much attention to these guys. I was more into cerebral-type stuff, like Dylan and The Band. Shame on me. Check this stuff out. Especially that plodding, booming bass. To heck with Clapton (just kidding; he is a player). JOHN PAUL JONES IS GOD! Enjoy.
0307719774|4.0|This is a great journal, but I gave it four stars because it's a tad difficult to write in. The spaces aren't too big and it'd be a lot easier to work with if it were a paperback/softcover
B004V5QWU2|5.0|A good sound machine can run into the hundreds and a cheap one is a waste of time! The sound quality is amazing, just ask my cat. I played the cat purring sound and she was pawing at my Kindle. For less than 2 dollars you get CD quality sound with NO LOOPS. You know what I mean if you have ever owned a cheap sound machine. I plug my Kindle in by my bed at night and play the waterfall and I listen to the various nature sounds while I read. You could not possibly be disappointed by this app! There are tons of absolutely realistic sounds to make anyone relax or sleep like a baby.
0345803485|5.0|Absolutely loved this book! The main characters Anastasia and Christian Grey are an unusual pairing. I am not unfamiliar with BDSM, but it was written into the story in such a way that it didn't make it a sleazy, cheesy romance novel. Any woman that reads this (and the entire series for that matter) should not feel as though the author is demoralizing women. This story is about a submissive that takes a dom and flips the script!! One thing that I will say is that I wish the author wrote more of the \\"Christian\\" story into the plot. I think that it would have made the story a little bit richer.....however; I do think a trilogy of just Christian would be an excellent read!! Can't wait to see what this author has in story for future novels!
B004H4XI5O|5.0|Just finished this book and it is definitely one of the best I've read.  Josh Foer is a professional writer and his skill writing added to the book's continuity, logical development, ease of reading, humor, etc.  (Mr Foer...if you're reading this review...PLEASE write another book!)  Mr Foer traces his journey from covering a story on the US memory competition to actually training for, competing in and winning the US championship.  Along the way of telling his story he divulges some of the memory techniques used in his training...but the book isn't primarily about the techniques.  He does give enough info to help anyone improve their memory by using the memory palaces or the PAO system (which is great!).  I found the sections about the Rainman & the Brainman FASCINATING!  & (I might add) his candor in admitting his memory shortfalls is extra interesting in the context that he won the US competition and set a record while doing it!  My only disappointment was when I hit the last chapter.  I was very pleasantly surprised by how much I loved this book.  I'm sure if you have any interest in this topic you'll enjoy the book.
B007GFDVEE|4.0|Yes, Captain America comes with this set, and that's great.  But there are some issues:<br /><br />-- The motorcycle is cool and they provide a spot for the shield.  That's all good.  But the motorcycle won't stand on its own.  I think they should have designed in some kind of little kickstand.  This is a major flaw if you're trying to display the set on your desk.<br /><br />-- The small alien shooter is pretty cheesy.  The missile angles make it seem like someone threw it together as an afterthought.  It won't level down to horizontal (to point at Cap's bike, for example), but it does bend back to point straight up, which seems useless.  And there's no base for the minifig controller to stand on, or lever for him to grasp.  All in all, it's kind of a weird little piece.<br /><br />-- The large flying piece is not too bad.  It will stand on its own and has a lot of nice \\"alien\\" features.<br /><br />If possible, I would have rated this set at 3.5 stars.  While Captain America is obviously very cool and the one alien flyer piece is nice, the flaws are hard to overlook.
B004UQ03P2|5.0|Going from the shiny, reflective surface of the original Macbook Pro screen to the iVisor was a bit of a transition. Took me about a day to really get used to it. First I couldn't believe it was so easy to put on. Why is there always just one brand that gets it right? Just had to ask myself that question - nobody answered of course. Glad I followed the other reviews and bought this rather than anything else. Of course, no bubbles when applying it. Don't notice any interference (in terms of thickness) when closing the cover.<br /><br />After a few weeks, I can hardly tell the iVisor is even there other than the barely noticeable circle around the Macbook's camera. Reflections gone, replaced by a very pleasant, looking almost like a real Apple non-reflective screen. Excellent product, highly recommended.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Well, I agree with the rest of the reviewers above that this is probably one of the best BBC dramas I have seen - very moving and well acted. I am actually considering buying it!  And I only have boughten one other (well 3 actually) films - the Stieg Larsson trilogy.  I do have to point out, however, how closely the scene where Margaret refuses John is a direct take on the scene with Darcy and Elizabeth in P&P. I will now have to read the book to see if it is the same in the book, although as she lived almost at the same time as Jane Austen she can't have copied it, so it must be a popular theme of the time. Or another explanation is that the film production lifted the scene and dialogue for P&P. At any rate, it is very good. I love this film.
0062183591|4.0|Interesting insights into the human mind.  If you like predictably irrational you will also enjoy this book.  However, if you haven't read predictably irrational you should start with that one as this book is pretty concentrated around the subject of honesty and thus is a little more repetitive/thorough and less intriguing.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I get to use windows 7, SAS, and R on my HTC thunderbolt. I wish the app had better compatibility for swift key or Swype.
B004SDEP38|2.0|The Amazon version is older than the Google version, which makes the Google Play Store prompting me to update.  DataViz should update both versions at the same time to avoid this issue!
1401216676|5.0|Given that I love Batman I was immediatly intrigued. Although short and without spoiling anything the story is exteremly deep on the Jokers reasoning for doing what he does and explains his orgins. This tale gives the Clown Prince of Crime a human side. Great buy
B00005JLEX|5.0|ORDER ARRIVED ON TIME. EVERYTHING WAS IN ORIGINAL PACKAGING. THE PRICE WAS A STEAL. IF U LOVE SEINFELD LIKE I DO, THEN THIS IS A MUST BUY.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|absolutely love it. I use it for all my meetings. I can then upload all my notes nonlinear and print them out. Very useful.
B006LR0XLM|4.0|This product is most helpful for linking computers to other media  such as the android or tablets. Only one little problem is printing email content. Either I don't  know how or it just wont.
0345803493|2.0|I'm so disappointed. I loved the first book but this second book was terrible - boring, predictable and I rolled my eyes through the whole first 30% until I gave up on it. I had enough when Ana's first dance was up for auction at the charity event and the others girls went for $5000 but Ana of course went for $100,000 and she was just oh so beautiful. Gag me with a spoon.

0446608955|5.0|The story of Landon Carter and Jamie Sullivan has to be one of the most romantic stories ever told. The movie is one of my favorites and I love the book just as much. You will definetly be moved and brought to tears by it. I wish I could give it 10 stars!

B007J4T2G8|2.0|My oh my, I am a child of the sixties and not much shocks me, been there, done that, got all the prizes.  So, why is this becoming such a 'Bestseller deal\\" I  have flicked thru sooooooooooooooo many pages, just trying to get to the end so I can feel I can justify the  money I spent.  So if you are of my generation, don't waste the money on this fantasy, we know about drugs sex and rock and roll, we are the real deal and whoever thinks this book is real should maybe be on a reality show.
B007M6P01O|5.0|I love this show, a great plot with twists and turns in every show. I can't wait for the next season.
B0039PPW60|4.0|I ordered this mixer specifically because it had an USB interface.  I use it for podcasting and I'm quite happy with the audio quality.  My only gripe was with the drivers for Windows from Behringer.  They seldom work properly and haven't been updated in the last year or so.  As well, they only do up to 48khz, which may be a limitation of USB audio.  I would have prefered 96khz.
B006BG7RI0|5.0|Casablanca is by far the best movie ever made. The anniversary set is top of the line for any and all fans of the movie. My set will sit in a closet and will be passed down to one of my grandchildren. Best investment I ever made.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I saw that this book was getting a lot of publicity and numerous friends had read it in an addictive fast manner so I decided to buy it without even seeing what it was about.  I did read the free sample but it doesn't really get into what this book entails.<br /><br />This book is about a college grad but more than that it is a book about sex.  It's definitely X rated and completely erotic.  I almost stopped reading it because I was in such shock when I got to that point of the book but I'd spent money on it and finished it through.  The book just ends and you go to turn the page and there's nothing there.  (Same with the sequel)...<br /><br />I enjoyed the book but it is not for the faint at heart.  It is for those with a completely open mind.  And should be read in private.  I was at the gym reading when I got to the first sex scene but after that the entire book is nothing but different sexual positions, innuendos, toys, etc.  This is by far the most graphic book I've read regarding sex.<br /><br />Only read this if you have an open mind and know what the book is about ahead of time.  I wish someone had told me.  I did like it though and found it to be a quick read.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Super cute. The graphics are goofy and each puzzle has little bonus challenges that add, well, a bit of challenge.
B005LBF7CY|4.0|I am a Danielle  STeele fan and i enjoyed this and all her other books .Heloise was a bit spoiled and unreasonable about her dad having a woman in his life . overall i would recommend to others who like to be entertained . keep up the good work ds
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was the best of the trilogy, It shows Christians fifty different shades his love for Ana, his very dark past and the lengths he will go to for their relationship. Christian is overbearing but even through all his stuggles you cant help but to love him and hope for the best for him. I now see why this is the \\"it\\" book! Its a must read.
0345803485|1.0|...and that's saying something. I'll try and keep this short because I want to be done with this book, and never have to think about it again. I read it ONLY because of all the hype. I wanted to see what all of the fuss was about. I wish I hadn't.<br /><br />The author writes like a 7th grader with a thesaurus sitting next to her; except she doesn't use it effectively. She changes unimportant words to be more complex, making sentences sound awkward and dialog sound fake. But when it comes to her other choice of words, there is no variation. The Kindle search tells me that James uses \\"mutter\\" 50 times, \\"inner goddess\\" 58 times, and \\"murmur\\" a whopping 199 times! Another review asked \\"How many times can someone say 'crap' and 'Oh my'\\"? well apparently Ana can say \\"Oh my\\" 73 times, and \\"crap\\", 98 times. Every other speech quote is \\"Mutter\\" or \\"Murmur\\". I'm not sure if she knows what those words even mean because why would someone be talking under their breath in every conversation?<br /><br />So, besides the poor writing, the characters are flat. Ana is essentially a self insert character. She has no personality, making it easier for the reader to insert themselves in her place. It's a clever trick, but it doesn't make good writing. If you take a step back even for a moment and think about it, it's actually kind of frustrating. Christian wants this girl so much, but all I can think of is \\"why?\\" shes does nothing to set her apart from anyone else, and has no redeeming qualities. The author tries to mask this by making Ana clumsy. If you take out her clumsiness, you have nothing.<br />Aside of Ana's character problems, Christian is abusive.<br /><br />From the domestic abuse signs on helpguide.org:<br />Does your partner:<br />act excessively jealous and possessive?<br />control where you go or what you do?<br />keep you from seeing your friends or family?<br />limit your access to money, the phone, or the car?<br />constantly check up on you?<br />see you as property ora sex object, rather than as a person?<br /><br />Christian is a big yes to all of those things. Don't waste your time with this series.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is very fun to play it is the best game on my kindle! kinda reminds me of Sid Myers don't know why.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games~<br /> This book was one of the best books I've read. Not only did the author create such a vivid image in your head when you read it, but also the story line kept you on the edge of your seat. The setting takes place years into the future into a new country known as Panem. This new country rose from the ashes of North America after it failed. In Panem, there are 13 districts and one Capitol. Each of the districts specializes in a certain area. While one district might supply weapons another supplies coal. One year though, district 13 decides to start a rebellion against the Capitol because they no longer want to supply them and be under their control. This caused the Capitol to destroy the 13th capitol and kill everybody remaining. The Capitol decided to make more laws and become extra strict. They wanted to make sure no one ever forgot what happened and the power they have over them all, thus creating the Hunger Games.<br /> Every year and once a year, each district must pick two tributes, one boy and one girl, from a glass bowl. These 2 tributes are then shipped off to the Capitol for training. Here they meet the other 22 tributes. Soon after their tanning they are taken to the arena, the battlefield for the games. While in this arena the tributes are forced to kill each other until only one is remaining while every citizen is forced to watch every brutal second of the games. The last tribute remaining will then go home and receive riches for the rest of their life.<br /> Meet Katniss Everdeen, a 16-year-old teenager from the poorest district, District 12. At a young age she lost her father and was forced to support her mother and her little sister Prim. To do this every morning she leaves early to go hunt in the woods with her best friend Gale. Although hunting is illegal, they never get in trouble because everybody could use a little food.<br /> One the day of the drawing for tributes, Prim is chosen. Katniss leaps forward to volunteer to takeher little sisters place. Once she is up on stage the boy tribute is chosen. The boy picked is Peeta Mellark. He is also a 16-year-old teenager. Katniss and Peeta know each other but aren't exactly friends. Peeta was the one who got Katniss to start hunting again and saved her family from starvation.<br /> When the games began Peeta told all of Panem that he was in love with Katniss. This was supposed to be only apart of the show, but he was actually telling the truth. At the beginning of the games, while in the arena, Peeta joins forces with the Careers (the rich kids from the upper districts who have trained their whole life for the Hunger Games, to them it's a honor) and helps them hunt down Katniss. This ends up being a lie to keep them away from her. Although he knows he has to die to keep her alive, he is willing to keep her safe. This is the problem, both Katniss and Peeta want to keep each other alive but to do that one of them must die.<br /> Then there was a rule change. During this rule change, two tributes can win if they are from the same district. This sends Katniss into a frenzy to find Peeta, who has been seriously injured. Once she finds him she learns that Cato, their many enemy and the one with the best chance of winning, sliced open Peeta's leg. Together they take shelter and Katniss nurses Peeta back to health.<br />  Soon there was only three left, Katniss, Peeta and Cato. Though they were spread apart, so, soon the gamemakers (ones who control everything that happens in the arena) send mutant mutts to chase them to the middle of the arena. This is where it all goes down.<br /> Once all three find each other in the middle, Cato puts Peeta into a headlock. He tells Katniss to go ahead and shoot him with her arrows because all it will do is send him and Peeta to their death. Being a smart young girl and an expert with bows and arrows, she shoots Cato in the hand causing him to let go of Peeta and fall to the mutts to die.<br />  Once Cato was killed, Katniss and Peeta think they have won. That is until the previous rule change had been revised, meaning only one could win. Katniss wasn't going to accept this. So she pulled out the nightlock berries (These berries are extremely deadly if you take one tiny bite, you will die instantly from the poison) and hands some to Peeta. They counted to three and shoved the berries into their mouths. That's when they are told they have won. Each spit out the berries and is lifted into the hovercraft waiting to take them back to the Capitol. They are finally safe and can both go back home and live peacefully with their families.... Or so they think. At home trouble is waiting for them, why? Because they outsmarted the Capitol. And nobody outsmarts the Capitol and gets away with it.

B005HV6Y5W|4.0|Much of this film is made as if through the eyes of a young boy. Because of that, it is quite emotionally fraught and tension filled where the film technique exaggerates and distorts in ways familiar to the descendants of The Cabinet of Dr Caligari, so that an attic room is a very narrow, forty foot high dark brown chamber with a small window at one end; the mother is filmed as an ethereal angel like figure, the father, a stiff, thick-lipped jaw-jutting fascist - a point of view familiar to almost all boys, and to Greek dramatists, Freudians etc. It reminds me that the great Huckleberry Finn is also a point of view work, where great truths are revealed through the eyes of a young boy.  The film is bookmarked by images of the natural world and highlights a reminder of our insignificant part in it. If it is the case that the world through the eyes of a boy, and his memory of it, are distorted by powerful feelings of love, shame, wonder, jealousy, guilt, fear, then Mr Mallick has managed to make a remarkable and powerful portrait of the world of post WW2 suburban America as one (universal) boy experienced it and a sobering reminder that our worlds are much more defined by our feelings than by any objective evidence. It is also a reminder of how close our dreams are to film. Brad Pitt plays the father and was one of the producers. Interesting to observe this actor grow and evolve. The film is all of a piece and a great example of the effective integration of music, themes, and technique to make a cinematic work of art.
1423140591|5.0|I have to admit that I didn't expect much for this volume of the series since the first one lost me a bit. Anyway, as an addict to Percy Jackson series, I had to read the book. Then, I found myself reading it from the first page to the last page in one day. I didn't do anything else but reading it. Unputdownable!

B007K87C4M|5.0|You either get it, or you don't. Mikael and Steven didn't create this body of work for YOU... they created it because this is what they felt. You have the privilege to hear it, and the right to form an opinion... but don't blame them because it's not what you thought it should be. If you're expecting Opeth or Porcupine Tree, this is probably not the album for you. You should go listen to Opeth or Porcupine Tree. However, if you want to slip on a pair of your best headphones and get lost in a symphony of melancholic, strange, hauntingly beautiful music that comes from the hearts of two talented musicians and song-writers... then I urge you to buy a copy asap!<br /><br />I get it, and I LOVE it!
B00136Q0AO|4.0|I have never listened to this album from beginning to end.<br /><br />But I have listened, often, and there is no doubt in my mind that Talking Heads, the 1980's version of King Crimson, and perhaps Gang of Four did. Because Miles' \\"On The Corner\\" has elements of all of its decedents.<br /><br />But it is a hard chaotic listen. It makes me nervous, and agitated.<br /><br />A classic, and a road map to better things to come.

0061906220|5.0|I also disagree with the review from the School Library Journal.  Pete does not teach children to be passive.  Rather he empowers them with the message that you<br />do not need to be a prisoner to your circumstances, but rather you can choose to be positive.  One of my favorite quotes in life is \\"Pain is inevitable, but misery is optional.  \\"  Praise to Pete for reminding us of this great truth.
0345803507|5.0|I actually read the review of Fifty Shades of Grey in a woman's magazine (I can't remember the name of it at this time) and found it simply amazing and knew I had to get the trilogy. Not only did I order the trilogy I talked this up to everyone I know, I emailed friends and family and told them to \\"GET THE BOOKS\\"!!!! and wear a pantyliner when reading:). Since my review of the books, receipt of the books, this trilogy has been on every talk channel, t.v. show, radio station I hear about and watch. This trilogy is the best thing out there and I wish continued great success to the author on her amazing accomplishment! Keep writing girlfriend!!!!!:):)
B004WOJ9E8|5.0|American progressive metal powerhouse \\"Symphony X\\" are back with their 8th studio album \\"Iconoclast\\", marking their first release under \\"Nuclear Blast Records\\". \\"Iconoclast\\" features the established line up of vocal titan Russel Allen, guitar virtuoso Michael Romeo, drummer Jason Rullo, keyboardist Michael Pinnella and bassist Michael Lepond.<br /><br />In comparison to the previous album, \\"Paradise Lost\\", \\"Iconoclast\\" is much more of a melody-driven album than a riff-driven album. While \\"Symphony X\\" go through an admirable amount of keyboard harmonies, rhythm guitars, six-string melodies and mercurial tempo patterns on each of the nine songs on offer, the structure of each track is very well defined; and even though it will require a good number of plays for one to grow accustomed to the structures of the compositions, the verses and choruses are guaranteed to stick with listener upon first play.<br /><br />Allen's rough-yet-melodic vocal performance makes for plenty memorable choruses while Romeo puts everything on the table with his furious shredding. The keyboards have also taken a leading role on certain songs adding complex instrumentations and, at times, carrying the core melody of a track. The rhythm section is undeniably metal, yet the attentive listener will be able to pick some very interesting bass chords. Overall \\"The end of innocence\\", \\"Dehumanized\\", \\"Bastards of the machine\\" and \\"Children of a faceless god\\" are easily amongst the greatest prog-power tunes you will hear in 2012 and ultimately bring you back to \\"Iconoclast\\" for any number of plays.
B0018CMJSU|5.0|The Godfather: The Coppola Restoration was a gift to my husband for our wedding anniversary.

I suggest everyone purchase this edition, its great!

B007PT3QOQ|1.0|The name of the game is Oregon Trail but it is not.  It is like the Zynga game Pioneer World.  Very Disappointing.  I finally uninstalled the game when it had a malfunction and all the times on every object was 24 hours.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am a late-30s something American woman and I really enjoyed this series.  I just perused a few of the other reviews, some of the less positive ones, and I think those were male readers and I can understand why they wouldn't like these books.  I can understand since the protagonist is a 21 year-old young woman.  I see the similarity drawn to Twilight because of the main characters' senses of feeling awkward, that they don't fit in.  There is also the Pacific Northwest setting which is a parallel for both series, but that is where it ends.  I did not read the vampire series meant for teenagers because I knew they would be too simple and too tame.  I have heard the later books grow beyond this.<br />The BDSM or S&M content of Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy is very mild and thus the wild popularity.  This is definitely romantic erotica or erotic romance, but not really very BDSM at all.  If I had to rank it on a scale of 1 - 10 with 1 being barely any S&M type content and 10 being extremely chock-full and more on the extreme and hardcore BDSM content, I would give this series more of 1 or a 2, really truly \\"vanilla\\" with mildly kinky sex.  They do refer to more hardcore scenes, but they are quite fleeting.  I write this because I like the opposite spectrum of darker erotica and hardcore bdsm, so for those that do also this series will not satisfy that desire for you.<br />I recommend it for the story, the romance, and the erotica.  I like a book that can touch my heart, bring tears to my eyes, put a smile on my face, and \\"rev my engine\\" a bit... This book did all of that.  I really liked the protagonist, our main character Anastasia Steele.  She was very likable.  The intelligence of our main characters enhanced the flirtation, seduction, and attraction between them. Their email exchanges were amusing and entertaining with their wit and humor.  I wanted to know what happens to our characters and I liked where the author took them.<br />Also enjoyable and humorous was Anastasia's inner dialogue with her \\"inner goddess,\\" it was part of the authenticity of her character and so reminiscent of personal moments and exchanges doing the same myself with internal feedback or reflection of conversations and experiences.  I cheered for her and her ability to rise to her challenges and overcome them.  The struggle concerning her sudden influx of wealth as a result of her relationship seemed realistic enough.  I guess the author really likes Audi, but with his kind of wealth I wanted to hear about some of the other classic European marques.  (Personally biased here also, of course!)<br />I can understand why these books are so popular.  I bought into it and I enjoyed it, so much that I finished them within a few days because I could hardly put them down.  Anastasia is a believable character, a sort of nerdy, English literature loving virgin, and just a bit socially awkward, but she seems to find her way pretty well.  You could say this might be the result of a side effect or byproduct of her blossoming romance and handling each occasion as it arises.<br />I am originally from the Pacific Northwest and now just a somewhat regular visitor, but I enjoyed the references to Portland and Seattle (especially Portland) and a few of those places I know about like the Heathman and OHSU.<br />For entertainment, read them and enjoy.  I think they're decently written and the \\"disturbing\\" is merely the troubled childhood of Mr. Grey.  Some of that and Anastasia's own emotions dealing with the resonating aftermath are the parts that touched my heart.  I'm one of those kinds of readers and persons, easily emotionally manipulated, so if you can make me cry with your story and your characters, then I think it's a pretty good book.  And yes, have your intimate partner, friend(s) with benefits, or various toys or hardware on hand...astasia's inner dialogue with her \\"inner goddess,\\" it was part of the authenticity of her character and so reminiscent of personal moments and exchanges doing the same myself with internal feedback or reflection of conversations and experiences.

B0072OFOM6|5.0|I shall be succinct. Life is unfair!<br /><br />Case in point, Andy Whitfield. For two years he was the luckiest man in the world and then WHAM! he became the unluckiest man in the world and I say to that, LIFE IS UNFAIR. And there is no God because what God would do such a thing. To play such a cruel joke on this man is unfathomable to me. I sometimes have trouble wrapping my head around it. Yes, I know I did not know the man personally, but damn, that doesn't mean I cannot feel for him. If you watch the early episodes of Blood & Sand you will see the Melanoma on Andy's upper chest and you just want to scream out for him to watch out! But alas, we cannot.<br /><br />With that in mind, I shall say that Andy's replacement is acceptable. What I mean is, I would have rather not had to have him replaced at all, but if it was necessary then the new Spartacus is okay with me. Not that anybody is looking for my approval, but there it is anyway for you to read.<br /><br />Spartacus VENGEANCE is a BUY!! As were \\"Gods of the Arena\\" & \\"Blood & Sand\\".  BUY THEM ALL! And always, in the back of your mind, be a little sad for Andy who is (I suppose) in a better place. So very sad. And unfair.<br /><br />Yes, we can take comfort in what Andy left behind for us, his legacy, it's very much appreciated and it shall bring hours and hours of comfort for you too! Blood and death and maiming and killing and scheming...what's not to like! The perfect series in my opinion. Well, except what happened to Andy but other than that, a perfect series. One the world has waited a long time to enjoy. Especially here in the USA where everything is censured all the time. To protect our sad little brains I suppose.<br /><br />Okay, well, I'm going to stop talking now. Buy it. You won't regret it. Trust me.<br /><br />Rich L<br />New Haven,CT
B005P06AAO|5.0|If you are looking for a smart, funny, very well cast teen comedy series - this is the one. The characters are a riot, and its refreshing to see a show where the victim of all that is awkward and mean is a very pretty, smart, sweet and well balanced girl.  A girl with friends, love interests and parents who are present. Some shows take a while for the characters to develop properly and for the actors to get comfortable with the roles they play, but this show is full of professionals who play their quirky roles with perfection. From the first episode to the last, very entertaining. I have recommended this show to a lot of people and I am glad it has been renewed for a second season. I am keeping my fingers crossed that the second season is as good if not better than the first. Watch it! I mean it. It is very funny. I'm glad I bought the DVD because I have already watched it twice, and I tell friends about it all the time.

1416972242|4.0|CITY OF ASHES continues with the confusion that we were left in at the end of City of Bones. Clary and Luke are trying to deal with Jocelyn being in the hospital in a coma, Jace and the Lightwood children are having problems with the Lightwood adults returning to the Institute, and Simon has his own personal demons to battle.<br /><br />This continuation of The Mortal Instruments series was just as good as the first. I thought the beginning was better than the first because we just jumped right in rather than having to take so much time to explain about the world of the Shadowhunters and Downworlders. It was also really great to see all the same characters we grew to love come back for this book. It was also great to see some new characters, so nothing became too monotonous.<br /><br />The emotions in this book are so raw and so easy to feel through the pages, that it is clear Cassandra Clare has a way with words. I don't want to give spoilers to those of you who haven't read it, but the chapter in the Seelie Court is a really great example of the raw emotions. It's my favourite scene from this book, and I wouldn't be surprised if others felt the same way about it.<br /><br />There are a lot of new challenges and hurdles that the characters have to face in CITY OF ASHES. And even though they have to deal with these tough things, they still seem like teenagers, and not adults. Clare really wrote the characters well.<br /><br />If you haven't picked up The Mortal Instruments yet, or you've started but haven't continued, pick them up. I went about 7 months between City of Bones and City of Ashes and now I don't know why. It's really great getting back to Cassandra Clare's world and seeing what kind of adventure she's going to take us on next. Trust me, you don't want to miss this series.
0439023513|4.0|About the Book:<br />It's the conclusion to The Hunger Games trilogy. The districts are rising against the Capital more and more every day. After the rescue from the Quarter Quell, the victors are now working with District 13 to overcome the Capital.<br /><br />Review:<br />I found this book to be both fantastic and a bit boring at the same time. I was especially looking forward to the uprising against the Capital, and I figured I would be hooked from page one. Sadly, this was not the case. The first half of Mockingjay really seemed to drag for me, and I felt I was basically reading the same thing over and over. Now, the first half wasn't all boredom. It definitely has some gems sparkling in the mundane muck.<br /><br />The characters in this book become more complex as well. We see more of Gale and Katniss' friendship go from rocky to firm. It's nice to see a friendship that still has its disagreements yet hold together. Collins also does a fabulous job at using her characters to get an emotional response out of us. Finnick's tale as he recollects the past probably had the biggest impact on me. It was heart moving and struck something deep inside. Then, there is Finnick's love story. You can see his torture play out when he knows President Snow has his love. You can see that he is barely holding on. Then, of course, there is Peeta. I don't want to give anything away, but when you see what the Capital has been doing to him, you cannot help but despise Snow and feel such distress for Peeta's situation.<br /><br />Now, I may not have been a fan of the first half of Mockingjay, but the later half had me hooked. Once we had a change of scenery, the adventures kept coming. Still my favourite bits were the emotions the characters brought forth and the climax. Like the prior novels, Collins writes scenes that will stick with you for what seems an eternity. There is one scene that involves silver parachutes (those who have read this will know what I talking about). It is this scene that actually caused me to put down the book and recollect myself from the shock. It was that intense. I don't know a single person who didn't feel some sort of emotion during this scene. There has only been one other time I felt this large of a shock when reading, and that was when Snape died in the Harry Potter series.<br /><br />Anyway, to sum up the review, I found the first half to be mediocre at best, but the impact of the last half certainly made up for it. Add in all the character dynamics, and you have a pretty fantastic book.
1400032717|4.0|I've heard this book is valuable to people who want to be teachers, and I understand why. It gives us a look into the mind of an autistic child. These students are often the ones who cause teachers a lot of stress because they can be high-maintenance, but they are typically very bright children who just don't understand social cues and therefore are misunderstood in society. The author of THE CURIOUS INCIDENT worked with autistic children, and his knowledge and understanding of them enabled him to write a magnificent novel.<br /><br />It was interesting to read at first. I had to get used to Christopher as a narrator because he thinks so differently from me (and, I'm assuming, from the general population). I was also surprised with the amount of swearing in this book, and it made me glad that I didn't read it when I was younger. But eventually, the plot starting catching me off-guard and about half-way through, I just got sucked right in. I really didn't expect it to! But the next thing I knew, I'd spent my whole night reading the second half of the book. I had a hard time putting it down.<br /><br />This book is so much more than the mystery of who killed Wellington, the dog. It's more about the relationship between Christopher and his father, and how Christopher deals with the things life throws at him. One characteristic of children with autism, is that they aren't very good with change. Unfortunately, Christopher has a lot of change to deal with, and he struggles a lot, but comes out as a stronger, more confident person.<br /><br />I'm sorry, I feel like this review is just all over the place! This book is a great exhibition of the mind of a child with autism, and I think that it is beneficial to teachers to read this, especially if they have or ever will work with children who have autism. I think that a lot of people would benefit from reading this. It's powerful to read and learn about how Christopher is, and then see what he can live through regardless of his disability. Thanks to Christopher, I'm willing to take whatever life throws at me, and be stronger because of it.s disability. Thanks to Christopher, I'm willing to take whatever life throws at me, and be stronger because of it.
0545265355|5.0|About the Trilogy:<br />The districts had revolted once before, but they were defeated by the Capital. Now, the Capital holds a tight reign on the districts by controlling their airwaves and economy, but the biggest terror is the Hunger Games. Every year, one boy and one girl is forced to play in the Capital's favourite reality show. In this unseemly event, twenty-four children are dropped into an arena where they are forced to kill each other until only one survives. In this trilogy, we follow Katniss as she tries to survive the Games and the Capital's control in what seem a never ending play of lies, secrets, and deceit.<br /><br />Review:<br />I had been hearing about The Hunger Games for what seems ages now, about how it is absolutely fantastic, and I have to agree for the most part. Yes, it still had its issues, but overall, I did not regret reading it and have even recommended it to a few people already. Even though the quality of the writing is less than top notch, I still couldn't help but get sucked into its gripping tale. The first book was fairly predictable, but Catching Fire and Mockingjay still managed to have their surprises. However, even though I felt book one was predictable, the action within kept me reading and wondering how things would play out. Hell, this could be said for the entire trilogy.<br /><br />Collins also manages to project tremendous visions and emotions within the mind's eye. Without even thinking, I can name at least one from each book. What's more is that these visions and emotions stay with you for quite a long time.<br /><br />The characters is The Hunger Games trilogy also hold quite an impact. Throughout the books, I came to love (and at times hate) the characters, and at other times, I wasn't even sure. For example, I wasn't overly fond of Katniss, but I couldn't help but root for her. Throughout the book, the reader is often struck with questions regarding the characters and their situation. Is Katniss being too cold? Is Peeta too soft? Is Gale too harsh? To rash? Not only does the reader come upon  these sort of scenarios, but Collins also manages to create some heart gripping scenes as you learn more and more about these characters.<br /><br />Now, there is the overdone love triangle, and I remember being suspicious when it reared its head, but I am glad to say it did not take over this story like an unwanted weed. Yes, it had a presence in each book, but it was not the main focus. Nor did we have an annoying heroine dropping everything so that she can decide what bloke she wants to be with.<br /><br />The Hunger Games trilogy has a story line that will keep you hooked from beginning to end. It sparks the imagination and creates a world within your mind. It can be disturbing at times, but I love the fact that Collins is not afraid to go there, even though it is geared toward young adults. Honestly, I believe it is because of this that this trilogy is loved by a wide range of people of different ages and genders. It's a wonderful adventure in a not-so-wonderful world, and I would, personally, recommend this to nearly anyone.
1416955070|4.0|I definitely enjoyed this book. I admit it took me a little while to get into it. The beginning is slightly drawn out with random events happening, making you think \\"What on Earth is going on?\\" Of course, we eventually get to the part where there is a character who has all the answers and starts explaining things for our main character. But because Cassandra Clare has created such a wonderfully amazing and creative world, it does take a little while to explain which makes it feel drawn out once again.<br /><br />Once everything's been explained, we jump into this new world with both feet. It seems like you're reading at the speed of light because so much is going on, but then you realize there's still so much to get through and you think \\"How is that still possible?\\", but then you're happy because you have more time to spend in this world than you thought.<br /><br />As the pace continues as quickly as it has been, eventually the end comes to a near and then Cassandra does something unexpected to me: shakes everything up in ways you can't imagine until you read it. I can't believe what she did and being a romantic, she kind of lost some brownie points from me. Then she also left it off on a big cliff hanger.<br /><br />In the end, this book has a wonderful story and Clare creates an amazing world that you are sad you can't be part of. I'm really excited to read City of Ashes and see what she will possibly do to wrap up what she left hanging before jumping into the next big adventure.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book took a few pages to get going but when it did, WOW.  Read all three and really liked them.
1416972250|5.0|I am fully confident in saying that City of Glass is my favourite book of The Mortal Instruments series, so far. I feel like that probably had to do with the fact that it was a new setting, and also that there were a few new characters, both good and bad. It was a big adventure for all the characters, lots of questions were answered, and it was all very emotional.<br /><br />If you've read my reviews before, you know that I love to get emotionally invested in the characters. Technically, I've been emotionally invested since the first book, but that's not the point. I felt like this book was a bigger emotional roller coaster than the last couple. Yes, in CoB Clary and Jace were all lovey dovey, then in CoA they were all \\"Oh em gee, you're my sibling.\\" But in CoG, it wasn't just Clary and Jace's feelings. I can't remember anyone else's feelings from the other books (except some flirtiness around Isabelle/Simon, Maia/Simon, and Alec/Magnus). This third book really shows us more than the one relationship. It shows more of Alec and Magnus, of Isabelle, Luke, Simon, and more. I've never had a problem with book focusing on one relationship (most are this way), but I feel like after two books centred on the Clary/Jace relationship, it was refreshing and exciting to see more of the other characters.<br /><br />I'm always amazed at how much Cassie Clare packs into one book. I guess that's why they're all around 500 pages. There's just SO MUCH that happens! I don't want to give spoilers, but I do want to say that you need to be prepared for lots of ups and downs, lots of questions answered, and a very good ending. I loved the ending.<br /><br />Sorry this is such a weird review, but I don't know how to put anything into words apparently! I finished the book a week ago, and haven't figured out how to write the review yet, so this will have to do. All I have to say is if you've been putting off continuing this series, at least finish up this book. It is a great way to finish off the first half of the series.the first half of the series.

B0012QE4Q2|1.0|This is not only a terrible adaptation but a terrible movie nonetheless. This is the worst period movie I have ever seen. I love period movies so I watch them all the time and this makes even the cheapest Masterpiece Theater production look like Oscar-winning material.<br /><br />I am so tired of filmmakers remaking films that are already great. This movie is horrible. It's incredibly boring that you can't sit through it at once. The acting is draggy and laughable. I am sorry but a lot of today's so-called hot actors don't have the range or the talent to attempt something like this. Scarlett Johnansson and Natalie Portman might do well with a modern-day romantic comedy but they do not have the chops for a film like this. It's laughable to see them step in the shoes of all the great actresses who have played these roles. I mean no disrespect to these ladies but this film was over their heads. To me I didn't see them as the parts of Mary and Anne but as replicas of the actresses who'd played them in the past. I got the sense that Natalie and Scarlett were just trying to imitate the actresses who played these roles before, not truly conveying Mary and Anne as people.<br /><br />Eric Bana was the best actor in the film AND the king yet showed less than anyone.<br /><br />I don't even have the interest to go into what I didn't like about this movie because it was so pitiful. If you want to see the REAL deal when it comes to the legend behind this movie check out the amazing classics that got the job done:<br /><br />Anne of a Thousand Days<br /><br />Mary, Queen of Scotts<br /><br />And for great modern-day period films in general check out Cate Blanchett in the Elizabeth series. Now that's acting!<br /><br />As for The Other Boleyn Girl, it takes more than fake accents and dressing up in old century clothes to get the job done. Obviously the filmmakers of this movie went with who was popular, not the best talent.

0345803485|1.0|...for such an awful trilogy. I must agree with the poor reviews and wonder how this crap is a best seller. Good marketing on simple minded.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Okay, so I'll admit I have never read any of the Twilight books. I've seen the first movie only because my best friend dragged me to it. But I have read enough articles and seen enough stats about word usage in the novels to make my title statement. I've even heard that this trilogy started out as Twilight fan-fiction. I don't know if that's true, but it honestly would not surprise me.<br /><br />Ana = Bella. They are both supposedly awkward and painfully average and self-deprecating, yet somehow practically EVERY GUY wants them. And of course the author feels the need to remind you every other page that yes, Ana is still pretty damn \\"average\\" looking.<br /><br />Grey = Edward. Dark, damaged, brooding, obsessed with the female lead, gorgeous, wealthy, etc. Again, we are constantly reminded that Christian Grey is drop dead sexy, which honestly wouldn't be too terrible if the same sexy things weren't mentioned every chapter. Instead we have to read about those damn pants hanging off his hips and his smoldering eyes. Okay, he dresses well. Got it. Yeah, he's got grey eyes. They're ashy. Smoldering ashes. I see what E.L. James did there...<br /><br />Throw in a stereotypical Hispanic best-guy-friend (complete with fun \\"Ay dios mio!\\"-esque catch phrases) and a best-girl-friend that Ana will never be as cool as, and we've got a party!<br /><br />Oh, and of course don't forget the whole backbone of the story... The endless, dragged out pseudo-BDSM sex scenes between Ana and Grey. First of all, anyone who's watched a half hour documentary on TLC about \\"Strange Sex\\" will know that a true devotee to BDSM (as Grey seems to be -- I mean, he's got a freaking torture room) would not be getting short of breath at the little dorky things Ana does. All this girl has to do is bite her lip and peek up at him through her lashes (which of course she does every two seconds) and he is ready to go.<br /><br />I could probably say more, but I could only get half way through the book before completely losing interest. I really wanted to like it because the premise is up my alley, but the writing style was painful and repetitive. I've heard similar things said of Stephanie Meyer.<br /><br />Another small thing that I couldn't get past -- The main characters are Americans in their 20s, Ana just barely out of college. However, you'd never know based on their tendency to converse with each other like 45 year old people from England (Grey being the absolute worst).completely losing interest.

B0055PGUYU|5.0|It's good to know that one can change one's habits. By learning how habit is formed,that there is a cue,followed by a routine,which in turn produces a reward -one can replace a more healthy routine,if not the cue,to get the reward.It's also very good to recognize that succesfully changing one routine,or habit, can have a multiplying affect- changing other bad habits,routines. The author gives numerous examples of how habit works in personal lives,as gambling-the cue is boredom in an empty nest situation-once the children are off to school- for this one women.Instead of going back to school or gotten a job,she chooses a nearby casino.Unfortunately for her,I think that her first blush of success,formed a habit in her mind that she can repeat it-which is not possible.one has to quit while one is ahead.I've played with a very limited amount to lose and after a while,one's attention span strays and one plays by habit-just to fill time.He gives examples in business-as alcoa-of a change in businees culture habits can transform a company into a more profitable business.By making worker safety the number one concern,instead of money making because of hazardous conditions, the company became more successful and profitable on many levels. It's a worthwhile book,hopefully life-changing for the better.

B001DHXT20|1.0|The Hulk, as a character, seems really intriguing.  I'll admit, I never read his comic series despite being obsessed with Marvel as a whole, and so I didn't know much about him other than the random times he popped up in Spider-Man or whatever.  I saw bits and pieces of Ang Lee's 2003 disaster of sorts while on vacation a few years back and fell asleep.  Visually, it seemed tight but organically it lacked depth.<br /><br />This 2008 abomination is just lacking everywhere.<br /><br />The visuals are cheesy and so cartoon like that it made me literally depressed.  I mean, we can't expect all of our superhero films to have the depth of character that Nolan or even Rami brought to their respective franchises, but we should expect that they are visually impressive.  `The Incredible Hulk' is just blandly created and looks so garish.  The Hulk himself looks awful, but the real sinker visually was that thing that comes of Tim Roth.  Seriously, that was a mess.  Other than the ridiculous use of CGI, the storyline is messy and the acting is terrible.  Edward Norton, who is usually VERY good, is wooden and merely a prop that leads to bigger and dumber things.  Liv Tyler first of all looks awful and her hushed voice is used desperately here.  She sounds like an idiot, and her performance lacks all conviction.  The makeup job on Hurt was great (almost unrecognizable) but the makeup on Roth was terrible, and his performance was atrocious.<br /><br />All around, this is a comic failure (pun intended).

B005LAIGPU|1.0|maybe I'm just biased, but enough with the home movie cinematography. shaky, unprofessional, and really... who carries their video camera every where.

B001N1DPDE|1.0|Beware! This knife is great, but the sheath is a total condom. The sheath DULLS THE BLADE. The sheath I got with mine broke the day I got it. The retention strap broke off of the nylon belt loop. I thought \\"no biggie, I wanted to put a tek-lok on it anyway\\"... so, I swing by the army surplus store. 20 minutes later, I have snapped all the rivets off and removed the crappy nylon belt loop. I install the tek-lok and put it on my belt. Sweet - good to go! Well, not exactly, after a few practice draws, I noticed the blade wouldn't even cut paper!!! Keep in mind that all this happened THE DAY I GOT THE KNIFE!!!!<br /><br />Ugh. This is just downright unacceptable. KaBar, you make great knives, but the sheaths are ridiculous. Becker BK2 knife only - 5 stars. The sheath - negative 2 stars.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I've been hearing about these books constantly and decided to check them out to see what exactly the hype was about.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoy the character of Christain Grey. Much like other great characters like Healthcliff in \\"Wuthering Heights\\" or Mr. Rochester in \\"Jane Eyre,\\" you want to know why he is so haunted, so tortured. I honestly wish that we could have since some of the story through his point of view as he pushes through his darkness to change for Ana, which is the central theme of \\"Fifty Shades Darker.\\"<br /><br />The character of Ana Steele just infuriates me as a reader, she is so one dimentional and beyond irritating. She reminded me of why I hated Bella Swan in the \\"Twilight\\" novels and just like Stephanie Meyer, E.L. James created a female progtagonist that I just wanted to slap. E.L. James basically beats you over the head in the first novel with the comparisons to Thomas Hardy and Tess of the D'Ubervilles but Ana in no way compares to some of the great literary heroines in love with tortured, dark souls.<br /><br />I just don't understand why you would write a book like this and create a female character that is a jumble of stereotypes, she's clumsy, naive, not very smart (unlike her best friend Kate), doesn't eat and acts like a petulant child. I was hoping that she was more of strong woman but what we get is a very shallow character with some of the most inane dialogue ever as other reviews have pointed out.<br /><br />These books are still a great read for what they are but they are far from perfect.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is one of the best reads I've had in a long time. I was fully prepared to not like this book (referring to the omnibus edition), to be honest it reminded too much of other works that haven't fared well with me. The whole huddled survivors in a bunker theme isn't my kind of story.<br /><br />However, right from the beginning I was seduced by one mystery after another until I could not put it down. The way the author would tease you with a glimpse of what the future held for each character and then give you the story leading up to point worked very well for keeping me riveted to story to found out how it all came about. An enjoyable read that I am recommending to all my friends. Keep up the good work Hugh!

B004A8ZWVK|4.0|Set in early 60s Jackson, Mississippi, Tate Taylor's ensemble drama@gThe Helph is a blend of pathos, drama and comedy. It is a fable, well told and bitter sweet. Maybe some people (including me) would find it a bit too sweet. It is a good fable, nonetheless, most notable for the great performance of Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer.<br /><br />\\"The Help\\" follows the story of Eugenia \\"Skeeter\\" Phelan (Emma Stone), who has just come back home after graduating college. As an aspiring writer, Skeeter attempts to interview the maids including Aibileen Clark (Viola Davis) to record their story in a book. Aibileen, at first very reluctant, finally agrees. Then outspoken Minny Jackson (Octavia Spencer) joins. She has many things to say, especially about her former employer, a society lady Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard).<br /><br />\\"The Help\\" seems too eager to please while trying not to offend anyone. Some characters, whether they are ggoodh or gbad,h are almost like caricatures, especially Bryce Dallas Howardfs Hilly Holbrook. Even Emma Stonefs heroine lacks the depth of the character Sissy Spacek (who appears as Hillyfs cynical mother) played in gThe Long Walk Homeh about 20 years ago, a more unique and fleshed out heroine who knows what she is doing. Ifm not sure whether or not Skeeter really understands the impact the book would leave in the community.<br /><br />The only person who really knows it is Aibileen played by Viola Davis. When end credits roll up, we realize that gThe Helph is after all about her character. See the film for her strong, Oscar-worthy performance.
B004Z4M15Y|5.0|Virginia Woolf broke ground in To the Lighthouse, keeping the narrative of the story in the strong subjective.  People reach out to each other in the book with internal expression of sensitive feelings, observations, perceptions so that knowledge of the characters grows for the reader through others' thoughts. There is not the usual spoken onversation or direct action as a character is revealed.  Nonetheless, the characters are drawn beautifully and come alive for the reader.  This book is a treasure.

0439023521|4.0|This is a great book to get lost in. Suzanne Collins imagines a future that we haven't seen before as America has become an authoritative dictatorship. The government is maliciously cruel, desperately inefficient, and barely holding in check the various communities that make up the social order.<br /><br />While trying to keep the masses in line, the evil President Snow oversees a decadent capital city that demands extreme hedonism and utter indifference to the real and massive suffering in the outer communities. Into that scenario a young teen girl, Katniss, is thrust into the Hunger Games, a despicable game whose only goal is to kill the other players. Last man/woman/child living wins a comfortable life. The main protaganist, Katniss, has managed to learn some *very* useful skills by illegally hunting outside her district's boundaries.<br /><br />Parallel themes of the book are the exploration of love, integrity, duplicity, ruthlessness, and oppression. Hunger Games is a fascinating adventure through the eyes of a detached teen, who is forced into an impossible situation and how her inner self tries to maintain her identity while living a tremendous lie.<br /><br />Great escapism. Enjoy.

We are able to view them more than once if we want and the convenience has made our little treat well worth the mad money! Thanks Amazon!

Voice in fine mettle and not overused. Still not figured out a lot of the lyrics but the vibe on each song is so infectious, it's hard not to keep listening to the album over and over ... Personal favorites include Cuckoo, Kickin, Outlaws, Underneath, Nirvana, Naked Love, Trespassing ... see, it's tough to pick one! If there's one thing that has made me get over listening to MDNA repeatedly, its Trespassing.

0307951529|5.0|The author rips apart the process from passion to business in a meaningful and well thought out manner. His incite from both personal and contributors for business creation based on passion is well worth the read. I consider this a good all around read for anyone because it creates critical thinking on the part of the reader. You can sit and read this book at a leisurely rate and thoughts will begin to stream through your mind about the activities and hobbies you have and how they could provide income. The author creates a sort of intellectual challenge with the reader to create income for themselves using what they already have. This is not some book that will have you taking out huge loans to start a business, it helps you recognize hobbies that could be profitable for you and fun at the same time.
B005FMZX9Q|4.0|This watch had me on the fence - I love the contrast of the white dial and black numbers.  The band is comfortable and stylish, but the size of the watch itself is a bit overwhelming.  Controls - 3 dials - are on the left side of the watch, making this seem like a left handed watch.  Functions, and accuracy have proven to be outstanding.

B0059XTUB8|2.0|This may have indeed been a \\"true story,\\" but what an insipid movie, with Marilyn presented as little more than a blow-up doll for young Colin's pleasure. Of course, one wonders how much access young Colin Clark had to Marilyn at the time. The book came out long after the incident presumably took place, and apparently at the urging of publishers. But, my biggest gripe was with the characterizations. Branagh makes Olivier into a pompous old windbag. God knows who Julia Ormand was trying to be, certainly not Vivian Leigh. Michelle Williams provides a cuddly version of Marilyn with out much body or soul. The only two to really stand out in this film were Derek Jacobi and Dame Judi Dench in their all too fleeting supporting roles.
B007SSDS24|3.0|A business trip to Moscow goes from bad to worse for two friends that get caught in the middle of an alien invasion. First, all of the electronic devices are disabled by a massive microwave pulse from space. Then the aliens start floating down to Earth, at times they glow orange, but they are mostly invisible to the human eye. These aliens are not interested in communication, they simply want to eliminate humans from the planet so that they can harvest the Earth's resources. This is a decent adventure story. Some of the special effects are interesting, for example, when we get to see the alien's perspective. It has a decent amount of action. Due to its larger budget, it is slightly better than a SyFy prime time apocalypse movie, but the acting and plot is mediocre at best. Don't expect The Darkest Hour to blow your mind, but it will serve as entertainment if you have a couple of hours to kill and nothing good is on tv.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it has poor graphics but games that are reasonably entertaining and the points earning system is pretty fair and there are a lot of games.
1419701533|5.0|My 3rd grade son hates to read but when his friends got into this series, he wanted to be like them.  I took a chance and bought his this set. He absolutely loved it.  He loves to sit on the sofa and read and is now competing with his friends on who can finish a book first.  The price is great for everything you get.  This is well worth it. Its a small price to pay to have your child read.
0439023483|2.0|The premise of the books is fine. The present tense writing is pretty good. I liked all the characters, and even the bad guys didn't sound so bad, but possibly because I knew what was at stake for everyone. Even the government didn't seem so bad.<br /><br />What I had a problem with was the tedious and boring description, right on into the end of the book. The scenes of her hunting and eating wild animal made me want to scream because the author covered those things for most of the book.<br /><br />The most egregious about the writing was the flashback or paragraphs of description in the middle of action scenes that literally stopped the action.<br /><br />Then the pages upon pages of description or character thoughts that bored me to death and did nothing but to fill the page because nothing was really happening. I particularly disliked the part when Katniss took us through many pages of how her sister, Prim, got a goat. I skipped all of that. There were many times when the description was merciless and boring and tedious that I skipped just to get to something that was happening.<br /><br />The way this books is written, the actual Hunger Games in the book seems pretty boring! There were times where katniss was miraculously spared or saved by someone else instead of getting out of the situation by herself. That was annoying.<br /><br />My other problem was the stereotype of the two black characters in the book, Thrash and Rue. In the author's attempt to portray them as sympathetic characters, she let lazying writing take over and start writing stereotypes of characters. Really, Thrash can't say two grammatically correct sentences! This goes to the stereotype of all blacks are uneducated. Rue who likes to swing in trees. I guess because all blacks are monkeys. The blacks in their district being whipped - like slaves, I guess. You wouldn't pick up on this SUBTLE stereotypes unless you've had to deal with them your whole life. There were others that I picked up on. Katniss is from an equally poor district, but she, Peeta, and Gale all speak perfectly well. Now, this might be intentional on the author's part and in later books we might find out that Rue's and Thrash's district is mistreated by the government and they have lesser education and are intentionally treated like second class citizens, then I can take the stereotypes, but if that's true then this is something that needs to be explained in THIS book and not a later books because right now the author looks like a lazy-writing, borderline racist fool in my eyes. Harsh, I know, but really.<br /><br />Lastly, this book didn't compel me to want to read the other books in the series so I'm saying good-riddance to katniss and peeta and gale. The writing in this book was not that good and I can't take it for two more books.
0547569653|5.0|Scott Jurek, is an American Ultramarathoner, who happens to be vegan. Scott grew up in close proximity to the  woods and rivers. Learning to hunt and fish as a child, it is no surprise that he enjoyed eating what he caught..meat. Scott as a young teen, endured many responsibilities and obstacles. He was not one to join team sports in high school. He felt more comfortable as a loner and found happiness when he joined the competitive ski team . On one particular training camp that he attended, he was first introduced to the vegan diet.  Jurek found that he felt much better by eating better. The transformation from meat eater to pure vegan would be a slow process. Jurek was under alot of pressure to help his mom, who was slowly becoming disabled due to MS, he would help cook, clean, take care of his siblings and work. He still achieved excellent grades and attended college to study Physical Therapy. With his good friend, Dusty, Jurek began to run trails and eventually bike long miles. He found that he enjoyed the long distances and eventually focused more to running than skiing.<br />Jurek's adventures and accomplishments were phenomenal. He constantly strives to be better in both speed and endurance. His experiments with his diet and slowly starts to eliminate all meat, diary and processed foods eventually turning to vegan. Jurek finds eating a plant based diet is more effective as he continues to run in extreme races.<br />At the end of each chapter, Jurek inserts a recipe for his readers to enjoy.<br />His story is very humble while at the same time I am amazed at what a remarkable runner he has become and still is.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Even better than his great debut. It'll be tough for any pop album to beat this effort this year. Been a fan since first seeing him on American Idol and already a huge fan of Trespassing. Very catchy songs right here and that amazing voice.. highly recommended!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was awesome!  I could not put it down!  I loved uncovering the mystery behind Christian's past.  After finishing the TriIogy didn't want it to be over because I hated saying good bye to the characters that I fell in love with.

B007IPJMCM|5.0|After a bad experience with the Deluxe Cowboys from hell Edition I was a bit skeptical about this one. Remastered CFH was overly done and sounded bad to my ears.<br />This one on the other hand, is pretty fun. dynamics remains almost the same, sound is wider and the bottom mid frequencies adds depth to the whole thing. while sometimes the subs are a bit exadurated, The energy is spot on!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really loved these books. I can't wait to see the movie. I hope I won't be disappointed in the actors. I have the perfect Christian in my mind...

B0009XNUK0|5.0|I absolutely love this collection of Michael's music.  I looked at a bunch of other so-called collections and none of them had all of the great songs included in this one.  Love it!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Very entertaining!  At first I was reluctant to allow my children to read a story about games which children must kill each other, but there were great lessons in the Hunger Games.  The second book in the series adds to the drama and has issues that children need to explore.  I highly recommend the series!
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Fantastic second album. I've been listening to it for 2 days on streaming, pretty much all the time. The first song caught my ear in about 3 seconds. And then the second one. And the third. Since then, I got over the excitement and could pay attention to the lyrics, and started loving the slow ballads too. Current favorites are Underneath, Cuckoo and Shady.<br /><br />The sounds of the 80's (my childhood) are all throughout this album, so this takes me to a very good place, updated for the 21st century. Lovely, lovely album.<br /><br />Adam's range finally shows. And the subtlety in his voice, too. He does not overdo anything, and goes into higher octaves at just the right moments. The result is greatly pleasing to the ear and heart.<br /><br />Get this album. Now.
B0062QRTKA|5.0|It's just a game and an enjoyable one at that, why is it that most Christians have no sense of humor? Lighten up there are worse things out there to gripe over. Btw I don't own the Amazon version, I got mine on sale at the play store a while back =) also yes I'm a christian I've read my bible and know the story etc. etc. Anyway runs great on my htc amaze graphics are perfect and yes it does get progressively harder as you advance but not enough to give up. Well worth the price so give it a try. The only issue I had was the game uninstalling itself once (no lost saves though) I reinstalled it contacted the dev and the next morning they had responded, no big deal it was a glitch on my phone.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Thor could've been a mess, considering it's a tricky property to pull it off. However, Marvel Studios and Kennet Brannagh made an amazing job; the cast is terrific, with Chris delivering everything you could expect from the God of Thunder and Hiddleston giving us the best Marvel villain brought to the screen so far (do you doubt me? See the Avengers!). Great FX, specially the ones about Asgard. I wish it would've spent less time on Earth, which definitely the movie's biggest flaw.<br />Anyway, highly recommended!
B001TH16DI|5.0|This is what it is. The blue rays of the first 6 movies. If you love Star Trek this is the only way to go, The only problem is that once you see these in HD you will want to convert everything over.

145162445X|5.0|This is a gem of book: small, dense, multi-faceted.  I don't hold an advanced degree in cosmology or physics, extracting the book's information required some focus on my part.  It was well worth the effort.<br /><br />Author Lawrence Krauss sets the intellectual tone for A Universe From Nothing in the first lines of his preface, quoting Jacob Bronowski:  \\"Dream or nightmare, we live our experience as it is, and we have to live it awake. We live in a world which is penetrated through and through by science and which is both whole and real.  We cannot turn it into a game simply by taking sides.\\" Put in as slightly different way, a way that Krauss repeats several times in the book, the job of humans with intellectual integrity is to accept the world as it presents itself through evidence, whether or not we like what the evidence shows.  Is this a foreshadowing that most will not like his conclusions?  I think not.  I loved what he had to say.<br /><br />A Universe From Nothing is a success on at least three levels: explanatory, exploratory, and exhortational.<br /><br />From an explanatory point of view, Krauss is a competent and good humored educator.  Though his prose doesn't, in my opinion, match the story-telling ability of Brian Greene in [[ASIN:0375727205 The Fabric of the Cosmos: Space, Time, and the Texture of Reality]], or the engaging style of Richard Panek in [[ASIN:0547577575 The 4 Percent Universe: Dark Matter, Dark Energy, and the Race to Discover the Rest of Reality]], it is more than adequate to lead a reader with a solid science base through the cosmology, particle physics, and quantum theory updates that are available to us in the second decade of the 21st century.  Krauss's succinct reviews of cosmic inflation, dark matter and energy, and quantum physics provide a solid underpinning for his theme that the universe does indeed appear to have come from \\"nothing\\", though what Krauss means by nothing is not the \\"nothing\\" that you grew up thinking about.<br /><br />In his exploratory mode, Krauss is just plain fun.  His explorations branch down at least two major pathways.  First, how do current discoveries and popular cosmological/quantum physics theories intersect with  theological/philosophical mullings over \\"How could SOMETHING possibly come from NOTHING?\\".  Second, leaving theology and philosophy aside, Krauss indulges in the pure pleasure of speculating about the different implications of contemporary cosmological and quantum physics theories.  He includes one of the finer, and more lucid, discussions of the anthropic principle that I have run across.  Krauss, who also wrote a book on the physics of Star Trek, deftly manages in these explorations to demonstrate that science well done is entrancing, and regularly capable of producing crops of awe-inspired goose bumps.<br /><br />Krauss is also unabashedly exhortational.  He makes the point repeatedly, and throughout the book, that any scientist, any human that claims intellectual integrity, must accept the universe as it presents itself, rather than as one would like to find it.  Those cosmologists that liked the notion of curved universes must yield to evidence that the universe is flat.  Those who thought the world was only 6000 years old, much yield to geology and cosmology that tags an extra 13 billion years (and loose change) on to that total.  We humans, including Einstein in his day, keep trying to bend the world into a comfortable shape.  Krauss, in effect, says \\"Hey, kick back, enjoy the ride, it's all fantastically interesting, even if it isn't what you wanted!\\".  Filled with a passionate love for science, Krauss exhorts us to be dispassionate in the face of properly accumulated evidence.<br /><br />This would not be a complete review without mentioning Krauss's thinking about God and the cosmos.  Krauss does not deny the possibility that there is a God (though his personal belief on the matter seems clear).  He forcefully denies, from the preface tothe epilogue, the need to invoke digitus Dei (the finger of God) to explain the universe(s) that we are a part of.  The universe, according to Krauss, simply doesn't require divine intervention to come into existence, nor to continue its existence after it spontaneously generates itself in a fashion concordant with quantum physics.  Thomas Jefferson said, in speaking as the founder of the University of Virginia \\"A professorship of theology has no place in our institution\\".  This was not an attack on theism, it was a ringing endorsement of the notion that when trying to explain the world that we live in, one should rigorously pursue natural explanations, to the exclusion of supernatural explanations.  Reliable knowledge about the universe we live in, felt Jefferson, will come through science, not theology.  Krauss could not agree more heartily.<br /><br />Finally, after reading this book, few will think of the concept of \\"nothing\\" in a way that has even remote resemblance to prior conception.  In a sense, the book calls into question even the notion of \\"nothing\\".  And though Krauss doesn't explicitly discuss it, the distinction between \\"something\\" and \\"nothing\\" takes a serious hit in his narrative.  How's that?  Well.  That would be a spoiler, would it not?the epilogue, the need to invoke digitus Dei (the finger of God) to explain the universe(s) that we are a part of.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|The Book Thief is one of the most compelling stories I've read about the Holocaust, indeed, humanity.  Written from the perspective of a girl who portrays the confusion of being caught up in the massiveness of social turbulence, what at first seems to be a powerless position, is ultimately transcended by hiding a Jew in their family basement. Through this one seemingly small courageous act, she and her family gain a subtle transformation in their interiors even if they are unable to change the course of history.  The prose is beautiful, characters well defined and actions layered with intense suspense.  An incredible read for serious students of the human condition and history itself.<br /><br />Rosalie Cushman, Author of the Holocaust memoir,The Man Confused By God
B007WV05GY|3.0|Was looking forward to renting this as did not catch in theater. Well just finished watching and ambivalent. Was not terrible but not great either. Definitely a film for men and not a date night choice. I like the \\"Flight of the Phoenix\\" better as a men-against-elements, themselves and \\"others\\" a better film.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|David Baldacci always seems to weave stories into a page turning experience.  This is no different.  I had trouble putting it down and looked for reasons and time to keep it going.  To me, that defines a good novel.
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|I'll admit it, I only bought this album for one track, after hearing it get some airplay after appearing on that famous U.S. television music show. Now that I've had a chance to sit and listen to the album a few times through, I have to say it is a real grower. The styles of the songs definitely varies, but the album is cohesive from beginning to end. There are some moments on here that remind me of another semi-famous Australian band, Cut Copy, so I kind of \\"get\\" the randomness that seems to pervade the album as a whole. Really solid effort overall though, will be in my regular rotation for quite a while!
B005RK6EUS|5.0|One of the better finales and looking forward to the next season.  I especially liked the look in his eye when.....  Spoilers, sweetie.  =)  --kissi
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game! It is easy and fun to play! I am a little hooked on the game! I am looking forward to seeing what comes next! My kids are hooked as well!
B005ZTFPFQ|3.0|Yes, it's a good game, except that it's only missile command that's free. According to my research (with help from game informer magazines by the way) , the Atari games are pretty good until you get bored. So whenever you get bored, just uninstall the app. It's that simple.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|I honestly thought, there would never be a show that would be as good as 'The Wire'. But right as 'The Wire' was ending, 'Breaking Bad' came along.<br />(Now I won't compare the 2 shows! I see them both, as the best shows in TV history.)<br />Now about 'Breaking Bad'! If for some reason you haven't seen it; watch season 1 ASAP! Next 2, 3, etc...<br />It will hook you so fast. Kinda like a junkie smoking Heisenberg's Blue Meth for the 1st time!<br />I'll leave it w/ this:<br />Some of 'Breaking Bad's' best episodes could be nominated Oscars!
B0064T6LV8|4.0|I love this game except for one thing: the premiums. As you can see, the arcade game I would play is pinball. But the problem is, you can't play with the premium levels unless you pay for the other app. So follow my advice.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I bought this movie for my girlfriend and watched it with her. Very well directed, and has a great message.<br />I would be quicker to recommend the blu-ray though.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|Loved it!!!  A couple of force closes didn't ruin it.  The story was fun and the grafix were great.  wish it had been a little longer but great fun for the price.  Am playing a 2nd time.  Can't wait for the sequel!
B005CVWWJY|5.0|This books has an amazing set of references about the 90's, movies, videogames, music, music videos, and far etcetera. Excellent book, totally recomended for everyone who has a like for this kind of things.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the story. It tells the story of the ages (people with power and those without). Want to read the whole series.
B004EPYZV2|4.0|Excellent Movie.  Great special effects spectacular scenery .  When they show the tallest building in the world and the camera pans downward, it gave me goose bumps..fear of heights!!
0439023521|5.0|Like many, I read this book because of the uprising in Hunger games fandom. I wanted to check it out before the movie was released and I'm so glad I did. It definitely was worth the read.<br /><br />You're heart is constantly torn by the fact that teenagers are training as killers. Even more so that the rich Capitol population not only accepts this reality-show \\"game,\\" but also enjoys watching each and every death as they unfold. Such a sick concept of government corruption, surrounded by the story of the unknowing heroine Katniss and her friendships, love and family.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|So before I can play you want my email address AND my email password?! Not just a password for this app but my actual email password. How about my social security number too?
B007LNJ3YS|5.0|I wouldn't expect anything less. While this album may not reach the same mainstream appeal as Teen Dream it is just as amazing. After the first listen I realized that I got lost in Victoria's haunting voice somewhere in the middle. I initially thought it wasn't as dynamic as their last but I have since changed my mind. It is a treat and also a task to listen from start to finish which is a credit to the production. I don't want to say that it gets better with every listen because it was brilliant from the start but it does have that signature Beach House hook. The sound quality of the vinyl is up there with some of my best sounding records. The 2 12-inch LP's are played at 45rpm which seems to add a noticeable depth to the music. I'm not an expert but I assume that the higher speed means the cartridge receives more information for a given time interval. It sounds so much better than the digital copy that is included. If you love Beach House then you probably don't need to be convinced but if you're looking for good music make the jump. Newcomers might warm up with Teen Dream then Bloom before Beach House and Devotion.
B000NA22C6|4.0|I am a huge fan of both Stephen King and Johnny Depp, so it should come as no surprise that I really enjoyed this movie. Johnny Depp is such a talented actor, he really makes you believe he is being driven mad. Alot of Stephen Kings fans really hate on the movies that are based on his books, I on the other hand enjoy them and many of them are really good, if they would just stop comparing them to the books and watch them for what they are (\\"BASED ON\\") they might actually enjoy them.
B002A97IJ0|1.0|This fan is ten times louder than my CPU heatsink..... It doesn't push a lot of air either...<br />i wish it was half as noisy.
B001OQCV6K|4.0|I have become a big fan of Robert Downey Jr lately. Everything from Due Date to Iron Man 1&2, has been really good. This movie is no exception. He did a good job at bringing some humor to the character. The slo-motion shots were awesome. Can't wait to see the second one. Keep up the great work Robert.
B005EYP8PO|5.0|U2 never failed to surprise me back when they first started out. I can remember buying 'October' and 'Boy' together on the strength of the first 2 film clips that I saw , 'I Will Follow' and ' Gloria',... Needless to say, I was a fan from the word go. 'Actung, Baby' was U2 're-inventing' themselves!!! To me, it was U2 just creating another great record. I have never been disappointed with any of their music. That is the mark of a GREAT band. You spend the money to buy the record before you hear it,knowing that you are going to enjoy listening to the music. This is my favourite U2 album. I remember listening to 'October' and thinking...'that's my favourite U2 album...then I heard War...then I heard Unforgettable Fire...Then Joshua Tree...then Rattle And Hum...then.....and then...
B0013ND30W|5.0|The blu ray version of Sleeping Beauty looks absolutely beautiful. The colors really pop off of the screen. They did a great job with the transfer. This is a must have for any Disney fan, in any format, blu ray, DVD, VHS, out doesn't matter, you just need to own this movie. This is where it all began.
B0079R8KXG|3.0|When not using my Fire, I've been keeping it in a zippered sleeve, which is nicely padded and keeps my Fire safe in my purse. I prefer all my Kindles uncovered for reading, etc. However, I thought it would be nice to have an angled stand for the Fire for the few times I watch videos. This case is perfect for viewing videos.<br /><br />The Fire slips into the case easily and is held securely. The fold in one side allows for a variety of angles while the flat side holds it in place. If I primarily used my Fire for videos and never wanted to remove the cover, I could be very happy with that and award five stars. But I do prefer the cover off most of the time, especially for reading, and there's the problem. The cover is extremely difficult to remove.<br /><br />To be fair, I should say the cover is extremely difficult for me to remove and I do have small hands. Removal requires holding the Fire with your hands while using your thumbs to push down and out on the clips to release the clips from the speakers. Each time, I have to make several attempts because the hard plastic jamming into my thumbs is so painful.<br /><br />So to sum up, if you plan to leave the cover on all of the time, I can highly recommend this one; it's great for watching videos. If you'll want to remove it often, and don't have strong hands, you may want to join me in my search for a different stand.
B000UJ48WC|4.0|This is a great horror movie, no one can deny that. Jack Nicholson looks like a lunatic by the end of the movie, he is a man that has drove off the deep end. Great, great movie and everyone should definitely see it, but in my opinion I like the TV series version better. I think it was a little more believable, and I love the Stanley Hotel.  Watch both and decide for yourself, they both are great horror movies.
0545091020|4.0|The voice is very clear and understandable. She really gets into the parts.  My problem is that the chapter pages listed on the CD's don't match the chapters in the book.
B007WV05GY|1.0|This movie is pretty much a conglomeration of brutality, blood, and complete lack of a story.  I won't get into more details for those of you plan to watch it, but don't get your hopes up.  Besides Liam Neeson's awesome voice (think back to Taken), there's nothing worth seeing/hearing here.
B0079R8KO0|4.0|I got a similar case for the Fire from amCase. They both protect the Fire well by covering the edges and having a snug fit. The amCase feels a little flimsier that the material on this case. This case folds a different way when standing the Fire up than the amCase. The amCase folds back and catches in a leather flap, that seems like it may wear out after months of use. This case allows the Fire to rest on the folded flap. A couple weeks later, the case is not as stiff and it doesn't stand up as easily. The MarWare is about twice the price of the amCase, so that may be a huge consideration there.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|judging from the large amount of primarily negative reviews it has received, I don't think I'll even bother. The plot sounds as if it could have some potential if written by a good author, however, the writing and lack of structure turns it into a complete joke. Can't believe they are actually considering turning this into a film. Won't be wasting my time, money, and certainly not my brain cells.
B005KA188S|5.0|The movie was totally amazing! It was freaky, got beautiful graphics and disgusting creatures, and the very cool story. Liked the acting and David Tennant played a very cool role. Now I just have to see the original classic movie.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|BEST book of the entire series.  It's worth reading the first two just to read this one.  I couldn't put it down until I finished it.  Loved the ending, wouldn't change a thing!  I'm hoping she decides to rewrite the series in Christain's prespective because I don't feel I got enough of them.  Loved it!!

B00000J048|5.0|My 2.5 year old one loves these bocks/gears.  They are difficult enough to put together to be challenging, but not so difficult that he could not put them together without our assistance.  It took a couple of days for my son to learn to connect but not to jam gears together.  He had it for a while now and he still plays with it every day, and they seem to be more appealing to him than his legos.  I am impressed by this toy.  It is fun and seem to have lasting entertainment power.  It is also educational and allows little ones to be creative.  You can put the gears together in 2D, 3D or you can stack them up.  The gears are well made and they can attach and turn at 90 degrees angle.  I would recommend this toy.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Walt Longmire reminds me strongly of my beloved grandfather, who was a doctor and a cowboy and a lover of the West.  This series ably demonstrates that the Code of the West is not dead.  I loved this book and all the rest of the series.  Long may Johnson continue to write.
B00466HN6S|5.0|I ordered this for my kids for Easter and it was a cute movie...! It is a great family movie.
B007X15GRQ|1.0|Movies like this are ugly and not entertaining. In the 1940s, noir movies had a manner to separate the good/bad guys from the bad/bad guys, and keep us from leaving. For example, in 1947s Kiss of Death, Victor Mature is a crook who eventually goes good, while Richard Widmark, as the notorious Tommy Udo, was not only bad, but probably created a role that dogged him his entire career. (Just check out how Tommy Udo deals with \\"Rat fink\\" grandmothers in wheelchairs.) In Contraband, a vile drama, much like The Departed, Man on Fire, and 52 Pickup, we must endure enormous cruelty and gratuitous violence merely for the sake of a self-indulgent director and badly written script. The stories are not made more clear, the characters more understandable, the dramatic resolution at least satisfying. Instead, Thank God, that's over! A real waste of talent and money.
1592332803|5.0|I was recommended this book by a friend and have to say it is a Great Book! This is a definite MUST buy and the recipes are delicious.
B007F5S1DQ|3.0|I was reading the reviews from previous issues of \\"Rank\\" and decided to buy this one, stickered as \\"remastered by Johnny Marr\\" from the Box Set. Marr of course is among the greatest of Gen X indie guitarists, and one assumes he would not purposefully preside over a shoddy remastering of his best work.<br /><br />I grew up with The Smiths, own all the studio albums including Morrissey's solo ones, and in particular I draw attention to the hugely underrated \\"Beethoven was Deaf\\" live album recorded in Paris in 1992 by Morrissey, where he sounds invigorated and emboldened by the rock music attack of 'Your Arsenal'.<br /><br />I'm not sure why fans are so keen on this live album. It would be great to have a Smiths live album proper which even approaches Morrissey's Live at Earls Court, let alone Beethoven was Deaf. Hatful of Hollow has the Peel Sessions, which are live in studio which is great but hasn't the atmosphere of a  live audience concert.<br /><br />Morrissey's antipathy towards his band members may be in evidence here. Sounds to me like implosion time. Morrissey vocals are lacklustre, as is the production, and the remastering has somehow dampened the sound as I recall it from an LP I once had (and now I remember why I discarded it). Of course the songs are unimpeachable, hence I could never resort to less than three stars, but really its sad that the best Smiths live is actually just Morrissey holding the candle in his solo concerts, particularly when Marr was really the chief driving force behind the band.
B000IMKDPC|4.0|I don't remember if I saw this before but I wanted to see it and so I purchased/rented it on my amazon kindle fire. I have enjoyed watching movies on my kindle fire and I think for this movie I had maybe one or two breaks but the rest was continuous.
B007Q2N0HA|1.0|I purchased this book afetr reading many of the very positive reviews - and I am so<br />sorry that I did I have read badly written books, books where I did not like the<br />content but that is life. But I am sorry to say this book I found boring, repetative<br />and a never repeat purchase from this author nor could I ever vouch for it to anyone else.
0345803507|1.0|This book is just so bad I can't even put it into words.  I was really excited to read the series based on the fact that many libraries were banning it, I thought it HAD to be good!  Nope, they probably banned it for horrible writing and not the \\"kinky sex\\" which really isn't so kinky.<br />I'm half way book 3 and stopped to write this review after finding myself literally skipping pages and pages of repetitive crap to get to some type of plot.  Ana has to be the single most annoying female character of all time, saying she's bipolar doesn't even cover it.<br />Seriously don't waste your money on this series, borrow it or wait for the lifetime movie.
0767802659|5.0|Nothing else to say. One of my favorite Sci-Fi films.Action packed and lots of fun to watch.DVD looks great.I had to have this one in my collection and amazon sure makes it easy to spend your money.Great price.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|There are definitely not enough words to describe The Book Thief.  This book is absolutely phenomenal!!!  Each word seems to be very delicately placed and if flows so nicely.  It is the most fantastic book I have ever read.<br /><br />The Book Thief is about a young girl, Liesel.  She grows up during the rough times during the Holocaust.  Some parts in the story that stood out to me were (WARNING contains a few spoilers!):<br /><br />~when Liesel wakes up from her nightmares and her foster Papa, Hans Hubermann, is always there ready to comfort her and to teach her how to read<br />~when Hans plays the accordion for Liesel<br />~when Liesel reads to the Jewish man, Max, while he is sick and unconscious<br />~when Liesel's foster mama, Rosa Hubermann, comes to Liesel school to tell her Max has woken up<br />~when Liesel finds Rosa asleep with Hans' accordion strapped to herself when Hans goes to war<br />~when Liesel gives encouragment to Max as he heads to Dachau<br />~Liesel and Rudy's first and last kiss =(<br />~Liesel and Max are reunited<br /><br />As you can see there are lots of things that I thought was really memorable about the book and, believe me, there are tons more!  This book is definitely worth the money as it is a cleverly written story and it is life changing.  I know for sure that The Book Thief has forever made it's imprint on my heart and mind.

B003O86FMW|4.0|I really enjoyed this book as well as the first (Hunger Games). There was such as sense of relief when Katniss and Peta made it out of the arena alive. And then, pow! They have to go back, and this time with tributes from past Hunger Games. My husband was exactly right (he read the trilogy as well), you won't be able to put the book down and will want to jump right into the third and final book, \\"Mockingjay.\\"
B005OU58HG|5.0|i love this tv show it is grose but nice it can be sad when people die but my fav. charector is katarina
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I had just finished reading \\"Anna Karenina,\\" so I was hoping for something entertaining and not too deep. This was exactly that. The characters were engaging, the action was fast paced, and if a reader engages in any intellectual reflection, he's over-reading. It's just fun.
0156030306|4.0|Flowers for Algernon, by Daniel Keyes is one of the most touching and interesting stories I've read in a while.  The plot follows Charlie Gordon, a mentally retarded man in his thirties, as he goes through a scientific experiment to improve his IQ.<br />This book is interesting because it is written (in the first person) as Charlie's journal entries; it even includes his horrible spelling and grammar like he is actually the one writing the book.  However, sometimes his spelling is so atrocious that I get headaches and have trouble focusing while reading because it is so difficult! After Charlie's brain surgery, his spelling and grammar progressively improve.  For me, watching his writing abilities and mental capacity progress is very amazing.  I was even moved to tears at certain parts of the book such as when Charlie starts to realize that not everyone is as nice to him as he thought; he realizes that he was being made fun of by others for all of his life.<br />Although there are many parts of the book that are very intriguing, other parts of the book are extremely boring and tedious to read. Charlie sometimes goes into tremendous detail about certain things that aren't even related to the storyline.  These boring phases happen very often throughout the story, especially towards the end of the book.  The book is a series of high and low points of excitement and boredom; sometimes the boring phases lasted just a little too long.<br />Despite the boring phases, I think this book is a classic.  I loved it because the whole idea of the story and the point of view from which it was written is just so surreal and intriguing.  It is very interesting to see the world from Charlie's point of view, even when he becomes very smart; he gets into so many situations that would never happen to an average person.  For example, he wants to visit his parents, but he doesn't know how to come back into their lives when they will be so surprised that he is now intelligent.  These problems aren't very common for most people, so it was very fascinating.<br />Although there were some boring parts in the book, I definitely recommend it because it is intriguing and VERY touching.  The boring phases of the book are worth it for the exciting high points.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Very attractive from app to maps.  Only problem was freezing up if enlarging map and trying to activate the radar.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|I avoided reading this trilogy because it was labeled \\"young adult\\".  When my 50 yr old brother told me he was in the middle of the second book, and was really enjoying it, I decided to give it a try. I was blown away by the first book!  I read almost the entire trilogy on Mother's Day weekend, with about half of the last book left.<br /><br />I went from absolutely loving the characters, the story lines, and the way the books made me think...I couldn't help but draw some similarities with our world today...to feeling totally betrayed by the author.  I have never seen an author sell out the way I felt Collins did.  Was she on that much of a deadline?  Was she personally tired of the storyline, the characters that she tossed them to the wind the way she did?  It wasn't about the romance for me...I loved both Gale and Peeta for different reasons, and could see her with either.  The person Katniss became at the end however, was not who Collins led us to believe she was throughout the rest of the books.  It almost felt as if Collins just wanted to be done, so she decimated every character we had grown to love.  Too much was left with no closure, and what was explained was unsatisfactory and left me wondering why?  What a waste of one of the best stories I have read in a long time.  I gave this 3 stars because the first 2 1/2 books kept me riveted.  Unfortunately, the ending ruined the entire series for me.
0385534639|5.0|For once, I had not read any of the reviews or heard any of the hype, I just happened to see the book at a bookstore when I was out of town one day and it caught my eye. I am so glad it did. It was a wonderful book and I loved every word of it! The whole time I was reading it I just kept thinking how perfect it would be to make it into a movie due to the excellent mental pictures I was able to discern from the text. It has a little bit of everything in it: action, adventure, romance... Several other reviewers commented that the story was magical and I would have to agree. There was something about this book that caught my attention and never let it go. It can be a little hard to follow at times due to the jumping between times and character perspectives but the author does this for good reason, so just stick with it and you'll understand why by the end of the book.<br /><br />On a personal note, I am currently working on my degree in English rhetoric and literature and so I am constantly reading books, and have been my whole life. This book has now made it into my top 10 - a feat for me, indeed! I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone. I am already suggesting it to my book clubs and several professor friends of mine as a novel to be studied in their literature classes! It is truly an excellent read worthy of all the praise it has received!
B007SSDS24|4.0|Xciting movie but hated ending. They just ran away. No answers , no winners or losers. Movie was ok but not good enough for sequel. The ending was just setup for Kick Human Ass Part 2
B004LWZW9C|4.0|Good, fun romantic comedy.  Part of the enjoyment for me was watching to see all of the familiar actors that show up in the film.  Some complain that the film is cheesy or predictable; however it had enough variety with several story lines to keep the film interesting. It was also fun to see how all of the characters' stories crossed or overlapped with each other.  Songs performed by Jon Bon Jovi and Lea Michele added to the film's overall feel.  Overly sentimental? Perhaps.  Good date movie? Definitely!
B005LAIIRQ|3.0|Generally, I love any movie with survival against the odds as a theme and that goes double for any movie starring Liam Neeson. On the good side, this is a gripping, even wrenching story of a plane crash in the vast wilderness of Alaska and the attempts by the survivors to keep alive after the crash. Not too bad for the setting of the scene, the plane crash itself (though a whole lot more drawn out than in real life, which would be milliseconds, not the minute or so it takes on screen). The settings are excellent and you can almost feel the cold and the shock as the survivors take stock and first realize that their struggle has entered into a new phase, thanks to the entry of a lot of particularly ferocious and aggressive wolves. At this point, the Liam Neeson character takes charge and the living and remarkably uninjured crash survivors follow him on a trek into the wilderness for survival. Or not.<br /><br />Not a good move. If you are unfortunate enough to be in a plane crash in a remote area but fortunate enough to survive and there is enough remaining wreckage available, stay with the wreck! That's what people will be searching for, it will shelter you somewhat from the elements and if you have the particularly bad luck to land in the middle of carnivores as these people did, the wreckage makes a dandy fortress with a little adjustment. You would need food and fuel for fires and certainly any efforts to enhance visibilty for searchers would be useful but moving further into the wilderness would be, well, fatally stupid. Cannot fathom why the writers had Liam rejecting the rifle because it had a broken stock - it could still have been fired, a nice thing if wolves are an issue (was he worried about its resale value?) or why they never thought of the usefulness of the metal in the wreckage for spearpoints or to fabricate bows/arrows for close-in defense. They never seemed notice that they would be traveling over deep snow, so nobody tried to make snowshoes or skiis or even a sledge for dragging gear. Despite the characters' rough-and-ready image, they never seemed to figure out what conditions they would have to deal with and overcome them. In the end, all they did was give the wolves a bit more fun while wearing all of the humans out.<br /><br />I would guess that the point of the movie really was the futility of fate and maybe to be more selective of which leader to follow when you find yourself in extremis..

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wow! I'm completely speechless. I gave up three nights of good sleep to finish this book. I don't think this author really needs any more positive reviews, but I just wanted to thank him for such an awesome reading experience. I will be thinking about Wool and all of its characters for a long time. I can't wait to read whatever else Hugh Howey has written.
0240810961|5.0|If you are looking to be a better artist, illustrator, animator, cartoonist, Graphic Novel-ist, GET THESE BOOKS. They are not \\"How to\\" books but books that teach basic principles, and rules that make a good drawing an even better drawing. I even applied some of the techniques to my oil painting such as \\"squash and stretch\\" and it helped out. These principles are not just for animation but for illustration in general.<br /><br />My teacher at AAU in San Francisco, CA worked with Walt Stanchfield and took over teaching his Quick Studies class when he couldn't do it anymore, she would always refer to these books The principles are not \\"Walt's\\" but industry standards/principles that he learned over the years, took the time to write down, and teach other people.<br /><br />Hey if it's good enough for the people that brought you Cinderalla, Snow White, Bambi, Sleeping Beauty, The Rescuers, etc. then it should be good enough. All these principles are in use today by all the big studios and small studios alike.<br /><br />***Update 12/29/2014***<br />Still have these books in my library and constantly refer to them. I am getting into storyboards professionally and these books are always helpful. Again they are INDUSTRY STANDARD PRINICPLES that all animation and art studios use and that are taught in major schools such as Academy of Art University, Cal Arts (in so cal). If you are trying to make your drawing better and more appealing get these books, read them, and put the principles into practice. Volumes 1 and 2 cost about 80-90 dollars and a class at AAU in SF costs about $2500, and they will teach you these principles. Save money and get ahead of the curve. These \\"rules\\" are so important that they are mentioned in all animation classes and are the foundation for any good illustration.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Like many others that have posted reviews for this book, it is my first amazon book review.<br /><br />Firstly, I always view books that have only 5 star ratings with high skepticism because no matter how good a product is, there is always someone that will have issue with it. After reading the reviews I decided that the reviews looked legitimate and at $1.50 there was not much to lose. After reading the book I will say this: Blood Song absolutely deserves the 5 star rating that is has obtained. It was an exciting epic fantasy that kept you engaged and immersed the entire time.<br /><br />The first night that I had this book, I knew I needed sleep and forced myself to stop reading after the first couple of chapters, at which point I was already fully engaged and wanting only to read until there were no pages left to turn. However, on the second night I lost all sense of discipline, resuming the story at 11 PM and not stopping until I was through, just after 5AM. I have read many books in this genre and this is in a league with very view others and by far cheaper than any of the novels I would consider its equals.<br /><br />I enjoyed that while this was a story of the protagonist growing and becoming a man of legend, it was not and did not have the feel of a repeat of the story told a thousand times in the genre (young boy with good heart becomes most powerful magic user/warrior/etc. in centuries and banishes all evil). The story was very mature and dealt with subject matter that makes the reader think. There are many well built, complex characters and the world building is fantastic.<br /><br />The bottom line is that if the second book is as good as the first, I would gladly pay 10 times as much as I did for this book, which is not something I have ever said of another novel.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I can't describe how good this book is. I want to preface this review with the fact that I listened to it on audiobook, and didn't want to get out of my car.  I would find my hour-long commutes too short and would look for any excuse to jump in my car to run an errand.  I even considered purchasing the kindle version because I was so eager to continue reading.  However, this eagerness began once we got into the meat of the story (Jacob's trial).  Because the book is written in first-person, you get into the mind of Andy Barber, Jacob's father.  Sometimes his thought processes are a little long and they seem to drag.  I may have had more a problem with it if I was actually reading the book versus listening to it.  Thankfully, the trail starts fairly early on and after that point, I didn't mind Andy Barber's thoughts.<br /><br />The best parts of the book are the author's attention to detail -- he obviously must have done a great deal of research to make it feel like you were actually sitting in the courtroom at trial.  Also, when he described the character's changing appearances (namely Jacob's mother) you could actually visualize them.  It all felt real to me.  The second best part was the unknown.  Throughout the entire trial, I found myself going back and forth on whether or not I believed Jacob was guilty.  I would go home with this thought and muse over it.<br /><br />While I don't think I am giving away any spoilers, don't read ahead if you don't want any hints about the ending.  This novel contains FOUR shocking twists. Each one was executed perfectly.  I was so busy focused on Jacob's trial that I didn't even see them coming; the author artistically and skillfully pulled the weave over my eyes so that I felt I had been sacked by each one.  A good novel has one, a great novel has two, but a perfect novel can execute more than two and actually pull them off.  Well done Mr. Landay!

0062082353|2.0|This book lends a great insight into the mind of a US solder in Iraq, including open bigotry against the Iraqi people in general and the need to label the ALL the combatants he killed \\"evil\\". And here he is, part of an unsanctioned war for oil and the destruction of weapons of mass destruction that were never found. I am sure there were terrorists in Iraq, but also patriots and religious purists who didn't care for foreign armies trampling their land, breaking down the doors to their homes and committing atrocities in Abu Graib and other places.<br /><br />The author mentions the highly decorated Vietnam sniper Carlos Hathcock in this book. Carlos never reveled or enjoyed the act of killing, unlike our author here as he clearly states. In one part of the book, the author argued for permission to shoot any Iraqi riding on a moped around an area of operation because he suspected they MUST be enemy observers. But then again who cares, he would only be killing Muslim Arabs, right?
B007WV05GY|3.0|This movie comes within a hair's breadth of a two star rating; only Liam Neeson's work as Ottway pulls it out.  There's so much wrong here it's hard to not to make a laundry list.<br /><br />As a reviewer elsewhere noted, this movie is a sort of meditation on death and God.  As these big wolves kill again and again (and get killed themselves in a couple of instances), the despair of the men grows as does anger against God for allowing this carnage.  Ottway collects the wallets of the dead, and it becomes clear to the movie viewer that these rough, profane men at the edge of the world are nonetheless linked to civilization through their families.  Their wives' and childrens' pictures are in those wallets, save for troublemaker Diaz's.  In its own way this movie is almost religious about serious matters of life, God, family, death, things we hang on to or think about ultimately.<br /><br />But oy veh.  A troubled Ottway, wolf-killer hired by the oil company to protect its workers, early on sets out to kill himself.  He sticks his rifle's barrel into his mouth but is distracted at the last moment.  But this is northern Alaska in bitterly cold weather: why didn't his mouth freeze to the gun barrel like a kid's tongue to a flag pole?  Stranger yet, his ammo is shown to be shotgun shells, which feature before the ill-fated airplane flight and during the desperate fight against the wolves after the crash.  But he has a rifle, not a shotgun!  (In passing, his rifle was aboard the aircraft but destroyed in the crash.)  Speaking of shotgun shells, Ottway rigs them up to spears made of saplings to go off when rammed against a wolf.  Truth is, without a barrel to channel the explosive gases, the worst the shell would do is sting the wolf, not kill it.  (Such testing of shells and cartridges shows that they barely penetrate nearby cardboard when ignited in the open.)<br /><br />Still, the device is successfully used once, and then all those sharp spears and shells the other menhad mysteriously vanish.  Absolutely senseless movie-making.<br /><br />Now, an airliner crash would have dozens of families alerted, aircraft everywhere searching for the wreck and survivors, and oil company searchers on the loose.  Yet somehow the crash survivors convince themselves that no one will come looking, or care, or if one does he'd never find them, despite the massive wreckage being right out in the open in a huge clearing.  I know that without this conceit there wouldn't be a movie at all, but there must be another way to strand them without comical assumptions that the world wouldn't even bother looking for them.<br /><br />Other Amazon reviewers note this, so let me just add my agreement: How dumb can you be to leave the plane wreckage behind, which is shelter, clothing, fuel, and at least some food and drink not to mention a huge landmark for searchers to see, to set out across a shelterless plain toward a shelterless tree line with proven killer wolves around?  In this instance a pretty good movie could have been made about these men improvising a defense in the plane's remains against these wolves, it seems to me.<br /><br />For as cold as it was supposed to be, there was a frequent lack of vapor from breathing, much like in the better movie \\"The Edge.\\"  From personal experience I can assure the reader that temperatures that cold would not have you lounging around a small campfire with your gloves off or sleeping comfortably under one blanket.<br /><br />For those who care, the F bomb is used a couple of hundred times in the movie as noun, verb, present participle, intensifier, adjective, adverb, interjection, and all-purpose space filler.  Even these days most people don't talk like that.  It's time for moviemakers to be a little more creative in their oaths.  How about, say, \\"cursed Satan spawn\\" or \\"damnable colon-formed wolves\\"?<br /><br />Well.  You'll have to decide for yourself if the ending was satisfactory.  The \\"neat resolutionist\\" in me didn't care much for it, but it does fit in well with the general ambiguity of the movie, nothing being certain but death and taxes.  Or is there something else beyond those?  Are those figures who come for or comfort their dying men just hallucinations, or something more divine?
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|...I was born in 1976, and it is like this book was written just for me.  Everything old and forgotten is new again.  My childhood is back and fresh again on these pages - and now the keys to unlocking the biggest mystery of all time.  I cannot recommend this book more strongly.  I consider myself an extremely well-read person.  This is obviously not Chaucer.  But sometimes things should just take you on a thrill ride, and this does... an immensely personal one, to an entire generation.  They say that you can never go home again.  Ready Player One defies that, if only for a little while.

B005D6O1FQ|5.0|Aesthetically, these shoes are great! I never leave the house in them that I don't get a compliment or someone asking me where I got them. They would make anyone's feet look dainty and cute.<br /><br />As for support, they have about as much support and structure as any Croc shoe; don't expect a ton of it. But I will say that I have high arches and these shoes are still very comfortable for me.<br /><br />Size: I normally wear a 7, but I got these in a 6, and they fit perfectly. I generally have to size Crocs down, but since these are ballet flats I thought it might be different; nope. I recommend sizing down.
B0070Z4M4I|3.0|My real-time review of The Thing (2011 prequel).  Spoilers abound.<br /><br />I saw this movie on Blu-Ray shortly after it first came out and while I thought it was OK, it was nowhere close to the 1984 version in plot, acting, or effects.  I feel most of the problems had to do with the big budget and politics.<br />The movie opens with a team of 3 Norwegians traveling through the Antarctic in some type of ATV.  Two tell a dirty joke while the other watches a radar/sonar screen.  For some reason, there is an unusually long pause after the admittedly funny joke is told before the other guy laughs.  Why?  Is he internally translating?  Are we supposed to think he, or Norwegians in generally, are dim?  Anyways, the guy looking at the screen suddenly says “We’re right on top of it”.  How does he know?  Did they continue going forward until the signal got smaller, then put it in reverse until the signal was at max amplitude? What about left and right?  This wasn’t shown.  Suddenly, and Hollywood dramatically, the ice cracks and the ATV falls into a void.  Wedged perfectly between ice sheets, the ATV’s headlights point perfectly at what appears to be a ship buried in the ice.  This was a little too dramatic already.  Couldn’t they just have found it on the radar, and then dug for it?  The 1984 version did not dramatize normal actions like this, and that’s the problem with big budget movies made by committee consensus.  Someone said “Make the ATV fall in, it will be more exciting!”, and they won the argument.  I want to know how the crew got out.  How they got back to base camp.  They are in the middle of the Antarctic, where every minute is a struggle to survive the inhospitability of a hellish environment.  I don’t think they understand this in Hollywood where it is sunny and 70 every day of the year.<br />Cut to the vintage style “The Thing” title screen.<br />Kate Lloyd (wow what an easy name, funny how nobody has ridiculous names in movies unlike the real world) is a scientist studying a 25,000 year old frozen bear.  In walks some Norwegian guy who wants to hire her as the paleontologist to investigate what’s obviously been found at the Norwegian camp in Antarctica.  Of course she accepts because the movie couldn’t continue otherwise.  OK so I have to ask, in 1984 how many paleontologists were women?  What was the likelihood of Kate being chosen?  It seems this decision was made more due to the success of Ripley in Alien(s) than any likelihood in reality, and also to help secure a female viewer demographic.  But Ripley was more believable because it was the future.<br />So now they are in Antarctica in a helicopter flying to the Norwegian camp.  The chopper seems to be full of Americans.  The pilot is some black guy.  Was this common in 1982?  Was the average chopper pilot black in 1982?  Everybody is chummy with each other.  Revisionism at its finest.  The co-pilot tells Kate she needs to be quick because a storm is coming and she doesn’t want to be cooped up for days with a bunch of Norwegian guys.  Why not?  Would a bunch of American guys be any better?  I guess I do not get what he is talking about.  Maybe he wants her for himself?<br />They arrive at the Norwegian camp and immediately jump in a Snow Cat (ATV) and head to the crash site.  No sitting down for some coffee and meeting the team.  And how did they get the Snow Cat out of the crater?  Anyways, after about 10 seconds of driving they reach the crater.  Did they move camp to the crater site?  I guess so.  I bet that was a lot of work.<br />Inside the cave introductions are made, and surprisingly there is another female on the Norwegian team.  How in the world did the original movie have ZERO women?  Hint: this was typical in the military and exploratory missions such as this, but revisionism will tell a different story.  It is also far to well lit (blue glow) in these caves.  It would have been better if it was darker with more shadows.OMG they just said Kate flew 10,000 miles.  She probably needs some sleep.  Now they reach the ship in a large cavern.  It does not appear to be dug out, but there is a large void above the ship.  Why?  Wouldn’t it have been slowly covered by snow and ice over thousands of years and been basically in a big block of ice?  The first movie showed the Norwegians having to use thermite charges to blast the ice to dig it out.  Now it sits in a tidy underground cave.  Now off to see the “survivor” of the crash, so they go out of the cave to the surface and look down through translucent ice to see the creature about 2’ below the surface.  WHY??  Why wouldn’t it be buried below 100’ of ice, just like the ship was in the 1982 movie?  Why does the ice in that very spot just so happen to be almost perfectly transparent?  For drama!  To make it easy!  So Kate tells the crew it’ll take a half day to dig it out.<br />Now we are inside the Norwegian camp and Kate is introduced to the whole crew.  These Sweeds, I mean Norwegians, are pretty stereotypical.  Remember the great and varied (and REALISTIC) characters in the 1982 version?  Well, all these guys are bearded scruffy lumberjacks.  Nobody seems very shocked about finding alien life.  These characters are acting like corporate or institutional robots.  They are not expressing feeling.<br />As they drive a couple Snow Cats back to the crash site, they pass the black pilot and a couple other guys from the original chopper just hanging around outside (in Antarctica, remember) drinking coffee.  I’m not sure if they are American or not.  If they are Norwegian, was there a lot of black pilots in Norway in 1982?  Now we cut to Kate and company in a room with a big chunk of ice containing the creature.  There is an altercation between the Leader and Kate about taking a tissue sample of the creature before defrosting him, which Kate is against.  In private the Leader tells Kate not to contradict him and that she is there just to get it safely out of the ice.  So I guess he’s supposed to be the bad guy because he hurt her feelings.  Also ominous music played as she stared at him speechless.  After a crappy job drilling, they bring up what appears to be a small but not frozen sample of tissue.  It seemed wet and squishy.  Why wouldn’t it be frozen the same as ice?  It was ice.  It was in ice.  Hollywood people don’t know about ice.  Now the whole crew is in the break room partying since Leader has told them that the sample’s cell structure is unlike anything he’s ever seen and they will all be famous for thousands of years.  Oh, also, the ice block is rapidly melting in the other room with nobody watching.  The co-pilot obviously has a crush on Kate.  Unlike the Americans, who had radios and TVs, I guess the Norwegians have to sing their own songs.<br />Black guy gets done taking a dump and his black intuition suddenly tells him he needs to check on the block of ice, alone.  After some drunk Norwegian scares him (and us) with a surprise “BOO!”, the alien suddenly jumps straight out of the block of ice and through the ceiling in about 1.5 seconds.  So he runs into the party room and tells everyone, and after initially thinking he is joking they see that he is for real and gather around the now empty block of ice.  OK I know this thing is an alien but I have a hard time believing that something frozen can move that fast, or move at all really.  And how did it know what way was up, or what was happening, or what to do?  Why couldn’t they have slowly defrosted it like they probably planned, and then it woke up and started its killing/hiding methods?  That’s what should have happened.  Another Hollywood moment!<br />Now the Leader has them searching for it in groups of 2 or 3.  They find one of the dogs has been eaten, or whatever.  As I look at the groups walk through the once again well-lit bluish snow and ice, I can’t help but wonder if this movie would have workedbetter if filmed from 1st person.  I think maybe.  Two guys are checking out some noise from a basement window, and we get our first sad CGI kill of the movie.  The alien shoots a terribly rendered CGI tentacle spear through the chest of some Norwegian, which then extends hooks and drags him back to be assimilated.  The whole team runs over to find the creature is now huge, and after shooting it with some pistols it climbs up the inside of the shack.  They throw gas cans under it and light the whole thing on fire with a flare.  After it seems to poop out the guy it just ate, they put the structure fire out with a couple CO2 extinguishers.<br />Next scene everyone is all sad in the main building.  The Leader says they need to get the remains and study it.  The co-pilot says they should destroy it and they are flying one of the Norwegians who is in shock to a medical base in the morning.  Now they are dissecting the creature in a scene that is very much like one from the 1982 movie.  What is missing is the nauseating smell when they open the creature up, which in the 1982 movie almost made everyone gag.  Kate examines a sample under a microscope to find un-surprisingly that “these cells aren’t dead”.  They show a too-perfect clip of cells attacking other cells.  If you have ever looked at things under a microscope, you will know that this clip was too smooth and made-for-TV.  Instead of immediately telling everyone that the alien is not dead, she just says goodbye to the co-pilot and the “sick” guy.  In the bathroom she finds bloody tooth fillings on the floor, plus a shower full of blood, and realizes someone is the creature.  Probably sick guy.  In the air we see it isn’t sick guy, but some other dude who suddenly turns into the creature and crashes the chopper, killing sick guy, black pilot, and co-pilot. It would have been nice to see more of the struggle aboard the chopper, but we only see the creature attack sick guy.  Why couldn’t the pilot land while it was eating sick guy?<br />Cut to a guy trying to make contact with anyone via the radio.  Of course he can’t get anyone because of the incoming storm.  Coincidence… I guess.  The American camp is not very far away.  The remaining crew wonder how and why the chopper crashed, and for some reason Kate is not telling them.  OK now Kate is telling everyone what she suspects, and they don’t believe her.  For some reason she doesn’t have everyone look in the microscope to see what she saw.  And for some reason everyone hasn’t already done so themselves.  They are all scientists!  I’m not a scientist and I’d have already taken a look under a microscope!  Someone has cleaned up the bloody mess in the shower so one of them is an imposter.  But nobody believes her logical story, and that is crappy writing and characters.  The other female is the only one who believes her, and shows her where the keys to the vehicles are stored.  Oh wait!  She’s the creature!  Really horrendous CGI again.  HOLLYWOOD, LISTEN!  STOP USING CGI!  IT ALWAYS LOOKS TERRIBLE AND FAKE!  Kate miraculously gets away but the creature kills some blonde guy.  Out jumps some dude with a flame thrower (are these standard issue in the Antarctic?  Do they use them to melt ice?) and “kills” the creature.  So far the creatures have generally looked the same as in the 1984 version.  That’s a bummer, because the cool thing in that movie was they never looked the same in any 2 scenes.  And they burn the remains in the snow using kerosene just like in the 1982 version.  As they sit around the creature-fire warming up, they collect their thoughts.  They decide to isolate it and kill it, and also to do the same blood test they did in the 1982 movie.  Somehow Kate seems to be the leader now.  After they sabotage the vehicles, a gruff Norwegian named Lars shows Kate where they keep the grenades.  Suddenly the American pilot and co-pilot stagger into frame, and the Norwegians consider roastingthem but Kate convinces them to lock them up until the blood test is ready.  Kate’s words and actions at this point forward are almost exactly like McCready’s from the 1982 movie.  Someone set the lab on fire which ruined any chance of the blood test, but Kate figures out the Filling Test.  The creature can’t reproduce teeth fillings so if you have fillings you are not the creature.  Half the crew are PT (Perfect Teeth), including the Leader.  Lars and some red haired guy go outside to get the Americans from another building and to administer the test on them.  This was a bad idea, as it left only Kate and 1 other non-creature guarding 4 possible creatures.  Stupid.  Should have tied them up.  Lars and buddy find the Americans are gone, with a big hole in their room.  Obviously they are creatures too.  Lars goes to hunt them down but is attacked.  The 4 possible creatures are getting aggressive and suddenly there is a bang on the door.  Kate lets in the red haired dude who says Lars is dead.  There is a crash and they all go to investigate.  It is the American’s, who have Lar’s flame thrower.  There is a flamethrower vs flamethrower standoff, but then the black pilot shoots the Norwegian flamethrower human in the head.  Dead dude’s flamethrower blows up and one Norwegian gets knocked out.  Everyone is gathered in the rec room.  Knocked out guy’s arms comes off and attacks the red hair guy.  Co-pilot is having problems with his flamethrower exactly like they had problems in the 1982 movie.  Is this typical of famethrowers?  Some guy gets stabbed by a long, too fast, and crappy CGI tentacle from knocked-out guy.  Black pilot shoots it but also gets stabbed.  This thing stabbed through a pool table.  Really?  Slate?  The creature melds with a couple of the dead and runs out of the room.  Kate straps on the flamethrower and gets it working, but forgets how to walk or run so the creature gets away.  She does manage to burn up poor red haired guy.  Black guy dies of his wounds.  Kate burns him up too.  OK now we see Kate and the co-pilot standing in the hallway with a raging inferno right behind them, and they are casually talking like no big deal.  Not even shouting.  Perhaps the green screen wasn’t very motivating.  Somewhere in the building we see the creature killing the Leader guy.  Co-pilot and Kate are attacked by the arm creature but Kate lights it on fire.  2-headed creature busts through window and co-pilot runs away.  It follows him into the kitchen and he tries to hide.  OK here is something I don’t like about this movie.  It seemed to me that the creature is remaining in a “half-and-half” state too long.  It can imitate a million creatures on a million worlds, but it never seems to completely imitate anything except humans.  For it to run around in a half-modified state for so long seems wrong.  Why doesn’t it finish it’s change so it is a more effective killing machine?  Having to look through the 4-busted eyes of 2 human heads, upside down, seems like a dumb thing to do.  There are plenty of critters with better optical sensors than humans, including infa-red vision.  Anyways…<br /><br />Right as it finds Mr. Co-Pilot and is about to bull-charge him, Kate walks in and blasts it with the fire extinguisher.  Terrible CGI follows.  Suddenly they hear sound of a Snow Cat taking off and know it is the Leader, now a creature in human form, trying to escape.  Co-Pilot quickly splices some wires together to fix the “disabled” other Snow Cat and they pursue.  Not very well disabled if a 7-year old could fix it.  Some chit chat in the snow cat.  Kate has absolutely no emotion.  She talks in the same tone the entire movie.  Same facial expression.  Now we’re at the space ship, still in its tidy ice cave.  The creature entered but left the hatch open, and started ‘er up.  Good thing this ship uses 100,000 year Duracell batteries.  I wonder why it even crashed on Earth, since it seems to be fine.  Anyways, Kate falls into a ventilation shaft and Mr. Co-Pilot jumps down the hatch.  Kate, somehow not killed from falling so far, finds the “brain” of the ship, or something, but the Mr. Leader giant creature finds Kate but she jumps down a human sized tunnel that is in the ship for no good reason.  The creature grabs Kate out of the hole, but Kate throws a grenade into its mouth and blows it up and Mr. Co-Pilot arrives on the scene.  The explosion evidentally also takes out the ship’s brain because it loses power.  I notice snow is falling on the ship, and it no longer is in a cave but has apparently melted all the snow above it?  Kate and Mr. Co-Pilot exit the cave and decide to drive a Snow Cat 50 miles to a Russian station (it seemed the American station was close).  As they enter the vehicle, Kate notices that Mr. Co-Pilot no longer has his ear-ring, so is most likely a creature.  Kate tells him this and lights him up.  He makes the creature’s noise as he cooks, but I think they should have left that out.  Better to not be 100% that he indeed was a creature; I mean, he could have lost it.  This is something the 1982 movie got right, and this movie fails at.<br />Kate jumps in the other Snow Cat and then surprisingly the end credits starts flashing.<br />Spliced into the end credits are scenes of a helicopter later landing at the Norwegian camp, and Lars comes out of hiding armed with a semi-auto rifle.  Now, of all times, the dog from the beginning of the movie jumps out and runs away.  Lars tells the pilot that it isn’t a dog and they must get it.  They take off and Lars is shooting after the dog.  For a long time.  Isn’t their camp at least over 50 miles from the American camp?  I mean, the Russian camp was 50 miles away, and if the American camp was closer, why wouldn’t they want to go their instead (this was during the Cold War)?  They shot at the threw grenades at this “dog” for 50+ miles?  Hmmmm….  And why did the dog try to run away right as someone with a chopper got there, in front of both of them?  Why not the day before, when nobody was looking???  AND WHERE IS KATE???!  Some people say she froze to death, others say she drove to the Russian base, but why wouldn’t she just go back to the Norwegian base to meet up with Lars?<br />I give the move 3 stars.  It’s ok and I like how they tied it together with the next film almost perfectly.  The CGI as always is awful, but I’ve seen far worse.  The 1982 movie is a 5-star film.contact with anyone via the radio.  Of course he can’t get anyone because of the incoming storm.  Coincidence… I guess.  The American camp is not very far away.

B004LWZW9C|4.0|Can you say CHICK FLICK?  Well, since I am a chick I'm totally fine with that label!  :-)<br /><br />Ok, as you may have guessed this is a movie about many NYE stories in NYC and happy/romantic new year beginnings.  No big secrets or complicated plots on this one (and, sorry guys, nothing gets blown up) - just sit back and enjoy the ride.<br /><br />(A good one to have so you can watch it on NYE if you tend to celebrate at home in your jammies.)<br /><br />I thought it was charming and enjoyable, I teared up a little and smiled a little and have no complaints.  Stephanie Alexander sings twice (beautifully!) and her version of Auld Lang Syne is wonderful.<br /><br />Enjoy!

B007SYWFRM|3.0|This game is cute. I play it to help my 3 yr old advance. He likes to watch the characters walk around. I did have the &quot;exit&quot; issue, but quickly figured out how to get out. I also ran into the &quot;in-app purchace&quot; issue. I spoke to an Amazon Rep and they told me how to set up parental controls. My only current complaint is how many &quot;coins&quot; you have to spend the farther in the game you get. It takes DAYS to advance through 1 goal. Other than that it's a typical build and raise animals game.

B002GHIPYI|5.0|I recently bought 4 pairs of different headphones from Amazon, all under $50, based on moderate online research.<br /><br />These were the best (and second cheapest).<br /><br />The other headphones were:<br /><br />a) Shure 240 ($49 on Amazon): uncomfortable, distort.<br /><br />b) Beyerdynamic DT 235 ($43/white - $49/black on Amazon): good sound, less comfortable.<br /><br />c) Senheiser 202 ($26 on Amazaon): uncomfortable, distort.<br /><br />Music source:<br /><br />17 inch Macbookpro 2010 -> FiiE10 24bit DAC ($80 on Amazon) -> tube headphone amplifier.<br /><br />Reference headphones: Bose triports 2009.<br /><br />pros:<br /><br />1) very comfortable, completely cover the ear, with room to spare.<br /><br />2) great sound, comparable to my bose triports which cost 5x more.<br /><br />3) very sturdy cords and connectors, much better quality that the others.<br /><br />cons:<br /><br />1) these are large headphones (though they are very light).<br /><br />2) they are semi-open, so don't expect much sound isolation (though I haven't tested that).<br /><br />Conclusion: good sound quality, very, very comfortable, probably the best value under $50, very light, good quality connectors.

B005FDWIGQ|1.0|I love Breaking Bad! It is one of the best series ever. However I am not a native English speaker and subtitles (in english) greatly help me to understand everything. I watched first three seasons in Netflix WITH SUBTITLES. Guess what, I paid $20 for the 4th season in Amazon, but there is no subtitles.<br />I tried to reach out Amazon people, but I could not find anywhere to submit. Think twice before you purchase.
0307913147|2.0|Wow... I really tried to like this book. The problem was that the first person perspective became tiring quick and the 80s nostalgia and tech geek references were not just incessant but inserted in a sloppy manner. In addition the goal of science fiction is to imagine the evolution of current technology in the stories time period not just call it 2040 while lazily using todays tech references to nauseam like torrent, RPG, FPS etc. This all done in a very pandering way. There are many holes in the stories concepts too. Your sitting in an abandoned car with virtual reality gloves and a visor but how are you walking around? This could have a better book with competent writing but in the end it felt like the illegitamate child of an edition of PC Gamer and The Catcher in the Rye. Both great by themselves but together....
B005K0HDGE|4.0|With this book it was like King took me by the hand and said to me \\"let me tell you a story\\". I sat down and was taken on a trip through history. The characters are so well developed and the story just flows so effordlessly. The only tiny problem I had is keeping up with all the characters! Other than that I have to say BRAVO on another book well done.

You know what annoys me, are people like you who think they know it all but haven't even read the bible, but you know what it would probably be a waste of time for you because you wouldn't read the bible with your heart you would read it with just your 1 demensional-thinking brain.<br /><br />The reviewer Harvey Ardman below states:<br /><br />\\"The most annoying reviewers, from my point of view, are those whose remarks demonstrate they haven't read the book (such as the fellow who insists Einstein was a believer), or those who feel Dawkins doesn't have the Biblical knowledge to back up his conclusions.<br /><br />He doesn't need any Biblical knowledge. None of us do, when it comes to the question of belief. Memorizing the Bible neither adds nor subtracts from our ability to feel faith.<br /><br />And that's the bottom line for me. I am unable to accept an assertion of any kind supported by nothing more than faith. I need some kind of truth, some kind of evidence.\\"<br /><br />By the way, if Einstein didn't believe in God why would we have said this?:<br /><br />¡Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind.<br />¡When the solution is simple, God is answering<br />¡God does not play dice.<br /><br />And Jesus says this to the unbeliever:<br /><br />Jesus answered, \\"I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit\\". John 3:5<br /><br />Only fools say in their hearts, \\"There is no God.\\" They are corrupt, and their actions are evil; not one of them does good! Psalm 14:1<br /><br />\\"Why put your trust in man?  Hecan't even decide if an egg is good for you or not!  Why would you stake your very soul on what man says??????\\"  That's my quote to all you atheists!!!!!!!!!  TIME IS RUNNING OUT, RETURN TO GOD BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE!  HE LOVES YOU AND WANTS TO FORGIVE YOU!!!<br /><br />Go to tlig.org (True Life In God)
B006MW3V6U|5.0|So addicting, I spent a whole weekend watching Season 1 & 2.  Couldn't get enough.  A must see.  Superb acting, great costumes, setting and story line. Waiting impatiently for Season 3.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|its not the real Oregon trail; but its a fun game.  you will really like this if your into town building games
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|In general it's great and does what it says.  The stand works great and it protects the screen when I'm not using it.  I'd definitely buy it knowing what I know now.<br /><br />Minor issues:<br />-the cover can only be attached one direction because of the way the plug-in openings are arranged and some apps only come on the screen in one direction.  So, you can't use the stand for some videos.  I only really had this problem once, though.<br />-because of a bend in the cover, it leaves a faint smudgy line middle of the screen.  If you clean the screen regularly, this is not an issue, but otherwise it'll be mildly noticeable.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|When buying this add on for the kinect expected the worse, i was thinking positive when i ordered but on the first try the kinect does even see me at 2 or 3 feed away i have to be right infront on the camera in order to see me, when i did the calibration was showing good but on the dashboard, kinect adventures, ufc training, kinect sports and kinectnimals didnt work at all. i am really upset about amazon still selling this product when a lot of customer reviews say the same thing about having a lot of problems with this product.  I like to say its not about the money price of the product but just the way you are expecting something one from nikon. On the other hand the outside fan for xbox slim work percetly smooth keeping the hot air flowing out.  I will recomended..
B007MLDC2I|2.0|The first part of this film os nearly a shot for shot remake of the original.  The rest of the film strays only a little.  The truth is that this movie has no value.  Just watch the originalthos version adds basically nothing.<br />if u haven't seen the original then you may find this interesting little mystery movie.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|No spoilers, so read on. I had a little trepidation about this book before I started reading the series.  As a 30-something man I did not think I was the target audience (Now after reading I am sure I'm not the target audience) . However, I thoroughly enjoyed the series - book 2 in particular.  Well written with good character development.  Does suffer a little from 'dumb character syndrome' in places, but overall a very enttaining read.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|simple straight forward game. if you do not want to buy content,  then you have to be very patient. something to do with your hands while watching Tv.
0143116177|5.0|I got hooked on Ferguson when a friend recommended \\"Civilization: The West and the Rest.\\" I followed that up with the equally interesting \\"The War of the World,\\" and I recommend both. Next up was \\"The Ascent of Money.\\" It's very different from the others, but illuminating and I learned a great deal about how not only money, but stocks, bonds, credit, mortgages and other financial developments came to be--and the crucial role they play in civilization and our current standard of living. I also learned that a lot of the things that got us into trouble in 2008, credit default swaps, securitized mortgages and the like, are beyond me. And that our prosperity is not only beyond my control, but, frighteningly, apparently beyond the control of the supposed experts making the big decisions. I highly recommend this entertaining, well-written, informative and, alas, unsettling book.<br /><br />Robert A.

B007Q476KU|5.0|This was my first video on Kindle Fire.  I really enjoyed the movie.  What a remarkable horse.  The training was unbelievable and the movie was excellent.  I enjoyed being able to watch it at home without the extremely loud movie theater presentation.  I went back and watched it again.

6305047529|5.0|The problem facing the director of photography (Lee Garmes) and costume designer (Irene Sharaff) when designing this film was to transform Virginia Mayo's standard blonde sweet girl next door image into the larger than life figment of Walter Mitty's imagination. And later, when she enters his real world to turn the beauty factor one notch higher to the totally irresistible level.<br /><br />The images I've uploaded show how well they succeeded.  I can't think of any other \\"star\\" with a complexion as perfect as Virginia Mayo and maybe this is why attention is always drawn to her head not her body.  As can be seen by looking at some of her different personas she ably plays his ever faithful dream girl but looks even more enticing as a contemporary (40's) glamour girl.<br /><br />Of course it's great fun watching Kaye being bewitched during their first 3 encounters but Mayo's acting is also so effortless one hardly notices how well she plays her different characters. Best demonstrated when the Gaylord Mitty riverboat gambling dream quickly transitions into their second meeting outside his office where from being his besotted southern belle she morphs into modern seductress - instantly reversing the roles they played 2 minutes earlier.<br /><br />One incongruity I still find just as bemusing as when I first saw this movie in 1948 is where did Mayo change into her perfect ensembles if she's not living with her wicked uncle in the suburbs (of California)?  Did she even have a life of her own beyond always being available to play parts in Walter Mitty's dreams?<br /><br />Now I'm older the more relevant issue would be who'll figure in his dreams when they are married? Thankfully Hollywood and Jane Austen are not worried about matters connected to mundane reality.  Maybe it was purely accidental but only in the last \\"just-married\\" scene does Sharaff return Mayo to human-scale normality by giving her a strange half-white dress covered by an enormous black fox fur - which appears to be larger than her.<br /><br />Nevertheless Mayo's earlier resplendent images and one question remain - how many other Hollywood film stars have ever looked this irresistibly feminine - in glorious Technicolor - at any time in the last 67 years?ears to be larger than her.<br /><br />Nevertheless Mayo's earlier resplendent images and one question remain - how many other Hollywood film stars have ever looked this irresistibly feminine - in glorious Technicolor - at any time in the last 67 years?
