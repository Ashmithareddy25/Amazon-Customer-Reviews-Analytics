B00936A0RU|5.0|If you're looking for a ganster movie, this is not for you. It does have a great storyline and wonderful acting.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|This is a wonderful tribute to George.  Sure, he wasn't perfect, but who is?  Martin Scorcese  did a terrific job with this documentary.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Finally something different. I don't watch much TV, but after buying season 1 at Christmas, I'm hooked. Bought season 2 and downloaded season 3. I'm caught up and can't wait till Feb 10.
B00000I14Z|5.0|one of the best in bebop by one  of the stellar musicians or all time; important  and recommended for everybody to consider a  basic jazz library.
B005LAII80|5.0|Excellent movie that hopefully won't remain a cult classic. Looks great on dvd and even better in high-def. Go ahead and check it out, you won't regret it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think subway surfers is a very good game. I play it all the time when I have spare time. I give it a thumps up!!!
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I loved the read, although it could have been a little longer. One of the good things was that it surprised me - one of the bad things was that two situations in particular were slightly weak in the telling.
B009G78EE2|5.0|Great Album.  Very refreshing sound. Not limited to just Thrift shop.  Good through and through. \\"s*** it was 99 cents\\"
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|One of my favorite gameloft game's. But you do have to pay for the good things. Still a very fun game.
0425264386|3.0|I have never known so many characters in a story shrug so much, Jack Reacher being the worst. He should be called Jack Shrug. Plot not bad though and some exciting moments
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome awesome and awesome awesome reassessed it is like butter good good good good good good good good good good good good game
B0057B8PT0|5.0|My friend is living in England and recommended Olly to me. I took a chance by buying his album only hearing one of his songs but it is GREAT! It has been on repeat in my car for weeks now. The instrumentals used are incredible and the tune and lyrics are very &#34;pop-y.&#34; If you like any Top 40 music, you'll love Olly!

B005C9YZIW|5.0|My grandparents just got an HD tv and blu-ray player on my insistence.  I was under some pressure then to provide them with something pretty to watch in order to justify the purchase.  This was a self-imposed pressure.  I don't think there is a better-suited blu-ray set for the price for this purpose.  My grandparents ate it up.
B0049J3RBC|5.0|I always watch it! And it is very encouraging to kids and to adults also. Love the graphics, the music, the script, all of it!
B009713XY8|5.0|AWESOME DVD OF THE CAREER OF A VERY UNDERRATED BAND SAXON. THIS BAND WAS NEVER TRULY APPRECIATED IN THE UNITED STATES AS THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This game is good but they need more power ups and do u sireousley need to triple the price of a power up each time? Come on!
B0087JTAKW|1.0|Did not like writer's style. Thought content<br />obvious. Sounded much like a moral tale.<br />Perhaps would serve as the basis for a<br />religious sermon.
B008478VE8|5.0|A well constructed argument and interesting read in its own right. Should be required reading not only for biologists (which it's not) but for all students
015603252X|5.0|Amoz Oz is an excellent writer.<br />He wove his life story with the development of<br />the State of Israel. He often threaded and re threaded<br />people and happenings so that you understood how<br />they and he (the author) were responding the way the<br />did. An outstanding writer worthy of the many accolades<br />he has received.
B004ZA9HB4|1.0|It was too difficult to figure out how to make it work. It isn't user friendly at all. Don't want to take the time to figure it out!
B006FO3ERQ|1.0|I guess I'm missing the point with this book. The story goes nowhere, all the while in painstaking detail of completely irrelevant factions of the story. I kept waiting for something to happen beyond the publicized premise. It doesn't. It's also written oddly, in that it takes a while to get familiar with the authors grammar and sentence structure.
B007HO392S|5.0|i love this cd so much when i got it. it was  in excellent shape. also got it by the time you said i would.many thanks

1594744475|4.0|These recipes are so easy to follow, though you do need a few extra tools: egg molds, Nori punches, cookie cutters, exct. Fortunately, it goes step by step of everything you will need for each meal. Not only do the recipes cover a wide array of foods (Though rice is, of course, in the majority of them) They are actually healthy! The perfect thing to get even the pickiest kid to eat. I adore this book and my niece adores the tasty lunches she gets whenever she comes to visit.
B000VD5I94|5.0|this movie is an older one but is still a great movie, i highly recommend watching this one, i will definitley watch it again!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I love this series, even though there are way too many Characters, but who would you leave out.......none of them.  No more time for this must start reading Book 5.
B000OONQ9O|5.0|The Warriors is a movie you can watch over and over again and never get tired of it, it is in my top 10 list of best movies of all time!!
B00AF6B22E|5.0|Wow! What a movie! DEFINITELY NOT FOR KIDS (Honestly it deserves the R-rating for _all_ the usual reasons - drugs, nudity, and some accident-caused gory/disturbing imagery) but a film with clear (and often enough rather \\"hammer over the head\\" explicit) religious overtones:<br /><br />(1) Miracle working by the unworthy. Denzel Washington plays an excellent if arrogant/clearly troubled pilot;<br /><br />(2) God's will in the midst of tragedy.  There's a plane crash in the film in which some of the passengers clearly suffer a lot (and some die), while others suffer hardly at all.  How to make sense of that?; finally<br /><br />(3) Can even a \\"miracle worker\\" earn his/her \\"Salvation?\\" Can being \\"really good\\" at something (like being a \\"really good pilot...\\") really be \\"good enough\\" to excuse/justify one's conduct/failings in other aspects of life?<br /><br />For adults, especially of a religious bent, this makes for a GREAT FILM for some serious reflection ;-).
B007UXSPK2|3.0|I mean I liked it, but I think that is enough with mission impossible. I liked Tom Cruise in it he is pretty good in all his movies. For a typical action movie it was good. I would say you will still like the movie because the action was good and the story line was good. I would watch it again.
B00APUTEBG|2.0|Not exactly the best film of the year, but as a \\"B-Movie\\" of the tradition of the paranoid thrillers of 1940s-50s \\"Film Noir,\\" IMHO it's not bad. Costars among others Bruce Willis and Sigourney Weaver.
B0083GQ2A0|4.0|I like Liam Neeson movies I think is a very good actor and his action movies are always good. I like a movie were the character has flaws and other things troubling him. I never got bored with the movie it kept my attention because it shows the human spirit must survive no matter the cost. I like and ending where it leaves you guessing. Very interesting.
B009AMAM9S|5.0|Excellent if at times _ponderous_ film by the Chicago born and raised Wachowski siblings who previously brought us \\"The Matrix\\" movies ;-).  The story is composed of a series of vignettes spanning epochs of human history from \\"140 years after the Fall\\" to \\"140 years into the future.\\"  The central question being asked throughout the film is whether we are all brothers and sisters to each other or whether \\"the weak are meat so that the strong can eat?\\" It's a great if very, very fundamental question!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|The books by Suzanne Collins were fantastic. The three books were hard to put down, kept you very interested. If you enjoyed the movie try the books also and I think you will like them. It was more than an action movie it sent a message of how society can be cruel just for entertainment. I believe Jenifer Lawrence was the right pick for Katniss Everdeen because that is how I had her in my mind. Great movie can not wait till the second installment of it.
B008220BLG|4.0|A remarkably gentle, _completely_ PG-13 appropriate, \\"post apocalyptic love story\\" between a young zombie who can only remember that his name once began with \\"R\\" and a young human teenager/young adult named Julie with a \\"super overprotective dad\\" ;-). Such a cute story! I'm just in \\"aw[...]\\" ;-)
B0073PZIYI|3.0|I like science fiction movies and what could happen in the future. This movie made you feel how precious time really is, especially when it means life or death. Justin Timberlake was good in it. I liked it because of the science fiction and the concept. If you like them kind of movies then I think you will enjoy it.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|A lovely children's parable about exclusion, reconciliation and finding a way for moving forward. What if \\"monsters\\" were just as afraid of us as we have been of them? And what if our kids were no longer afraid of them anyway? A fascinating story ;-)
B007Q0OUNA|5.0|An addition to my grand son's collection.  He and his dad had fun and when they do Legos they're being creative and off the computer for awhile.  I recommend this collection.
B00AZMFO6I|3.0|A somewhat needlessly \\"idyllic\\" film about four former \\"operatic singers\\" living in at a lovely retirement home in England, who have to overcome past hurts/egos to sing (at a Benefit concert) together again. Still, even if economics aren't seriously part of the picture, coming to terms with growing old and fixing the relationships that need to be fixed isn't easy. And this is what the film is about...
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I was looking for another good series book and this was it....If you are looking for a good cry, it's a must read!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I absolutly love the show.  Everyone from the aristocratic family upstairs, to the hard working (some) downstairs..Everyone lives what we go though in life e/ or w/out a certain network of class.  Start from Season 1..Its a must see
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I could not put this book down, and I have a 2 year old! It took me one day to read it from cover to cover!!  Every second I could, I read this thing. The story line and characters were very well written.  It had so many twists and turns and was not at all predictable. At one point I gasped....READ THIS BOOK!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|A graphic novel about Greg heffly trying to get a girl for the Valentine's dance while he saves some cash
B009YN2M7S|5.0|I really enjoyed this book...at first, it was a little predictable, but once you got a few chapters in, the pace picked up and I didn't want to put it down.  I loved the characters, and Sparks does a great job making you feel as if you connect with them.  Hope the movie is as good as the book.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I made time to read the entire book once I started.  I went to the movie later and enjoyed it for different reasons, but was glad a read book first.
B0027GGL6W|4.0|Enjoyed it a lot; it's like Dreamgirls, but a bit depressing.<br /><br />The recording scenes were hilarious, because they were so technically off- performers moving around, singing into mics while holding them and dragging the microphone, no one has a popper stopper, no one wears earphones or sings into an over-head mic... I can see doing that for a few scenes for an emotional look, but after a while, it just got to be ridiculous.<br /><br />That being said, this thinly veiled account of Motown Records was pretty fascinating! I drooled over the classic cars and retro fashion. It was terrible how the performers suffered. You really felt for them. I'd definitely recommend it as a compliment to the Dreamgirls movie.
B005723JSQ|3.0|Another lighthearted, fun read by Sophie Kinsella. Exactly as we have come to expect. No big twists or turns in the plot, and fairly predictable, but definitely entertaining.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple run 2 is an awesome game!!! I rarely give 5 stars but this one definitely deserves it!! I strongly suggest downloading this app!
B000JMKTLO|4.0|this was excellent. i enjoyed the second novel a bit more but this one is quite excellent as well. Gillian Flynn is outstanding
B000HF6XV8|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies. I love nature and children and believe that exposure to either or both can actually help<br />heal one's pshche.
B0027MJU00|5.0|at times this novel made my skin practically crawl and that is what i loved about it. i found it difficult to put down.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Just love this book. Am nearing the end of it and will be sorry when I have finished it. That is all I have to say. Other readers may make what they will of the book. I am enjoying every single chapter. Wish it could go on forever.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is fun and intermediate if you want to play go for it!!!!! I  personally love the game!!! If you want any more help about this game I made a fan club
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game to cure boredom..<br />I love the horses and the way the game was made absolutely a good time
B008XG1X18|5.0|Best ever love every second I wish that I joined earlier to enjoy so much more. The recipes are the best I have tried lots and found them to be delish I have made three of my friends join so far. The app works good for I'm using through a kindle.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Josh Groban rocks my world, homes. I even love saying his surname slowly and sounding it out: Grow-Bahn. Yummo, as Rachael Ray would shout! I am probably the biggest Josh Groban fan in the entire universe, as evidenced by my devotion to his brand of womanly pop music that I've been listening to ever since 2003.<br /><br />You know what I just thought of on the spur of the moment, just now, without any premeditation at all, just like all of my reviews, which spring from the fertile valley of my brain organically? Groban has such a deep, succulent voice that he can easily pull off sounding like one of the Three Tenors. In fact, many times when I'm listening to Groban on my Sony Walkman, I am looking at myself in the mirror, lip-synching along, and pretending that I'm an opera singer. That's how much Joshie's opera-tenor voice has touched my soul.<br /><br />On All That Echoes, Joshie continues his mad, opera awesomeness. Take She Moved Through the Fair: Joshie thunders like Luciano Pavarotti on meth, crooning about how he loves to lust for and look at all women who visit the various county fairs across the U.S. of A! Or how about The Moon is a Harsh Mistress?! I swear that Joshie does his best impression of Michael Bolton doing an impression of the Three Tenors!! Holy...Toledo, Batman! Holy...Toledo!<br /><br />All That Echoes really echoes Joshie's magical voice that combines hardcore, devil-horn metal mastery with Celine Dion-ish pop sensibilities. The end result, you inquire? It's awesome, dawg. Absolutely awesome. I urge you to buy this CD, even if you have to sell some possessions to do so, seeing as how you are probably among the underemployed in this Obama economy, which is really a depression and nothing close to a recession!
B0038ZITIE|5.0|he's just a man. but with a man's courage. and when he's got Queen in his corner and the majority of the movie budget spent on costumes, it doesn't matter if he can save us all or not! i will never be ashamed of my Flash Gordon fan status! he's the savior of the universe :o)
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Fantastic journey through the development of an extraordinary mind.<br />Had to continue with the next book at once, and now I'm waiting eagerly for the third :)
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Nice Sturdy Case, I love the fact that it folds into a stand.  The elastic is nice and tight so when I shove my Kindle in my purse I have no worries.  Great product for a great price.
B004PGNB1K|5.0|Patrick Rothfuss sure knows how to get my attention and keep it for hours and hours.. Now that I have finished this books I probably can get some more sleep during the coming nights ;-)
B005OP2928|5.0|Modern family is the best comedy on TV today.  The characters are well played.  The situations they find themselves in are an exageration of everyday life.  The acting, writing, and directing is superb.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I'm from Spain, so I had this ordered from the states, as that is the only version worth having if you want extras, particularly the Whedon commentary. There is only one problem: though the Blu ray is ABC (plays on any blu ray player), the DVD is only R1.<br /><br />Anyway, if you are outside EEUU you get a great Blu-ray and an Avengers coaster for the same price :) (that is if you don't own a multi region DVD player, of course...)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing I love it so much the only thing is the personal adds love love love it
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This alarm clock is great. It wakes you up and it makes it difficult to fall asleep after it goes off...I have it on the hard option and need to solve multiple questions. And side note...my math has gotten better!
B002LRDWNW|5.0|The disc was in perfect physical condition. Shipped and received sooner than promised. Actual movie wasn't as suspenseful as when i first saw it as a teenager. but part of my favorite film collection now.
B006LSZECO|5.0|loved the story, never will guess what happens, not sure I like the ending, but that is the part that makes it hard to put down
B008SGMPVU|5.0|This is the best movie purchase I've made recently. This version is done very well. I had a pirated copy that I made from my pc to vcr for years. this is as good as it can get for this movie. I haven't watched the documentary yet looking forward to it. I live in Humboldt county California where another of John Carpenters films was made. Halloween 3 the season of the witch. The same music is used in that film and I've had lunch across the street from where the masks were made. cool. How do you Know you've really read this?<br />J
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have enjoyed this show so much and can't wait for more to come out!!! Highly recommend!!  I love it!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Great app and it does not require logging on to the internet to use so I will give it an A plus.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Great way to see so many episodes that you may have missed.  Definitely worth the investment, can't wait until the next season is available.
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|The controls are very hard to use and they did not always work as they should. The reaction time was off.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|Good story, great voices from talented, funny actors, and just long enough to hold my 9 year old's attention span!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Everyone in the family plays this one. We enjoy the free app. Just not sure if we want to download the full app just yet.
0765325950|5.0|I have been waiting for this book for a while and was very happy with how it turned out! I couldn't put it down! Nicely done!
B006YTTVHO|3.0|Common sense material, worth restating, but writing style was off<br />At least it was a quick read! --<br />Ok book
B00AYDC5HY|4.0|Lots of little references to past classics and the state of our current affairs. Love it when the foreign science teacher states in his country his plummer is a scientist, but in America we want what science brings but don't raise scientists.<br /><br />Entertaining and heartfelt.  I enjoyed the movie and my 7 year olds did too.
0451209338|5.0|I keep giving away my copies of this book, so this time I'm keeping it for my personal library! Keep'em coming Daniel.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Surprises and twists along the way. I really enjoyed getting pulled into Mr. Penumbra' s secret world. Worth the read
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Ok, so I get all the hype about the book, it's just not as \\"I can't put it down\\" that people make it seem. Don't get me wrong, a good book, but I guess maybe \\"it\\" is something you have to be into more? I'll still probably read the other two to see where the story goes... the only thing I don't really understand is that these characters were supposedly modeled after Bella/Edward-KStew/RPatt... I don't see the comparison except for the clumsiness (Bella) and dark, sexy side (Edward)... maybe I missed something?
B004LP3AYI|5.0|I've read all the books and would highly recommend this series to anyone looking for a fantastic journey you will get lost. You'll get so attached to the characters it will be hard to get any sleep because you'll want to know what happens to them chapter after chapter!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|However short, this book was great. It was more of a modern love story than most everything I have read and made it more relatable to life. It had some great juicy detail, I would recommend this to anyone!
0545123291|4.0|Linger was such a great sequel.  I think I like it a little better than Shiver, even.  In Shiver, I got annoyed with Sam's character quite a bit, but in Linger, there is a larger cast of characters and I really enjoyed how the story developed.<br /><br />I liked all of the characters in Linger.  Grace is such a fun character to read about; her personality is a great mixture of sweet and tough and her character just seems real.  I felt what she was going through.  And Cole and Isabel?  I love them so much.  Isabel was an okay character in Shiver, but she grew on me so much in Linger.  I felt so bad for Cole too.  He's a wonderfully complex character and I thought that his story fit into the plot very well.  Even Sam didn't bother me like he did in Shiver - he seemed less sappy and wimpy and more of a character that I could feel sympathy for.<br /><br />It's funny, because based on the reviews I've read, people seem to like Shiver better than Linger.  I guess I like Linger better because it's not as focused on Sam as Shiver was.  In Linger, there seems to be much more happening in the plot, rather than simply Sam's struggle to keep his humanity.<br /><br />One little thing I didn't like: Grace's parents start paying more attention to her in Linger and become more involved in her life.  I thought this was good, since her parents were noticeably absent in Shiver.  But at the same time, the way Grace handles her parents got on my nerves a bit.  Grace just seems to react too impulsively and angrily, and it made her character a little immature at times.<br /><br />Lastly I have to mention the writing.  It's so gorgeous.  Maggie Stiefvater has a wonderful talent for writing.  Her prose is delicate and poetic and lovely, and it just draws you into the story so much. that the plot is on the slow side at times, I think it works and flows perfectly, because the author's writing is just so good that she can turn any scene into something magically intriguing.<br /><br />This is a solid sequel and I was impressed by the character development and the writing.  Even though I wasn't crazy about Shiver, I'm becoming more and more fond of this series as it goes on.  Depending on how well I like the final book, Forever, this series might just be going on my favorites list!solid sequel and I was impressed by the character development and the writing.

B001H5X7I4|5.0|Wow this was great. This film was just so funny and all the star actors performed perfectly. Ben Stiller, hilarious especially as Simple Jack. Robert Downey Jr., very great acting and funny. Jack Black, hilarious and awesome as always. The script was unbelievably good and was laugh out loud funny. Ben Stiller did a great job directing, acting, and writing. The funniest parts were the trailer and Simple Jack. For the DVD sent, it was in perfect condition and came ahead of schedule.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I hate how it doesn't let me go to the app.then I have to redownload it and then start all over -_- but if I didn't have that problem it would be awesome!

B006XF5BTG|5.0|I loved this book. Very informative. I have been following this program for about 6 weeks now and have gotten great results.

B004UXUX7S|5.0|A bittersweet story of a suddenly dysfunctional family suddenly thrust into a position of having to pull together. Clooney is at the top of his game here. Though he didn't win, it's still an Oscar worthy performance. Don't miss this one.

0345803485|2.0|I've been really trying to read this book due to friends and people talking about it so I decided to finally buy it. Excited when I finally got it in the mail and when I started to read it it all seemed good and stuff but some of the words are misspelled constantly very disappointing I read up to chapter 6 but got tired of trying to make sense of a sentence...ugh! So I put it aside and instead got it from my local library better now I'm actually loving my borrowed library. DON'T BUY. You'll have a better chance at the library hahahahaa FREE
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I like the entire CD. The music is easy listening for me.  I can hum along with the music in the car while driving, while cleaning around the house, with my nieces and nephews while babysitting.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The &#34;Hunger Games&#34; series never takes you to any place expected. This final book is no exception, from beginning to end. A very fast-paced conclusion and rewarding ending to the trilogy.
B001FB55L2|4.0|This was a really good movie about two brothers-a military hero and a screw-up just released from prison. When the hero is shipped off to the Middle East, shot down, and presumed dead, the screw-up tries to redeem himself and act as a father figure to the family. This was a well-made film with superb acting and drama. The extras on the DVD were also good. If you like the stars (Tobey Maguire, Jake Gylenhaal, Natalie Portmann) and a good drama, then this is the movie for you.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Threat Vector is a &#34;story&#34; about Chinese intervention into the South China Sea and use of cyberterror.  This is in today's [2/1/13] newspaper headlines.  Right on target, as usual.

If you list numerous items,  the lists can quickly become very long.<br /><br />I would like to be able to send an invoice from this app, instead of having to open the browser.<br /><br /> The ability to print shipping labels would be very convenient.<br /><br />If these things were added, I would give 5 stars.

1402270275|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I found the characters relatable, liked the plot and the incorporation of the paranormal--finding blue-bloods vs. vampires a fun  dichotomy--and simply adored the world that was created in this book.  The blending of historical facts with imaginative creatures worked for me and the societal structure was both fascinating and believable, if a bit under-explored--but that is only to be expected in a series--something to explore in books to come.  I did have a small disconnect with the hero's dialect and accent written into the dialogue, but  after I discovered that it did have a plot purpose I was able to re-gig my mind from heavy-handed to character clue.  I would also say that the \\"steampunk\\" elements in this book were, in my opinion little more than window dressing.  Seam-powered mechanical servers and a few mechanical limbs--they didn't really have an effect on the book other that a small amount of aesthetic.  With a series title of \\"London Steampunk\\" I kind of expected them to play a more predominant role.  I don't feel that this hurt the book, however if one is looking for a truly steampunk read, I am not sure that I would recommend this, as it was more of a paranormal book with steampunk overtones.  Perhaps further into the series the steampunk elements will develop further, or perhaps they were incorporated to capitalize on the current steampunk fascination, in either case they helped to create a beautiful cover and enhance a good book.<br /><br />I give Kiss of Steel four smiling stars with every intention of picking up the next book in this series Heart of Iron with it is released.<br /><br />As a side not, I also have to add and give props to the publishing company of this one, Sourcebooks Casablanca.  This is a beautifully published paperback, with quality paper that was a joy to read.  As a comparison, if anyone is interested, I weighed both this book and Ilona Andrews Bayou Moon (which has just slightly more pages) and Bayou moon came in at around 8ozs while Kiss of Steel was 11ozs.  The quality of the paper was substantially above the normal mass market and made this book much cleaner to read.moon came in at around 8ozs while Kiss of Steel was 11ozs.

0783226888|5.0|The movie shows how versatile Bruce Willis is. You see how he can be a cold blooded villain who is fascinating to watch. The plot goes in directions that you would not have guessed and so it keeps your interest. This is not an action picture like his other movies. This is more a drama that makes you think. I really enjoyed watching it several times.
0765325950|5.0|For those readers that have gotten this far in the series it is pretty much a no brainer that you would buy this book to see how the story concludes.  So many civilizations.  So many individuals who have threads that need conclusions.  And readers that want to know the answers to each.  The only question then is whether or not the last book satisfies the questions that readers have and whether or not the last book is worthy of reading all prerequisite books leading up to the final book.  To me the answer is \\"yes, this book was very satisfying\\".  And for that reason alone I give the book 5 stars for being a fun read, keeping the humor of the series in tact, and for answering many of my own questions regarding conclusions.<br /><br />But it is more than that in a lot of ways also...  For example, when I started this series of books I became a fan of Robert Jordan's writings.  Particularly the first few books of the Wheel of Time were very good reads.  Towards the end of Robert Jordan's writings the books lost perhaps a bit of the edge that they once had and that is understandable given Robert Jordan's health concerns.  Jordan's final books were still very enjoyable but perhaps not with the same captivating ability as his first few books.  Then enters Brandon Sanderson.  And wow, the series all of a sudden had that same flow that the first few books in the series did.  And the continuity of the story was excellent.  All of a sudden I found myself becoming more and more of a Brandon Sanderson fan and I started reading some of his other books (Mistborn in particular) and really enjoyed those as well.  I just find that Brandon Sanderson's writing was a great tribute to Robert Jordan and really did justice to Robert Jordan's story telling capabilities.<br /><br />In the final book of the series the humor and the individual character traits were fantastic in my opinion.  And the book flowed very well which was important for bringing forth the final chapters to the book.  And Brandon Sanderson took one of Robert Jordan's tricks to heart very well which was to leave one character hanging on the edge of a literal cliff while shifting to the story of another character so that you wanted to read further to find out how the first character gets to safety.  Book writing techniques like that were a great Jordan trait which Brandon used well in the last book (perhaps partly to the credit of Jordan's outline and to Jordan's editing crew and wife who knew some of Jordan's tricks).  The fact that characters laughed and created songs at dangerous moments with levity were just as important as the base story surrounding the facts of the danger.  And that laughter intermixed with fast paced reading makes for a good combination that this last book has in abundance.<br /><br />Bottom line...  Definately read this book if you are a fan of either Brandon Sanderson or of Robert Jordan.  It is a fun fast paced story that satisfactorily concludes a fantastic series of books with a few twists and turns in and of itself.<br /><br />The above paragraphs contain no spoilers...  However, the next few paragraphs contain a couple of minor spoilers so you can stop reading now if you don't want to know about the book.<br /><br />On the flip side I should mention that there are a few flaws or improvements which could have been made a bit better in this last book.  These are nitpicks more than anything else but just my opinions only...<br />  1) The character of Moghedian was concluded by placing an adam around her neck and making her damane.  That is a bit flawed though because Rand's peace explicitly states that any bound damane that wishes to go to the white tower is free to do so via Seanchan agreement.  So if that is the case then what is keeping Moghedian from going free and fulfilling her wishes of becoming an \\"empress of her lessers\\"?<br /><br />  2) The Seanchan seemed to have gotten off way too easy in the last battle.  Just about all of the other civilizations got beaten up badly and yet the Seanchan are a civilization that could arguably have taken over other civilizations (if the shadow were not present and Rand's peace were not signed) and yet the Seanchan sat on the sidelines for much of the book waiting.  Whereas most civilizations lost most of their important members of society to war and to the last battle it seemed like the Seanchan kept most of their important members of society alive and was almost as much of a power thru it all as when they started.  That seems a bit strange that such a mighty civilization had a minor role in the last battle.<br /><br />  3) Several of the books leading up to this book describe the flow of black sisters from the white tower and that the \\"black ajah\\" had grown to be quite sizeable with their defections.  One could reasonably state that the black ajah was one fourth the total number of the Aes Sedai in the Wheel of Time.  And yet the black ajah played a fairly small role in this last book whereas the other ajah colors played larger roles.  Further, there were several civilizations which played large roles in this last book (the Sharan army, the red-veiled Aiel, and the darkhounds) which I thought would have been better represented by more major roles by the already established black ajah force and Padan Fain.  And Padan Fain, himself, was such an infamous character that I felt that he deserved a bit larger role in this last book than what he received.  Especially in comparison to the Sharan army, the red-veield Aiel, and the darkhounds.<br /><br />  4) Damandred starts with a full circle of support to give him power.  And yet, at some point in the book, Damandred loses his full circle of support.  At what point in the book did the full circle decide to leave him and why when he was so effective with it?  And what happened to the individuals of that full circle as the book went on?  It seems like a full circle is a lot of powerful members of the source and it left a question with me as to where these people went to during the story.  Although it is true that some members of the shadow with capabilities of \\"the one power\\" were discussed it didn't seem like there were enough members discussed that could have made up an entire full circle around Damandred.<br /><br />  5) I had predicted that Elaida would make a comeback in the final book either as a damane to Egwene (that would have been fun) or as a former damane that became subsequently freed and again got on Egwene's nerves in some manner or another.  Both options seemed plausible since Elaida was captured by the Seanchan but was not, to my understanding, killed.  Elaida was such a pain in the side of Egwene in previous books that it would have been fun to see her play a role (even if minor) in the last book.  Unfortunately my prediction never came true which was a mild disappointment but one that doesn't detract from the book itself.
B005T87QCI|1.0|This game won't work.  It shows the intro then goes to loading screen and plays music.  Not sure how to get it to work.  Any help would be great.
B008P76UKE|5.0|Lorin Maazel conducts the Berlin Philharmonic in what Maazel has termed a \\"symphonic synthesis\\", a suite of the most familiar themes from Wagner's four-night Ring Cycle. The resulting distillation arranged by Maazel is a thrilling non-stop 74 minute musical experience, chronologically telling the story of the highlights of the Ring in music only. This is a great introduction to Wagner's music for the beginner, and a pleasant evening of fine memories for a veteran Wagner fan.<br /><br />As might be expected from Maazel and the Berlin Philharmonic, the music and its presentation on this Blu-ray disc are top-notch. Other aspects of the production are strange, but do not materially detract from its enjoyment. The disc has no time tracking of any kind, and even the normal timer on the player does not display. Tiny print on the case claims 83 minutes of \\"program\\" which is likely a typo, as the program is actually 75 minutes, nearly 74 of which is music. One can access the \\"chapters' on the disc to ascertain what piece of music is playing and thus where we are in the chronological presentation of the themes, or in order to select a different piece. Experimentation is required to determine how to access this feature and then remove it from the screen without causing the playback to return to the Main Menu; the correct sequence seems to be \\"pop-up menu\\", select \\"chapters\\", \\"pop-up menu\\".  The program listing is available in the booklet that comes with the disc, which also contains a good outline of the story that is being told by the music.<br /><br />There is no explanation on the disc, nor anything in the enclosed booklet, that reveals the circumstances of this recording. Why, for example, are there empty seats in the house, people seemingly seated in random places like behind the orchestra, many audience members quite casually dressed, and the principal cellist lacking his white bow tie? It almost looks like a dress rehearsal, but no matter, the music is magnificent. Onlyone \\"bonus feature\\" is offered, a brief commentary by Maazel on the genesis of the idea for a synthesis of the Ring's music, and the philosophy behind its production.<br /><br />The stern-faced Maazel stands before the Berlin Philharmonic, and together they deliver well over an hour of exceptional music. As stipulated by Wagner, the orchestra is very large, with four clarinets instead of the usual two, three oboes and an English horn instead of two oboes, four harps instead of one (or none), eight French horns instead of four, two sets of timpani instead of one, and so on through the instrumental lineup. The resultant sound is massive, and glorious. The modest price of this Blu-ray makes it more affordable than a CD, the music quality is great, and the high-definition video is a bonus. This is a gem of quality and value, and if you like great classical music in general, or Wagner in particular, you will love this presentation.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book from start to finish is a great mystery.  A who dun it kind of story.  You go back and forth between 2 characters and their stories, between the wife and her husband.  Just when you begun to side with one character, you start to side with the other.  Just did not want to put the story down and was great.  Plan on reading the other books from this author.  Going back and forth from one character narrative to another made it confusing a times, when it jumped from one story to the next in the beginning of the book, but as you towards the middle of the story and the end, it started to connect and jumping back and forth wasn't as confusing.  Would recommend this book for anyone that wants a great mystery, thrill book, about revenge, getting even, and who dun it.

0385344228|5.0|Having your 14-year-old son indicted for murdering a classmate would cause any family to unravel.  The narrator is Andy Barber, an assistant DA, whose son Jacob has means (a knife), motive (bullying), and opportunity.  Jacob also has a mean streak, a history of shoplifting, and a nasty temper.  Oh, and his fingerprint is on the victim's sweatshirt.  Why his parents have chosen to ignore obvious signs that their son is a sociopath is anybody's guess, especially since Andy's forbears had a propensity toward violence--a fact that he has failed to share with his wife, Laurie.  Now Andy and Laurie are paying a huge price for turning a blind eye to their son's abominable behavior.  The book shifts back and forth between the year of the murder and the following year, in which Andy is testifying before a grand jury.  The reason for this latter testimony is as much of a puzzle to the reader as the uncertainty of Jacob's involvement in the murder.  Before Andy's replacement as prosecutor on the case, he had wanted to pursue a known pedophile as the most likely culprit.  As the damning evidence continues to mount against Jacob, however, even Andy and Laurie begin to doubt their son's innocence, especially after a particularly disturbing assessment of his mental health.  More importantly, the parents have to question to what degree they are to blame for their son's problems and misdeeds.  To some readers, this book is not just a legal thriller; it's a portrait of a family facing an unfathomable crisis.  For me, it's a story of a child whose parents are victimized for granting him too much privacy.  Either way, it's a crowd pleaser.

B009O2XY12|2.0|But it does this trick (and a lot of app games do this) where they make playing the game a slight obstacle and grant you real progess given that you pay a certain amount of money. At the beginning of the game it doesn't seem like a problem. But after the first island you basically are given very few bubbles and when you run out you can conintue with gems. These gems just grant you ten more bubbles. And when you run out of gems you either give up the level or purcahse gems with real life currency.<br />Well that just won't do I'm not going to pay for something so dumb (and given how hard this game will become you could take a bath on that sort of mindset. And i'm not grinding old levels for gems. (this isn't an RPG). So basically. No. Don't play this. Team lava has a lot of apps like this so I wouldn't go there with anything they make.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I was surprised a couple years ago when I went to see what I liked so much playing on my Pandora and it was Josh Groban.  His voice reminded me of a powerful Billy Joel with a gigantic range.  Songs like \\"Awake,\\" \\"Weeping,\\" and \\"You Rise me Up,\\" just seemed to resonate in my head.  So I admit I like the David Foster days more than anything and the last album was a little bit of a let-down.  None-the-less his voice has always remained strong and magnificent, so it's not like I thought \\"Illuminations\\" was total trash or anything.<br /><br />Overall, \\"All that Echoes\\" is a charming, more layered and complex album than \\"Illuminations\\" and it's a welcome addition to the other five CD's he has released.  I expect other fans will feel as I do, which is that this is the best Groban has been in a while, and certainly since the David Foster days that many people originally fell in love with.<br /><br />First off, the songwriting on \\"All That Echoes\\" is some of Josh's best.  This is completely apparent in the first few tracks, as they are as great as they are varied:<br /><br />\\"Brave\\" and \\"False Alarms\\" both use interweaving plucked strings throughout with piano support.  The songs build and show Josh growing in his songwriting and entering new territory that is definitely welcome.  The sound is new and I find it exciting and it lets his voice go to places that weren't so often heard before.  \\"Falling Slowly\\" is a throwback to the Groban of old.  And it's fantastic.  The song has one of his best chorus' and easily may be my favorite song on the album.  A few other gems include:<br /><br />\\"Happy in my Heartache,\\" A medium paced songs that is incredibly uplifting for a break-up song. The lyrics are quite sappy, and make me laugh a little in their ridiculousness, but that's part of what you get with Groban, love it or hate it, it's still catchy as hell.<br /><br />\\"Below the Line,\\" A similar pace and tone to \\"Happy...\\" as above.  I really have to hand it to Rob Cavallo, as he's done an excellent job producing this album.  The instrumentation is spot on all the way through.  This song is the best showcase of that with Paul Simon like guitar vamping and galloping drums.<br /><br />\\"She Moved Through the Fair,\\" A little bit of a surprise here in instrumentation and tone.  Includes a semi dark tone if you can believe it (well dark for Groban) and utilizes bag-pipes throughout.  Has a hypnotic feel and I love the Cliff Martinez like meditative electronic back-drop.  Really great feel throughout.<br /><br />In the end, this is a must buy album in my opinion.  The album is listenable all the way through.  If you're like me and listen to the music around the house, while trying to get work done, or when you're out walking the dog, then you want a versatile album.  This is by far his most varied, and takes his music in a welcome new direction.  Highly recommended.done an excellent job producing this album.  The instrumentation is spot on all the way through.

B00005NIE1|3.0|The vinyl version contains \\"New York City Cops\\" instead of \\"When It Started\\", and this is not reflected in Amazon's track listing. This means the vinyl actually has the track listing of the European CD (with NYC cops) but the artwork of the American CD (the blue/yellow one). I wanted \\"When It Started\\" and I bought the album thinking that I would get it. It would have been a five star review otherwise, it's an excellent album.

B003Y5H556|4.0|I actually enjoyed the movie.  It felt more like a medieval crime thriller woven into a fairytale.  It was a little slow to start and the dark sets were a bit annoying; as were some of the other inconsistencies like no one dressing warm in winter.  Overall though it had some nice visual artwork.  The acting was decent, especially Julie Christie and Gary Oldman.  It is an escapist film best watched on a grey, rainy day.  I picked up the Blu-ray here on Amazon for $7.99 which is just about maximum you'd want to pay for the movie on Blu-ray.

B003VANOFY|5.0|As an avid gamer I always use my headset and never my speakers. I got this headset only for the wireless capabilities. I came from a very comfortable Gamecom 377 headset. Those earphones were very comfortable so when I put these on I was in for a shock. I already miss the super cushy headphones but this is way more noise canceling. Logitech has amassing software that makes listening to this worth it in the end. This review is about after a week of use, I will certainly add more. I got this refurbished so it came without an instruction manual and it was fairly easy to set-up. I already have a Logitech keyboard which has media keys so having the 3 on the headset isn't that necessary, just a nice addition. I haven't use the surround sound but I'm sure its great. I will certainly update this if I come across any problems. I feel like the first thing to break will be the connector between the headset ear pieces. Having the swivel feature is nice I guess but it feels super flimsy and I know that will break first. I would recommend this HIGHLY. I got it on sale. You might thing that around $100 is steep for a headset but wireless makes all the difference.<br /><br />UPDATE: It isn't actually that uncomfortable. I haven't run out of battery yet i always charge it overnight and only have to use tethered mode once and a while. I initially though it was uncomfortable but it isn't It is a nice headset and i still recommend it.

B005LN5UOC|2.0|cheap pair, but the quality isnt extremely cheap. they work well enough. i would recommend them f you are seeking a cheap headset for gaming.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I have already read a couple of the later Jack Reacher books that I really enjoyed.  Decided to go back to the beginning and watch the character develop.  Glad I did.  A very good book.
B003JTHXOK|2.0|I like Nicholas Sparks but honestly, I returned this Kindle book after one day.  Trite, predictable, boring...maybe the movie will be better???
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I really enjoy this game. It is good clean fun. I also have some of the other games. It can help kids think and move faster.l give it 10 stars if I could.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Very fun game! out of all the horse games this one is my favorite! very good graphics and easy to play
B0094OLFUW|5.0|the beats dont quite match up to their first album but its still beautiful. the lyrics make up for it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I cannot stop playing. There is so much you can do in this game and it is so addictive! I highly recommend it. Go play now! Best game ever!
1594203334|5.0|I  have  recommended  this  book  to  25  other  people.  I  cannot  believe  what  commonsense  the  French  have in  mastering  the  art  of  controlling  their  kids'  eating  habits.  It  does make  us  think  about  our  casual  approach  to child development,  and  maybe  that  is  why  our  young  ones  are  so  addicted  to  junk.  I  loved  her  personal  stories  about  getting  pregnant  the  second  time....hilarious !  She  is  an  entertaining  writer.  Hope  she  does  more !!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a great book.  Hard to put down.  I was just a little disappointed in how it ended.  There!
B005ETA5K2|1.0|Ironically enough the laptop alone got a better range and speed and i have the previous versions and they did better twice!!!<br />this is a joke!!! seriosuly this company should work harder cause they got the money to do so....
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book.  It lots lots of twists and turns and the author made me identify with both main characters.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|If u enjoyed Phillip Phillips on American Idol last year you won't be disappointed  He wrote most of the songs on the album himself
B003O86MY8|5.0|This cd was purchased for my daughter in law and she loves everything David Garrett records. This is one of his cd's that she was missing in her collection
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Ive never written a review before... but this book deserved it. I read reviews about this book saying it was too violent and Travis was a violent man. I caved and read the book anyway and im glad that i did. The book was amazing. This book was no more violent than alot of other romance books ive read with jealous boyfriends. i loved this book. its most definitely worth a read.
B000FQIRXQ|5.0|Good Charles Dickens movie, Fast shipping, product as advertised. You should read the book to get a real good understanding of David Copperfield.
B002Q1YDLI|1.0|After seeing the movie Something Borrowed, I thought I would pick up with the 2nd book. The first bit of this book was a recap of what happened in the first book (or movie), so it seems doable. However, I ended up hating this book and wasn't able to get past 51% (Kindle) of the book. Perhaps I missed something in the fist book, but Darcy the main character is so unbelievably annoying that I just couldn't read any further. I tried to push through in hopes of Darcy having a redeeming quality to keep it interesting. If she has one I never saw it or made it to the point where it is showed. I do realize I may have missed something from the first book, but if you're like me and saw the movie and want to see what happens it's probably not worth your time.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|As cliché as it might be, Steve Jobs seems to be quite a leader. I'm only through some of this book and it's been quite a good read. It's quite a good insight into who Steve Jobs was and how he operated, Even though many people didn't like him he was able to get the job done. Hard work and dedication is what you need to get the job done. it's great to read from someone who is able to get inside track and truly understand him not only as a man but also as a business owner.
B002R27J1W|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. If you haven't seen it, I highly suggest you do. It is deliciously suspenseful. Audry Hepburn is an amazing actress and played a blind lady almost perfectly. I just love the movie. Ten out of ten in my book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Keeps you on edge. Loved the story line, so much emotion put  Into it.  Recommend reading it, especially if you love suspenseful love stories.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I highly recommend this book and have already done so to several of my friends.  It is a different approach to building a publishing business.  There are good items for nonfiction writers but excellent for fiction writers.
B009K72RRS|5.0|Need I say more. it's star wars and as you can see on cover of The Clone Wars Season 5, Darth Maul is alive! Can't wait for Episode 7 of the movie franchise. JJ Abrams will not disappoint.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I have watched Downton Abbey from the very beginning.The work is so good and the actors and actress' are so very outstanding that one feels like<br />they are right there with everyone. However I am upset about the amount of people that are being killed off. William,Lavinia,Syble and now Mathew to say nothing<br />of poor Pamouk and Vera as well as Cora losing her baby..So I am wondering how many and who will be next in season 4 if there is one.I had wondered how they were going to get Bates out<br />of prison.Never thought it would be as simple as a pie.A pie would never get one off in this country but it is fantasy to begin with.However a lot of<br />research must have gone on about that time of life. Being of Irish decent myself I could sympathise with Tom especialy my ancesters are from northern<br />Ireland which is still under British rule.However it was done it is an excellant piece of work and the person that said the U.S. should take a lesson from<br />the Brits in making movies that needs no sex or violence was so right.Amazon has done an excellant job in getting Downton Abbey to the public in a timely manner.<br />I have no complaints about their product.I love my Kindle Fire.
B00A6PD9I4|2.0|My wife rented this a while back and sorrily disappointed. It was nothing like the trailers had portrayed it and the story in and of itself isn't very compelling.....
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I think the branium games are great. The properties are easy to figure out and the games are both easy and hard. a good mix.
B000OZ0NXA|2.0|This is my first Jack Reacher experience. My husband recommended that I read it since I like the Alex Cross series. BUT, the read is way to slow and Lee Child's writing style places too much on character and situation development. Too boring and I never finished. I have no desire to finish because I'm don't find Reacher all that interesting. Maybe I'll try another one-- we'll see.
B0049U4INC|5.0|Guy is a very easy writer to read.  This book is a very good guide for people in business particularly for those that are new to the business.  It embraces the new economy very well.
B009IF82SK|5.0|One of the best shows on tv for sure. I could watch every episode over and over and still crack up laughing.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is an awesome game I have it on Pc &amp;on IPod, not allowed. to get It on Kindle Fire yet but glad its on a bigger platform.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|I purchased two albums - set the destination as my windows media - they are not there, and I cannot find them on my computer. I sent an email to Amazon asking for help - but have had NO response whatsoever.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Wow! Somewhat like a typical Steven King book, but this is different. it really makes you think about the butterfly effect. I really enjoy his books and I think this is one of my favorite ones. Loved the ending. I have already recomended this to alot of people and many types of readers.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I have read quite a few reviews that this book drags on and is such a painful read to get through, however I don't really agree with that.<br />If you have any interest in Mereen at all you will enjoy this book. If you are in love with the story, you will enjoy this book. If you are way too impatient for HBO to take another 6 years to get where we are (Not that Martin will be much faster with WoW) you will love this book.<br /><br />And lastly, the 4th and 5th books are the calm before the storm of book 6. If the entire series were as tumultuous we wouldn't have any characters left by the 5th book, let alone anyone surviving to the 7th.<br /><br />May the old gods of the north watch over you,<br />-Tuck
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think this game is a great game.for all horse lovers!!! Its so self explanitory easy to use and great graphics

0393088774|1.0|Our revenue is $2.2 trillion, spend $3.5 trillion, amassed over $16 trillion in debt not including unfunded liabilities around $60 trillion and he thinks that we are not borrowing enough money???  He is convinced that the world will continue to sacrifice so we can overspend for eternity? Has he ever balanced a checkbook? Does he know the difference between a Ponzi scheme and Social Security? No!  His friends in the Fed have pinned us to a corner with zero interest rates and any change will make us officially insolvent.  He believes in paying off interest and debts with newer and newer credit cards. I guess that's how you pay off your debts by accumulating more debt.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|My nephew loves this movie.  I love this movie.<br />Good vs evil.....good wins.  Shrek has a good heart.<br />The characters may look different but it's a warm<br />story of the power of love.
B006M4F67A|3.0|I really enjoy playing mahjong and i Like all the different tile arrangements in this game. It does freeze up on me often and then I have to close the game. This is a dissappointment.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The best free game that has AMAZING graphics and is the most beautiful looking game with new things to do like zipline, mine, waterfall, and so much more awesome stuff that you will love
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is even more addictive than the first one. I love it. I play it all the time. I enjoy how it is set up really easy to understand and I enjoy it much more than the first.
0375701427|4.0|For 40 years I have avoided reading anything by Philip Roth, because Portnoy's Complaint annoyed me so. That book was so whiny, so non-funny in its humor, so obviously designed to shock.<br /><br />But this one is a Pulitzer Prize winner, and I try to read all of those, so I read it, although with some misgivings. As it turns out, it is not whiny; it does not even try to be funny; its shock lies in the tragedy of events rather than in graphic sexual descriptions. It is superbly written, switching backward and forward through time with ease and clarity to place climactic events at just the right places. Roth is a wizard with words. The book lends itself to a variety of interpretations, and I have been thinking about it all morning. That, in itself, is the mark of a good book--you think about it afterward.<br /><br />On one level, this is just the incredibly sad story of \\"Swede\\" Levov, a third-generation Jewish boy who seems to be living the American dream. He is a three-sport athletic wonder in high school and a Marine in World War II, marries an Irish-Catholic beauty who was Miss New Jersey, becomes rich from the glove factory his father started, moves to the New Jersey countryside, and has an intelligent and loving daughter. And then things fall apart. The adored daughter becomes a fanatical teenager who protests the war in Viet Nam with a savage act of terrorism. The daughter \\"transports him out of the longed-for American pastoral and into everything that is its antithesis and its enemy, into the fury, the violence, and the desperation of the counterpastoral--into the indigenous American berserk.\\"<br /><br />On another level, as I interpret it, this is an allegory for the death of the American promise. For a good while, the dream held together. Hard work, dedication to \\"doing the right thing,\\" and a general desire for assimilation seemed to work. And then, it just didn't work anymore--race riots, outsourcing of manufacturing, war protests, a general discontent. The center could not hold.<br /><br />One reason I keep thinking about this book is that once again, it seems to me, America is falling apart, this time along religious and economic fault lines.<br /><br />American Pastoral is not an easy book to read, does not tie up all the loose plot ends, and is certainly not \\"happily ever after.\\" Still, it is an essential book, worthy of its Pulitzer Prize and its inclusion on the Times Top 100.
B00004CZAS|1.0|I give a zero rating - the DVD I purchased said it can't be used in this country!?!?! What a waste of money and time waiting for it!!!! Ridiculous!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a really addicting game. It's fun and has the right amount of stuff to unlock to keep you playing. I think there should be something to unlock to make powerful spawn more often, but other than that it's super fun.
B006ZS4FE8|5.0|This was the greatest present for my granddaughter!  No pieces missing, directions are pretty clear.  I would definitely order this again (if I had any other granddaughters)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John green is something else. This book was so beautiful and definitely a book I would read again. By far the best John green books yet.
B00003CXB4|4.0|a very nice package and appeals nicely to young children. this has also kept many adults quite entertained many times
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Great picture and sound. This animated show was funny and my daughter and I enjoyed it! We watched it twice. Ate lots of popcorn and danced to the music!
B000SEI230|5.0|I chose this book because I love the movie. They always say the book is better than the movie. It is just as good if not better, so just read it.
B0091QS88K|5.0|We first got the Doctor/ Hospital app when it was free.  We love it.  I promptly downloaded other free Panda apps.  These are great explorations apps.  Fun activities.  You can seat your guests, chop food, plate it, serve it, and more.  Not much learning, but a safe and fun app for kids.  A good app to add to the mix.  I must also add, I never paid for an app, until yesterday, when I purchased the full Restaurant version for my son.  It's worth the money- all the Panda apps.
B003UBTX72|5.0|This is an excellent and instructive document. I really enjoyed the whole book on Keith’s honest and straight words. I was not aware of the greatness and genius of this rock icon until reading the eBook.  The material is not only about Keith Richard and his struggle and survival from addictions, but a very comprehensive narrative about the Stones and their evolution to becoming the greatest rock band in music history.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is the best game in the app store and they need to make more and keep updating the
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I can easily see why this book is so popular among young adults.  The author really has created a detailed story that captures your attention from start to finish.  Very well thoughtout suspenseful story that is not predictable and keep syou on the edge of your seat.  I couldn't put it down.
B002H3ETX2|3.0|The music is good but the sound is not of audiophile quality. This vinyl LP does not appears to have been produced from the original analog master tape.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I had no idea how this book would end but I stayed up till morning unable to stop reading.  There is so much that connects the things that happen in this book with who we are as human beings.  Governments that feel the need to control it's people and the distrust so many of us have for them.  Suzanne Collins brilliantly exposes the flaws of human nature in such a way it stays with you long after you finish this trilogy.  True or not true, is the question that haunts us all.
B0091QSNEE|5.0|My son loves these apps.  You can see my reviews on the other Panda apps.  They're simple clean fun.  A great alternative to always playing learning apps.<br /><br />This is also the only app I've spent money on.  I usually stick to lite/ trial versions or Amazon's free daily apps.  However, after getting the hospital panda app, I promptly downloaded the other panda trial apps.  We want them all and this is the first one we decided to get.<br /><br />In this restaurant app you can set your guests, chop food, mix it, bake it/ fry it, serve it, and have your guests eat it.  It's pretty fun for my son.  One of his favorites.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The kids and me think this game rocks. We have a lot of fun doing the competitions and seeing who does better.
0143119680|4.0|Been looking at this book for sometime now and then took the plunge. it was enjoyable enough that i will read the triology.  the book is really a love story with a plot that \\"thickens\\" with the situation. the ones in love are a witch and a vampire!  it creates a modern day world where the supernatual beings and humans all live but the humans are unaware of the demons, witches and vampires. The main characters meet over a chance achemist book that was locked centuries ago and opened unexpectedly by the witch.  the story develops and they will seek a resolution to the schism between the supernatural groups and to find out why such hoslitiies and problems have occurred.<br />the book is well written, some new concepts for supernatural beings, most especially vampires and the \\"still human\\" side of these beings.<br />i doubt you will be dissappointed in this relaxing book.
B003B02O3C|4.0|John Grisham helps show to good and bad of lawyers and their motives.  This story in particular helps those of us who chose not to go into law see that we made the right decision.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|TEMPLE RUN HAS BEEN DELETED FOR THIS ONE...I LOVE THE FACT THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO RESTART AT HE BEGINNING OF THE GAME EVERY TIME. OHH YEA & I LOVE SWINGING FROM THE VINES TOO.
B0053O89WY|5.0|We all love this gang. It's great to laugh at smart people instead of stupid people.This series is one of the few that just keeps getting better.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Brilliant must have game for anyone! So addictive! Better than temple run because you can play it with the kindle flat but there isn't enough things to collect along the run. However a really good game.
1577311523|5.0|I first got this book in 2004 or so.  I enjoyed it immensely and tried to apply the principles in my life.  It made an instant positive impact.  Over the years since then, I lapsed on my diligence about trying to &#34;remain present and totally in the now&#34;.  I recently was inspired to buy the book again and it was like reading it for the first time.<br /><br />My mind does not want to accept that this is all there is, and fights presence every step of the way.  But the freedome and peace I have experienced in the past few weeks has been amazing.<br /><br />I recommend this book to everyone as a way to peace and true happiness, regardless of what is going on in your life currently.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This was a really great book.... I really enjoyed reading Slammed.  This is the second book I read from this author and love her work.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry birds is fun all the time from easy to hard.  Love the sound effects and usually get more angry than the birds.
0525952926|3.0|while still a good read (i'm glad i checked it out at the library instead of paying $19.00 for the kindle edition), i was disappointed.  The writing, to me, wasn't the same, and the new characters never really developed, and were never life-like to me.  Some of the old favorites, like Maude, were totally out of character from their previous developments.  i skimmed lots of parts because it was boring and the writing a bit wooden.  get the library book if you want to keep up with the second part of this trilogy, but don't waste your money on buying the book.
0786838655|5.0|Ever since watching the film, I've wanted to read this book. Now I have more bookish friends who love anything Riordan, so I thought it was time for me to read this. I started it yesterday morning and finished it just a little while ago. I haven't read a book that fast in a long while!<br /><br />A lot of people compare this book to Harry Potter and I guess now I see why. Percy is a 12-year-old boy who keeps experiencing weird things in his life, and is forced to go to a summer camp for demigods to learn  (among other things) how to stay alive. Another comparison I made was the fact that this book also featured a trio of MC's: Percy, Annabeth and Grover (much like Harry, Hermione and Ron).<br /><br />But apart from those little things, TLT is a book that stands on its own, and is packed with excitement, magic and Greek mythology, something a geek like me loves! (I'm placing this book under the MG category, but a YA fan can be just as enthralled by it.)<br /><br />The first chapter alone is a mind-boggling one, that traps you right into the story. I think that is just what books today are lacking, the ability to grab your attention in just the first chapter; instead, they make you wait until the third, fourth chapter to let you know what's really going on.<br /><br />Percy's voice is so rich, and his way of talking to the reader flows beautifully off the pages. I know this is a book I'll be giving to my little brothers in their future birthdays. Every character is as tridimensional as Percy, they all have their quirks, and there are so many of them! I was fascinated by the way Riordan crafted so many people and never once lost me along the way. I knew just who everyone was, and I started feeling different emotions toward each of them.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed the descriptions in this book, going from the Half-Blood Hill and its Camp for Half-Bloods, to the layout of NYC and Las Vegas, and finally, the Underworld and the Olympus. Everything was beautifully detailed; the film didn't do this book any justice.<br /><br />The Lightning Thief is going to my favourites shelf right away!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I just started watching Downton this season, so being able to watch the previous season was great!  I like how it saves your place when you have to quit watching for awhile.
B006XBSAP2|5.0|She made a list of music she wanted and loved this CD when she received it for Christmas. She has an iTunes account. It was cheaper to buy this CD than purchasing the songs she liked separately. I bought it on sale.
B0082SU98U|5.0|I never read this book before and really enjoyed it.  I saw the movie and really enjoyed watching it.  The story was not the same in the book as was the movie, noticed a few differences in the story line and would recommend this book to anyone who enjoy this type of literature especially to children because many books today are not appropriate for children.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I enjoy angry birds Rio.  I've only played a couple of games but they seem easier than angry birds and suitable for younger people.
B004UUKDNA|5.0|Great album to wake you up and keep you going. the beats between songs are strong and unique and the themes of the songs keep you interested. It's a fun time all around. Hopefully a follow-up live up to this release.
B007ZTLLMK|3.0|this game is okay I put 3! stars because it didn't seem to cool as I exspected it to be but its not bad for 10year old its perfaect game because 10year old get in to helicopters in that stage.  but that's a okay GAME
B001DHXT6G|4.0|This is not a review of the series.  There is nothing I could add of value to many of the detailed reviews on these pages.  This concern is with wasted time and energy exchanging this boxed set, because the first season was missing its cardboard sleeve cover and artwork -- I got a new one with the same problem.  This time I went back to the photo on Amazon and noticed that there was no sleeve pictured on the first season.  I called Amazon and was informed that the manufacturer no longer ships the set with the artwork included on the first season.  WHY???????  As Mr. Spock might say, \\"it defies logic!\\"  At least I should have been informed of this fact before going through an entire, needless exchange.  The discs work fine; there are no problems with how they play, and the remastering and other improvements, plus all the extras, make this series well worth having.  It costs less to buy it as a complete package than to get the seasons individually, but DVD collectors like me want to see the things we spend so much money on be complete and as flawless as possible.  I just wanted to alert other buyers to this irritating little glitch. I've seen Star Trek the First Season in stores, and by itself it has the slip cover. Again, its omission from the 3-Season boxed set is senseless!
B002IVLH60|3.0|Not Pearl Jam's best.  Johnny Guitar is the best song.  If you are just getting into Pearl Jam, check out Ten, VS, Yield, and definitely Pearl Jam (the albumn that is).
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The story, the settings, the acting-all top notch!! It is hard to find decent television programming, but Downton Abbey delivers.
B008LV8TSU|4.0|I thought this story was great fun.  If you are a fan of Piers Anthony then this is right up your alley.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I Loved this story, my favorite by Nicholas sparks so far!  Will definitely recommend this book to all my friends!
B003VANOFY|2.0|I used to love my headset.  Updated to windows 8 and have had nothing but problems.<br />connection between itself to its base drops about every 5 mins.<br /><br />Audio quality for the mic is in a higher pitch when on team speak.<br /><br />If I set the default device to be my computer speakers it will then not recognize the usb headset when I try to switch it back.<br />The last few weeks have been a nightmare. Reading many forums I have not found any fixes that work.<br /><br />I can safely say I will probably not buy another logitech headset again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game. My cousin was talking about how she had wanted me to see if there was multiplayer on it and if so she wanted me to play it. But I'm like I don't even have the game. So when I get home I search for it and download it. I'm glad I did because I've only been playing this for like an hour and it's one of my favorite game already.
B001EN71DQ|5.0|What can I say?  Pretty good stuff.  Not as good as the originals, but still really good.  Plus it has Natalie Portman in it.  Not the best actress, but I do not mind.
B00AFEXRME|4.0|Love anything denzel Washington does. The movie was sad but interesting. Def buying this movie right away. I loved it
B004J4XGN6|4.0|Great roadmap for how to implement and excellent ideas for how to improve your own operation.<br /><br />The Lean Startup will help you apply the scientific method to your vision for a new business. All concepts are well presented and followed up with real examples from modern successful companies. Overall it has inspired me to think different about how I approach introducing innovation to established businesses, a necessity for survival in today's fast-paced and constantly changing economy powered by software and internet services.

B000ETQRCM|5.0|One of their best alumns to date!  I have been a fan since Ten, and I think this albumn is right up there at the top.  They need to do more like this!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best mobile of the year so far. Still dont get how that fat officer can keep up, its kinda funny though, but yes best mobile games of the year so far
B001EAWMGA|1.0|I was so disappointed to get a movie that was not about the Outlander Series by Diana Gabaldon.  It was listed along with her other excellent books and because of the name and juxaposition on Amazon, I ordered it.  A disclaimer should be used if an automated system put the two identical titles together.
1565114205|3.0|This book came highly recommended from a coworker of mine. I thought a lot of the research in this book was predictable and almost common sense, but still a good, quick read. The basics of the system are a good foundation for any B2B salesmen.
B001DMJ9VA|3.0|This is a mixed review: 5 stars for service, 1.5 stars for product quality. See that little gray box in the lower left of the cover?  Well, I now know that means the dvd is for european dvd players and won't work on us dvd players.  The marvello folks were very good about communicating and follow up after I informed them the dvd would not work and I received a full refund for the purchase after I returned the package.  I was surprised they had not figured this out on their own but nonetheless, I would certainly do business with them again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun! I sit and play it all day long. Its challenging and really great. I love it and play it all the time. I lo e to compete against all my facebook
B0000000LI|5.0|Bought this for my mom as a Christmas present.  She used to have this on casette and played it until the tape was stretched and the sound was distorted.
B007L24T52|3.0|Not disappointed, but almost. The author has to look more around in world and try to give his protagonists more personal history and forget the adulation of the military, among other things.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|It fits perfectly with my kindle after losing my cable during a move. I would recommend this prduct highly to anyone who needs a replacement cable.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Very moving, the ending was surprising. Nicely done.I'm looking forward to her next novel. I know the discussion at book club will be very interesting.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I enjoyed the wonderful and whimsical story  line. The details painted a good picture. I also enjoyed the happy ending.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|While reading you go through so many different emotions. The story of Marcus Luttrell and his fallen brothers is so incredibly inspirational.
B00003CXCT|5.0|These are are remastered versions of the movies with new computer animated special effects that they released in the 1990s.  Very well done.  Goes without saying that the story is a classic.
B00632HWOG|5.0|All I can say is sinnple and easy to download and use.  If you cannot get your e-mail to work on the Kindle Fire download this app., its free
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It helps to put everything from the other 2 books together. Could not put it down. I wish there was another book to come.
1936608898|5.0|Very informative and covers everything you would want to know in order to change your eating. They have all the &#34;science-y&#34; jargon in easy to understand language that makes sense. A must read!
B003LQMZS0|5.0|My baby has a hard time time holding on to toys. I like this giraffe because the velcro strap allows me to hang it on her gym, on her carrier, or on the bar above her play pen. Also, she likes to hold it in her stroller or swing. The soft giraffe is easy for her to hold and has many toys in one. It also has a crinkle sound area on the giraffes tummy that my baby really likes.
B001EBV0NU|5.0|Anybody who actted wanted to be in this film. I watch if more than once but I still keep noticing things.
B002BWP49C|4.0|I'm a huge fan of the novels but not the films.......and yet, I have to own/watch them. Go figure. DVD's arrived when they were supposed to and were in perfect condition.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I read a lot of Tom's books he is great at explaining and knowing of all the important characters is his books this book is no different. As soon as you decide to like or hate someone in this book they get a bullet to the head lol. It was really hard to put this book down. If you like his books you need to read this one.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|The Wool no longer blinding me.  After a good friend recommended Wool to me I was very excited to read it.  The fact that both of us having a huge appetite for post-apocalyptic stories only intrigued me more.  Suffice to say I basically justified my Kindle purchase just to read this story.  I was NOT disappointed!!  I could hardly wait to get home from work just to continue the story.  Hugh Howdy spins a masterful web of complex human interaction and intrigue in the close confines of our tubular future.
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|Great acting and interesting time period -  but the story line is SLOW.  Movie starts to pick up towards the second half.  It's OK.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love temple run 2. It's even better than temple run 1..... hey that rhymes :-) I love it it is the best it works great on my kindle
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I downloaded this app on my Kindle, but It won't open. There seems to be a problem with it. :(
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Perfect from the beginning to the end. This book is full of love, passion, comedy, and of course a heartfelt story line that all comes together so perfectly. Holder must be fictional because guys like Holder do not exist, he is now a Book Hero. He was perfect and confident. Aside from Holder, Six and Breckin were hilarious.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I swear, it deleted all my progress and I'm so pissed fox it and I will tell people to get it
B003TJR2HS|3.0|The product came quick and in excellent condition. It will not work with the i Pad 1.  It would let you plug in the i Pad and update without removing the cover but it will Not let charge the i Pad. So it defeated the reason I ordered it I need both.
B00ARAO720|3.0|eh - this one was only ok.  I liked the suspense but wish there was more to the story.  Great acting by Joseph Gordon-Levitt.  If you are a big fan of his - you'll probably enjoy the movie.
B000FC1HBY|3.0|this book pissed me off because Arya just went through too much and Sansa made me want to hit her. but  then again, I have to give it to Martin, he made get emotionally involved with the characters. so kudos to him, I am currently reading A Dance With Dragons, so he must be doing something right
B004LWZWGK|4.0|This is a very good blu-ray, and a good price. By having it I have the complete Dark Knight series.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|All the rave comments which we have heard and read for seasons 3 and 4 apply here, dialogue, acting, humor, drama... But cannot say more or I would spoil other viewers fun!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome I spend at least an hour a day playing it every day I have the Rio addition.
B00683JK9K|3.0|The puzzles are nice, but this app has some significant problems.  Rotating pieces is way too much of a pain.  You find yourself just tap, tap, tapping away hoping the next tap will get the piece to rotate.  That is, if THE PIECE DOESN'T DISAPPEAR COMPLETELY!  Someone mentioned there were missing pieces. They probably just had a piece or more disappear when they were trying to rotate them.  Bottom line:  it's just too frustrating to try to put together a puzzle.<br /><br />Edit:  I'm going to up my rating by a star.  For whatever reason, I'm having less of a problem rotating pieces, although it is still a little hit and miss at times and I really don't like the \\"double tap\\" method used to rotate a piece.  In order to rotate a piece 270 degrees you have to tap at least 6 times.  And there's still the problem of pieces getting lost, although that's not as bad when the double-tap is working ok.  Occasionally the piece ends up under the puzzle and you can find it by moving the puzzle out of the way, but on at least one occasion one piece was under the tray of pieces and I could just barely see the edge while another piece was gone completely.
B008602KQI|5.0|Love this movie.  Love the book and the series.  If you haven't seen it - you must have been hiding in a cave.  If you watch it and you don't &#34;get it&#34; then read the book.  In fact, I'd highly recommend reading the book PRIOR to watching the movie.  Can't wait for the next one to come out!!
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I almost gave up on this series because Arya's story was just plain depressing, however, Martin keeps coming up with twist after twist so i can't put them down
B0021L8V1Q|4.0|This was offered at a good price, especially since it was a blue ray package. I've already viewed it twice.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I go through books pretty quickly so I tend to look for more than 400 pages. This series never fails to keep me interested until the end.
B00B7G3Y4U|3.0|I love horror movies. They're just so much fun. The Paranormal Activity movies are some of my favorites b/c the suspense is almost overwhelming. If you're watching a movie to watch guts splatter and fly, you probably don't care for these particular films. However, if you are moved by the psychological and the suspenseful, you'll probably have more appreciation for this. Throughout these movies you KNOW something is going to happen, something creepy...something's hiding in the background to shock you. In that way, PA4 was great. There are some really good jumps.<br />However, I was disappointed and almost confused by the plot points revealed toward the end. It didn't seem logical to me. Also, this movie seemed to bring out way more questions and didn't answer any. Great if there's going to be another one, not so great if this is the last installment.<br />If you liked the previous three Paranormal Activity films, you will like this one.<br />Overall, the intensity and suspense was great, but the plot line got a little wacky toward the late middle and end (at least to me.)
B007BFSYMS|5.0|It is a nice app to use to go to sleep with. Can't really go wrong with it and it is easy to use
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app teaches kids the basics of caring for a real horse.  The graphics are awesome and realistic.  I love this.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|we start to see the characters more clearly. and the characters you once loved you start to hate and the ones you once hated you start to love.
B001DRF84W|4.0|This is a very good movie, the best story of the Hulk's origin that I've ever seen. An essential watch before the Avengers. Excellent price.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|Great cd. Love Thankful and Breakaway too. The third one is ok but definitely not one of my favorties. Saw her in concert, good show.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Okay so I brought it to school today and the pen cap fell off on the road and when i went off the bus it was there. Cars ran over it and it still works! awsome product!!!!!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This book  is captivating and keeps you  at the edge of your seat to the very end.  I cannot wait to see what awaits in the third part of this series.
B00138GZAC|5.0|Smooth & easy after a stressful day. Several years old, but still a great one to wind down a day
B001MTENOC|1.0|I do not believe much of what he says. If want the truth about souls and reincarnation,stick to Edgar cayce .
B005IZLPMY|5.0|This Captain America blu-ray is excellent! It was a very good deal and was shipped promptly. I have viewed it three times.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this game kind of better than temple run and temple run 2.<br /><br />Functions:<br />Works fine but sometimes I do the wrong down swipes and it thinks I am jumping<br /><br />Also<br />You can use a skateboard and other powerups!
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I use this app when I'm working on my homework to help myself better understand certain words that don't quite make sense. :)

B0007TKNII|4.0|Got this movie to prep me for the Halloween costume character. I liked the movie, especially the details. A nice price too. Glad I have it in my collection.
1405910259|5.0|A fantastic continuation of the first book, blurring the lines between obsession and love, and makes you wanting to get the last installment NOW! ... but you must wait until May 2013.
B002ZG9774|5.0|I love this movie because of the performance and singing. I recommand this movie. If u love Chicago then u will love this movie!
B002BWP49C|5.0|It is exactly what I asked for. Couldn't find the movie anywhere in stores. My husband found it on here.
B0068THAGY|4.0|2011PG13: This movie would be good even without Spielberg's name on the cover. All the teen actors are good, but Fanning was EXCELLENT. Decent plot, nice action, good acting, excellent sound, the military chasing a subterranean alien, and all while the kids are making their own super 8 movie. What more can you ask for? I was thoroughly entertained and will remember this one. MFJLabs 4x
B0020MKTOS|5.0|&#34;Zipperhead&#34;... need I say more?<br />ha: this movie is hilarious and heartfelt at the same time.  perfect gift for oldtimers that love CLint Eastwood
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This is the best super hero action movie; it goes beyond my childhood fantasies. I watch it again and again. A good deal, and was sent as soon as it was released.
B0012PDVQ2|1.0|I received the instant video free since I purchased the blu-ray DVD for my son. Frankly I don't know why he likes it. Maybe it is for the visual effects. I always like Harrison Ford films but this is definitely not one of his best.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I love this book it was fun to read. I laugh I was serious and awesome. People read this book
B005HSL626|5.0|I downloaded this game for myself but my only complaint is that between my two boys and my husband I didn't get to play it for almost a week. I had to hide my Kindle while it was charging and then wait until they went to bed to play it.  :)
B00ARAO720|3.0|2012PG13: No big surprises here, but decent action. Nice man-on-bike-in-Manhattan footage, and mixed rock oldies soundtrack. All-in-all, Dania Ramirez & Jamie Chung (the two beauties), and the see-into-the-future accident graphics ultimately make this film work. MFJLabs 3x
B001NLKXK2|4.0|It gave me some insight to what Alzheimer's might feel like. Both of my parent's are currently suffering from dementia.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's a fun little game just wish it didn't take so long to collect enough money to buy stuff. The tasks take real time which are a bit of a problem with me.
1582406723|5.0|I bought this as a present for my boyfriend who had just been watching the tv series and he loved it. The art work is amazing and I'm sure he'll be buying more of them soon. Really great product.
0553386697|5.0|I love this book because it explains why non-violent communication (Dr.Rosenberg) works so well.<br /><br />This Whole-Brain Child book is very practical. It helps parents learn easy strategies that respect the child where they are at, with their brain development.<br /><br />I think this connection with your young child could help avoid many challenges when they become teen-agers.
B002OR0RP0|1.0|Downloaded it and payed for it for my Kindle fire, while we were out of town, and it never worked.
B0058VW36U|1.0|@k so if u want free apps like instageam were u can post things and this app for free look in this store download everything pro it is free and great so i hope u take my advice and not buy this app

6305558167|5.0|Ah-nal bathrak ! Üd vust B'eh Thüd ! Daquiel Thien-vey !!<br /><br />Forget any other cinematic attempt of the King Arthur story. This IS THE Definitive one.<br /><br />From the costumes, scenery, and soundtrack, to Nicol Williamson's (Merlin's) accent...<br />This flick is magical throughout... and not in a childish way either. It's dark, eirie, and sexual.<br />I saw this flick 5x when it came out at theatres in 1980 (i was 11). It provided my 1st view of a sex scene ! LOL ...(Thank you ticket taker ! ... for letting me & the boys in, despite it's 'R' rating).<br /><br />One of my All-Time favorite flicks. A must have in any collection. Just a damn good work of art in all regards, from the Director (John Boorman) of 'Deliverance'.

B005K17RU0|5.0|Exactly what I needed in a weather app. The fact that I can just slide down the bar and get a quick peek at the temp is great. Compared to my states weather site online and its always accurate down to the last snowflake.
0307269981|5.0|Definitely not pop culture! A truly fascinating look into the less desirable strata of our our seemingly civilised society<br />It challenges your concepts of right and wrong as the &#34; heroes&#34; indulge in some pretty savage revenge behaviours and looks deeply at a fairly dark and brutal side of society
B002RI9PS6|4.0|A classic example of why one shouldn't judge a book by its cover... There can't be many people who want to read a history of tractors!<br /><br />I loved this, it told what must be a fairly common story in a believable and occasionally humourous way...<br /><br />I enjoyed the read, but it's not one that would make me keep an eye out for any of the author's future books...
B000JIHP88|4.0|The mobile moves perfectly.  The leaves open and close and the animals move around in a circle.  It is very heavy and must be attach to a crib with slates.  I'm just concern about the batteries.  It seems to drain them quickly.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|So entertaining and twisting such suspense couldn't put it down. Can't wait to watch the movies and read the rest of the books
B005RYF5JA|5.0|I love these gals and this is the only one of their CD's I didn't have. I have quite a collection going on and these girls have such beautiful voices and the CD itself  is digitally enhanced so the sound is great!
0765325950|5.0|&#34;finally I have the whole set! Now I can read them all again&#34;.<br />Those were my sons words on seeing it.<br />The book arrived so quickly I had to hide it for 2 weeks until his birthday.<br />It arrived in perfect condittion and we are both enjoying it thoroughly<br />Incidentally, it appeared in the bookshops here 10 days after I received my copy, only in paperback and for the same price as my hardcover copy.<br />Thankyou Amazon
B008J05EL8|2.0|Office suite pro ought to come with basic fonts included.  If one wants special fonts for special purpose then we buy it.<br />This is just a marketing gimic.  The popup came when I tried the free version of office suite.  Thinking I would be able create and edit a new file on my Kindle Fire I bought the fonts.  Then I figured out that Pro was necessary to edit. but I had already bought fonts. @#$%^&*  don't know if Pro works without fonts.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Have to learn how to use this thing, but it looks great and I am sure it works fine. A friend of mine has one and said its just great
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun and addicting I love it so very very much. It is so hard to stop playing.
B008MC175A|5.0|I really enjoyed all these movies and now by purchasing this set,I got the whole collection and in Blu-Ray too.YA-HOO! I'm building a library of movies I like & if their ones I really like,Blu-Ray is great. At this price,it was a bargain & the bonus is they are enhanced sound,Great for my surround sound. Practically there. Very pleased with my purchase.Definitely reccomend.
B002VHI8J0|5.0|This is a book worth calling in sick to work for. The characters are interesting, and while the detail in their dialect is challenging for the reader, this makes them believable and made me interested in their fates. I felt like I was thrown head first into the plot line and the shift between characters and time was very interesting.<br /><br />The only problem I had with the book was carving out enough time to finish it, as little bits of the plot and dialogue kept popping into my mind.
B000687M48|5.0|In my opinion my favorite Evanescence CD because of the concert. I like all the bonus content. No need to say that the singer Amy Lee is awe inspiring
B0053O89JM|3.0|I admit, that I was sad to see this series come to an end, but I expected a little more bang for my buck when finally saying goodbye to these characters. The series deserved better.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best online game ever.  It lets you explore and stuff like that.  You will love this game!!
B00AE2LJVS|3.0|I love the amazon movie service but this movie was just ok for me. It was interesting but I don't know maybe its just noy my thing. Others my like it.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|I read this book on a recommendation, and was both disappointed and satisfied. I had two issues with the book. First, the book starts on a pretty unreasonable coincidence, which the plot relies on. And while the plot is pretty thin, it took the characters most of the book to figure it out. I made an educated guess halfway through about the plot, and was a little bit disappointed that there was not a twist in the end. Secondly, the author likes to describe in detail what the characters are doing. Which could be interesting, but gets repetitive after a while.<br /><br />On the whole, this is a decent read. But don't expect it to be anything like the Reacher movie.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|Be warned. Although it is a good tv show it is absolutely nothing like the books and in most cases does the exact opposite that the author would do
B005FISBTO|1.0|In case any of you haven't seen Dexter Season 6 and were planning to watch the DVDs, DO NOT WATCH THE SHOWTIME PREVIEWS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE DISK! Leave the room. Make a sandwich. Go to the john. The previews show the final sequence for the season YOU ARE ABOUT TO WATCH. The folks at Showtime are morons.
B0020BUWX2|4.0|It was an interesting book. The idea that the body and the spirit can be separated for a length of time and be aware of it makse sense to me. I liked her idea of choice to stay or leave. That is no so unbelievable to me.
0547848412|5.0|I've never left a review before, but am an avid reader and believe in this book so much that I bug anyone and everyone that loves a good story and appreciates the truth found in fiction to read it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great game to play on breaks. Easy to follow,  earn points. Passes time quickly.  Does freeze at times., Playing on a Kindle fire.
B000K4X5XA|5.0|It has been thirty-five years since the late Christopher Reeve first soared across movie screens as the legendary Man of Steel.  But it doesn't really seem all that long ago, at least not when viewers first see Superman in costume at the Fortress of Solitude as he flies toward the camera and makes a remarkable banking turn in front of our eyes.  In my opinion, Reeve remains the only actor who can make one believe that Superman truly lives; it will forever be his legacy to moviegoers that a godlike super-hero could be fully realized as a personable human being that anyone could easily relate to.  Sure, the passage of time hasn't been kind to the film's badly outdated costumes, but, otherwise, &#34;Superman: The Movie&#34; still outclasses virtually any film in its genre.  It is pretty impressive that director Richard Donner and his production crew could conjure a totally believable Superman without the benefit of modern CGI and still make an appealing film for a wide spectrum of viewers.  Specifically, Donner's film proves that graphic violence, excessive profanity, and explicit content are not required for an entertaining movie experience.<br /><br />With the classy opening sequence of a young boy flipping open an issue of &#34;Action Comics,&#34; as the camera then pans up into the sky towards the majestic darkness of deep space, composer John Williams' timeless theme sparks the imagination that something truly special is about to happen.  Director Richard Donner, with the aid of among others, script doctor Tom Mankiewicz, and an excellent ensemble cast, brings the &#34;Superman&#34; world to real life and establishes a common path for other big-budget super heroes Batman, Spider-Man, the X-Men, and the Avengers to follow by utilizing a first-class script and talented actors who are not ashamed to wear flashy spandex.<br /><br />The film simplistically is a three-part play: the Krypton sequence (with Marlon Brando as Jor-El); Smallville (with Glenn Ford as Jonathan Kent); and Metropolis (with Margot Kidder as Lois Lane; Jackie Cooper as Perry White; Marc McClure as Jimmy Olsen; and, of course, Gene Hackman, as a delightfully sinister Lex Luthor).  New to the storyline are Lex's two groupies: bumbling Otis (Ned Beatty) and sultry Eve Teschmacher (Valerie Perrine), who help Hackman's egotistical Lex (as he calls himself, &#34;The greatest criminal mind of our time,&#34; and &#34;fiendishly gifted,&#34;) add a wonderful element of tongue-in-cheek humor.  Case in point: watch an annoyed Lex's reaction to Otis having scribbled his own proposed little town (&#34;Otisberg?,&#34; &#34;Otisberg?&#34;) on to the scheming villain's idealized map of what California will look like after it is hit by a nuclear missile.  Also, Donner cleverly plants the seed for an inevitable sequel at the beginning rather than at the end with cameos by three Krypton super-villains (General Zod, Ursa, and Non).  By vowing that even Jor-El's heirs will one day kneel before him, the tyrannical Zod (Terrence Stamp) instantly becomes a classic movie villain ... with only a few moments of screen time.<br /><br />Lastly, I will address the film's ending, as there is a legitimate cause for criticism.  After nearly two and a half hours of leisurely-paced, first class entertainment (including the breathtaking Superman & Lois &#34;first date&#34; flying sequence), the script resorts to a time travel gimmick to help resolve the finale.  Although originally intended for &#34;Superman II,&#34; as according to Donner, the idea makes Superman look unbeatable if he can alter history to his liking at will.  However, Reeve's anguished facial reactions make this plot twist work as viewers are reminded by voice-overs of Superman's past with his two fathers, and exactly why he chooses emotion over cosmic responsibility. The ending should be taken as a leap of faith that even the Man of Steel sometimes has to find a way to beat impossible odds.  Still, my favorite moment comes just before the closing credits with Superman's confident fly-by in space over Earth signaling that he will be back for further adventures ensuring our world is in safe hands.  Backed by the opening bars of Superman's theme, Reeve accomplishes a most satisfying farewell without saying a word.<br /><br />Even today, whenever I ponder horrific tragedies reported by the news media, I still visualize Christopher Reeve's Superman flying out of seemingly nowhere to rescue Margot Kidder's Lois Lane from certain death dangling from a wrecked helicopter from the roof of the Daily Planet.  It reminds me that real-life heroism isn't a comic book; it is really about being there unselfishly when others are in need.<br /><br />Rating: 10/10.  The blu-ray and DVD special features offer a treasure trove for fans, including music cues; screen tests; trailers; and some insightful documentaries, which are well worth your spare time.with Superman's confident fly-by in space over Earth signaling that he will be back for further adventures ensuring our world is in safe hands.

B0053O89Z6|5.0|I keep waiting for this show to drop off in entertainment value, but it continues to deliver season after season.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I've enjoyed both Temple Run games, but the second one has a few issues.  First, the screen is jumpy, even when you hold your device completely still.  Second, half the time when you click on the 'save me' button, the game freezes and you have to restart it.  Third - unlike the first game, you cannot adjust sensitivity settings for this game.  Fourth - I wish the game makers would install a 'slow down' button!  Honestly, the more you progress in the game, the faster it gets, so what's the purpose?  IS there one?  But for a free game, it's pretty cool...hope to see #3 come out one day...with changes.
B006LSZECO|2.0|The plot and characters were not well thought of. I could not wait to finish it as it was slow and the story just dragged on miserably.
B00008EY7H|5.0|My second trip to Cirque Du Soileil, is a great show  the music the stunts are amazing , I was back again this DVD is awesome
B0027MJU00|4.0|Another satisfying read by Flynn. She creates situations that the reader is eager to read about. The book keeps you hooked to the end.
B00APJLFEG|2.0|I thought it might have something in there for me, like many of the animated movies do to at least keep the adults interested.  Not this one.  Not a chuckle.  If you're not in the 6-10 age group, don't bother.
B000SP1SH6|5.0|Great movie about a jerk who can't progress beyond one day in his life till he stops being the jerk he is. Some might think he's so obnoxious they'll stop watching the movie, but it's necessary to the story line. Just stay with it till the end and you'll find yourself rewatching it again and again.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|There were so many twists and turns and the ending was a surprise! One of the best mystery thrillers I have ever read!
B007Y36K46|4.0|Great visual effects along with an intriguing story line with a lot of twists and turns non-stop action and a feel good ending.

B005NJU8PA|3.0|When I get a book about cooking, I expect most of the pages to be about cooking, the problem with this book is that at least 70% is not about cooking (and half of them talks about other books of the author, or gives examples from other books of this author....)<br /><br />The book is full about advertisement of items to bye and sometimes with direct links of where to get them. (specially that it's not relevant to me, since I am not living in the US....).<br /><br />I have got the Kindle editions, I have the Kindle Touch and the book is really heavy for it. it takes for it too much time to open/change page.<br />Plus, the kindle edition have problems with pages sometimes... Blank pages with background only, and lines of text out of the window.
B007G9D5JQ|5.0|I am enjoying listening to these Vinyls. The sound is warm and an amazing selection of Blind Guardian's repertoire. Listening to this collection is bringing back a lot of memories.I am incredibly happy with this purchase and would recommend these to anyone who is a Blind Guardian Fan or would love to get an intimate immersion in Blind Guardian's Work.

B006LSZECO|4.0|Was tough for me to get through the first 30% of this book, but once it started taking twists and turns it was very interesting!  Ending is a shocker!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this after I watched the movie. I am amazed that the movie followed the book so well. That speaks very well for the author.
B00683JK9K|4.0|Kindle Fire, no issues rotating pieces if the &quot;rotate&quot; icon is selected.  Just double tap.  As for pieces missing, I had one go missing but it isn't gone.  Simply moved to the layer below the puzzle instead of being on top.  Slide the puzzle around and presto, missing piece appears!  Looking forward to completing all the puzzles.

0765325950|5.0|When I first got a copy of the 12th Wheel of Time book, which marked the beginning of Brandon Sanderson's stint as the relief pitcher for the Mighty Jordan and his arm of strikingly amazing literary tomes... I kept that book on my shelf for a month before opening the cover.<br /><br />I was scared yo.<br /><br />I was terrified that I'd experience what my friend who read the Dune series had gone through in reading the post-Frank Herbert novels. What if this new guy sucked? Well after a month I had to know, so I bit the bullet and opened it up. I was dreading the point where I'd feel a shift between what Jordan had written before the end of his life and what Sanderson had written after. That never happened for me. The entirety of &#34;The Gathering Storm&#34; felt like the book that Jordan would have written. So when Book 13 &#34;The Towers of Midnight&#34; hit the streets, I was champing at the bit to tear into and it was even better... oddly enough it was a little bit better because I could feel Sanderson's presence around the words. This was still Jordan's story, but the words being used were a bit different and it was a good difference.<br /><br />The waiting for &#34;A Memory of Light&#34; was unbearable, but bear it I did and it was worth the wait. From beginning to end it's the culmination of over a dozen books building up a mountain of a story and then letting that mountain erupt. It's like the line from the opening of Black Sunshine narrated by Iggy Pop &#34;The Wheels of his mustang exploding on the highway like a slug from a .45&#34; the book takes off and reaches a cruising speed that it maintains for a good long while. Then it hits a long stretch with no curves in the road and no exit ramps. The pedal is put to the metal, the engine is given a chance to roar into higher gear as the speed limit is raised from 55mph to 80mph and the the asphalt zips by underneath. Eventually a sign comes p announcing that the speed limit is dropping to 65mph and turns start coming up again along with exit ramps coming up a lot more frequently before almost as though to say &#34;you can take a break now.... if you want to.&#34; but who wants to get off of the highway now when the journey is going along so damn well. Almost before ya know it, there's a bunch of cars ahead and they're slowing down. So as you slow down and get behind them you think maybe it's a traffic jam but nope... It's a funeral procession and it's time to pay your respects. Turns out that funeral is at a rest stop off the highway and you are now pulling into it. After you exit the vehicle, you're allowed to walk around the most beautiful rest stop ya ever did see and when it's all over, you can't get back into the car you've been driving but you can go pick up another car. There's millions of cars that can be your for the driving. Although, it might be nice to walk around for a bit and stretch your legs before sitting down again.<br /><br />I know it might seem pretentious to use the car metaphor to describe the pacing of the plot, but that's because I'm not gonna say one word about the plot directly. If you're reading the review of A Memory of Light you're either someone who knows what the Wheel of Time series is like from other books, or you're curious enough to risk spoilers about a series you've ever read. If you wanna know if you should read the series again after having stopped for one reason or another well... I think you should. If you stopped because Jordan died and you don't want to try the new guy, that's something I'd say you should reconsider. If you stopped because you didn't like where the series was going after so many books then I can only say that it's up to you whether or not to give it another chance. If ye've never read the series at all, go pick up a copy of Eye of the World and give it a try.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is a book for everyone. This was truly a book that was written from the heart. No theories, just the facts. Loved it!
B0031RS8SA|5.0|This was an excellent read. Very informative and realistic. Shows the immigration to England of a young women from a small town in Bangladesh for an arranged marraige. How she developed over the years and how she was able to change for the new environment. The difficulties she had in adopting to the new environment and culture, were not shared with her daughters. They were been educated in London and therefore had a different perspective about Banglsdesh. Her husband was not able to change to the new environment and thus lived with an ideal vision of what Bangledesh really was. When he returned home alone to Bangledesh the realism was somewhat different.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|Took 3 minutes to install.  Works just as described. Solved our dark laundry porch issue in less time than installing new AC wiring.<br />***UPDATE: Its now 3 years later and this thing is still working great, now in our garden shed. Have never even had to change the batteries!
B0029O08WA|5.0|Not disapointed at all in purchasing this CD along with the first one!  Excellent music and it matches scenes in the movie so well!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Chose this book for an original view of a long lived tradition. I was not disappointed. We get to see the battle for the survival of mankind from the shoulder`s point of view as well as he family man protecting his lost home to the invaders, down to the lost soldier behind enemy lines. All told with original points of view and original voices. Zombie book or no this is a good political book for our current climate.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Very long but very indebted on one of americas most facinating CEO's of our times. Learn just about everything you would ever want to know about apple...
B000UZNRS2|3.0|Didn't hold my interest.  The dialog wandered and the plots not believable.  I know it's a novel, but there was no suspense.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|We never saw the series and it was getting great reviews.  We were loyal viewers of '24' and were told Homeland was similar with many twists and turns and suspense. And they were right!  I'm now waiting for Season 2 to be available.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the Lord and love having the bible on my Kindle.  Make me want to read it more and more..
B000PDYVVG|1.0|Good I enjoyed it<br />Made me think a little deeper I not me and my thoughts. I would  recommend it.
B00AYDC5HY|2.0|I loved the characters, the puppets and the Tim Burton graphic style and music, but this was more of a kid's movie than a kid/adult movie, and it got kind of tedious after a while. 2 out of 3 of us fell asleep! Great for kids tho!
B0060AY6FO|3.0|It was interesting to see this authors's view of Pemberley after the wedding of Darcy and Elizabeth and Bingley and Jane.  Good description of setting and their houses, their loves for each other.  The event in the Pemberley woodland, takes the story line to the Wickham couple and their craziness.  It kinda got lost in the addition of the cottage family, and their involvement in the lives of the main characters...........I had trouble getting to the end.<br /><br />Anyone who knows the story of the Bennett sisters and the love stories of the girls, may like to see this author's interpretation of what happened next.  It started out great, then, I was disappointed....
B0091574VI|2.0|Nothing you've not already seen in Discovery.<br />The story about the little orphan chimpanzee not that original either.<br />Save the 2 hours, go to the park or something.
B000JML7EC|5.0|I loved this book as a child and now my grandson loves it.  Easy transaction and easy to find.  Thanks.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Holy cow! I stumbled onto Wool by pure dumb luck. I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought these books but I'm glad I did. Mr. Hugh kept me on the edge of my seat for the entire  length press books. I can't wait to read more from him. His use of imagery is so great and  thorough. You really connect with the characters. Highly recommend reading this series.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I really have no clue what this game does but it's one of my kids favorites so I'm giving it 5 stars.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|What a great movie.  Bought this for my mother who cannot get out to a movie theater easily and she loved it !<br />Great story, cast and talent - transports you back in time.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Because it was free, I can live with the occasional ads that show up prior to starting a game. I'ts a fun Solitaire and has several options of play.
0060254920|5.0|My nieces and nephews love this book, as my children did when they were young!  Now I give it to my great nieces & nephews.
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|Jeremy Renner did a great job in the movie. Liked how his story weaved in with the other Bourne movies. Worth watching.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|After a long time searching for this series, all I have to say is that it's way better that I expected!!!<br />I know a lot of people complain about the lack of the original music but, even as I think it was an important part of Daria, the lack of it is not as important once you have it.<br />And the fact that it also comes with the 2 movies is amazing.<br />I can't think of a better package!
B0027MJU00|4.0|If you enjoy surprise endings then this is the book for you.  All the way through I kept switching my thoughts on who I thought the culprit was.  It was exactly what the name implies:  dark at times to read but it still kept my full attention.  I would recommend this to all who enjoy mysteries and startling endings.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I got this game for my 5-yr old grandson to play but I play it just as often as he does. The object is to earn &#34;money&#34; by playing a match-three type game so you can buy fish, food and comfort items and decorations for your fish tank. There are lots of decorations to buy and everything needed for your fish to live comfortably in their tank. There are 3 tanks also which you can alternate between. The only criticism I have is that the decorations appear smaller than I would like them to be in the tank. But that is a minor issue. I believe another version of this game is also available for the P.C.<br /><br />The fish and various plants are depicted semi-realistically and with common names so you can learn a bit about them. One of the tanks is a coral reef with different fish and plants/corals for purchase.<br /><br />This would be a great way to teach a child something about what is needed to populate and care for a real aquarium.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton seamlessly moves into Season Three with flawless production standards, grand costumes, breathtaking cinematography, and of course, the finest acting seen on television. We continue our journey into our favorite characters' lives, intrigued, laughing, crying, angered and rejoicing right along with them. Really, television just doesn't get any better than this.<br /><br />(Spoiler Alert: I got the Season Pass  and I've watched the whole season! Don't talk about Downton Abbey with Season Pass holders; they just might slip and whisper this seasons' breath conclusion holding  to you.)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Read it  in two days because I had to read it every chance I got!  VERY WELL WRITTEN.  The author did a great job  placing you right in the story. I would recommend this book for every age of readers!
0545265355|5.0|Once you start, you can't stop!<br />The content of the books are great! The storyline is complete and intriguing. You can actually relate to the characters!<br />And about the quality of the materials, well they are amazing! the box they come in is excellent, a little bit small but overall great.<br />If you're a fan of the series, this are the books you have to have.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|This book is one of the best I've read in a long time. I like how there are many surprises. I look forward to the other two books of this series.
B004JN1CW4|1.0|I just thought the third book was stretching and trying to combined all 3 books together.  It was really perdictible and not a lot of action.  The ending wasn't good either.  I was really disappointed because I  enjoyed the other 2 books.
0634022296|4.0|I'm a beginner guitarist and wanted to learn to play a few Beatles hits. The way each song provides the details for each chord was very convenient for me to skim though the songs and determine which ones I would start with simply based on the amount of different chords needed for the song. I would say that a beginner can easily play at least 5 songs within a week or two. It's a great start, especially when using youtube to hear the song while you practice. Good luck!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My wife and I had almost given up on TV, but we try to catch each week of Downton Abbey. When we miss a week on TV, I just stream that show from Amazon. I'm thankful to Amazon for carrying all these programs, and up to date too!<br /><br />If you are new to Downton Abbey, you need to start with the first season and the first show, as you then get all the character development and the reasons for certain situations. At this point, I'm hoping Daisy accepts her father-in-law's offer.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I love having this on my kindle, easy to use, large print, and i usally have my kindle with me but not a calculator.  Cell phone calculators are very small for my eyes.  Does not do complex mathamatics but i rarely need that when not in my office.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Awesome!<br />G g tv B-) Gibb g b B-) B-) :/ B-) vBulletin g Gibb c tv by v. Byhi B-) bucking  h B-) B-) check exact  c
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works very well.  So easy to use with big buttons...<br />There are handy features that make this app a great tool.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A tale of a totalitarian state and a young girl and boy who defeat it. Sometimes gruesome, the story is very well told and hard to put down, with an ending that leaves room for more.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|The horse is beautiful and I like to be involved in the competing,but it takes to long to make money and get gems.  I don't want to purchase them.  Also, the horses energy gets sapped to fast.  Sadly, I'm finding myself a little bored and god knows if I'll ever be able to afford another horse.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I didn't like this App until I started combining sounds  much more than white noise or water sounds...here you can pick and mix your ambience. Love it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome game great graphics fluid controls a must for those animal lovers like me so hurry up download it . Best horse game by far
B001JIFYSA|5.0|Love Actually is one of my all time favorite movies.  All the actors are superb.  Also, Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, Liam Neeson and Bill Nighy are among my absolute favorite actors.  This was the first movie  in which I saw Kiera Nightly.  Not only is she stunningly beautiful, she is a very talented actor.  As always, Emma Thompson and Laura Linney give stellar performances.  The movie is very refreshing in its lack of violence.  The relationships are believable.  While much of the comedy is subtle I find myself smiling and laughing throughout this film. I gave my copy to a friend.  Then I needed to cheer myself up, so I bought another copy. Like other of my favorite movies, I know I will watch it again and again. I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to laugh, cry and be amazed at the incredible creativity available in a single film.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Awesome app for kindle easy to use and you can go shopping at anytime at anyplace and its just cool
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It is hard find a BOOK that has a unique aspect of adventure and creativity that is easy on the eyes and not overtly intellectually intense. This book met my criteria and I could not/would not put until, sadly, the BOOK was done and over. I was left wanting more.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|Plenty of stations, varied music and talk, and great feature of being able to record and listen later! Get it!!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Love the brain teasers, me and my daughter had a great time figuring all the puzzles out.we can not wait until the next one comes out. Thanks again .
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|great game for the tablet! just like league of legends! so stoked to find a game like this for aneroid! yay!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This series has captured our hearts as it has so many others.  We can't wait to watch them all again some day.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|not even remotely believable, redundant from the first book and continued redundancy throughout this book... only purchased this one and the final one to make sure I didn't suddenly miss out some miraculous chance that the writing would get better. I didn't receive a miracle and I wouldn't ever purchase another story by this author again.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|If you're a fan of the graphic novel, you'll enjoy Parts I and II.  They are feature length movies each, so there you won't feel like you're only getting half of a movie with each purchase.  I was able to pick this up very cheap which was all the better.<br /><br />The animation is top notch, you will easily recognize the characters and even shot for shot recreations from the book.  The voice acting is done well and even though I have my favorite Batman voice actors, the people who acted this are awesome.<br /><br />I haven't gotten to watch much of the special features on this movie yet, but I did go through them and it seems like you're getting quite a few extras and other tidbits.  I was impressed with what the first movie had with it, especially for the price, so I don't think you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the graphic novel, or you just want to so a side of Batman that usually isn't portrayed, pick this up quick and enjoy.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Loved it, was my favorite of the G5 series so far.  Play the bonus material.  The moon phases had me stumped
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Great gameboard its big so it takes up a lot of room but its worth it because it has a ton of buttons and the lcd screen is really nice to have.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Great read....I would recommend to all. I plan to reread and I definitely think it is a book that everyone should read.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I bought all three books in the trilogy and had hoped that they would get better, but it was simply page after page of the same sex story. I would not recommend wasting your money on this trilogy unless you want a cheap cheesy porn magazine style story. No one has mind blowing orgasmic sexual encounters at every turn especially someone as naive and easily manipulated as the young girl in this story.
B0086700CM|5.0|My kids and I all love this game.  It's a &#34;time waster&#34; but it keeps us entertained.  Thanks for the fun
1606995359|5.0|&#34;Only a Poor Man&#34; (Vol. 1) brings back many, many pleasant memories of my childhood, when Uncle Scrooge and Donald and the nephews were among my favorites.  In this volume of Carl Banks' excellent work, I found the selections well chosen--and, of course, well done.  What's not to like about a miserly uber-gazillionnaire duck and his family.  And the Beagle Boys!  Comics today aren't quite the same, but these early ones are, indeed, classic--and edcuational at the same time.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Anyone in my family (ages 4-44!) can play this game and everyone loves it. The free version has plenty of levels to play/master. The ads aren't obtrusive, so we haven't bought the full version.
B008JGSM6G|2.0|This is a fairly easy game to play and it does get progressively more difficult, but I found myself bored pretty quick with the whole program.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Hi fellow gamers...I've been playing video games since  my kids were little. Actually since before that.  They all chipped in for Christmas and got me my Kindgle because I was having surgery and they thought this would be easier to handle than my laptop. And it was so much easier. I saw my daughter playing this game she got from Amazon. It looked like fun so I tried it not knowing I'd be totally addicted to Subway Surfers. I can't go on my Kindle without playing this game.It's really cool with a cop chasing you up and down the tracks, jumping on trains and getting treats along the way.Now I have my niece and nephew playing whenever they can get their little hands on my Kindle.  Anyway it's time to go play. I just love it. You will too. Oh yeah! It works much better with a stylus. Got that also from Amazon.
0316228532|5.0|I have read and taught to adult teachers almost all of the Harry Potter books.  When the first HP book came out I hailed it as a wonderful new trend in children's literature, with semi-colons and long sentences and intricate themes.  I received a great many nasty letters telling me how wrong I was, that children would never read books that were so long and involved. Okay?  Who is right now?  I claim again that Rowling's latest is of a piece of classical 19th century literature, with a Swiftean touch. Yahoos?  Perhaps...A non-too casual look into the lives of people who seem to be admired....and those who would be on the other side of the tracks....takers, not givers....off the system. I look forward to investigating the book on a second read: folks today want instant satisfaction, action and violence, trite resolutions, not the kind of Dickensian characters we see in TCV....They are Everyman....failure to care for his fellow man....except perhaps for the one already deceased person, Barry Fairbrother....One who actually cares about others.  Let's take this book seriously.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is a lot of fun and never lags and my little sister loves it when I leet her play it.<br />I would recommend it to others have fun.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is honestly one of the best I've ever played!! At first I kinda sucked lol, but I started to get a hang of doing the missions to get more points and now I'm in the eighth place out of my Facebook friends! I love the Hoover boards, it keeps the game going! I would suggest this to a friend, I actually already have a few times!!
B008D28HYS|5.0|This was recommended to me by a co-worker and I would recommend it to others if you like puzzles and brain teaser type games.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I have almost wore it out playing it. In fact I have lent it to my daughter because we both love it BUT WISH IT HAD BEEN THE WHOLE SOUNDTRACT and not just the ''Hightlights.&#34;

B005LAIHSG|5.0|Great movie! Charlise Theron does a great job!  Not your typical fairytale that's for sure!  Kristen Stewart is amazing as well.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|As soon as I picked up (downloaded, actually) this book, I loved it. `Nuff said. But this really is a great book.
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|Enjoy this game, but do not enjoy it on the Kindle Fire as well as on my Mac.  The cards do not seem to stand out as well.  Marsha
B0031QUTBA|3.0|I have played 2 seasons and I did not like the video quality. The images are slightly blurred and while they may not create too much of a problem they are still irritating when you can clearly identify the faulty video.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Blue rays are the wave of the future until something better comes along. But for now this set will do nicely. Sigourney weaver's handsome face was made for hd.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Very good and funny<br />I am collecting the whole 6 books! I am sure they will have the same greatness!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was very moving. It made me want to accept life as it is. Im not one to cry, and I'm not sure why i did. But i did at the ending. This is my new favorite  book and will be for a while.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|This book was amazing! I love any spin off of Disney and cinder was done amazingly! This was the kind of book that you would say &#34; ok one more chapter then ill put it down&#34;.... well that doesn't work here. Great book and I am so excited to read Scarlet !
B005EGXTHG|3.0|In my opinion, not well written. Not a stand-alone read.  Would make a better story if condensed with third publication.
B009JBZH54|4.0|I enjoyed  the Batman movies so naturally I purchased this. Blue ray quality audio and video. I tried a marathon at home but fell asleep. Not because the movies at  boring but because I was tired an  my couch is comfy.
B0061S073A|5.0|I love this app since I am able to hand it to my son to play with and he can't get into my stuff.  It is clean and basic just the apps you want.
B008F5YDRI|3.0|Ewan McGregor is always a pleasure to watch and I would definitely recommend this for family viewing in the rom-com genre (although a little light on the com). However, if you're looking for interesting plot twists, depth, or originality, I would look elsewhere.
B008KNUKVI|3.0|I miss the Sing Off because I love everything about acapella music.  Pentatonix has a great sound and the have revolutionized the style but for me this CD came up short.  The third track was my favorite.  The rest of the CD was just OK for me.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Such an enticing book. I loved it the whole way through and I completely recommend it to anyone who loves a good silver lining
B004SOR4H6|4.0|Works great. How else can you send messages to Beyonce letting her know her weave looked a mess at the super bowl? Twitter, that's how. And it's free so there's that.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I haven't been able to see or view the Aliens movies. Much like a Harry Potter movie series fan that hasn't even read any of the books, this is a huge plus for me :) I had little to no expectations about the movie, but was fascinated by the storyline and the high-level idea that this is a precedent to an alien invasion on Earth.<br /><br />The graphics and 3D were ok, but you could live without the 3D. Sounds and scenes were pretty stagnant, but I like the gore and naivity in some of the characters especially if they were trying to befriend alien form.
B0060CX8F6|5.0|Another great Princess movie with a touch of New Orleans! Lots of great music. My daughter loves it and so do I.<br />It has a beautiful message helpful for everyone, no age requirement!
B0085KGHI6|5.0|Wasn't sure what I was getting, very pleased with the cd. Would recommend to buddies. Well worth the price, have enjoyed listening to it severals times so far.
B005KELW26|5.0|I loce this case because it is a stylish and secure case for the kindle fire. It holds my kindle well using the straps inside the case. I would recommend this item !
B004UIOUHC|4.0|Works so much better than silk. Which isn't saying much because silk is the top of the worst. I would  like to see Firefox on kindle but Amazon makes it so hard. Why do you hat  me, Amazon?
B008HT4FUW|4.0|My wife and I have ran out of TV series to follow during our spare time (or what you may probably consider &#34;prime time&#34;). Once we watched, my wife and I can't stop looking for what happens in the next episode. It's also been great to at least mimic British accent.<br /><br />Looking forward to Season 3 on TV! Though I hate that the season is over in the UK whereas it only started in the US. We are prone to spoiler alerts and temptation to browse through Wikipedia.
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|Not your typical teen movie...thank goodness! This was refreshing and entertainig. Good cast as well. Just wish the ending was a little more thorough wrapping things up.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I was ready to quit this book several times as I found it very confusing in the beginning.  I was encouraged to finish it and I'm so glad I did.  What an ending.
B00AECGQF2|3.0|Its fun at first but then you short of ignore the application . But it is a fun game for your younger kids or you if you are young.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|fun to play an good detail in the game. I like it more than other games like it. Its got really good animation  for being a free app.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Avatar has been a great combination of real-life and CGI graphics. The story could have been more compelling if they had provided some background on the late brother's work (maybe a prequel?).<br /><br />The story and the graphics makes you feel more as if you were there. I love the concept that we could be in our own Avatars and similar to when we role-play or in playing a character in video games.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|Kind of finished up where it started off. Not one of the best books I have read. I'd give it two and a half stars.
8866130915|5.0|I bought the moleskine and i must say, i'm absolutely about it - how it looks and it's organised - i recommend it to everyone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so cool.  It is amazing!  I think everyone will love it ! This game has inspired me I love it.  Love love love love love love love love love it!!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|It arrived on time and in good condistion.  It was a good price for the show.  I will shop ther again.
B00APUQH0W|4.0|It had some funny and smart Alec moments.  Some baseball for the guys too. Overall, entertaining and worth the watch.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The first book was amazing, but the second installment was even better. I didn't think the second one could be topped, but I was wrong!  The third book was a deeper illustration of the circumstances that created our dear Mr. Gray's behavior.  What I wasn't prepared for was the heightened emotional twists and the unexpected occurrences, which is what kept me completely in the moment like I was living it out with them. This is so much more than just an erotic novel, and the evolution into its love story was beautiful!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|When i got this is i wasnt to sure because everyone had bad comments about it. It is great! I dont even have to sign in anymore, and whenever someone follows me or favs or retweets one of my  tweets it lets me know. I have it on my kindle fire, and it is just amazayn. The only thing i dont like about the app is that if you do want to sign out everytime you get off, it wont let you. But that is the only thing I've had trouble with.
B008JFUUIA|3.0|Directed by Jason Moore with a script by Kay Cannon, \\"Pitch Perfect\\" borrows heavily from TV's \\"Glee\\" by using actors in their mid to late 20's, but at least this time puts them in college rather than high school.  The cast has the usual suspects.  That is, the cute brainy one, the cute dumb one, the overweight funny one, the sexy one, the black gansta' one, the mean one.  You get the picture.  Not only that, the story is the age old one of competition, this time between a cappella singing groups.<br /><br />Anna Kendrick heads the cast as the girl who just wants to go to L. A. and produce records.  Her dad (John Benjamin Hickey) is a professor at the small college and insists she get an education first.  Anna Camp is Aubrey, the domineering leader of the all-girl warblers who continues to do the same performance of the same songs, dressed in the same 1980's flight-attendant outfits that they always have.<br /><br />The film heads down the expected path including romantic give-and-take between Beca (Kendrick) and a competing singer (Skylar Astin) who is also a co-worker and wannabe writer of film scores.  What elevates the movie above the norm is a funny performance by Rebel Wilson as self-named Fat Amy.  She steals most of her scenes.  There is also the banter between TV announcers played by Elizabeth Banks (her college group was known as the Menstrual Cycles) and John Michael Higgins, an unapologetic misogynist.  Then of course there are the excellent production numbers by all the groups.  The film is a lot of fun in spite of its lack of originality.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|this book is touching, adorable, makes you think and makes you feel. i couldn't put it down once i started reading it. the characters are beautiful. Charlie is that once-in-a-while character that you wish you knew someone like him in real life. I love my Kindle & I love this book!
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Loved the story line, not one you would predict, easy read.<br />Characters well developed, you really ended up wanting more, glad there are a few sequels
B00946WM6Q|1.0|Who ever thought that the action-packed Bond series would become an hour and a half episode of the poker world series!  I'm sorry but I was not riveted to the screen waiting to see the next card dealt or if Bond what want 1 card or 2 cards. Thus was Bond the wimp. Often beaten up, too slow to catch the bad guy, too in touch with his feelings, giving up duty for a pretty girl who is duping him the whole time. Bond the douche really.  This movie would make the Bond fan think that they've lost it, that the Bond dynasty is done.  Thankfully in 2012 somebody righted the course and got the Bond series back on track!<br />Amazon delivery review is that the HD movie did cut out/time out a couple of times across cable through ps3 so that was annoying.
B0052BZ6X8|4.0|I read the book, then watched the movie, and it was one of those rare occasions that the movie was better than the book.
B00000F14B|5.0|I love this movie and I had to get it so whenever i feel like watching it i can just put it in the dvd player.
B000NY12LO|4.0|Enjoyed it 'til ther ending--which was a little far-fetched. For the most part, I;m a Jodi Picoult fan. Looking forward to reding her again.
0425252868|4.0|Over all a good read .<br />Perhaps a little slow in the introductions, but, on balance a worthwhile read for any one interested in WWII air warfare in Europe .
B007FJFDXS|4.0|Very good game, I have yet to finish it but it sure makes you learn to very dexterous on moving blocks.
B00005JM02|5.0|This is a great movie for adults and kids alike. I loved this movie in the theater and i just HAD to have it for my collection.
B008O037RG|5.0|I listen to this album every day.  The record is a nice thick vinyl.  The case has wonderful artwork on it. 100% recommended.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Story line was interesting but not his best work.<br />I would like to see the movie since I saw the previews.
B00AESN8XY|2.0|The instructions indicated that the game would be too complicated. I never played it. Plague Inc. was overly hyped in the description.
B000AP04NI|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and I just HAD to get it so I could watch it whenever the mood strikes.
B002IVLWI8|4.0|You can't go wrong with this album.  If you like Simon & Garfunkel it is a 100% need-to-have.  The only reason I'm giving this a 4/5 is because the week that I bought it I went record shopping at my local stores.  Found about 3 used copies in good condition that ranged from $3-5.  Made me wish I had checked there first.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I never thought that this app would prove itself invaluable...man, was I wrong! I'm sleepingmore soundly, for longer periods at a time, and more restful.  you won't be disappointed!
B00005JKDR|5.0|What isn't to love about these silly Monsters!<br />My grandson received these yesterday. We sat and laughed<br />over and over. The second dvd is full of silly short stories.<br />I highly recommend this for your child of any age!
0425263916|5.0|read it in 3 days! It started up right where the previous book left off. Couldn't put it down once i started readin it
B008MEM24S|4.0|I think I could make it a little. better then I really. like it but. my mom. does not like it
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Fast running and didn't take a long time to learn. There was a variety of places like New York and Rio I think from my point of view it is a great game.pus it was free that's a go get her!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game takes the cake! We have family tournaments where the little ones even enjoy it! Beware though it is really addicting...especially the missions.
B009GEEMLY|3.0|As a kid, Capt Marvel was a favorite comic book hero, and I've enjoyed all the recent movies made about other Marvel heroes.  So I was really looking forward to The Avengers, where many of them were brought together.  However, I was disappointed.  I didn't think the plot lived up to the standards those previous movies...the plot seemed like an excuse for the action, ending with a justification for The Avengers, Part 2.  Perhaps I just getting old, but I think they could have done better.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is super. my only complaint is the lack of getting gems. overall this game is super addicting and fun for anyone
B0095ZMMCK|1.0|For the first time, I couldn't keep up with the characters. Between the U.S.,Russian, HK and China, I got lost and gave up.
0439023513|4.0|Definitely the best of the three. A lot more action and suspense. The very end wasn't what I had personally hoped happened but it's still a fairly good ending.
B007HACDLK|5.0|The Last Man was very suspensive as all are Vince Flynn books.  Can't wait to get for the next new book.
1452101248|5.0|This is my first cookbook. While I love to cook, I prefer to tweak my family's repertoire or recreate recipes from restaurants with lots of healthy twists and turns (let's face it - experimentation is not uniformly successful but this has never stopped me - I am even an improv baker). When I want to indulge in haute cuisine that is beyond my culinary imagination, I sensibly go out to eat. This is what I did for years at Yotam Ottolenghi's fantastic shops and restaurant (oh NOPI where art thou?). Now, I miss the entire oeuvre - I just cannot believe that Yotam is not a vegetarian - he renders vegetables better than any chef I know - it's more than empathy with produce - he seems to get that crucial insight that set the British on their colonial quests for spices - that as fresh and delightful vegetables can be, they can really shine with the right spices and combinations. While Asian cooking is au fait with this spicing vegetables insight, it doesn't do justice to the power of great fresh vegetables possibly because the rules were laid down before the invention of refrigeration. Ottolenghi strikes a pitch perfect balance between eclectic spices and farm-to-table produce and brings vegetables to the forefront with the famed single ingredient focus as stars in their own right rather than blushing extras suddenly swelling simply in size to become main courses. If I have to abandon my conviction that at home one is free to play and shackle myself to the dictates of a recipe then I am beyond happy that I am in Yotam Ottolenghi's inventive fetters.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addicting and fun! I love all the challenges they give you and all the extras you can unlock and buy!
B00008972S|5.0|I was very please with the picture and sound quality of the recording. On a large screen it makes for theater-like presentation
B009KG7EMC|5.0|I loved in the Movies and I love having it on DVD so I can watch it again and again!  I love the interaction between all the &#34;action heros&#34; and the references back to all their previous movies!
B0091VGAXK|2.0|Ultraviolet is not compatible with iTunes and you can only watch moves with ultraviolet if you are streaming. well what if i have no internet connection?? lame
B001MTENOC|4.0|Journey of Souls is very comforting to someone who has recently lost a loved one. It also lent confirmation to the ideas I've always had about the after-life (or more specifically, the between-life) and reincarnation.
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|On a cold, wet raining day - nothing is better then sitting by the fire in front of the TV watching a movie that GET your HEART racing.
B008KYOCA2|3.0|It's okay, not really user friendly and doesn't work like Microsoft Outlook, but then again it's not and again for the price it is okay.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game i have it on iPhone and kindle, gives me something to do during my down time, and helps me get tired while dealing with insomnia.
B000SEGUDE|1.0|Cloud Atlas was much too long, too futuristic, a lot of weird words that make no sense, not enough explanation of the background of each segment. I never saw the connection between all six eras that is promoted in the movie, which I have no desire at all to see after reading the book.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a fun app, great graphics.  However to get more gems in the game they make you complete tasks like create reviews or download other apps/games.  On the other hand, it is a free app.
B003NTSBUG|5.0|As always Mr. DeCaprio does and excellent job. The movie I have seen several times and once at the theater. In each case I have viewed a little different aspect to the movie. It is a movie that will draw you in and make you wonder. After the theater showing I noted the audience walking out was divided of opinion about the main character. Without spoiling the plot or expounding my take on the movie, I will say watch the movie and decide for your self - was he? or Wasn't he? Either way enjoy!
B003V5CFV8|5.0|Clooney's best role in my humble opinion.  A good well rounded and full story that flows well and rewards the viewer with some good ole timey tunes. I own the soundtrack. Enough said.
B005DZMODI|2.0|This Wynton Marsalis and Eric Clapton CD was a disappointment. Too progressive for me. I like Dixieland Jazz  the most and was hoping this would satisfy that craving.
0452284392|3.0|Good book, but not nearly as seminal as bursts. This book has great findings, but unless you're a mathematician, you'd need a lot of background work to understand this.
0061841935|5.0|I have only listened to part of this book. I have enjoyed it very much thus far. Craig is an entertaining writer / narrator. Thanks!
0307341577|5.0|The author has this knack of writing about characters that are loathesome<br />but makes them interesting. This book in many ways is better than Gone<br />Girl.<br /><br />Crisp writing; characters fully drawn. You can smell the air in the bar<br />scenes she writes about. This would make a great movie- with Jennifer Lawrence<br />as Libby Day. Mark Ruffalo would make a great Runner Day.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|11/22/63 was so good, I couldn't put it down. I love &#34;time warp&#34; stuff (wish it were really true!) and having such a strong memory of the Kennedy assassination, it was especially interesting. I had ordered O'Reilley's &#34;Killing Kennedy&#34; and read it first. It was very good and well researched non-fiction, but 11/22/63 was fascinating fiction and I loved it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Awesome book! Could not put it down! Definitely 5 stars, more if I could. It was suspenseful and I couldn't stop reading to find out what was going to happen. Definitely like the twist at the end.
B005HSG3TC|2.0|the shell folio case is not what i expected it does not stand up the kf unit and slips off each time i use the stylus to move the page
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I was surprised that I actually woke up without an alarm the other day, thanks to white noise. It soothed me to sleep and I woke up energized. Be sure to plug in your device.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book i  halarious you should really read this. That is all I have to say. By Naudia Morrison. THANK you
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I watched the series with my wife and we both decided to read the novels.  We're enjoying the whole set.
B00A757EFW|2.0|I have tried this game only a couple of times and have given up on it, temporarily. Will try again in a few days. It is not easy to understand how it works.
B004ADH1RI|1.0|The movie so was crude that the kids asked to stop watching it just 15 minutes into the movie.  Bad movie.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is an amazing story,made even more amazing because it is true. People say &#34; I could not put the book down&#34;. Well that is what happened to me.  The story of the fighter pilot and the bomber crew  before during and after the incident when they met in the air over Germany is worth the read.  You will get a better understanding of  those fighting for Germany (the country)  and those fighting for the Nazi Party.  I am glad this book was written
B000FC1HBY|5.0|The second story continues seamlessly where the first left off.  By the end I still wanted more.  Looking forward to the third book.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I have read several books written by John Green.  This book is my favorite out of them all.  I laughed and I cried while reading this.  I became attach ed d to the characters and wanted to know what was going to happen.  Some portions of the book make you stop and think about your life, your goals, where you are heading. I would highly recommend this book.  Nerdfigjters for the win!
B000ZMVAXO|3.0|I think the concept of this product is a great idea, and I love how there's one especially for &#34;metal&#34; and that's probably worth five stars right there; however, I am frequently fighting with my headphone cord. It seems to either tug badly when I move, or gets in the way of my hands when I play. This may be where my guitar's cord input is located or perhaps I would fair better with different headphones (different length cord, thicker cord, etc.), I don't know. All I know is it is enough of an annoyance to not want to use this product very much except as a last resort. Also, the dials are impossible to read, so I just turn each one randomly until I get the sound I want. Finally, the &#34;metal&#34; sound of this device does not seem that stellar, but maybe it is my guitar or playing style. I don't bother playing clean. Finally, the device seems a bit overpriced for what it is. I am getting another axe soon, so I will readdress this unit with different headphones and the new axe. It could be that it jumps up a star or two.
0307720950|5.0|This book was inspiring for myself as a maker.. It contains great stories about the entrepreneurial movement and the future of making.
B0046P2MV0|5.0|Marc Bolan is the most underrated rock influence of all time, and this is easily the best T. Rex album - one the most fluid/complete albums ever produced.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a fun and entertaining game for people of all ages!!! If you love horses or just love competing then this game is for you. Its perfect and free!!! GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like this game it is fun and so cool. Please keep the game on the kindle.  I would tell anyone to play.
B0000A98ZP|5.0|nothing less than 5 stars can watch this movie over and over never get tired of it..before they became known as the Brat Pack. for everyone who ever went to high school these 5 teens are a perfect assortment of everyone we went to school with!!.and of course Simple Minds Dont You Forget About Me
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|I am not a big fan of Hidden object games and I like that this was mostly puzzles with story line! Very fun!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a Awesome Game  I got 5000 coins just for having Facebook  I already got 3  people It is also a good game to play if you like siding you finger and you like trains!!! That was my report about this Awesome Game
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Uplifting fun film that proves that hard work, humility and passion can rise above and that music can change the world
B007139AMS|5.0|Bob Dylan Infidels a classic Lp from 1983...the vinyl sounds amazing..Bob along with Mark Knopfler (Dire Straits) produced this amazing LP!!! Sly Dunbar,Robbie Shakespeare, Mick Taylor, Alan Clarke..Jokerman,Sweetheart Like You, License To Kill,Dont Fall Apart on Me Tonight,Neighborhood Bully,I and I, Union Sundown,Man Of Peace..definitely must own this!!
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|I love puzzles and usually am bored by hidden object games but this was cleverly done and definitely worth the purchase!
B009D5VPTI|5.0|Brave is fun, fun, fun.  Merida is such a hoot.  What a good role model for making your life what you want it to be . . . and not following the path someone else sets for you.  And what a great picture of Scottish quirkiness. The characters voiced by real life Scots have a great sense of fun and disregard for social conventions. They are focused on having a good time, competing fiercely, and rolling with whatever punch comes their way.  Not to mention the amazing graphics which make Merida's hair an unbelievable work of interesting art.  I loved this movie!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this app to help me fall asleep and stay asleep.  I just wish it had a timer.  Love the sounds.
B000000OF6|5.0|This is a great compilation of songs by Queen. This was perfect for our road trip, singing all the way!
B007ZTLLMK|5.0|I like this Helicopter game and it is a truly learning process for me , Although, I wish the UI got more polished .
B003TNM2K6|4.0|Great movie. Great ending. Classic Stephen King horror with the character relations going in directions that caught me completely off guard.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|This was a funny movie...great for kids and adults which I really like.  It was funny and action packed so it filled the bill for all in my family.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|On a scale of 1- 10 I gave the book an 8.OK found the story y brewing purely fiction gave it more mystique. A very good read.
B00170I7GG|4.0|Although instant playback quality was not great (guess I'm spoiled by HD), this is one of my favorite movies of all time. I watch it every February 2nd and come away feeling reinvigorated for the coming year.  Bill Murray's characterization of Phil is superb as he learns how to become fully human by making every moment count.  Great life lessons and laugh out loud funny, too.  Love it!
B003TSEL7S|4.0|Action suspense and a hero who has lost his memory. All in all, a great book for my age, 13-50
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|Did not like this movie.  I am married for 45 years and I was embarrassed as well as my husband at some of the things that were shown in the movie.  I don't recommend it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|U know how u give a game 5 stars they get an update so give this game 5 stars and it will be better plus this will make Mojang and the one and only Nocht real happy!!!<br />I'm a PS3 user my user name if you might of heard of me TJ195slayer I love minecraft both Minecraft  PE , XBOX 360, and the best one MINECRAFT PC<br />THIS part is for Mojang and Nocht please put MINECRAFT on PS3 please we PS3 user are really upset :( please Nocht and Mojang please!
B004AM5QT4|2.0|I have to say that while I didn't like this book, I really loved Ken Follet's historical novels such as Pillars of the Earth, Fall of Giants, and Winter of the World.  I've read many of his books and think he's a wonderful story teller.  The reason I did not like this particular book is that I just couldn't care about any of the characters, and it was very much outdated in terms of where medicine and technology are today.  I'm also sick to death of politically conservative characters being portrayed as the evil villains, while the liberal-leaning characters are the only ones with common sense and moral virtue.  For an author that is good at writing unpredictable stories, this habit of making the conservative the bad guy is quite boring and totally expected.<br />Sexual explicitness seems to be a theme in all of Follet's novels, and this one was no exception.  After reading several of Follet's novels, I now know to just skip over these parts.  I have read many books in my lifetime, but I have never come across an author so obsessed with describing the color of a character's personal body hair.  I don't find that particular information relevant to the character or interesting at all.  Despite some of these issues I have with him as an author, I do recommend his historical fiction novels.  I am eagerly awaiting the third book in the Century Trilogy.
0062082353|5.0|With the recent death of the author of this book, I am so glad I ordered this book and read it last year.  Chris Kyle was a wonderful person.  RIP Chris
B0033H7VI6|3.0|Knife is heavy, solid knife to chop wood and is helpful in overall outdoor stuff. Blade is thick too. Handle is very comfortable. Yet the Sheath was completely wrong. the velcro part of the sheath to clip and lock the knife was the other way around.....very disappointed in that aspect. Overall it was a good knife.
1455523550|5.0|I loved this book, it was not only fun to find out if the characters fall for each other, but then the suspensful twist made it so hard to put down. I recommend this book to any one and can't wait to see the movie. Although the book is always better.
B007ZTLLMK|4.0|It was fun for a while but the gyro is a little too sensitive and it really has no point to the missions. Fun if you have nothing else to do except drive in a car. I like the game but would like to have a real RC Helicopter instead. Realistic but it looses its flavor after 10 minutes. Can't knock the price though cause it was free. Would not spend any money on it...
B007ZTLLMK|4.0|The controls, both joystick and gyro, is well designed. Fun to just fly around. Would like a free flight mode.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the most greatest book I have ever read. I am very eager to read the other two books of this series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very good and entertaining like temple run and a bit addictive . I like how it has different themes and characters you can get and upgrades.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|It was really good! It had some reAlly good tips and advice. I really hope they make a second book!:)
B000FCKGPC|5.0|The person who received this book absolutely loves it. I guess if your into this series, your into this series.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Long term planning and quick execution. A bit slow, but I blame my phone. I happen to love horses, so this is right up my alley.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|What more can I say, I loved each one these books!! If you like these books you should definitely read Bared to You next.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|The acting [with such a cast!] and the scenery are gorgeous -- you can almost smell the streets of Jaipur.  Romance for over 60s is beautifully evoked.
B00AYDC5HY|3.0|The kids seemed to like Frankenweenie, but had to &#34;reload&#34; the movie several times while streaming.  I've been an Amazon Prime member for about 2 months and recently bought a Sony Blu-Ray Player with wireless capability.  Anytime I'm streaming through this player using Amazon Instant Videos, the movie stops streaming and i get a &#34;waiting to load' message.  I have to stop the streaming process, go to the main movie menu and then resume the movie.  I have not had this issue using my Roku on a different TV nor using Netflix through the Blu-Ray player.

031250926X|5.0|An excellent book to introduce animals and colors to kids. My 21 month old son loves it! I started this book when he was 12 months and he still loves this one. One of the best buys ever!!!

B0052RE4MQ|3.0|I only read the book because I had already read the first two parts.  The story just felt like it ended, I didn't feel like it was as good as the first two

B005VPRDAY|4.0|okay.  the kids were happy with them.  wished i would have waited to buy them later but they play with them.
B004SBQGHS|3.0|This is a game that children would enjoy.  It would keep a child or young adult entertained for awhile.  I did not find it interesting or challenging for adults.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|This movie kept me entertained along with my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter. I found myself laughing out loud (especially at the horse - the scene stealer).

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show - the history, the setting, the story line keeps me wanting more. This show is a much better way to spend your time than reality tv!!
B009CF3P7E|5.0|Awsome movie and the soundtrack is the best to test any new speaker or subwoofer for its good base effects definitely recomend.
B001HN6922|5.0|used but it was in good condiiton.  i believe that it works good.  i gave it away to my grandson but he likes it.
1582701709|3.0|I love the when Byrne wrote the book by quoting famous's speech and citing successful people. I also enjoy the feeling of hope that was given to me from reading the book. However, there is no guarantee that after following the teaching of the book precisely, you will be given things you desire.<br /><br />Over all, the book is a good tool to make you more optimistic about life, but not something that you have to hold on deary.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Great ending to a great series!! I'm excited for the movies, hoping they follow the books! Will read more by this author!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I've never been happier with a app in my life. On temple run u have to tilt it but on subway surfers u slide it with your hand.it's like temple run u have to dodge the obstacles.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Truly one of the best series on television.  Wonderfully done period work.  Actors are at the top of their game.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|This is one of Audrey Hepburn's great movies to collect and watch; over and over again. The dialogue is great, gives good examples of someone who gives their life in service to God and the challenges doing so. Recommended for the entire family, because it teaches people great life's lessons on your choices made. A five star and love this!
B00422LESO|5.0|I found this book during my search of something new to read. I reread pretty much all of my books, and since finding a good book can be as tedious as trying to find a good person to date, it's been a while since I found a book that I truly enjoyed. This book fit everything I was looking for in my next book - it was fun, flirty, and thoroughly entertaining. I read the book in an afternoon because I couldn't put it down. While it was at times a bit predictable, that part never bothered me that much because it wasn't to the point of me accurately guessing the dialogue (as has happened with some shows I've watched).<br /><br />The book centers on Jane, a graphic designer in love with a fictional character, so much so that it has, at times, had a damaging affect on her real life. Her great-aunt leaves her a dream vacation - 3 weeks in England at an exclusive resort to live the kind of life her favorite character led, complete with actors to enhance the role. It would be like getting to enroll at Hogwarts for 3 weeks for Harry Potter fans. Once there, she is in full-on fantasy mode, and has to play the part or face the consequences. As expected in a book like this, there is a bit of a love triangle, but it always felt fun, never too cheesy or too serious.<br /><br />Anyone who reads this should go in expecting something fun, light and entertaining. If you're looking for depth, while it has some... you probably want to look elsewhere. If this was a movie, it wouldn't be an Oscar contender. It would be along the lines of The Proposal with Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. Is it still fun, a good time and worth reading? Absolutely. :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When I started the hunger games, I wasn't very impressed and I was actually kind of disappointed. I had heard so much about the whole trilogy from friends and my expectations were very high. But as I read on, I realized why people raved about it so much: it was deep. It leaves you with so many questions that are ultimately unanswerable. This isn't another book about the controlling powers of a different government. It's so much more. Just read it. And you'll know what I mean.
0547564651|3.0|This book was very different from most books I have read on education. Instead of looking at what schools can do better to improve curriculum, teachers, or programs, Paul Tough looks at the reasons behind student success and failure. What he found was that character, grit, and intrinsic motivation tend to be the keys to success for children (there is no surprise from me in regards to his findings). Unfortunately for educators, he found that students' home lives are the key to having grit, fortitude, character, stick-with-it-ness, etc. Although some schools have had limited success with character education, real character education comes from home. Students growing up in poverty tend to struggle the most with these traits due to the high-stress homes and communities that they live in. This situation tends to be a catch-22 and the cycle continuously repeats itself as these children have to work twice as hard at school as their middle-class peers. Tough even goes on to suggest that it would be more cost effective in the long run to have effective programs for parents of young low-income students, rather than trying to remediate these students as young adults. This was an interesting book that actually left me with more questions than answers.
1250006341|5.0|I would highly recommend this book. Bought it for a friend who was speechless. It's a treasure chest of history and gorgeous photos of characters and scenes.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|The cover is fairly reliable but I wish it had some kind of magnetic closing action.  The elastic band is a bit cheap but works well enough.  If you want a low profile solution this does the job.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|I was excited to read this book because the story--though paranormal based--had very realistic undertones. Hamilton is a fantastic writer, with a great ability to create suspense. I especially liked Sophia book of shadows in which she carefully documents information pertaining to her Wiccan heritage. It reminded me of a mix between the book the Charmed sisters had and the family book from the Hunger Games Series. The chemistry between her and Charles is exciting to watch, and the development of their relationship, with all of its ups and downs, kept me wanting more! This book has it all, and I would highly recommend it!
B001M4YZ90|1.0|I did not like this movie at all. Number one U can hardly understand what they were saying. I saw very little of Gerard Butler. That is why I bought this DVD tosee more of Butler. Some of the actors I didn't even recongize except for 2. It was the most stupid movie I ever saw. Gerard U can do better.Also what a waste of my money.
B003L77GG0|5.0|Great price and fast shipping!  Finally wraps up the series.  This particular season was pretty good with most all loose ends were tied up.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|Mad men gets better every season. I love it! The streaming makes it so easy, and I didn't have to wait for the season to get shipped.
B002R88G5E|5.0|This was one of the best books I have read for a long time . I found it a lot different than I usually read the story line was very good would recommend it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love it! i like this game. it helps you understand about the care of a horse. there is much responsability that comes with ownership of a horse._
B005LAII80|5.0|I enjoy this movie. If you can watch it 3-D, do it! If not the efdects on bluray are almost just as good. Great entertainment.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This was a very entertaining book and I liked it more than I thought I would. The story is very interesting and now I can't wait to see the movie.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|Witty, insightful, and exactly the experience I lived for 20 years. Bourdain nailed it as only someone who's lived it can.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Is a very high quality product, I wish it had a few more EQ options but the ones it has are mainly the ones I look for.
B009T3AHDE|2.0|I didn't like this movie at all if you could call it that...terrible movie not with even the plastic used to make the dvd
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Spellbinding as usual. I feel like a kid in a candy store when I get a hold of a John Grisham  book! I love his way with words. He has such humor. I always recommend Grishams books to everyone. I am proud to say I love John Grisham !!  He is the best and will be for years to come. When I finish a book I pass it on. I have a hardback making its way through Texas right now! Has been a few years so no telling where it's at!
B0098VYCCE|4.0|The other side of Snow White made this movie very exciting. She has finally found her strength. Good work to the writer.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|This thing is amazing in games and OC pretty well. No problems on my end when getting the new chip. So far so good.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Function over form is mostly my motto, but in this case there was no compromise. The watch looks amazing, the black face with the brushed metal housing is a classic combination for any timepiece. This watch is a fully automatic winding watch which means you cannot manually wind it, that being said you should remember to wear it around and not leave it unused for too long or the spring will not keep the movement in motion and will stop keeping time.<br /><br />Overall, wonderful starter timepiece
B00B2V66VS|3.0|the controls aren't as good as the first. they need to fix the tilt settings and the turning speeds needs to he tighter. if they fix these thing it would be better than the first temple run.
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|I am  a 24 fanatic! Watched on TV, then purchased the DVD,s. I would want to see another movie but I'm a firm believer in going out on top.  K. Sutherland is a great actor.  I'm trying to get use to seeing his new character in Touch.  If you've never seen 24, and love suspense and action, this is the show to watch.
0062020897|5.0|This 1978 thriller had me caught up totally in its fast-paced action consistently through all its pages.  The spy discovers the fake devices intended to make Hitler believe that D-Day will not be in Normandy, and book traces his effort to get to Germany and tell Hitler--and the effort of British military intelligence to keep him from getting the information to Hitler.  The book ends up on an island off Scotland inhabitated by only four people.  On reflection, there are hard to beleive aspects to the scenario, but one cannot but be totally immersed in the enthralling action.
B00AAW1322|4.0|Really like this app, it,s simple and fun.  Would like THE KINKS \\"Sunny Afternoon\\" on this app.<br /><br />Hopefully the database will continue to expand.  Ok, now I,m just adding words to get this review to post.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|The entire time I was reading this book I kept thinking about my own dog. It made me wonder if he has thoughts like Enzo. This was such a sweet story. Parts made me cry and some made me laugh. If you're looking for a light hearted life story, this is the book for you.
B001UG56ES|5.0|Great acting, cinematography, storyline. I could easily watch this movie again. A woman's struggle to overcome adversity, achieve respect and acceptance is enough for me to enjoy a movie.
B000JPRPAO|4.0|This is the movie I always use to test the quality of a new surround sound system.  Action packed and full of excitement.
B005WUHAX8|4.0|Love the case.  It has already gotten wet a little with no problem with the phone.  Hate having to take the little end of to use speakers.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love the characters. This book reminds me that there are a lot of people hurting in the world but you can overcome whatever it is you're dealing with. The author really makes everything come together in the end. So you aren't left feeling like you wanted more. This book is inspiring, witty and comforting all at the same time.
B00114RKT8|5.0|I learned something new. I thoroughly enjoy books and movies about this time period and was surprised I never heard or read about this man's fight for justice.  This is a great movie.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|Wow!!!!  What a surprise!  It was so moving and thought provoking.  Quite a journey.  Laughs, tears and it stays with you.  My husband and I are still talking about it.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I have been playing this app for a while and have unlocked many power ups and characters. I was diasapointed when it didn't open, that is why I am writing this review now. I thought maybe if I rate it since I haven't rated it yet. it will let me play. if not I will be sad that I cant play such a terrific game.

B00A8OBSX6|5.0|With these words, Max Emanuel Cenčić shares the concept of this, his newest recorded collection: \\"With these arias by Vivaldi and his lesser-known contemporaries I am hoping both to capture the musical tastes of Venice in the early 18th century and to recreate the moods and colours of a city that was open to the world. Venice was one of Europe's most important musical centres, both exporting its operatic glories and importing new ideas from Rome and Naples.\\" So brace yourself for a splendid survey of music that is not only new to Croatian born, Austria based Cenčić but also to us. . His intention, in this first collaboration with Italian violinist/conductor Riccardo Minasi and his ensemble Il Pomo d'Oro, is to recreate Venetian taste and to trace the influences of the time, particularly as the city faced operatic innovations originating from Rome and Naples.<br />The works on this recording are as follows:<br /><br />Antonio Vivaldi (1678 - 1741) Concerto for violin RV 181a in C major - Allegro, Largo, Allegro<br /><br />Tomaso Albinoni (1671 - 1751) Pianta bella - Il nascimento dell'Aurora<br /><br />Antonio Caldara (1670 -1736)  Barbaro, non comprendo -Adriano in Siria<br /><br />Giuseppe Antonio Brescianello (1690 - 1758) Sinfonia Op 1 n 5 in F major - Allegro, Adagio, Presto<br /><br />Francesco Gasparini (1661 - 1727) Dolce mio ben - La fedelta' tradita<br /><br />Antonio Vivaldi  Mi vuoi tradir - La verita' in cimento<br /><br />Baldassarre Galuppi (1706 - 1785)  Concerto a quattro in G major - Grave, Allegretto, Adagio, Allegro<br /><br />Geminiano Giacommelli (1692 - 1740) Sposa, non mi conosci - La Merope<br /><br />Antonio Vivaldi  A piedi miei svenato - Argippo<br /><br />Antonio Vivaldi  Concerto for violin RV 277 in E minor Il Favorito\\" - Allegro, Andante, Allegro<br /><br />Giovanni Porta (1675 - 1755)  Mormorando - Costanza combatutta in amore<br /><br />Antonio Vivaldi Anche in mezzo aperigliosa - L'odio vinto dalla costanza<br /><br />Cenčić has been lauded for his assumption of the title role in Virgin Classics' complete recording of Vivaldi's Farnace, which Opera magazine felt \\"will set the standard for the foreseeable future ... Max Emanuel Cenčić has all the necessary fire and fury for Farnace, with excellent coloratura singing and shows control in the more introspective numbers.\\" Gramophone meanwhile wrote that: \\"[Cenčić's] brilliant coloratura is never merely showy, his poetic lament singing is superb...and his knack for portraying explosive vengefulness does not preclude intelligent musicality...this marvelous recording reveals that Vivaldi's theatrical fantasy is a journey worth taking.\\"<br /><br />With the plethora of countertenors today the competition is always keen, but with recordings such as this new one by Max Emanuel Cenčić this particular countertenor seems to be enjoying the favored few at the top.

B008JGSM6G|4.0|passes the time different game then the standard apps available.  challenge yourself. easy to use. love flow free free app
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I love the way i can quickly swap out lenses with a shoulder bag, but hate that it falls off my shoulder and gets in the way. after some messing with the straps on this bag I was able to swing it around and back to get gear quickly without fear of the bag getting in the way or coming loose. It seems very well built with plenty of pockets and padding for comfort. I bought it on sale during Christmas ($25) as a gift for myself. I'm glad I did. I'm pretty rough with bags during shoots and was able to retire my shredded Nikon bag. Adjustable sections inside keep everything snug and well protected against bumps or drops. Love that it  has straps on the side for my tripod / monopod to hook onto to. Smaller pockets help keep the small memory cards, batteries, remotes and anything else that could get lost in the mix organized and safe.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My two year old loves this game. But then again, she loves everything that has to do with puzzles! very easy for her to navigate on her own.
B000VDUWMC|5.0|A must read - for a realistic and in depth analysis about why we are who we are in a global sense, Guns, Germs and Steel gives us a perspective on how our environment dictates how we live, sustain our lives and eventually progress - or not!

B004LWZWGK|1.0|First Off I want to say I'm a Big Batman Fan and as a Batman Fan I've come to expect a lot from the character.<br />The Batman in this film is NOT batman! He's a Lazy bum that gets his Bat butt handed to him the whole movie and then cat woman saves the day....Worst batman Movie ever made hands down. Don't even get me started on the plot holes. Fox says to Wayne that you can easily flood the room holding the nuke in one scene,but then in another scene where Fox was at the controls to the Nuke he handed the nuke over to the bad guys instead of flooding the place...really?<br />It was just a really bad Movie with zero redeeming qualities.

B00632HWOG|2.0|Since the upgrade, this newest version has lots of issues. It freezes which causes you to force close it. Email messages do not delete, even if it appears they have they are still there once the page refreshes.  If you have more than one account, it often will not switch over to other accounts.  I would rather log in to my desktop...its faster &amp; more convenient....which is exactly what the app is supposed to do!
B004R13U6Y|4.0|Cant think of a better app out there to handle PDF files, however since I have loaded it seems my kindle does not respond as fast. Could be I just need to 'learn more' did notice it does keep making 'log' files which are taking space.

B002WBZD02|5.0|&#34;Get Short&#34; was an excellent movie !! All the  actors were superb, but none more so than John Travolta himself. Not quite up to par with his character in &#34;Pulp Fiction&#34; ...but close !!<br />thank you,<br />Mark
B003L77GGU|5.0|Great product. Packaging was great. The series is outstanding, can't wait to get the eighth season and hope they continue on with season nine and ten
B005K17RU0|5.0|I first used this for a trip across the country. Easy to input destinations and track weather where you are headed. Very accurate.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|As the title suggests this game is a clever take on the adventure game genre.  You get to take an active role in your character, because you get to draw the hero, and the 'damsel in distress'.  Each level is somewhat open ended in that you usually have a choice on which path to take.  Another feature that I like in this game is that you get to draw your weapons/tools you will use to solve the level.  You will be given a magic crayon or two that have special powers.  The key crayon will make keys, the fire crayon makes fire, and so on, though admittedly I did get a little lazy in drawing some of the tools.  I would give the replay-ability a 4 out of 5, because the levels don’t change, but they are fairly dynamic, so you can mess around in them for a while trying out new things.  Fun clever game that I would recommend.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|It keeps you updated and it works fairly fast without any hiccups. I would recommend this to any one who uses Twitter
B007B5EDEG|5.0|Couldn't put them down for about 3 months!<br />Recommend to anyone who likes Lord of the Rings or such books.
B001C3L2C4|5.0|Simply one of their better albums. It was during that period when the MB were putting out great album after great album. You can't go wrong if you like this group. If you're new to them; give them a listen and you'll discover an amazing blend of rock and classical sounds that transcends the era in which it was written.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|As the title says this is a geat puzzle game in the style of MYST.  The graphics are very nice, and the story is interesting.  It is fun unlocking the different secrets that are clues to the next secret.  For the price, I think it is a good value, and will keep you entertained for at least a few days.  One thing to note is the replayability would be very low, since the puzzles do not change once you finish the game.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is really fun it is way better than the original. I play it all the time whenever I get bored. well anyway its a great game and you should get it.
B007ZD17XO|4.0|Only at beginning of game but like it so far. Much better than first game in series. Like the colorful play, too.
B00136JPB0|5.0|Jeff Buckley's music is soulful, passionate, and unfortunately in short supply due to his untimely passing. Grace is a testament to the talent of this great singer/songwriter with a collection of great songs that still sound fresh and new 15 years after his passing. The brightest flame burns quickest, but it still makes you wonder what might have been had Jeff continued on his musical path.
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|If you lived comfortable lives as children, it is very likely that you created your fantasies about heroes and monsters, based on the environment that you were raised. In 1953, Walt Disney released a movie based on the play \\"Peter Pan, or the Boy who wouldn't Grow Up,\\" written by J.M. Barrie. The movie, of course, is \\"Peter Pan,\\" and it magnificently captures that magic of our growing up and our fantasies. Now we can relive those memories with the fantastic Blu-ray edition of this classic as never seen before.<br /><br />The story begins in the early 1900s London, when Wendy, John and Michael Darling's father is exasperated because the boys are being affected by Wendy's stories about Peter Pan, who has become their hero. That night, while the children's parents are at a party, Peter Pan visits the Darling's home, stopping at the kid's comfortable and warm bedroom. With the help of Tinker bell, a fairy, he sprinkles the kids with pixie dust, so that they can fly - in their pajamas --and accompany him and Tinker bell to the magical island of Neverland. This trip turns out to be a dream that comes true for Wendy, John and Michael, as they will live their fantasies and meet the characters from the stories. As they arrive, Captain Hook and his pirates are on the island and Peter, the kids, and the Lost Boys - Peter's gang - have to save the day. In the process, they will save an Indian princess (Tiger Lilly), deal with mermaids, and forgive Tinker bell's mistakes.<br /><br />\\"Peter Pan\\" is a story for all the family, and brings out the best of us all. It is about the kid that we all have inside and never wants to grow up. As an adult and a parent, it is a thrill to see children creating their own stories and living in their own worlds. As we grow older, we still wish to capture those moments. The awesome Diamond Edition is comprised of the Blu-ray, DVD and digital copies of the film, and they are loaded with extras, including never-before-seen deleted scenes and alternate endings, deleted songs, introduction by Diane Daisy Disney, Tinker Bell: A Fairy's tale, and much more! (USA, 1953, color, 77 min plus additional materials).<br /><br />Reviewed on February 3, 2013 by Eric Gonzalez for Disney Blu-ray.

B004A8ZWWO|5.0|Tower Heist - I was really looking forward to this as I am a big Eddie Murphy fan and the rest of the cast should have made for a great film but it was milk toast at best - too bad .... But, of course, it arrived very quickly and packaged well!!
B005LAIIA8|5.0|If you are very observant, you may be able to distinguish the styles of different film directors -- their signatures, if you will. Some of them are hard, and some of them are easy. In the later group, without a doubt, we have Tim Burton, who has left a definitive imprint in moviemaking, with his tetric, dark, yet very stylish and entertaining vision. In 1984 Burton generated a short named \\"Frankenweenie,\\" which Disney didn't release because they felt it was \\"too scary for young audiences.\\" However, it was later released in 1994 as a video. Now, almost twenty years later, Burton has released a delightful full feature film of \\"Frankenweenie\\" in a glorious Blu-ray format, a little gem that will surely touch your heart.<br /><br />Victor is the only child in the Frankenstein household, where he lives a happy life in town named New Holland. He shares his happiness with Sparky, his dog and best friend. Sadly, one day, during a baseball game, a freak accident causes Sparky's demise, which, of course, makes Victor very sad. However, during his science class at school, his teacher - a Vincent Price-looking type --, shows his students how electricity can make a dead frog's leg move. This notion gives Victor an idea. At the same time, the students are supposed to be presenting a science project, and, of course, each one wants to win the prize for the best project. Victor is not thinking about that; he just wants his dog to come back to life. Using the principle taught by his teacher, he is able to reanimate Sparky with electricity. Victor is happy again, but tells Sparky to stay in the attic, so that his parents don't see him. Unfortunately, Edgar, one of Victor classmates sees Sparky, and that is when the problems begin.<br /><br />\\"Frankenweenie\\" is in black and white, just like when the classic horror films of the 30s were made, and which undoubtedly inspired and influenced Burton. And it really works, because you won't notice the difference, and the attention to detail isstill fascinating. You will also see references to Godzilla, the Bride of Frankenstein, the Gremlins, Igor (Frankenstein's assistant), and others. The film's message, I suppose, is that when you do things with love, they come out better. There is also a scene in which Victor's science teacher warns him that \\"your country needs more science teachers,\\" and how free thinkers are attacked under the blanket of stupidity. The fantastic Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D, DVD and Digital Copy has many extras, including the original short \\"Captain Sparky vs The Flying Saucers,\\" an original Frankenweenie short, music video, making-of feature, and much more! (USA, 2012, B&W, 87 min plus additional materials).<br /><br />Reviewed on February 3, 2013 by Eric Gonzalez for Disney Blu-ray,
1932100660|5.0|Very helpful and informative.  You can tell a lot of thorough study and research went into this endeavor.  My Grandaughter wants to become an M.D. in the field of Cancer research.  I gave her a copy of this book and told her it would be very useful to help with her studies.
159413586X|5.0|I read the first two books in the Hunger Games trilogy and could not wait to read the third.  It was a fantastic read and a smart purchase, it arrived quickly and in great condition which is why amazon is my favorite website to shop on.
0525952926|4.0|WHAT IT ISN'T:<br />I've read a lot of Ken Follett, and am a huge, HUGE fan of the Pillars of the Earth and World Without End.  Both of these were fun, absolutely riveting pieces of fiction that kept you entertained and entranced from page 1 to the very end.  And taught you a bit of history in the process.<br /><br />WHAT IT IS:<br />Winter of the World is not quite like that.  While Ken Follett's writing style is still clean and clear, this is not that same kind of read.  It's more serious and the pace is not the same.  You don't feel as pulled into the drama of a particular character or characters;  the scope of this novel is much broader than that.  As other reviewers have said, some of characters actually feel more like caricatures than people you feel close to.  On the other hand, you really get a sense for how WW2 affected people and politics all over the world.  I believe that this was Follett's intention with this book.<br /><br />While there are many, many books, both scholarly and fictional, that deal with specific WW2 events in more detail (and at a more personal level), where this book excels is in presenting a more \\"big picture\\" view of the entire era.  For example, it shows how the politics of Germany and/or the USSR was perceived in America or Great Britain;  it takes us into the mind of Russians as they perceive the Germans, and vice versa;  it shows the complex politics of both the USA and Great Britain in dealing with European politics.  This, I believe, is this novel's strongest point.
0307346617|5.0|Good book, cant wait for the movie to come out. I finished it in two weeks. It was awesome bro.
B007SUW24W|5.0|I purchased Ed Sheeran's album, which is entitled \\"+,\\" in the beginning of April, 2012. I have been listening to this CD on iTunes and YouTube since it was released in September of 2011, but then decided that I needed to own his amazing album. This album consists of beautiful ballads, along with some fun, upbeat songs. Ed Sheeran is so incredibly talented and this album shows off his outstanding voice and his perfect lyrics. He is my favorite artist in the singer/songwriter genre, actually in any genre, because his music and lyrics create songs that have great messages, beautiful stories, and wonderful melodies. Every song on this album has lyrics that are truthful, inspiring, and breathtaking.<br />It has been over a year now since I first heard his song, \\"The A Team,\\" and I still listen to it almost every day. The \\"+\\" album contains songs that never get old. I could listen to this album over and over again, and I have. Songs like \\"Give Me Love,\\" \\"Wake Me Up,\\" and \\"Kiss Me\\" are three of my all time favorite songs. They all tell such amazing stories of true love. The lyrics are so honest and inspiring. Another favorite of mine is \\"Small Bump.\\" This song tells a very sad story, but the lyrics are so touching. There are also some songs such as \\"U.N.I.\\" and \\"You Need Me, I Don't Need You,\\" where Ed is able to show off his rapping skills. But unlike mainstream rap, Ed Sheeran does more of a fun, sweet rap in these upbeat songs and blends it with singing throughout the song. Even though some of the songs have sad lyrics, the beauty and simplicity to his work leave you feeling happy and peaceful.<br />I know there are many ways to download music for free, but this CD was one that I had to own. Ed Sheeran deserves the support. For the quality of the music, I feel it was worth spending the money on. I have gotten my moneys worth for this album. It has been played over and over in my car and at my house. I love this album so much and also think it would be great as a gift for a friend's birthday. Ed also has recently been featured in a Taylor Swift song and will be opening for her on her Red tour, so any fans of Taylor should also be a fan of Ed. I think that the songs can be liked by teens and adults. The music is relatable to many people and I think there is a song on this album for everyone. I think that the truthfulness to this album allows a wide range of people to love it.<br />I would highly recommend this album to every music lover. Ed Sheeran is such a unique and special musician, and I think that everyone should be exposed to his music. He goes beyond most artists, and creates music with meaning. You can hear the beauty in each song he writes and sings. I love not only listening to the music, but paying close attention to his lyrics. By doing this, I was able to appreciate the genuine greatness of this album. This album is so unique that it is hard to compare it to any other album. Ed Sheeran writes lyrics that carry similar emotions and passion as Adele's songs. He sings of the love that is similar to that of Bruno Mars. The songs on this album hold the same distinctive and charming qualities like songs by artists such as Ellie Goulding. If you like these artists, then you would definitely enjoy Ed Sheeran's \\"+\\" album. This album is passionate, pure, and perfect. I feel that no other artist will ever be able to achieve the same sincerity that is found in this album. There is so much depth to the lyrics and a wonderful quality to the specially crafted rhythm and beat of each song on the album.
1594135851|5.0|After reading the first book of the Hunger Games Trilogy I could not wait to read the next one!  This book arrived quickly and in great condition and it was definitely a fantastic read.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I couldnt put this book down, I started reading and just kept going and going until it was over. Wonderful book.
B00A6RP8Z4|5.0|I love Lana Del Rey's EP Paradise (the Target exclusive edition). My favorite songs are in this album is Ride, American, Cola, Blue Velvet, Gods & Monsters, Yayo, & Bel Air. I do like all of these songs on this album though. I love the 2 remixes of Blue Velvet on this album. The album/EP Paradise is the best from Lana Del Rey!
B002KSPKRS|5.0|Headset is overall excellent but the battery usage is terrible. The headset is expensive itself plus another $20/month in batteries.
B004KBSQBA|4.0|Unusual music. Great theme, we have always liked Paul Simon. I do not fault him for making the album, I think that is the correct way to make friends.
B000JML7EC|3.0|I am a sucker for classics, but this one is a hard read for me because I am not getting sucked in right away. Could be just me.
B00A4A2WH0|5.0|I love Nicki Minaj's re-release of her album Pink Friday... Roman Reloaded-The Re-Up. I love her new songs Up in Flames, Freedom, Hell Yeah (feat. Parker), High School (feat. Lil Wayne),  I'm Legit (feat. Ciara), & The Boys (feat. Cassie). But I do like her original songs from the original Pink Friday... Roman Reloaded too. It's a fun album!
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|The book is nice and funny and it is about Greg's summer including Rowley's summer too! And it all ends nicely.
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|This game is great for getting your brain revved up for math. It's like I can feel the blood rushing to my brain! The game becomes easier as you warm up and then it adjusts and becomes faster like Tetris. It's a great spin on an old classic. I recommend this game for ages 7 and up.
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|it sometimes freezes up on me and one time the controls didn't appear and I had to do it from memory. over all I was kinda dissipointed. I liked the first one better.
B003Y01JRG|5.0|It is really great joy to listen to this awesome man from a high qualified printed record. This double play is 180 gr. and with the help of an adequate audio system it gives lively sensation of actually being in those concert halls .
B003PIUC02|1.0|DO NOT BUY THIS DVD SET OR THE SEASON 2 SET.  Obviously produced in some back alley production shop.  Three different sets received from Amazon.  All three sets had play issues as follows;  Discs will not load.  Individual episodes on loadable discs won't play, skip, video but no audio, audio but no video.  Also purchased Season 2 discs that are experiencing the same issues.  Am attempting replacement/refund with Amazon now.  Avoid these low quality poorly produced discs at all costs.  They will only disappoint you.  This was disturbing since the Spartacus series is awesome.  However my attempt at obtaining a complete collection has been made impossible due to the poor production quality.  I just hope I can find discs that were produced by a reputable firm even if more expensive.  These discs were obviously thrifted in order of offer them at a low cost.  In this case low cost equals low quality.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I appreciate Mr. Sparks hitting it right on the money as far as the abuse many women<br />experience at the hands of their &#34;loving&#34; husbands.  Men can get away with murder<br />sometimes!
1401937268|5.0|Loved them......excellent...awesome, artistic, uplifting & creative effects.... I would definitely recommend these cards.  I am happy to use these as one of 2 decks!
B0051OZ564|5.0|Loved the music, loved the artistry of the dream sequences.  It was difficult for me to figure out at first (and I think for others).  After a 2-3 viewings I was able to fully grasp it.  I think this may be why it lower ratings from other reviewers.  I loved the movie 300, which is very similarly produced.  At times it feels campy, but I'm pretty sure it was intentional.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Rather strange book about a very disturbed young woman. Very well drawn out by Flynn. As she starts with the &#34;I&#34; husband interspersed with her diary entries. Very slowly she develops the plot and the twists. We are kept swinging back and forth until the very end.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Love it, I play when I have to wait in line, for service, or just because I am bored at home.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a very well done app. I think it does a great job competing in the app market. The only way it will keep competing is<br />if it keeps making updates door the world tour. Very unique standpoint but a very well done app
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is awesome! Imanji has done another, beyond amazing job. It has ziplines, minecarts and you are in the sky. Also if you die you can revive yourself with jewels. That's all I'm going to share.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The original Temple Run was great, but this one is even more fun. If you haven't played it yet, give it a try. You'll love it!
B00APJLFEG|4.0|This is a great movie for kids.  If you are an adult I am sure you will enjoy the humor in it, but your kids will love it.  If you love animations, this movie is for you!  I would recommend it!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Go figure...<br />'My So-called Life' and Clare Danes helped get me through my 20's by putting perspective on my troubled teens, and now again, on the post 9/11 world we all live in.<br />I used to paint the world in black and white, now I don't know.<br />Damian Lewis's Nick Brody shows us the gray in all the shades, and Clare's Carrie - looking for (and finding) love in all those dark places.<br />She's a girl with a broken mind and an anguished heart.<br />He's a boy with a torture-broken body and a restless spirit.<br />And so the tangled web of love and intrigue these two do very extraordinarily make - and to our great benefit especially.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I couldnt put the book down, you would stop and be like what next, what craziness is next if it's not one thing it that town it's something else, a must read!
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|I loved this book. Very well thought out and detailed. Most stories seems to like not finishing the whole story. Not the case with this book. Please give this one a chance if you have no intention of reading it.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|This movie was much better than expected and even kept my 80 year old mother in laughs (that was a surprise) Clean for the family too! (just a little potty humor)
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This product was extremely easy to install. My computer was idling around 48*c with stock cooling, and now idles at 27*c. Gaming shows a great difference in heat dissipation as well. I would strongly suggest this product to anyone looking to replace their current cooling setup.<br /><br />Looks can be deceiving. I thought this heatsink & base was a lot larger than it actually turned out to be. I was fearful that it wouldn't fit in my mid-tower case because of the side-fan, but it fits with a lot of room to spare. Fan is extra quiet as well.<br /><br />As a side note - I purchased Arctic Silver T.paste and may have not needed it in the end. But it's always wise to use quality products when dealing with CPU/Cooling as you don't want to ruin your investment.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It helps kill time and when I can't be with my own horse this helps me not miss her too much. My children enjoy it too
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Let me start out by saying this one blew my mind. I was skeptical, but oh goodness am I glad I bought this.<br /><br />My Rating: 5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />An Overview of the Novel: (I really worry I won't be able to adequately summarize the awesomeness of this novel. It was so complex and so deep, but oh well here I go.)<br /><br />Sky has been home-schooled for her entire life and has lived a very sheltered life. No TV, no computers, no electronics. She hasn't minded, but she's going to go to college soon and she wants to go to school her senior year and finally her mom agrees.<br /><br />But Sky has a little bit of a reputation going into school. She's been the make-out queen and has gone through more guys than she can name. She's never done more than make-out, but if you believe the rumors, then she's the school slut.<br /><br />Sky has never felt anything with any of the guys she's made out. It helps her be numb and to stop thinking, because whether they are dreams or her past, the moment Sky closes her eyes she sees awful images. Thinking is sometimes overrated.<br /><br />Then she meets Dean Holder and he makes her feel. The only problem is he is nothing but trouble and he infuriates her more than anybody she meets. She doesn't understand him. All she knows is he has serious issues. Sky's just not sure if she can handle him and when he comes clean, it might just be the thing that will tear them apart for forever.<br /><br />My Overall Thoughts/Impressions: I can't begin to name how many people told me I'd love this one. I'll admit to being skeptical. I wasn't sure if I'd like it, but so many people kept raving over it that I gave it a shot because it was cheap book.<br /><br />I was hesitant to read this book because there were certain aspects to the novel that I thought I'd find offensive. However, I gave it a shot and I wasn't offended; I was blown away by the book.<br /><br />I read five pages and I was feeling pretty hooked and then by two chapters in I knew I was going to have a long night ahead of me because there was no way I was going to stop reading until I turned the very last page.<br /><br />I loved Hoover's writing style. It's been a LONG LONG time since I've enjoyed a writing style this much. And then there were characters, dang her characters felt so real to me. I loved getting into Sky's head and watching her deal with unknown horrors that she had dealt with in her past.<br /><br />And then there was Dean Holder. Okay, I think I just found my fictional bad boy love. Dean Holder was everything I like in a bad boy--a boy who had a rough exterior and a bad reputation, but was really a sweet, sensitive, and oh so hot guy. Seriously, where can I find a Dean? He is easily one of my favorite characters of all time.<br /><br />Watching Sky and Dean interact was also mesmerizing. I was rooting for them from the get-go, but Dean and Sky both had a lot going on underneath the surface and the whole time I was worried they wouldn't get together.<br /><br />The chemistry between these two characters. This isn't giving anything away so don't panic. But one of my favorite scenes was when Sky confesses to Dean that she's never felt anything while being kissed. He then says she hasn't been kissed right because when he kisses her, she's going to feel it.<br /><br />I'm not a huge romantic and romantic scenes are never my favorite, but let me tell you that scene where he doesn't kiss her because he wants her to really feel it when he does kiss her....if you only read the novel for that scene, then that's a good enough reason.<br /><br />Trust me though this novel had depth to it. It's not a shallow romance like I so often read. Sky was an extremely developed character and she had a lot to overcome. The romance really wasn't the center of the story. And I loved that.<br /><br />That would have been enough to make me love this novel, but then came that ending. Don't worry I'm not going to give anything away. After finishing the novel, I had entered into absolute fangirl stage. It didn't end anything like I expected it would. I mean I did guess a few of the twists, but I was unprepared for the beauty of this novel and for its ending.<br /><br />I'm recommending this to anybody and everybody. Go buy this now. You'll want to read it again eventually and it's really cheap.<br /><br />So Why 5 out of 5 stars? In case you couldn't tell because I frickin' love this book. The writing was beautiful, the plot was gripping, the characters were incredibly developed, and the whole novel was mind-blowing.<br /><br />In Summary: Easily one of my favorites of the year. Hoover has created a tale that will capture the hearts and minds of every one who gets lost in its pages.<br /><br />Warnings/Side-notes: Sexual references and interactions. For 16 and up.<br /><br />The Wrap-up: Readers will be sucked into this world of beauty, pain, tragedy, love, redemption, and forgiveness and won't want to leave the book. However, when they turn the last page, they'll be satisfied and that's a mark of a great book. As much as I'd like to read more about Dean and Sky, I'm perfectly satisfied and don't need a sequel. There aren't many books I can say that about.g the novel, I had entered into absolute fangirl stage. It didn't end anything like I expected it would.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I think it is very good since it keeps a record of your calculations.  It is also large and easy to read.
B00APJLFEG|1.0|Hard to rate the movie when the streaming was inconsistent and slow. From what we could follow on the movie, it seemed great. But, we got tired of waiting through the long pauses from slow streaming. By the time we were willing to sit it out and actually wait, our 24 hour rental was over...:(
B006GLM5EQ|5.0|I love this show I got hooked on the first episode!!! The quality of the video was great and I was able to watch it instantly.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Yet a continuation of their love story. eavesDrop may New revelations and surprise events in this book. Leaves you hanging... Can't wait to start the last book!
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Okay, I'm hooked.  The Outlander series has been my noontime reading material for sometime now.  That means I can't spend more than an hour a day with Jamey and Claire, et al., but I really look forward to the next installment of their adventures.  Having made the choice to serialize their story I know I have many, many months of noontime adventure ahead of me.  Perhaps coincidentally, I live and work in the same town and at the same university where Diana Gabaldon lives and worked.  Although I have never met her, I am totally fascinated by her ability to weave a tale of adventure and love outside of the constraints of time.  Highly recommended for anyone who loves a loooooong storyline.
B003QO8TDC|5.0|This is a wonderful movie, as impressive now as it was when it first appeared in 1983.  Only the jokes about &#34;Polacks&#34; date it.  The women are beautiful and brilliant dancers, though too beautiful and brilliant for the humble bars in which they perform.  The music, the dancing and the photography, together with the high quality of the acting, make it a movie to see and hear again and again.
B00AF6B22E|4.0|\\"The way you landed that plane was nothing short of a miracle.\\" Captain Whip Whitaker (Washington) is a great pilot. Mid-flight the plane he is flying begins to malfunction and lives are in danger. When his skill and quick thinking save the lives of most of the passengers he is called a hero. Then his past catches up with him and his career and life are in jeopardy. I was looking forward to this movie because of Denzel. After watching it I have to say not only was the movie fantastic but I am again amazed at how good he is in this. For someone of Denzel's stature usually you watch and only see the actor himself. For example I like him a lot but when I see Kevin Costner every once in awhile watching him I think that's him and it takes me out of the movie for a second. All that rambling is to make a point. The entire movie I didn't once see Denzel, all I saw was an alcoholic pilot who was trying to save his own skin. You aren't sure if he is a good guy or not throughout. I could go on and on about his performance but this is one that just needs to be seen. Besides the acting job the movie itself is great and affecting. This is an absolute must see. Overall, one of the best movies of the year as well as one of the best acting performances. I give it an easy A.
0345803493|5.0|Enjoyed the story line on all 3 of these books. The rest was just a bonus.<br />Would read  more of her books.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|so many games to play and it gets you started with a couple of games win or lose u can retry get the game
032180354X|5.0|If you've been to Strobist.com you know that the one thing missing there is diagrams to visually explain the lighting setups. If you've not been to Strobist.com.... well go there now AND buy this book as it provides all the visual explanations you're likely to need.<br /><br />First off, the book gives great written information about what you will need and has solid suggestions on what works well and what to avoid. Follow these suggestions and the book will more than pay for itself. The writing is informal, easy to understand and cleverly worded to keep you interested.<br /><br />The bulk of this work is drawn from the authors own 365 day project to take a well lit photo every day for a year. There are 50 of these photos, one  filling the left hand page of a pair of pages. On the right hand of the pair is another photo that shows the lighting setup used to accomplish the shot. It's brilliant, you see the shot and see the setup directly next to it. In the setup shot you will find all the info as to flash settings, camera settings, lens used and distance between equipment and subject.<br /><br />What could be clearer? Buy this book, learn at Strobist.com, get some equipment (the right equipment) and you will light like a real pro. Brilliant!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Loved it, fabulous story and easy to read in Kindle<br />Thanks for the service, it is a great way to read
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a very fun and cool game. It is very popular and ally of people play it and I like it ally and I really want them to make a temple run 3
B00124BNF4|4.0|I'm not crazy about all their songs but they have a few that I love. This 'best of&#34; had at least six of my favorites so it was worth 5.99 for 18 songs.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was really easy to read and a page turner. I read it for a book club and the book made for great conversation.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|THIS IS A MUST SEE MOVIE. I LAUGHED,I CRIED,BUT, MOST OF ALL I WOULD TELL ANYONE WHO HAS NOT SEEN IT,BUY THIS MOVIE
B00APJLFEG|3.0|Okay for Grand kids.  The movie was watched and enjoyed by an four and eight year old plus their grandad!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's very nice. It does move kinda slow, but it's not worth it to spend real money to get things done faster.
B004HX0P2Y|4.0|I purchased this movie after having seen it at the theater.  It has some very funny parts.  You get a little bit of everything with this movie. It has action, romance and comedy.
B0032KPE0G|4.0|This is a delightful adult movie.  I recommend it for people looking for a relaxing couple of hours without violence.  The dialogue is quite good, and the performances are solid.  I would keep it away from young children.  While there is no violence, the language is adult.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|The sensitivity is too low, the upgrades are weak, and the gameplay is awkward at best.<br /><br />I don't find this game nearly as fun as the 1st Temple Run. Actually, I think it sucks.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Before you scream at me for saying it is better than the original, I made that decision based soley on the limitations that the original film had, I always felt that it was attempted too early.<br /><br />The acting for the most part was a sleep walk, Mrs Biel phoned her part in from so far away that buying the long distance carrier was probably part of her contract.  On the other end of the spectrum though was Kate Beckinsale, she sold her part so well that I all I could think of was that she was channeling a very personal bad relationship termination in her head the entire time.<br /><br />The film seemed to be rushed from start to finish, I understand that it was an action movie, but but even a shoot-em-up needs something more than this.<br /><br />I don't regret watching the film at all, as mentioned before KB more than made it worth it, but I still wished there could have been more to it.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|This is a must see movie for adults and children.  The cast is excellent. I would even recommend buying this movie!!
B00821P7FM|1.0|Just very poorly written. The premise has a lot of potential, and if AMC had made it it would be off the hook. The dialogue is cheap, and with so many teenage actors it doesn't seem like anyone has prior experience with acting. It's like watching a high school play. About aliens. The plot usually isn't believable, and it's never interesting. Just get new writers and the show might amount to something.

B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Sound City will quickly become one of the classic rock documentaries of all time. Period. It beautifully remembers a time and place, documents its decline, and points the way to the future.
0446585041|3.0|From the very first story, Cover Girl, I got the impression that I was reading ideas and thoughts that were clever and well-meaning, but not very funny.  Then I started imagining Ellen delivering those lines: a short pause at the right moment, an inflection of the voice when needed, and her low-key, deadpan delivery that is so unique.  All of a sudden, the book got a lot funnier.  Of course, it was tiring and impractical to keep that up throughout the book.<br /><br />I guess the listen here is that stand-up comedy must be heard not read.  Without the comic's delivery, we're left with anecdotes that are rather wise and somewhat entertaining, but not very funny.  Still, there is enough insight and amusement to recommend the book.  Just don't expect to be doubling over with laughter.
1250006341|5.0|How could a person not love this book. Pictures are beautiful andDownton Abbey is such a great production<br />It was a gift and they love it
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Absolutely loved this novel. The whole book was great but the ending was my favorite part because it was so unexpected but so perfect.
B00AHXIC50|4.0|Love this album. It gets better than \\"Locked Out of Heaven\\" but not one for the kiddies, if its the explicit version. If you've never been a Bruno Mars fan, this will be the album to change your mind.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|The DVD was in great condition and I received it earlier than expected.  I enjoyed the movie when I saw it in the theater and I enjoyed it the second time just as much.
B00005JN8Z|3.0|I hesitate to write a review for this film because I don't like writing reviews unless I REALLY like the film or book.  I didn't dislike \\"Quo Vadis,\\" however, it's not one of my faves either.<br /><br />First of all, I LOVE Deborah Kerr so I was really looking forward to seeing this film.  I didn't feel like this was one of her best films, but she, as usual, was lovely and efficient. However, I couldn't get passed Robert Taylor though. He was a beautiful man, but I couldn't get passed his deficient acting skills.  It got so bad that I, literally, slept through the burning of Rome. I know that there are a lot of Taylor fans out there, but I have yet watch one of his films that kept me interested except for \\"Camille\\" and that was ALL because of Garbo.<br /><br />The one true stand out was Peter Ustinov.  Yes, his performance seemed over the top, but it brought some much needed levity to this very long film whether he was meant to or not.<br /><br />This is the last of Miss Kerr's available films that I haven't purchased yet, but I can get it for free on Amazon Prime through unlimited streaming.  I plan to watch it again and, who knows, it just may grow on me. I most certainly will watch the burning of Rome to see what I initially missed. I'll probably end up buying the DVD anyway just to complete my collection.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I am a huge fan of Colleen Hoover's books and this one was no different. I think she does a great job at the beginning of writing about Sky's internal battle between wanting to be closer to Holder and thinking he's not good for her. I think we've all been there at least once in our life. As I was reading and more of the story line started to fall into place I was blown away but the grace she used to touch on such a difficult topic. I love Sky, I love Holder and I love them together. The bond they have is one that I think everyone should experience at least once in a life time.<br />In other words this was an amazing book.<br />Way to go Colleen Hoover!!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Very nice story of true love. How mature love really is. How two people can trust LOVE and let their feelings go.
B00683JK9K|1.0|Rotation doesn't work, no matter how fast you double click the piece...<br />Sad because this could be a really good time waster...<br />A puzzle that doesn't work isn't worth the free download..<br />Fix it &amp; the rating would go up...
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season 3 is fantastic.  Although I don't like everything that happened to my favorite characters (I won't say who because I've seen episodes that have not yet been broadcast in the US), the show continues to provide great story lines, fabulous characters, and wonderful character development.  I love the characters and don't want the show to ever end.  And, like most people, the Dowager Countess is my favorite.  She never fails to surprise me and give me a giant belly laugh.  Julian Fellowes and Maggie Smith have created one of the greatest characters to grace the screen, big or small.  Thank you to them both.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My niece and nephew love to play this game and take care of their horse. It would be better if everything didn't cost so many diamonds.
1451695195|5.0|I have read it and already passed it on.  The other person has also read it and it is being passed forward.  You cannot keep this book to yourself--it is too remarkable.  The author describes his journey so vividly that you almost feel you are there.  As a nurse, I also enjoyed his technical discourse.  I highly recommend this book. My friend and I read this book very quickly--once you start it, it is almost impossible to put down!
B001B3MCQK|5.0|love the music, love the poetry of lyrics and I feel cheated that I never had the chance to hear Rodriquez 30+ years ago!
B0090SI4HO|4.0|Here I am with a review on this account. I have mostly done reviews for old Wrestling Pay Per Views & done my 20 years ago & 2003 in film reviews on my newer account. But anyway getting to this review for The Last Stand which is Arnold Schwarzenegger's 1st leading role in 10 years. Made on a budget of $30 or $45 million made a very disappointing $6 million in it's opening weekend the number 1 film of that weekend was some movie called Mama which I am sure is a run of the mill horror film. Or a movie like Machete that was suppose to be a exploitation, revenge film instead was about the border & very pretentious. This movie is what Machete should've been. Directed by Kim Ji Woon this has been the only movie that I have seen that he has directed. It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as Sheriff Ray Owens,Eduardo Noriega as Cortez,n Johnny Knoxville as Lewis Dirkum, Peter Stormare as Burell, Jamie Alexander as Deputy Torrance Zach Gilford as Deputy Bailey, Forest Wittaker as Agent John Banister, Genesis Rodriguez as Agent Ellen Richards, Luis Guzman as Deputy Mike Figerola & Rodrigo Santoro as Frank Martienez. The story is you have this Drug Lord named Cortez escape FBI custody when his henchies takes this giant magnet that picks up the van he is in Cortez kills the guards he escapes takes an agent named Ellen Richards hostage & leaves in a Corvette C6 ZR1 that has been modified. Meanwhile you have this Sheriff named Ray Owens who is Sheriff in a small town he gets a call that this local farmer played by Harry Dean Stanton hasn't delivered any milk at the local Diner. A couple of his deputies Jerry Bailey & Sarah Torrance check out the farmers house where they find him dead they look outside where they find blood & tire tracks leading to The Canyons. Meanwhile Agent John Banister has the local cops set up a blockade to stop Cortez but his henchies gun the cops down a Bulldozer comes through knocks some cop cars out of the way Cortez speeds through in his Corvette & dodges theremaining SWAT Trucks. Then you go back to that farm house where Sheriff Owens & another Deputy Mike Figuerola they find the body & they find out that Deputies Torrance & Bailey are going into a trap. Then you have Burell a guy that is going to help Cortez escape The US. They open fire at Deputies Bailey & Torrance. Burell shoots Deputy Bailey in the back with a Sniper Rifle. Sheriff Owens drives up saves his Deputies guns some of Burell's hencies down with his Shot Gun. Deputy Bailey dies later on. Agent Banister contacts Sheriff Owens he tells him about Cortez. He prepares to go to war with Burell & stop Cortez. Owens Deputizes a local man named Frank Martinez cause he was friends with Deputy Bailey. Owens goes to this guy named Lewis Dirkum who has a lot of illegal firearms. He goes to The Diner & tells the people in there to go home for their safety. This scene is funny where the old guy tells him \\"I'm 72 years old I'm eating an omlet with extra bacon & cheese do you think I'm afraid of death.\\" I know I messed that line up but. Then Burell & his men show up at town square where you get a series of really good action scenes where Deputy Figuerola is pinned down behind a car. This was really over the top in a good way where Burell takes a rocket launcher fires it at the car that Deputy Figuerola is hiding behind & Figuerola is still alive & comes out firing a machine gun starts firing it at Burell's men but he is shot by a sniper. You have Sheriff Owens in the back of an old School Bus firing a mini gun from T2. Dirkum shoots a flare gun at 1 of the henchies & he is blown apart. That character Frank comes into the picture he drives the bus into town square & runs over 1 of Burell's men. He also saves Deputy Torrance from being killed. The scene with the old lady is beyond hilarious. Burell tries to escape in the school bus but is killed by Sheriff Owens. Burell's phone rings & Owens answer's it. It's Cortez Owens lets him know who he is. Cortez speeds through townsquare Owens steals The Mayor's Corvette which you have a battle of The Corvettes. Not going further into the plot I pretty much told a little bit of what happens. The Last Stand was a fun movie & a solid 1 at that the only problems was it is kind of slow early on the main villain isn't all that great. But you have likeable & funny characters & some really good action set pieces. Kim Ji woon did a good job directing.  Arnold Schwarzenegger was really good. Forest Wittaker did a decent job. Johnny Knoxville was ok. Genesis Rodriguez was ok. Rodrigo Santoro was ok. Zach Gilford was ok Peter Stormaro was good. Jamie Alexander did a good job. Luis Guzman did a pretty good job. Like I said only 2 or 3 issues with the movie but overall a solid fun movie.
B009FZFONO|5.0|If you like the zombie genre, watching this show is a no-brainer, but it's much more than that.  It has great character development, plot, conflict, and emotion.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|Cute colorful  a lot of princesses  high quality nice for a princess room easy to remove from paper and stick all over the walls<br />.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Best story I have read in a long time. It was so believable and engrossing. I've read it  twice and would love to read a  sequel to it.
B000FC130E|4.0|I've not finished the story yet (school really gets in the way sometimes), but what I have read is curious, complex, twisting, amusing, and fascinating. My best friend recommended it, and I would certainly do the same to those who enjoy mystery, adventure, fiction, and London.
B006XMR1YC|5.0|An essential classic album for any electronic music lover. Whether you like classic house, electro, ambient or Detroit techno, this album embodied them all and was done before most knew who he was.
0345803493|5.0|Gotta be one of my favorite books. I hope more books come out with a great story line like this..

B003PIUBZS|5.0|Heard of the series from the guys at work, then rented and watched &#34;Blood and Sand&#34;. It was awesome... Then eventually bought season 2. Gotta have the entire series... :)
B008Y212PI|5.0|I now own all flip pix art, hexalogic, hexsaw and flip pix puzzle apps!  I love them so much that when I finish them, I uninstall them and download them again so I can do them over and over, all the while checking for new apps by the devs!  I love these puzzles and highly recommend them to everyone! I don't think I have paid more than $1.99 for any of the puzzles, and would gladly pay more!  Keep up the great work Gabysoft!  I love you!  Your puzzles, that is! Lol!  Thanks!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I don't know what these people are saying!!!! I freaking looove this game! I played it nonstop till I beat the whole thing
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|I downloaded this because it was free that day but honestly I don't know what the difference between this and Adobe is, but I can say that opening docs on my phone is easier now.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|I still find it incredible that the actors actually sang the covers of the songs! ALMOST like some of the covers as much as the originals. Highly suggest looking into this for anyone that loved the '80s music scene.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My son loves this movie!! Such a great story and so much to learn from it!! Dr Seuss does it again!!
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|The music from Pride and Prejudice is simply &#34;Beautiful&#34;.  I also bought the piano music for a family member as a birthday present.

B004HO6I4M|5.0|I love the story and fun music.  Great animation, story and music. Great time for the whole family!  Haven't had this much fun in a long time.  Recommend Rio to all.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I got this app because it was being offered for free the day I downloaded it. Overall it's a great app and if you live in the Chicagoland area and like alternative music, it's a must for the car to listen to Q87.7 bc my radio doesn't go down that low. I don't know what the difference between the pro and the regular is though.
B005DOL0R0|4.0|I was disappointed that it didn't have a pocket for a stylus.  Otherwise, I am very satisfied with the product.

0062124293|4.0|Excellent book, I highly recommend it for a quick read that is both funny and enlightening. Moran makes the cringe worthy moments of womanhood bearable. Great for young women!
B0090X4GJE|4.0|I bought this CD bc I like the artist and I think I got it for 4 or 5 dollars. Overall really good for the price!
0743497465|5.0|wonderful book that i also have as an ebook but wanted to share with my friends. the price offered was super and delivery very fast!
B000Q76K1A|5.0|This movie is so good and thrilling. I'd seen it a few years back but couldn't really remember everything so I decided to watch it again. Such a good decision. The acting is great, the places they filmed are perfect and the premise is interesting. I definitely recommend this series.
1439156816|5.0|I annoyed my husband by stopping to read out loud passages throughout this book. That is the finest compliment I can pay to any writer.
B000669GAI|4.0|There are some great songs here, for the true fans of the band, I highly recommend it. I bought this after seeing the documentary Pearl Jam 20 because it reminded me of the great songs I had not listened to in a long time.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|great movie for a night with a girlfriend...something very realistic which also makes you smile about our reality. Absolutely recommended!
B0018QOIXU|5.0|I truly love this artist! She has a sound all her own that cannot be mistaken for anyone else. Awesome!  :)
0446577391|5.0|Excellent<br />This review requires that I write ten more words.  Word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word.
B004EE30DW|5.0|Fans of the Decemberists unique sound will enjoy the DVD look at the making of this great album. Some great catchy tunes on the CD with a delightful blend of styles. Is that a bouzouki I hear along with a country twang, an accordion and some folk/indie rock edge? It's great.
B000M5NRLC|5.0|This movie is a classic, even for those of us that love the animated &#34;Grinch.&#34; Our family just loves it!
B009VSW15Y|3.0|The Kindle is not very practical as a camera.  It is hard to see what you are going to get when you don't have a viewfinder.  It is not the fault of the software but I seldom use it.
0446604844|5.0|Excellent<br />This review requires that I write ten more words.  Word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I could watch this one over and over. Richard Armitage and Daniela Denby-Ashe are excellent as the romantic leads. If you don't care very much about the plight of the mill workers in 19th century England, you can always skip over those scenes, but you'll be missing some great scenes with an outstanding supporting cast.
0545265355|4.0|I just love the books. I'll certainly read them again! Hard back books are also nicer to read than on a tablet.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Vince Flynn is a great author and both my wife and I always read his latest book.  Mitch Rapp is quite a character.

B003MC5N28|5.0|Although the setting is a dystopian society, it's not just another dystopian book.  It's told from a unique angle.  Very enjoyable.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game has no bugs, has the best things to do and lots of things to do and has world tour which rocks. Is a great time killer
B0012GTZC0|4.0|Ken Follett is one of my favorite authors and this is one of his best mytery books.  The plot is hard to figure out until the very end.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|If you work in technology, you should definitely read this book.  It touch on many subjects that people think they're doing, but they're actually doing them wrong, or not enough.<br /><br />I read it in one sitting.  The fact that it was a novel made it far easier to read and grasp concepts compared to technical books.<br /><br />READ IT!
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|This book was hopeless itself! Terrible, will not finish it. Maybe a needy teenager will love it and all those dumb characters.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|The Christian Bale Batman trilogy is great from start to finish.  The final installment of the trilogy may be the best of the three.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It is about as good as any solitaire game I have played.  I like that you can undo selections when you have more than one play, so that you can decide which is most likely to result in more plays.
B0088WFZQG|5.0|MAN MOVIE! Perfect for when the wife goes to bed early and you want to watch some amazing action. Boom!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I would highly recommend this book!  I couldn't put it down, after about 1/3 of the way through.<br />GREAT BOOK!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app, it is super fun and I can not believe that a game of this quality is free.You are going to love this game. It is also on a world tour so it changes places and gets limited edition people.Enjoy.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I haven't read a John Grisham book for quite some time, but I have read them all.  This was not one of his best in my opinion.
0439023491|5.0|This book was amazing can't wait to watch the movie just finished it last week. It was definitely worth my money!!!!! Would totally recommend the book I would give it 10 stars although I can't say the same for Mocking Jay!! Mocking Jay turned out to be really disappointing!! But overall I give this book 10 stars ;)
B00APUQH0W|4.0|Cantankerous relationship with his daughter is typical of Clint Eastwood character. Tough guy,<br />not a family man, but underlying protection of his daughter give us hope.<br />Adult language, not recommended for family audience.
B006RXPUR2|4.0|This diverting mystery is full of twists and turns, surprising villains and imperfect heroes.  While it is not a deep metaphysical work, it does leave the viewer with some interesting questions to ponder in the end.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|A good way to waste time.  I don't know why I play it but sometimes I do. What else can I say.
0439023513|3.0|I expected more from this book but let me down sooo dissapointed. I am very unsatisfied with the book with Peeta going all crazy Primroose ended up dead I'm so mad Katniss getting all burned well except for her face. The ending seemed short it was like if the writer was bored with the book and did not know what to write anymore!!!! I really loved the first and second book bit this one let me down;(
B001UV4XIS|5.0|A great movie of all times for the kids and all the family .Hours of entertainment and excitement.Love all the potter movies.
B009JBZH54|5.0|When I saw that I could get the whole Dark Knight series in a box set and on Blu-Ray, it pretty much made it the best Christmas. Totally worth the price.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I love this but sometimes when your fixing he display or sound for some reason it will take you to home but other than that its a pretty good app I recomind u get this cuz u can pick the alarm how long to snoozie and fix he lighting with a swipe of a finger (literary)  I would have to say his is the best alarm ive ever had
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the only game I can play when I'm bord!!!my high score is 60172!!!!!best game ever I thought it would be like temple run , it's so much better!!!!!!!!
B00633W614|4.0|I enjoyed this series. I'm looking forward to the next book. I have read Cane and Able by Jeffery Archer years ago. I enjoyed that book too. Not sure why I didn't keep up with this author, but I'm glad I found him again!
B000JMLFLW|3.0|Great read. Enjoyed it very much. Going to read it for a second time. really enjoyed the read. Great story and book.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Like many Walking Dead fans, I don't really care about zombies.  I'm not a horror movie fan at all, actually, and zombie flicks have always been my _least_ favorite.  But this show is superb.  Think of it as just an excellent drama that happens to have zombies.  The actors, writers, and director all did an amazing job.  I discovered this show a few days ago and watched seasons one and two almost back-to-back, and I'm now caught up and waiting for new episodes from season 3.  If you like good drama, you'll love this show.  Don't let the zombies &#34;scare&#34; you away.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|If you manage to avoid becoming addicted, its great because each level only takes a minute or so. I enjoy playing untimed so it stays stress free. And I was pleasantly surprised that its not at all frustrating either since spacial is not my thing.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Make sure that you have some spare time ahead before starting reading this book! Captivating and well written. A must
B0052UYJDC|5.0|A great little book which is jammed full of information, I rushed through it on the first read, but even now some months later I'm still enjoying going back &#34;in&#34; to re-read bits and pieces. Francine has an delightful way of getting her views across!!!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This is without a doubt one of the finest dramas I have ever had the pleasure of watching.  I say that as someone who doesn't care for horror flicks, and most especially not the zombie genre.  When a friend recommended this, I thought she was crazy and I delayed for months before finally giving it a try.  I wish I hadn't.  Once I started watching it I finished the first two seasons in a few days.<br /><br />To me, the zombies are really a very small part of this show.  Like any good show, it is the writing, acting, and directing that make it amazing, not the subject matter.  But the premise provides an excellent breeding ground for all sorts of drama.  One of my favorite aspects of the show is the incredibly hard decisions that have to be made, and the show's writers do a good job of showing that right and wrong under these circumstances aren't nearly as clear-cut as you might think.<br /><br />The show also very realistically portrays the fact that diversity is most certainly NOT strength.  With only a few survivors, the group is a wildly disparate one with people from all sorts of backgrounds.  They rarely agree on anything, and are in constant conflict.  And yet they manage to overcome diversity (for the most part) and pull together to face the common threat.<br /><br />Don't think of this as a zombie show.  Think of it as one of the best dramas on TV that happens to have zombies.
0812992792|3.0|It was very engrossing book and a bit over the top.  There were harrowing parts mixed in with a bit of Catch 22 satire, so at times I was not sure what tone the author was going for.  But I did find it a compelling read and finished it over a weekend.
B004CUVRF6|4.0|Great family time movie.  It kept my husband, my sons (16 & 8), and myself entertained and left us smiling.  It probably would have been great to see in 3D in the theater.  Glad we own it now.
B004XGN8W4|4.0|First, lets talk about the appearance. This thing is absolutely cool. the entire packaging, everything about it screams awesome. You will feel boss carrying it around, I guarantee.<br /><br />Lets talk functionality. Chances are, the lack of a remote won't matter - you should be sitting fairly close to it, considering the size. Plenty of room to pop in your cords and a controller. The only real problem is that there isn't much of any room for games, but if you're travelling, its all too simple to just toss those in with your other possessions. I'm using this with my Wii U, and aside from the gamepad (obviously) not fitting, it works fine.<br /><br />I've noticed a few discrepancies. Despite being listed as a 720p HD TV, my console seems convinced that the optimum resolution for the tv is 1080p. I don't know if that is fault of console, or if the TV is secretly better than advertised. The other, is that the packaging (including the user manual) claims that it includes an HDMI cable - which it did not.<br /><br />Lastly, the colors on the tv seem a bit off occasionally. Particularly on the home menu, where it would normally be a clear white and grey in the background, seems to take on a slightly greenish hue.<br /><br />All that aside, I don't regret the purchase in the least. I didn't notice the discolouration while playing The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword at all. in fact, it looked better on this, than on my main TV.

B0036T1RMM|4.0|This isn't really one story; like so many films of the period, it attempts to connect a series of loosely intersected lives, with a lot of strangeness and bizarre occurances thrown in for....what??? I don't think the director's intention was to provide answers, and I certainly didn't feel like I got any. But that's OK. There's enough going on to keep my interest through a couple of viewings already, and I'd watch it again. Cruise and other well-known actors give strong performances, and the movie is visually intriguing, if rather dark. The title seems to bear no relation to anything in the movie; if you figure it out, let me in on it, OK? I liked &#34;Magnolia&#34;, it's has just the right mix of realism and wierdness to keep my interest, and the fact that there didn't seem to be any point doesn't bother me at all.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|I read the book first and was super excited about the movie.  However, the movie leaves out some key details from the book.<br /><br />I thought Effie was perfect! Exactly how I imagined her from the book.  And Katniss too! Peeta was not at all how I imagined him from the book.  Kind of disappointed with him in the movie.<br /><br />However, I still like th movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Dear Mojang<br /><br />I really like this app. But I would like to ask that you add slimes , endermen, enchanting, potion making, obsidian nether portals, red stone lines, pressure plates, levers, and iron doors. I hope this isn't to much to ask for.<br />  Sincirely<br />  Josh Massey
B005S9EJ14|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, especially the performances by the absolutely wonderful cast they had assembled.  The story is set in India, where a group of...shall we say, retirement age folks decide to spend their golden years for an assortment of reasons.  One man is returning to find his lost love of years ago.  A couple with not much money hopes to stretch out their bank account.  Another lady comes to get an operation and finds herself confronting her own prejudices.<br /><br />The hotel that they journey to is run-down, but still incredible.  Culture-shock abounds, and some end up thriving and others run away from the sights, smells, sounds, and food of this very non-English land.<br /><br />But the real star of this movie is the place.  Brightly colored, always on the move, exotic, beautiful and dreadful, old-fashioned and future-oriented at once, India shines through the story.  We see it through the eyes of this older generation as well as through the eyes of the young Indian people who are striving to make their way in the world, including the owner of the hotel who wants to break with tradition and marry a woman his mother doesn't approve of.<br /><br />Quite enjoyable for an evening, but probably too slow-moving for some.
B004U8VWLE|3.0|Not a bad movie, interesting to watch, but a very dreary interpretation of life as a ballet dancer. The performances are solid but not exceptional. Don't expect any smiles and giggles or the soaring exhaltation of success; this story's all about pain and depression and struggle, reflected at every moment in Portman's face. The dull, almost monochromatic colors accentuate the somber mood. If I wanted to be a dancer, this movie might convince me to change my plans.
B0069UP2PI|5.0|I love this movie! It's scary how realistic it is.  How quickly a deadly virus can spread and wreak havoc.  Hope nothing like this ever happens.
B008MEM24S|5.0|My 7 year old loves this game. And my 2 year old is learning fast. Gotta love Perry. Going to put this on my phones as well.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I'm surprised that I don't get tired of this evening soap opera.  I watch my favorite episodes  whenever time permits.  I think my being older (over 70) is part of why this satisfies me.
0062238868|1.0|So he enjoys shooting and killing people.... and he works for the US government.<br /><br />He is proud of all the people he HAZED, MURDERED, BEAT UP, HARRASSED, and womanizer.<br /><br />Is that the picture perfect example of a American Hero?<br /><br />When did america started glorifying socio-psycho-paths?<br /><br />Basically he is just a serial killer on the US payroll
B005LLX582|5.0|I thought this was a really great movie.  It's kind of artsy, but it definitely evokes human emotion.  And in my book, if a movie can do that, then I think it's great.  Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain were surprisingly great in this movie.  This movie really makes you think about life.
0345803485|5.0|it was great book good for my relationship we both where into it.<br />It helped us open up more about fantasy.
0307359913|5.0|This can be as intense as you want it.  I'm still in the first phase of the diet, and the results are as promised.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|As soon as you download this app, it tells you to download it again but from a trusted site, neither will actually allow you to download any YouTube videos. This app is a big disappointment.
B004A8ZWVK|3.0|I liked this movie, but I thought it was way over-hyped.  Definitely not as great as all the fuss was about.  Still trying to figure out what the fuss was about...
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Not a bad read. Cannot wait for the movie. Curious to see how close to the book they make it.
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|I am happy to report that the instant download worked very well. I am sad to report that I paid to see this movie. But, on the good side, at least I didn't pay to see it in the theater. I enjoyed the first 3..... This one really is pretty bad. I've seen worse. Battlefield Earth for one.... But still, I'm glad it only cost me $4.......
B0096HNDXY|5.0|Kylie's best loved hits brought to a sensual level live you've never heard before. What a treat Kylie has given us with this enchanting collection of songs sung the the way only Miss Minogue could - and backed by an orchestra! A true treasure for any Kylie fan.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|This is a GORGEOUS album!!!  WOW!  I loved &#34;Amore&#34; and this is just as incredible!  For the reviewers who didn't give it 5 stars -- are you NUTS????  It's sexy, cool jazzy sounding... with some sultry latin rhythms.... if that's not your style, then this isn't for you.  If you LOVE that style, and LOVE Andrea, this is SUCH a home run!  Buy IT!!
0307588343|5.0|Above all others, this is an inside view of the cataclysm that began with Lehman's collapse. There is no whining, no evil vs. good, no cheap western good guys vs. the bad bankers. The book simply offers a point of view and a box of assorted figures from the firm and there place(s. In doing so, McDonald not only gives us, untutored or not, a blow by blow description and explanation of how this could have happened.<br /><br />Better yet, he's able to put a personal face first on himself and his career and soon thereafter on so many key players in the firm the role each played as the firm sank. All of this from someone inside, in the center of it. Add master storytelling to the writer's quals and we might have here the top narrative of the fall of a great firm and the beginning of what was certainly a glimpse of a real worldwide crash, not a recession.<br /><br />Exciting and up close and personal. Snatch this book up!<br /><br />-- JL
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|A must see, I liked the movie a lot.  Good action, good story, and I like the fact it was based on somewhat true events.
B0030Y11QK|5.0|I have always liked Ms. Binoche's roles in the movies I have seen. Although Chocolat remains my favorite. She is in the role of a supportive sister. Very real and compelling.
B003JR1USM|4.0|This album could have flowed better, but other than that each song is catchy and accessible and all around I love it.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I love all the action/adventure type movies. I now own all the Batman Movies on VHS and DVD. I live where the tragedy took place over the opening. I am glad I stayed home and now I can watch all my movies in peace. If you love Batman, then this is the one for you.  My grandsons and I are having a Batman Marathon this weekend.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|The case looks nice but it distorts the audio noticeably. Its a lot harder to hear sounds from the iphone with the case on. The touchscreen is also a lot less sensitive which made it really annoying. Id recommend this only if youre going to use it temporarily for anything involving water. I wouldnt use it all the time because the lack of  touchscreen sensitivity is annoying and the sound is annoying.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I used it on a Kindle Fire HD.  It worked very well for what I needed.  I can recommend it for those how need to access the file system.
B009MSNTC2|5.0|This was a Xmas gift for my nephew and the expression on his face was priceless.  He absolutely loved putting it together.
B000NI8F5G|5.0|If you like good old movies then this a good one for you. Try it you will love it. I recommend this one and I have added it to y collection
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Straight away, I must say that I am drawn to the sheer beauty of the series, starting with each episode's montage played over the compelling and tense theme. This continues throughout what with beautiful people and costumes populating the estate. But, really, Downton has turned into a bit of a basic soap opera with not uncommon if beautifully presented plotlines. The acting is still excellent -- finally giving Maggie Smith something to do with her still-fine theatrical chops other than speak witty punchlines. Each episode also seems to have an &#34;easter egg&#34; of history thrown in for those of who like the stuff -- one comment or so per episode about the Habsburgs or references to the &#34;dual monarchy&#34; or the like. This is fun, but is becoming part of a formula, I think. Still, yes, I will keep watching for the stunning Lady Mary's arched eyebrow or Matthew's excellent suits. Worth your time and money if you've like the contemporary Upstairs/Downstairs view heretofore or are an anglophile in general.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Very realistic. Just enough techincal info injected to make it believable, and entice you to keep reding and not put the book down.<br />II enjoyed the book very much.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a Fun game with cute horses and skills to learn. Cool equipment to buy.<br /><br />You just gotta love it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Battery HD is an easy and convenient tool to help you accurately track power usage. What are you waiting for? Download today!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|A lot of fun, but wish you could understand the scoring system.  The colors are just enough different to prove you must keep your eyes open.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much fun! If you like temple run, then this game is even better. You get to run from a cop, or a zoo keeper while collecting coins, mystery boxes, and character tokens that add up to buying cool new characters. Also you complete missions along the way to multiply the value of each coin you get. CAUTION this game is highly addicting.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I started using the Amazon MP3 a little over a year and so far I love it. I have both purchased and uploaded songs with no problem. I highly recommend and will continue to use.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Its a lot of fun to play!  The game almost plays itself and makes it a fast pasted game! Thanks!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|A great time waster and also challenging. Fun to buy the neurax worm and beat the game easily. A good buy
B0007GAEGC|5.0|their music is really good and there relaxing too, there's a lot of telnet with these women and i hope to see more music from them
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game was a lots of fun especially when playing with your kids it's a bit of scary and a whole lot of fun.
B00APJLEGA|5.0|My 4 yr. old dughter has not stopped watching this movie since we bought it.  Entertaining for adults as well.
B009DH2PP4|5.0|I started brewing a couple of months ago using a Mr. Beer kit (very nice way to introduce yourself to brewing in my opinion - small batches and cheap).  After brewing the simple extract I wanted to take it to the next level... and brew bigger batches... but I didn't know where to start.<br /><br />So, I bought this book and chapter 1 is perfect for understanding the process, equipment, and things to be mindful of.  Once you get past chapter 1, the book goes into detail on every aspect of brewing.<br /><br />I like this because it serves as a nice reference when you're wondering about things like &#34;what's the difference between dry and liquid yeast?&#34;.  I liked that they went really deep on these subjects even if I don't yet understand everything.<br /><br />There are a lot of diagrams/pictures which I found very helpful especially for brew day to understand what things should look like at different points in the process.<br /><br />All in all, I have a feeling this book will be my primary guide towards all things brewing for quite some time.
B003L77G6A|5.0|love this show its too funny if your a fan of the series its a must have and own. its lol
B009H442DG|5.0|Love the CD!  Great purchase.  They put together a nice variety of music, very entertaining.  Wouldn't find it in the stores.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Romantic and heartbreaking.  Got a tad bored right at the end, but other than that it was a really great book!

B001EO2UKO|5.0|love dido's music when im sad for some reason her music speaks to me idk why but its really good too
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|Kind of mindless.  Not much you can do with it other than make it talk.  Needs mord functions to make it enjoyable
B008Y212PI|5.0|I never buy apps. I'm all about free. I've bought 3 of these games. I love them. They're fun and addicting. And they sharpen your brain.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Kind of Amazon slightly tricked me by offering it as a new download when I already had it so I thought it a different version.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|love this show its too funny if your a fan of the series its a must have and own. its lol
0553280325|5.0|Great, pivotal book by Ray Bradbury. My sister needed it for a class and this is a great edition! I recommend it!
B001ECDVKE|5.0|I love this movie. Robot alien voices, exaggerated acting, and music that makes the martians head explode. What more could you ask for?
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a great book. I highly recommend it.  If you are a fan of Sparks you will not be disappointed.

1400049628|3.0|I haven't actually read it but my roommate liked it. I got it as a present for him because he likes zombies.
B0050KEVO6|4.0|I'd recommend this app to people over the age of about 12. I don't usually write reviews but I very much like this game. It's a lot of fun but not your average alchemy game. Sometimes you have to think outside the box to get the answer. I suggest downloading the alchemy helper also. Not for &#34;cheating&#34; purposes but just so you know what your aiming for other wise you can get stuck and frustrated. However, once you catch on it's rather addicting. I played before bed the other night and after 2 hours of being up way to long I now play in the morning but never before I have something to do like go to bed or make lunch. But anytime I do get a few minutes I check into the game. The things you come up with are a lot of fun and push you to keep going because you want to know what's next. Of course you make normal things you would like in the original alchemy game like volcano's and swamps but you also make unexpected things sucks a countries Mario vampires and even sex in the city was my last surprising one. I'd of given it 5 stars but the ads are super annoying which u have to pay to remove and I wish there were more ways to sort it out. Also it gives you the option to get info about the things that you've made but I wish u didn't have to also pay just to get a hint the hints should be free. Even if u do have to pay I don't think 5 dollars is a fair asking price. That's almost as much as an EA Sims game or a movie for my android. However, still alot of fun. Good luck! :D
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|have al of the downton abbey vd's and this is added to the collection, and being loved and watched may times to see something that I had not seen before

B008QE9XD2|1.0|I'm glad the '70s are \\"in\\" again; by it's very nature, the classic Dark Shadows series is timeless. Many savor the classic gothic drama, with its tremendous cast. This spin-off film's best part, aside from the opening sequence with the train and Moody Blues (easy to script-write, a give away), is the momentary glimpse of favorites: Kathryn Leigh Scott, Lara Parker, David Selby, and Jonathan Frid; what good sports! Sadly, the new movie is not respectful of the series or actors, past and present. What a wasted opportunity, with a disappointing squandering of talent, resources, and classic story lines. Why alter the narrative so clumsily? There is no clear point of view, just a chaotic collage of images. Changing the demise of Barnabas' parents, Joshua and Naomi, is just one departure. The film drastically departs from many story-lines, and alters Maggie Evans in a bizarre way; Tim Burton turns Vickie into Maggie Evans. Except for the Moody Blues opening, Karen Carpenter (and other) music lends nothing. Burton inflicts that WHOLE Carpenter song on viewers (trite cynicism? Burton lost his mind) during what should have been a fun scene. The wrong Witch of Eastwick was cast; Susan Sarandon would have played our darkly mysterious matriarch Elizabeth Collins/Joan Bennett far better. Julia Hoffman is a throw-away part, as is Caroline - a desultory werewolf. Dr. Julia Hoffman's role is mangled, and Angelique is a brittle (literally) bore. Collinwood manor burns to the ground. What a mess, and a misuse of the goodwill numerous fans would have been happy to give. Tim Burton has his head up his wide child-bearing-sized hips. What's with that fixation? This film is the rant of a guy afraid to grow old, with riffs from his therapist's couch tossed in. There is a difference between honest vintage camp and contemporary mocking; Tim Burton lacks the ballast to discern between the two. Definition of a movie-bomb (or abomination): the Amazon trade-in value of this mint-quality is worth all of .05 cents!all of .05 cents!
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|Had fun watching it at Christmas time with the family. Beautifully packaged, great for gifts. I keep this one for myself
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is awesome!! My husband and I love it as well as our 9 and 11 year old boys. It's addictive so beware ;) Get ready for hours of fun!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|this is a semi older movie but its a great bluray collection only disappointment is in Aliens 3 the alien has not so great fx but all in all its really good if your a fan or new to the series jump on this its great you might wanna wait for a great sale for it like I did but either way you wont be disappointed
0525478817|5.0|This is not a book about cancer ;)<br /><br />This is a book about cancer as a side effect to everyday life and dealing with problems.  I loved the teenager angle, though I am 32, as it was wide open to new experiences and also cynical enough to make every situation humorous.<br /><br />I am buying this book for so many people in my life who know those dealing with cancer.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Great movie- a must in 3 D. A lot of fun for all family. One of those movies that you can watch again and again.
B00AE2I4WK|3.0|If you want to watch a chintzy dancing movie with a completely unrealistic storyline, watch this newest installment in the step up series.<br /><br />Dancing scenes are neat, as usual.
B0012GTZFC|5.0|This book really hits it home. I really liked how its laid out and the next steps the offer to raise people up to the next level. Great for people in any level of career.
B000PMLFRA|3.0|I love some of the original scenes in true HD.  But when I watched Empire, there were huge coloring issues and big changes from the movie I grew up loving on VHS.<br /><br />Maybe Disney will release the originals as they were shown in the theater...
B005LAII08|5.0|Great mother and daughter movie! I have a five year old and we were both teary eyes at the end.
0385737947|5.0|I have had these books for quite some time and am just now getting to the review. Ho boy.<br /><br />These books are fantastic. A really interactive and insane view of the future world! Absolutely a must for any young reader!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It's a fun game. Fast paced. Graphics are pretty good.  More things to do than Temple Run. I wish you had more than one chance if you die and perhaps continue where you left off.  Maybe add slower pace for younger or less experienced  players. Overall quite fun.
B00AHQNHSY|2.0|They even had to add an option to &#34;terminate the application on exit&#34;?? Wow, if that app was on Windows people would freak. Seems to play videos well enough to keep the kids occupied though.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Even better in 3 D than blue ray. It almost may me feel as if I was watching a new movie.
0439023513|5.0|Amazing book series, and does wonders for contemporary readers! These is actually a wonderful political aspect to this storyline that relates to current events.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's so fun because you are running away from the cop and his dog and you can collect coins, magnets , special shoes and a box that will give you prizes. If you sign into it with Facebook you get 5000 coin  for free and if any of your friends have the game you can compete with them.GET THIS GAME ITS AWESOME!!!!!!
B00A4Y9BT8|5.0|Classic album.  I picked it up for $2.99...yes the whole album.  Brings me back to my old skateboard days and is very clear.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Plays by \\"Back to the Future\\" time travel rules, makes sense to me! Bruce Willis is also awesome. No more words are needed.
0385738757|5.0|I thought the story couldn't get any better, but oh what a surprise!<br /><br />This book series is a really fresh storyline, and stays away from the dreary romantic storyline that seems to crop up in books these days. Buy. This.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Its a good read but not quite up to par compaired to some of Coreys other adventures.  I would recomend.
B0099Y2MYK|1.0|To be clear, that's one star for AMAZON, not Downton Abbey.  Viewing at 9 PM on Sundays doesn't mesh well with our Monday morning schedules so we were positively gleeful to get our Series 3 DVD, advertised as the \\"Original UK Version\\" on Amazon.  Last night, while surfing the internet on my laptop for Charlotte Russe recipes for next week's viewing party, I decided I needed another peek at Ethel's masterpiece, so I popped over to PBS.org for another look, rather than get up and fiddle with the TV and remote. Of course, you can't just re-watch one scene so...much to my surprise there were Thomas and O'Brien in the corridor discussing Jimmy/James!  I checked with my fellow Downtonians from last week's DVD-based viewing - this scene was not on our disc - what is going on here?!? I want every last frame of my DA!!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This Show is always entertaining, great writing, love the plot twist. This show does not disappoint, I can't wait for the next episode.
B0086700CM|5.0|It's easy to pick up the basics of this game. My five year old grandson likes it and so do I.
B008WCP2KG|5.0|really good and quickly service I would buy again with them. I couldn't believe the quickness and the description was right like they posted
B00683JK9K|5.0|This is a great app if the Kindle Fire HD 8.9. Works great and the big HD screen really helps solve the puzzles. I don't know how good this app would be on a smaller screen because I haven't tested it but I can imagine it would be hard for the bigger puzzles. Hope this helps. Thanks!
B0068LYEHA|5.0|It was really fun and interesting. Laughed a bunch and found myself agreeing as well. She is right - in her quirky way. Great read.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It's easy for my grandkids to pick up the skills needed to play this game. Good for quiet time or rainy days.
B004HW7JMY|5.0|really good and quickly service I would buy again with them. I couldn't believe the quickness and the description was right like they posted
B00355L2TU|5.0|This dvd is down loaded onto my lap top and wash received quickly and promptly and I thank you very much.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it needs armor buckets it needs a lot of things but I love it but I like Pc more than anything but you should buy it
B003HE2B6C|2.0|This album has some really great songs, with a slight pop rock edge. The experience of listening is let down by some VERY poor production. The sound quality is terible and sounds like it was done at a home studio. A shame.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|really good and quickly service I would buy again with them. I couldn't believe the quickness and the description was right like they posted
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Loved the movie :-) .. A fast, funny and wildly inventive animated tale with enough laughs and heart to appeal to audiences of all ages.
B00007KWHG|5.0|one of my favorites from my &#34;early years&#34;---they don't have music today that compares with that of the 60's and 70's
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|The graphics were unbelievable, the puzzles were challenging and I really enjoyed the storyline.  Most of today's games are mindless because lets face it how much thinking do you have to do running around shooting zombies?  This is a game that I will be proud to tell my friends to get!  Thank you for making my mind work again, I was tired of cutting zombies in half while I ate chips and drooled on my dirty, wife beater.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|After a week of using it will no longer open even after reinstalling. useless game that you cant even use.
B00APUQT7I|4.0|As usual Ice Age is a family friendly movie that has been orchestrated, in such a way, to be enjoyed by both adults and children. As always, Sid, the Sloth, is our favorite and keeps you laughing.<br /><br />Regarding the service. I was able to play the move from amazon without a hitch. No glitches. Played very well. As good as...if not better than netflix. We watched another movie as well...same thing. So, if you are worried about whether or not you have trouble playing it....no need to worry~! Enjoy your movie!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|there was no rhym or reason to this book  i just thought it was fun and happy and something to read inbetween
B009ERK1T0|5.0|I am not a big fan of Deftones, but this record blew me away. It grows with every listen. It is definitely a 2012 top 10.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King at his best.  Draws you in and keeps you.  Takes the unbelievable and makes it seem real.  And this time he nails the ending!
0765325950|5.0|I really enjoyed the this book. The battle descriptions were epic. I could not put the book down. Read it in 4 days. The ending left me in awe. I have many discussions with myself over the meaning of the ending. What has Rand become. I am also very sad to see the Wheel of Time over. I wish there could be one more book detailing Matt, Perrin, Logain, Elayne... 20 years after the last battle. I would love to know what Rand became. Thank you Robert and Brandon.
B004G5ZY7E|2.0|this isnt the first book i tried to read from nesbo.... i quess the author and myself are not on the same playing field
B007IFZU5A|5.0|Here they are trying to go back to the Icon and Draconian Times kind of sound. However, they manage to sound heavier and tighter than those glorious days. If you are a fan, you will not regret the purchase; and if you are new to them, this will not be a bad idea at all.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Wasn't necessarily ever a JFK fan and thought the book might be a little too politically bent.  Not the case.  Definitely a captivating read.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|The movie was very cute and funny. Only 3 &#34;scary&#34; parts, when Dracula gets angry and shows his fangs(Scary for younger kids). Saw the movie twice, really liked it :)
B001HNE3NO|5.0|i really have to say i loved this book and i can say i never saw where it was going ... you just have to read to the end
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Suits is one of the best shows. It's funny, it has drama, and it's intense. But if I were asked if there was one word that would describe most of the characters , it would be \\"witty\\".
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Wonderfully funny with lots of hidden gems for those of us older folks that are familiar with the classic monster movies.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is a very good book. It kept my interest from cover to cover. I would defiantly recommend it to anyone who just likes a good story.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|great but the entire middle of the book was slow and repeated everything twice or more... but the end was different i didnt see it coming
B0011UJMK2|2.0|Ok, so I was born and raised in Soviet Russia, my grandparents were living their lives during the time described in this book. The author claimed that some russian lady reviewed this book but either she didn't do a good job or the author didn't listen. I am sorry, but nobody would name their son Leo in a Russian village in 1930. Leonid -yes, Lev - yes, Vladlen (Vladimir Lenin) - yes, Leo- NO. Leo is also never used as a short for Leonid. Lenya is. But I was ready to overlook this detail (the name of the main character) for the sake of the very interesting story. Which is it was at first: interesting and even believable. The author lost me at the escape from the train. People arrested in Stalin's Soviet Union would not help anyone escape because it meant death to them and their families. Then when the whole village of people decided to help Leo and Raisa (by the way, she would be called Raya by her husband and family, Raisa is too formal), I started laughing. It was not possible in 1953. By that time, all people with courage were killed or sent to Gulag. The survivors were either believers or adapters. Either way, nobody dared do, say, think, or even dream against the Party. Finally, I mean what a stupid motive for killing all these children... Don't you think, it would be easier to write a letter to his brother?
B0024FAR5M|5.0|The first seson of Sons is awesome with a lot of sexy women, action, comedy, and god plots and story lines.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I would recommend this game for everyone. I got this for my kids and they can not seem to stop playing.
B003PGNBO8|5.0|With so many law/crime and hospital dramas on network TV, this was just what I was looking for in a show... original, cerebral, thought provoking, human, etc. And the casting was genius. Do yourself a favor and buy these to watch during your fav shows hiatus.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Finally the science fiction story I can believe, enjoy, and share with my children. Great humor, great life lessons. I admit, I am no engineer, nor biologist, so I just believed all the data in the book. Recommend to read and discuss with children. Occasional bad language though but nothing too bad
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|Samcro kicks butt it rocks it's a real guys show it's got some good plots and story lines and the cast and crew are fantastic.
B00AOMR2S2|5.0|If you haven't seen the movie you should and then you must buy this soundtrack!! Its aca-awesome lol lol :)
B000VT6FAO|4.0|The writing was a little weaker than I expected, but all in all, the sound, musicalilty, emotion, and everything else you expect to be dynamic... was. would recommend to any DM fan.
B00AS1Q8FW|1.0|I have read all the Lee Child books. When Tom Cruise was cast as Jack Reacher, had they ever read any of the books? Jack Reacher is 6'5 weighing in at 220 to 250 and is intimidating just by his size alone. Tiny Tom never intimidated anyone. He killed off the Mission Impossible franchise. Expect the same for Jack Reacher. When Tom is in a scene with another actor, do they stand him on a box or something? For me the movie was just typical Cruise. Just a lot of Tom's one face - glaring at everyone. Huge disappointment!
B004G600A4|5.0|&#34;Tangled&#34;<br /><br />I first watched this animated Disney feature at the theater. My kids enjoyed it so much I ordered it on-line so we can watch it at our leisure. I have to admit, as an adult, I watch &#34;Tangled&#34; whenever my Kids have it  on.<br /><br />Highly recommend the movie. I guarantee you'll watch it more than once. It won't sit on the shelf collecting dust.
B00992CF6W|4.0|But not as good as the computer one. Still good cant hook up with micraft account. Need more blocks and stiff
B0028MBKVG|4.0|Even a non-athlete will find this book interesting.<br /><br />Mcdougall interweaves stories of real people as he describes the background of the sport.  The result is a book that looks into the bizarre world of ultra uber-runners and their unique foibles.  They make this book read like fiction, not fact, as Mcdougle tries to answer the question, Why do my feet hurt when I run?<br /><br />By the book's end, you will want to throw away those uber-expensive tennis shoes of yours.
B002H3EUA4|5.0|We always seem to miss Christmas Vacation when it is on TV, it's a classic Christmas movie, so we added it to our dvd library.  We didn't need the rest of the stuff in the box, but would make a great gift.
6305499365|5.0|If you have ever worked in an office, or felt you were just a number in the grand scheme of any corporation, you'll identify yourself with this film. Did you ever feel that if you ran the company it would make sense? This Independent film exposes what we all know. The company you work for must be run by morons.<br /><br />It is also a great love story without any gratuitous sex or violence. In fact, it doesn't have any. If your child is 14 years-old or older he or she can enjoy it with you. (Some occasional minor profanity) You might as well prepare them now for what they will only learn when he or she enters the work force. Just because someone is their boss does not make them any smarter than anyone else. In fact, it makes you wonder how they ever obtained that position.<br /><br />I thought it was funny movie with a good moral ending. &#34;It is not what do for a living; it is how much you enjoy doing it.&#34; Oh, by the way, he gets the girl in the end. That should go without saying.
B0026KZ3T0|5.0|I thought this was a good comedy about how men and women communicate and how little things tend to get in the way of a great relationship.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love you get to go in the mine and slide down the rope. you should get this awesome app.
B0042J6VUS|4.0|After reading very mixed reviews I thought I would add my views. To address the comments about the spring etc. I found that if you don't try and pull the spring all the way up and then try and slide the phone in from the side, but instead, use the phone itself to open the spring by putting what will be the top (right side of the iPhone) in first at an angle so the top points away from you, and then use the phone to push the spring up and then snap the bottom (left side of the iPhone) into place when the spring is up far enough you are not putting too much stress on the spring. Doing it this way held my iPhone 4S snugly in place. I should point out my iPhone is in a Mophie case so there is plenty of room for a smaller case or no case.<br />The quality of the included tripod is about on a par with other inexpensive pocket tripods and has the same issues as any other small tripod. The ballhead is not able to tighten as much as I would like and the collar doesn't swivel like on a more expensive ballhead. So the comments about the portrait position being less than ideal are all valid. But for the price you can't really complain. I am sure I am not the only person who bought this for the clamp, not the tripod. I have tried other clamps/tripod adapters and this holds the iPhone the most securely. If you are looking for something that you will use every day then I would suggest spending more money for something that is more rugged. But for the occasional use then this is a good deal.
B002ZG975Q|4.0|I read the book before getting the movie and i loved the book so much but the movie was sorta a disappointment in comparison. First off Kyle's last name is changed, the setting(in time that is) was different, he did NOT grow fur(biggest disappointment), some other little details that are major for the book were changed including the ending where Kyle turns back but i will excuse the director because they made an alternate ending that fit the book. But if your not trying to watch it to see the book come to life its still really good. I enjoyed it besides the nitpicking i did throughout the movie. My mom was watching it with me and she hadnt read the book but she enjoyed it. oh before i forget, the mirror is not in the movie
B006TF6WAM|5.0|A great yarn.  I enjoyed the way the author dealt delved into people's emotions, thoughts and beliefs. I tried to image walking through England in the rain and cold. Only a person on a mission would undertake such a walk without proper clothing and preparation- yet this yarn took the reader on such a trip.  Worth the read.  It was recommended by a friend who also enjoyed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really cool, personally I think its better then temple run.I love the hover boards and those cool little gadgets that they have for sell.
1616550414|5.0|I freaking love TLoZ and this book loaded me with nostalgia and a desire for all things Zelda. A must for any Zelda fan!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|i loved it,it was so adorable and the songs were catchy. I ended up buying it because i saw the ending of it at my dentist and i wanted to see the rest of it so i did. Totally worth it :)
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It was a very funny quirky book that kept me laughing and sighing! Two thumbs up for this great book
B000004286|5.0|It's good music, and I must know type at least ten more words or I can not submit this review.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This is a good read. It takes a little patience because the author creates some suspence. Reminds me of an old Hawthorne short story or &#34;Something Wicked This Way Comes&#34;.  I recommend this book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Terrific game, my children and I love to play this game and would recommend it to others.<br />It is a great way to pass the time.
B005HSL626|5.0|Fast & fun. Good game, had 3 of us playing on different devices. Total blast! And good coordination for young players.
B004EPZ03O|3.0|Our two granddaughters are 2 1/2 and almost 3 ~ this was for older children :~{  Guess, we'll have to hold on to it for the future :}
0812993292|5.0|This is a quick read and I am glad to have read it. At times I found the story predictable and there were some places where it was an effort to keep reading. However, at the end I found myself feeling real depressed gut reactions to events in maybe my own life or lives of friends that I found uncomfortable to remember. I think we all should take a journey at some point in our lives.
B002VX0A40|5.0|I gave this to a friend for her baby and she loved it.  It is all I hoped it would be and more.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This book was well written, and the author took great care in trying to make the reader feel as if they were actually hearing the characters speak. This is a great tale that tells of the wonders of the mind and the great outdoors.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|Awesome movie for all ages.  This one is a holiday hit to start, add to, and end the seasons with.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Got bored very fast. I think I am going to do away with Nicholas Sparks books. They are all variations of the same thing.
0316069434|3.0|I still love Harry Bosch but I didn't think this was a real page turner. I remember the L.A. riots and was expecting the story to be more about them. That being said, it was good - just not Connelly's best.
B0091QS88K|5.0|Cute and fun for all and they need to make the whole game free and make more games like this one
B008XG1X18|5.0|Fantastic and Fun way to exchange and get Great Ideas , just type anything in the search box and TA-DA !
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I git this game because i love temple run and it looked the same but then i found out that it was absolutly amazing and honestly i think that they should mak  number 2 xxx woo
B007IXWL2C|5.0|You just don't want it to end... that's how good it was for me.<br />Highly sexual and addictive.<br />Totally liked it for the plot.
B003L20IHE|5.0|This movie came sealed and in perfect condition.<br />Love the movie and it's definitely a tear jerker!<br />Thanks for the great deal on it!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Totally like it for the plot, characters and ending.<br />Recommended for readers that want more than just love. It gives another meaning to it all.
B004047XXO|2.0|I did not like the 3D version of this DVD at all.  It is not true 3D.  My guess is that if you bought the BluRay version of this movie, that it would be much better, but the 3D on the DVD is not good at all.  I think I'm going to return it.<br />As far as the movie itself, it was fine.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Rating goes for good plot, which keeps it interesting till the end, nice characters, perfect ending!<br /><br />Recommended for romantics who want something more than just love.<br />Totally liked it for the increasing plot
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|A boy and his dog. Never fails to make a good story. Lassie, Old yeller, etc. Same thing but with a twist. Tim Burton has never let us down.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This game us really cool and fun to okay it can get addicting an  leave  you wanting for more I love it
0316224588|4.0|I was so delighted to see that Rankin has once again taken up DI Rebus (Retired). I am delighted to be with him again, albeit somewhat less energetically, but then Rebus - not unlike some of us - is a bit slower of step being of a &#34;a certain age.&#34;  It is good to be let in on his thinking and reasoning ability - which has not slackened. It was also good to meet again with his past partner, now DI herself, Siobahn Clarke.  Then, of course, there is Big Ger Cafferty, less actively villainous but still a presence of evil, (remembered from times past).  At times though I did feel as if I needed an atlas of the Scottish Highlands just to keep up with the travel.  Good story, Glad to have Rebus back - while he may be less active physically, he is still mentally acute and continues to be viewed with a questioning eye by some of his previous cohorts. Some things will never change, eh?
B0041KKYGU|4.0|Good watch for an evening.  DVD was in good condition and was received in a prompt manner.  We enjoyed viewing it.  Would recommend to an adult fun group.
B006YC74E8|5.0|I had browsed through almost all the other free image editing software on the amazon store when I came to this. It's everything I need in a photo editor
B001CTDH4Y|5.0|The DVD was a good read and a very good story line.  The DVD was in very good condition.  My grandson and I truly enjoyed watching it.  Would recommend for overnight slumber party or just some family fun.
B002OOG6YY|5.0|I have to say,  I've owned a few manson dvd's and this is the only one that I can keep going back to view, and not just because it's the same show that I went to, but because like the others said, it's just one recording as opposed to a concert with clips from multiple venues.  Plus, the 1080p video quality and DTS Surround Sound is AMAZING!
B004SBULWE|5.0|Advanced Task Killer has given me more battery power and I love it!  It's very easy to use and I don't have to close apps one at a time.  Just push the icon, press &#34;kill apps&#34; and bingo!  They're all closed.
B007P06DJK|5.0|These (CD and vid) are a wonderful celebration of an iconic man and his music, and of the times out of which they came... The music is as great and uplifting as always, bringing joy and pleasure to my body, mind, and soul, and light and bounce into every moment I play this music or watch this excellent documentary on that time and the genius of Paul Simon -- it's gorgeous!
B002FQOI0A|5.0|I love it its a really good book it's I would recommend it to people who like a heart working story
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I was really curious as I already read about the story.  I really appreciate the effort made by the author to bring us closer to the eternal life, or the possibility of it. But it went just too difficult, I felt lost among God, Om (or Ohm? :-)) heavenly beings, Core, purposes,&#34; you can't do anything wrong&#34; messages. Might be my fault of course but  I still felt being left alone in the journey. Right now I have no idea if the author met a personal God or a strange energy core and don't understand the explanation about how God Almighty and Saviour Lord Jesus belongs to this experience, even if a prayer group was involved. On the whole I am happy that he recovered miracously from a very serious, fatal illness. This fact alone can bring hope to those who maybe face hopeless curcumstances in their life.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another great one by Vince Flynn.  I would have liked a little more development of the aftermath of the ending (I don't want to ruin it), but I am guessing that will be touched upon in the next Mitch Rapp book.
1400067820|5.0|This book talks infact about the complexity, being the author an economist who knows also very good literature and phylosophy.<br />There is a variation between different matters, whom together constitute a particular back-ground; this model is non-linear, in the sense that the absence of regularity is its most important characteristic.<br />This problem is also related to the lecture of brains, choised in poetry, romances and phylosophy chapters.<br />Taleb uses exact terms in economics, as randomness and volatility, which are typical of the econometrics, but they are applied also to the other aspect of the reality.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app it is fun and it is free. it is interactive, interesting and competitive. over all it is a very good app. freezes a little bit but I kind of expected that from a highly complicated game....
0307352153|3.0|The author is able to interest the reader: but the role of this book is limitated to the psychology of the modern life.<br />It is very technical about the differences between a behavior into the personality or against the external back-ground. But I think that the human mind has particular aspects correlated to this definition, so that the capacity to understand it is more difficult than the author tells.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I've had this for about a month, and so fat so good. Seems accurate and I lite the interface. Sometimes the temp in the alert bar lags a bit but launching it synches it right up.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|It was a nice and quick book. You can read it at once, it gives many good things to do. I would have liked if it had more exampkes for you to try them out.
B00B7G3Y4U|3.0|I saw the first 3 and they just got less and less scary as time went on. This one here uses \\"cheap scares\\" to scare you and its tiring. I found this movie kind of funny though. Not that its a funny movie because its not but looking at the first 3 its plainly obvious that they are running out of material. Nevertheless, I still like the series and if they come out with part 5 (which i'm sure they will), I will wait, like I did with the other 3, for it to come on Amazon instant video.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|I purchased this DVD for several family members. We had seen a local Musical Theater group perform this and I wanted a reminder we could all share. Great deal on this DVD also.
B008M87GJK|5.0|This is a great app for reading various news stories and posting to Facebook etc... only thing I don't like is that I can't find specific sections such as Rugby union - wanted to look up results & info from the 6 Nations, or from my local rugby team, but they don't appear on the sports news feed, & there's no way to choose it as an option.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I purchased this DVD for my granddaughter to complete her set (so far) of Twilight movies. She was very happy to receive it and has already viewed it. Good price too
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Finally started watching this series & absolutely love it!! Season 1 we start figuring everyone out, season 2 had some great character development, & season 3 more twists & turns!!!!! Pretty sure I'm not the only person yelling &#34;BEHIND YOU!!!&#34; At the screen!!!
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|I liked that this was such a quick read.  I like the four agreements but the beginning of the book was a little hard to follow.
B0088P2A7A|5.0|I love looking for things on Wikipedia, so the app is very helpful... good app, nothing much else to say...
B005LAIHCM|4.0|There are too many cheap thrill horror films with no substance or fall apart towards the end.<br /><br />A remake or not, this is a good one, with a good story by Jonathan Mostow of U-571 and Breakdown fame,<br />a well-written script by David Loucka and ably directed by Mark Tonderal.<br /><br />Jennifer Lawrence gave another strong performance as a teenager from a broken family with a newcomer<br />Max Thieriot who gave an impressive performance.<br /><br />A thoroughly enjoyable thrill ride to the end.  Good musical soundtrack too.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert:  Stay away from watching the trailer.  It gives away the whole story!
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|You gotta love this game. it has those little green men known to be protecting their gold which lays hidden at the end of the rainbow. Need I say more?
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great app, buy it and don't listen to the people who reviewed this app badly, fun and addicting great for anyone!
1609611543|2.0|I found this book when a friend referred me to it. To be fair, I haven't finished reading all of it. I am about 1/2 way through it, but I have spent the last 2 hours reading various reviews here on Amazon.<br /><br />If you love and are convinced that a diet high in animal protein and fat is good for you, you will love this book. If you are not, as I am not, you will want to carefully sift through this book, and figure out what will and will not work for you, as I have done...<br /><br />I am a 37 year old woman, who desires to lose about 55 pounds, and who has had problems with my blood sugar levels being too high...suggesting pre-diabities...<br /><br />For the past 2 weeks I have been following the McDougall plan, which, for those who don't know, is a plant based, low fat, vegan diet, wherein one structures meals around starches, and include lots of fresh veggies, & minimal fruits while staying away from ALL fats, meat, dairy and processed foods.<br /><br />I have been eating a ton of brown rice each day, and I love it! For breakfast, I eat it as a cereal with a 1/2 of a banana, and 1/4 cup of low fat Almond milk and Stevia, a plant derived sweetener. For lunch, I have brown rice with grilled veggies, usually zucchini and onions, and a raw cabbage salad. For dinner, usually a Squash soup and salad...While potatoes are allowed and recommended, I am not a huge fan of them, and am resisting nightshades due to inflammation. In general, I prefer squash, corn, brown rice and other grains over potatoes, but do occasionally enjoy a yam or sweet potato. During this diet, I have been carefully monitoring my blood sugar levels and after 1 week my insulin levels are SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER after eating a big, starchy meal with lots of carbs, fresh veggies, etc, than it had previously been while fasting! This is huge for me. My whole point to sharing this is that carbs are NOT bad! I do not agree with this book to eliminate them! Wheat, yes, because it has been so genetically modified you can't even consider it a true food item anymore and our bodies probably do not recognize it as such, as is with most of the frankenstien, man made foods today.<br /><br />I will not follow Wheat Belly to a T because I am not a fan of low carb diets. I truly believe that animal products, and diet high in fat and protein are unhealthy and killing us! Years ago, I went on the on the Atkins diet. I had insane cravings, headaches, felt irritable, lethargic and NEVER EVER lost ANY weight in 6 months! I lost ZERO pounds!!!! On the McDougall plan I have lost 3 pounds in 2 weeks. Not shocking, but I am eating well, my insulin levels are way down, and my sugar cravings are gone, gone, gone!  This is HUGE for me! If that were the ONLY  benefit I experienced I would be in heaven, but there has been more.<br /><br />As for Wheat Belly, I am combining the wisdom here, but not taking all of it. As of 3 days ago I have eliminated wheat from my diet. Of course, it is too early to note any benefits yet. But, I am certain I will not follow the advice in this book and eliminate carbs all together. They will continue to be a large part of my diet, and I have the lower blood glucose readings, weight loss, lack of cravings and energy to suggest that it is working for me.<br /><br />I am not trying to convince anyone to go Vegan, but I do think that The China Study by T Colin Campbell  should be recommended reading for everyone!!!!! It has over 1k reviews and 5 stars!!!!<br /><br />So far,I have found a lot I can take with me from Wheat Belly and do believe that my health will be improved as a result, but avoiding all carbs is NOT the solution for me.ified you can't even consider it a true food item anymore and our bodies probably do not recognize it as such, as is with most of the frankenstien, man made foods today.<br /><br />I will not follow Wheat Belly to a T because I am not a fan of low carb diets.

B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Great free<br />game. Many different &amp; challenging tile layouts. Only downside would<br /> be the ads that pop up after every game but worth downloading.
B007MD43CO|4.0|they aren't professional, but they are well worth the money.<br /><br />they make all of the studio recorded tracks off of an album much more clear. You can tell when they breathe soft and even hear the subtle reverb notes after a vocal.<br />I use them in my home studio for ROUGH mixes to send out to customers, which are never as good as when I play them through my monitors, but when someone pays for my<br />time I give them a rough mix with the headphones before they leave, then I do a 2nd pass with my rokit 8s.<br /><br />I don't suggest using them for tracking unless you plan on listening very soft. LOTS-O-BLEED! :O<br /><br />Other than the headphone bleed, these were a great surprise!<br />I recommend them to any new home studio musician!
