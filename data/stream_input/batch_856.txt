B00005JPD0|1.0|Now, I have never given one star to a movie before. But this movie is _that_ bad. It's so absurd that it insults the viewer's intelligence. Denzel is decent, but then the movie started getting so ridiculous at one point that I gave up.. right when Denzel went back in time by four days and started chasing the bomber... go figure! Oh, it also seemed like he was falling in love with the girl who is already dead (or is she?) by watching videos of her taking shower and changing clothes. I guess by the end of the movie, she will get back to life again and fall in love with Denzel.    This movie is plain stupid. I'm surprised it has a 4 stars rating on amazon. If you want to watch a good time-travel, sci-fi movie, I recommend [[ASIN:B0007PALZ2 12 Monkeys (Special Edition)]]
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|Ok, so I'll start off saying I absolutely love the album. Its a cohesive, full-bodied work, that's been better produced than most things out there. The songs are melodic, with complete and intriguing harmonies, and the album has a powerful rhythmic aspect that is not often seen in this type of music. Oh, and did I mention that this is my OPINION?    Reviews are completely useless...including this one, but I'll go on anyways. How can anyone \\"review\\" something that is so subjective? A review may tell an opinion, but also highlights the actual aspects of the songs. Loud, soft? Strings, percussion? Dissonant, melodic? Fast, slow? Etc..etc...I had to laugh at how all the people giving this album said how much they didn't like it because of blah blah blah, and then proceeded to give the reasons why Coldplay and this album suck. I like this one by James C. Nielsen... \\"This album really is not sincere Coldplay. This is a departure from what they truly are as musicians.\\" UM.....are YOU Coldplay? That'd be like me walking up to some random guy in the grocery store buying Coke (while I'm a Pepsi fan) and saying \\"dude, thats SO not you. Go back to your roots and be yourself.\\" WTF?? Better yet James, why don't YOU go write an album? Then everyone can tell you why and how you didn't write what you should have?    And here's one by David Ljunggren. \\"Even by Coldplay's standards, this is a bad album.\\" Did Coldplay say themselves this was a bad album? I know what you mean, or at least are trying to mean, but saying that \\"this is a bad album\\" is trying to pass fact much like insisting that 2+2=5. Radiohead reference anyone? Instead, David, say something like \\"I THINK this is a bad album.\\" Then, that at least lets everyone know that we're dealing with an OPINION, rather than someone trying to pass off opinion as FACT.    And the examples could go on. Oh, and I know that you can find people who say that \\"this is a good album,\\" or that \\"this is sincere Coldplay.\\" The difference is, those praising it are really saying, \\"hey, I liked it, and you should give it a shot. If you don't like it, ok.\\" Those hatin' on it are saying, \\"Abandon all hope, ye who enters here. Don't even try it. And if you like it, you're a moron. This album is crap. Period.\\"        Lastly, I acknowledge that this is my personal opinion, subject to criticism and holds true only to myself. But next time you write a review, actually REVIEW the album rather than barfing all over the English language and regurgitating the negative. To heed my own advice, this is more a review of the reviews, rather than a review of the album!!
0375414053|5.0|I've experimented in all the mother scenarios: SAHM, Work at home, PT worker, FT working mom -- and this book spoke to each one. The author's bottom line is motherhood is tough work no matter what. Kate Reddy doesn't have great answers to the daily dilemmas we face, she's flawed, she does some cliched things, and she doesn't have a magical way to solve the work/life balance on the last page. But it's worth going along with her on the journey, regardless because she's funny and touching and honest.
B001DJ7PR8|4.0|Woody Allen Films tend to always be very refreshing. Filled with zany experiences and the quirks that come up along the way, shaping the path of the character's life.     I recommend this movie, especially if you are a fan of foreign film as this falls more in category of the story-telling style of such.     If you're looking 4 the strict Hollywood movie formula, this is not it.  This is a nicely-done artistic portrait of the interaction of 4 people, at different stages of their emotional lives in their quest for love and how it all plays out over the backdrop of Barcelona.   *SPOILER ALERT*  A few commentors here complain about things I believe were supposed to be comedy and they haven't realized it:     Javier Bardem telling Penelope Cruz to speak in English was a comedic point, especially when he continued to speak Spanish despite telling her not to do so. It was a sign of the couple's confusion, imperfection and beautiful messyness of their relationship - like their paintings. The dynamic of their interaction was beautiful and highly engaging.    The narration in Vicky Christina, was a joke also, I believe. Kudos to Woody Allen for being so bold and confident in making this choice.      The Narration was hideously hysterically funny and I think more of an inside joke to the film-maker's industry. It was also a testament to how life should be more lighthearted when it comes to love, to search for what you want. And how if you were looking at this from an outsider point of view, all of the confusion, anger, sexuality, worrying, chance-taking, the mistakes, were just a story - just life and in the end, not as serious as it all seems when living it first-hand.      Like \\"family issues\\" were Yasujiro Ozu's theme in his films. Love and the search for happiness are Woody Allen's focus.     I ENJOYED this film tremendously. It was fun, adventerous, a breath of fresh air. Penelope Cruz just cranked out a kick-butt performance as the explosive but brilliant, hurricane ofa woman, Marie-Elena constantly sweeping Javier up into what was to him, her magnificence.     If you let a film tell it's own story in it's own voice, youll be better equipped to see the brilliance of the Director. Don't try to stuff everything into a Hollywood format - and saying it sucks.     This is a great film, a piece of art in it's own unique right making actually is like sitting down to a nice, smart but whimisical and turbulent symphony. SEE IT.

B001GKJ2E8|4.0|Wanted is a fun an entertaining movie. It is full of action, excellent fight scenes and overall great pace. The movie is about an average guy, or so he thinks, who is recruited into a legendary secret fraternity of assassins. The performances by all the actors were superb and the story played itself well. I just wish that the story would have delved a bit more into the background of the fraternity. I also wished that Wesley's training (James McAvoy) would have taken a bit longer (and thus more believable considering the resolution of this film). But, the film itself lacks all logic and credibility. Really, if you think too much about it, nothing will make sense. This is a film to just sit back and enjoy, forget the plot holes and enjoy the amazing action.
B000T05R8Q|5.0|This limited edition of Pink Floyd's great debut album contains more or less all a fan of their Syd Barrett period could hope for. The album is featured in both mono and stereo on seperate CD's. Moreover there is a bonus CD containing their early singles \\"Arnold Layne\\", \\"See Emily Play\\" and \\"Apples and Oranges\\" along with their B-sides.  Also an alternate version of \\"Matilda Mother\\", with different lyrics, and two shorter mixes of the long instrumental \\"Intersteller Overdrive\\".<br /><br />The album itself has long ago earned its place as a classic of pcychedelia and early progressive British rock. Not least due to the highly original songwriting of guitarist Syd Barrett - sadly poor health/drug abuse only allowed him to contribute to the band's first two albums and 3 singles. On  their second album \\"A saucerful of Secrets\\" his contributions were scarce and his place as lead guitarist had been overtaken by Dave Gilmour.<br /><br />Experimenting tracks like \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\" and \\"Pow R. Toc H.\\" obviously show a band exploring new grounds and sounds, but for me it's the great melodic songs that make the album timeless. \\"Matilda Mother\\" with its fairy-tale lyrics and great melody is a favourite.<br /><br />\\"The Gnome\\", \\"Flaming\\" and \\"The Scarecrow\\" are songs in the same vein, and almost as strong.<br /><br />The spacey \\"Astronomy Domine\\" is the perfect opener of the album, and it is followed by \\"Lucifer Sam\\", which probably would have been a better choice for the band's third single, instead the unconventional but highly uncommercial \\"Apples and Oranges\\".<br /><br />\\"Chapter 24\\" has both atmosphere and weird lyrics - and of course a nice melody.<br /><br />The charming closing track \\"Bike\\" shows the bands at their most free and easy mood.<br /><br />The bonus tracks are obviously great too; not least the two classic hit-singles \\"Arnold Layne\\" and \\"See Emily Play\\". The B-side \\"Candy and the Currant Bun\\", would have fitted nicely onto the album, and a typical Barrett songs. \\"Paintbox\\" is a quiet half-acoustic song written by Richard Wright.<br /><br />The alternate versions of \\"Instellar Overdrive\\" are not very different from the album version, apart from being considerably shorter, which is okay for me - The take 6 version includes more guitar parts than the album version.<br /><br />The highlight among the rarities is the alternate version of \\"Matilda Mother\\" - a completely different recording with different lyrics - but as good as the album version.<br /><br />Some background information about the band and the creation is sadly missing, but the music itself as it is great at any rate.ritten by Richard Wright.

B001HN6972|5.0|\\"The Reader\\" has received largely favorable but mixed reviews. The movie explores themes of guilt, responsibility, and love. It is based upon a novel of the same name by Bernard Schlink, a German law professor.  The larger part of the story tells of an affair between a 15 year old adolescent, Michael Berg, and a woman in her mid-30s, Hanna Schmitz, who works collecting fares on a trolley. Besides their physical relationship, Hanna wants Michael to read to her. He reads novels, poetry, and classics, the stuff of literature. The movie moves both backwards to tell of Hanna's unsavory past as a guard for the SS during the Holocaust and forwards, to recount Hanna's and Michael's lives subsequent to their relationship in the late 1950s.  Michael becomes a lawyer. He marries, has a daughter, and divorces.  He is a tense individual with difficulty forming an intimate relationship with a woman. Hanna is sentenced to life imprisonment for her role during the Holocaust. The movie describes Hanna's and Michael's relationship during Michael's adulthood and how it effects each of them.<br /><br />Some viewers find this movie troubling in that it evokes sympathy for a woman deeply involved in the crimes of the Holocaust. I found that the movie developed Schmitz' character and thought the criticism misplaced. The movie also involves sexual abuse of a minor with many explicit scenes. Again, I did not see the movie as endorsing these activities. The flashbacks have been criticized for being difficult to follow, but I did not find this to be the case.  I thought the manner in which the flashbacks were presented was integral to the story.<br /><br />I found the movie compelling in its portrayal of the long relationship between its two major characters and in their frustrated searches for each other. The film develops the theme of guilt and responsibility as it applies to those who lived through the days of the Holocaust.  It universalizes these themes to people everywhere,and pointedly individualizes them to show their role in the adult life of Michael Berg.  Early in the movie one of Michael's teachers is lecturing on the role of secrecy as a literary device.  The nature of individual secrets is probed throughout the movie. The nature of being a \\"reader\\" and of  \\"reading\\" -- a spectator perhaps --is also a subject of this movie, as applied to both its protagonists.  Kate Winslet offers a stellar performance of the hard and yet vulnerable Hanna Schmitz. I was taken with the movie while it was on the screen, and it continues to resonate in my thought.<br /><br />Robin Friedmanthem to show their role in the adult life of Michael Berg.

0765316897|3.0|First off, I'm rating the entire series rather than just the final book, and trying not to include spoilers, but just in case SPOILER ALERT. My feelings are mixed. The books struck me as written for the twelve to sixteen year old crowd . . . very cautious love affair, almost platonic and over the top magical abilities that smack of the Matrix, only using metals. Others have pointed out how book three left them asking where the wonder was. In my opinion, it was lost because too much improbable power and deux in the machina was displayed in the other two books. I ended up skimming the fight scenes because they blended into one another so much it felt like all were the same. Now I know this would appeal to young adults, which is why I believe they are Sanderson's target audience.    The religious aspect also bothered me. I mean how more blatant could Sanderson be, with the devil controlling minds and whispering over one's shoulder to get them to commit evil but himself having no real power. And Sazed was an absolute bore. I skipped every one of his chapters. (as well as a few others that were repetitive writing, just endless filler to me)    The bad: Too much preaching about the wonders of faith for my tastes. Too much perfect god-like power, characters I didn't care at all about (except OreSur), poor pacing and repetition, deux in the machina and an unsatisfying ending.     The good: I did find certain aspects of the world building interesting and I think he tied everything together in a unique way which few authors do. He has potential.    But when religious preaching overshadows fantasy, it belongs in a Christian (or Mormon) bookstore, not on mainstream fantasy shelves. If I hear that he's stopped preaching, I'll likely pick up other books of his. If not, there are other authors I'd much prefer to read.

B000FC1KBG|2.0|I'm sorry. I heard all the reviews about this book and thought I'd give it a try. One question I have is, \\"Why do british women think American women are helpless twits?\\". Not to be harsh, as I'm not that type, i am very disappointed with this book. Seriously, do you really expect me to ask my 4 month old for her permission in order to pick her up? To me, her reaching her arms up to me is permission enough. I actually ran a dialogue like the author suggested when I was changing my daughter's diaper in a british accent \\"Oh is okay with you that I take your pants off? Are you sure? Is it alright that I undo your \\"nappy\\" now? Shall I do the right flap first, or the left? Oh please, you just let me know if I'm disrespecting you in anyway?\\" Needless to say, my daughter giggled throught the diaper change, and I realized I wasted my money.
B000J10EQU|5.0|Release date: June 28, 2006<br />Director: Bryan Singer<br />Runtime: 2 hours, 34 minutes<br />Locations: New South Wales, Australia, and New York City<br />Cast: Brandon Routh (Superman), Kate Bosworth (Lois), Kevin Spacey (Luthor), James Marsden (Richard White), Parker Posey (Kitty), Frank Langella (Perry White), Eve Marie Saint (Clark's mom) and Marlon Brando (Jor-el).<br /><br />STORY: Superman returns to Earth after five years trying to find out what happened to his homeworld. As Clark Kent he gets his job back at the Daily Planet newspaper, but finds out Lois Lane has moved on without him -- having a live-in fiance (Marsden) and a five-year-old child, not to mention winning a Pulitzer for her article \\"Why the World Doesn't Need Superman.\\" Meanwhile Lex Luthor and his henchmen discover Superman's Fortress of Solitude and steal some of the alien crystals. Luthor's mad scheme is to create a new continent, killing billions of people in the process.<br /><br />Before seeing this film I scanned many of the Amazon reviews to see if it was worthwhile and the first thing I noticed was that most of the people wrote very long, detailed reviews. I thought, \\"Wow, these Superman fans really take ol' Supes seriously.\\" I also noticed that people either seemed to love the film or hate it.<br /><br />Count me as one who loved it. I'm not the biggest Superman fan but I used to collect many of the comics and I loved the first two movies. I only had a half hour to kill last Saturday night but the movie was so good I watched well over an hour without really realizing it and finished it the next night. In other words, the film successfully pulled me into the story and I lost track of time. This is a good sign (especially when the film has so many dramatic parts).<br /><br />The story is an obvious retelling of the Christ story:<br /><br />--  Jor-el gives his son to protect (save) humankind.<br />-- Superman repeatedly states that he's everywhere and will always be around (i.e. omnipresent).<br />-- Luthor and his henchmen's beating of Supes is reminiscent of Christ's beating before his crucifixion.<br />-- Superman sacrifices himself to save humanity from Luthor's new continent.<br />-- When superman \\"dies\\" above the atmosphere of Earth he is shown in a cross posture.<br /><br />In adition to this, Lois Lane is an obvious type of atheism. Although she once believed in and even loved Superman, she's now convinced the world doesn't really need him. She's obviously unhappy and bitter; she lacks the pizzazz she had when she once believed.<br /><br />Of course, all this heavy symbolism is useless if the story itself fails to capture the viewer's attention. This is especially vital when the picture is two and a half hours long. But it succeeds!<br /><br />The film definitely has an epic vibe to it, even more so than the first in the series. It seems more serious, i.e. less campy, especially where Luthor and his team are concerned. The film also possesses an imperceptible reverent quality. Even though the whole Superman mythos is totally absurd, the film somehow enables the viewer to accept it as real. On top of all this there are numerous humorous parts, which are truly laugh-out-loud funny (watch out for the hilarious \\"It's a bird,\\" \\"It's a plane\\" piece).<br /><br />Other things worth commenting on:<br /><br />-- Some complain that Kate Bosworth lacks charisma as Lois Lane, but this all fits into the bitter \\"I no longer believe\\" subplot. Bosworth is fine in the role.<br />-- Some complain about Superman's 5-year visit to Krypton. What's the problem? Part of my youth was spent in Minneapolis and I've gone back there numerous times to quell my curiosity. Why wouldn't Superman feel the same way? Why was he gone so long and why did he need a crystalized craft? Because he was potentially exposing himself to large amounts of Kryptonite (radioactive pieces of his homeworld) which would severely weaken him, not to mention he gets his powers from the Earth's sun.<br />-- Some complain about Lois' fiance and her son, who may or may not be the offspring of Supes. Wouldn't it be natural for Lois to move on after about two years waiting? Her \\"shacking up\\" before marriage can be attributed to her new \\"I no longer believe\\" mentality.<br />-- Love is a strong theme here as is fitting for any retelling of the Christ story. Superman loves Lois and vice versa, even though Lois is initially in denial. Love gives life and saves from death.<br />-- I liked the fact that Lois' fiance (Marsden) isn't made out to be a villain. Interestingly, Lois picked a man who, as a pilot, could fly her around like Supes, albeit less spectacularly. I also like the fact that the film shows Lois being faithful to Marsden even though she discovers she still loves Superman. The human heart is capable of loving more than one person, but can only be faithful or committed to one, if you know what I mean.<br />-- Frank Langella is his usual charismatic self as Perry White.<br />-- Kevin Spacey is excellent as Luthor, much better than Hackman; this is especially evident as the story progresses. His larger-than-life lunatic scheme is truly fitting for Supe's main foe.<br />-- There are numerous dramatic parts where the film takes its time to tell the story; there's obviously no rush to get to the next cgi action scene. Those with ADD beware. Needless to say, this is a film for adults even though kids will enjoy many aspects.<br />-- \\"Superman Returns\\" was one of the most expensive films ever made at $209 million but made most of it back in North America ($200 million) while almost doubling it worldwide ($391 million). What's strange is studio heads were disappointed with these numbers (!), claiming it should have made $500 million.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: I was truly surprised to discover how good \\"Superman Returns\\" is.

0393312836|5.0|When I started this book, I saw how it tried to use its own vocabulary and thought, \\"Oh gosh, it's one of these,\\" but it actually turned out to be quite entertaining.  Dialect is rare and difficult to do well, and this is the best job I've seen of it since the Uncle Remus tales.<br /><br />As far as the philosophical ramifications of the novel, at first I'd say, heck yeah, brainwash those criminals into being pascifists.  But then again, what if brainwashing criminals isn't enough for the government and every civilian becomes brainwashed to the point of being incapable of self defense?<br /><br />It's always tough to find a balance for this kind of thing.  But you know, a society can only take so much pointless gang violence before resulting to drastic measures.  You want to avoid a potential 1984 type future?  You can start by not being a gang member.<br /><br />But actually, I like to ignore the violence and philosophy of the book and concentrate only on the futuristic slang.  It's fun.

Is it really true record reviewers have to give Bruce records good reviews in all the music mag's or they get fired?<br /><br />Must be the case cause only Spin gave it a so so review. My review is that is sucks big time. Have a good day, high school dropout, political genius, celebrity hanging out with, working class hero, what a joke that they are still pushing this guy as a everyman working class hero B.S. Since when are mega millionaires part of the everyday slugs who have to deal with life's up's and down's. It's over Bruce. Or take steriods like A-Rod, maybe you will hit some home runs once in awhile.

1883217040|4.0|The Jazz Theory Book has a TON of information. It gets pretty deep into the theory of jazz hence the title. It also has a lot of examples from a lot of popular standards. Sometimes the amount of examples it has can be overwhelming, especially if your a cut to the chase kind of person. Even so anyone could benefit from this book no matter what playing experience they come from. I would recommend it.
B000YABYLA|4.0|Writer Diablo Cody has managed to take a very serious topic, teen pregnancy, and successfully blend it with humor, innocence and a bit of fear to make a wonderful film:  \\"Juno.\\"<br /><br />Some believe that this film champions the ideals of the pro-choice crowd.  Others see it as a movie that highlights the positive aspects of choosing life instead of abortion.  What I see is a film about a young girl who is attempting to rationalize the severity of her situation with a mind that is still in its formative years.<br /><br />Ellen Page stars as Juno McGuff, a teen who has just found out that she is pregnant for her good friend, Bleeker (Michael Cera).  On a whim (at least as Juno sees it), the pair have sex and now they have to deal with its consequences.  Instead of that happening, though, Juno pretty much keeps Bleeker in the dark about the entire situation.  He approaches the situation with confusion and innocence.  She tries to work through it with sarcasm and wit.<br /><br />Eventually, Juno finds an adoptive family for her child through the Penny Saver paper.  Enter Mark and Vanessa Loring (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner), a couple looking for their first child after many failed attempts.  Vanessa is hungry to be a mother while Mark is a little hesitant about becoming a dad.<br /><br />Once the legalities of the adoption are set, the rest of the film follows Juno through the ups and downs of being a pregnant teen and how her relationships with others are affected.  She deals with being stared at by classmates and sneered at by school staff.  Her relationship with Bleeker takes a few detours.  She bonds with Mark through music and with Vanessa through motherhood.  She also strengthens the bond with her father and step mother.  A twist is thrown late in the film to add a little drama to the story, but it fits perfectly.<br /><br />What you have in the end is a film that deals with teen pregnancy with well-placed humor and just the right amount of tenderness.  The cast, for the most part, is brilliant.  J.K. Simmons as Juno's father does a brilliant job.  He perfectly evokes a father's disappointment, confusion, fear and eventual pride and joy for his daughter.  Allison Janney plays Juno's step mother.  She shows how much a person tries to make a connection with their step child by protecting Juno.  Page can be a bit over-the-top at times, but she does a solid enough job to never make me lose interest in her character.  Cera does an excellent job of showing the uncertainty in Bleeker.  His character develops wonderfully as the story goes along.  Bateman turns in an impressive performance as Mark, a man approaching middle-age and still hanging on to the past.  While Garner does a fine job as Vanessa, I felt at times that she was pushing the emotional envelope a bit too much.  Her character seems to have this picture perfect (and somewhat Utopian)idea of what it's like to be a mother, but she also shows emotions that I find would be more likely to be found in a woman who is actually pregnant.  Still, this is the only shortfall in the cast and is forgivable thanks to the overall strength of the rest of the cast and the film as a whole.<br /><br />I must point out that the music is pretty good, but a few of the songs rake the nerves.  If you like your music with a bit of a folk tinge to it or happen to be a regular listener of NPR, you'll probably love the soundtrack.  If your tastes require a bit more punch, you might be turned off by the film's music.<br /><br />There is a bit of strong language in the film, but nothing that your average child over the age of ten doesn't hear in the store every day.  The sexuality in the movie is dealt with briefly and with humorous teen confusion, and there is no nudity.  On a positive note, Juno's family has a strong bond, which is especially important in dealing with a teen pregnancy.  Her father and step mother give her strong support throughout the film.<br /><br />If you're looking fora light comedy/drama that deals with a very heavy subject, I highly recommend \\"Juno.\\"  I initially thought that this film would be a bust considering the heavy hype it received during its theatrical release, but it has turned me into a believer.  \\"Juno\\" is an excellent film., I highly recommend \\"Juno.\\"  I initially thought that this film would be a bust considering the heavy hype it received during its theatrical release, but it has turned me into a believer.  \\"Juno\\" is an excellent film.
0571240151|1.0|Thought this was a follow up to the orginal War Horse. No indication that this was a play. Awfull, just awfull. A real way to waist your money. I threw it away. No indication when it was purchased that it was a play.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I can't say enough about how much I love this soundtrack.  Every time I listen to it,I can pinpoint the exact scene that the song is played in.  For instance,'Supermassive Black Hole' is played during the Baseball scene in the field.  Everytime I hear it,all I can think of is the Cullens playing out in a Thunderstorm. I also love that Paramore has 2 songs on the soundtrack.  They're my favorite band and I can't imagine anything better than my fav. band with one of the best movies I've ever seen.  The biggest surprise was probably 'Never Think' by Robert Pattinson.  I thought the placement of the song in the movie was a bit of a jip but that's whatever.  It's an incredible song and his voice was so haunting.  This is one of the best soundtracks I've heard.  If you don't have it,you should go buy it..ASAP!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Settlers of Catan is a great game where you utilize resources to build roads, settlements and cities and try to settle the new frontier.

B001ECE6C6|3.0|a PM completist, I was naturally quite excited to plop this into the tray and take a voyage with Pat and Anna Maria Jopek.<br /><br />AMJ has a beautiful, ever-so-slightly husky/smoky voice which floats over Pat's guitars like ... well, like a Pole-vaulter (sorry, couldn't help it)...<br /><br />No, seriously, she's very talented -- and the Polish musicians are all competent -- but, quite frankly, never as exciting as Mays, Rodby, et al, in general.<br /><br />For example, do we really need yet ANOTHER version of Letter From Home (Track 11 -- 2:46), for piano only. It's lovely, but Mr. Mozdzer accomplishes nothing that Mays hadn't already set down for posterity, years ago. Oh well, I can easily let that pass.<br /><br />The CD features a nice mix of old PM tunes (the reworking of \\"Follow Me\\" from [[ASIN:B000002NIE Imaginary Day]], for example, is fascinating!), new original tunes, including a stunner by AMJ, the title track...<br /><br />But -- now for the major complaint; and frankly, I'm surprised to see that I'm the only one who complains about this (so far):<br /><br />WHY aren't the lyrics printed in Polish *and* English? How annoying to listen to this beautiful, interesting music and have only the translation to read? It's ridiculous -- I want to see the words in Polish, with the English in a parallel column, comme d'habitude with foreign languages.<br /><br />At the very least, PM could have printed it thusly on his website -- but alas, I couldn't find it if it is there...<br /><br />I think there only a few PM recordings which I would rate lower than this: for example, [[ASIN:B000008BQO Zero Tolerance for Silence]] would qualify...<br /><br />Not bad, but not particularly a stunner, either...

0060012234|5.0|First gay book i ever opened! It really helped me understand myself and made me feel like i wasn't alone in this world. It was good and very simple read. Being gay is hard and becoming comtrable with your self is very important to being truely happy. If your just coming out... this is a good book for you. YOu see through the eyes of this high school guy and makes you really feel what hes feeling. I highly recommend this one. (second part is better in my option)
0061438294|5.0|If I had just one complaint about this book, I think that it would be that,in reading it, I learned a bit too much about myself.

B0000CEB4V|4.0|In 2002 a concert was arranged at the Royal Albert Hall as a tribute to George Harrison. These tribute concerts usually don't excite me, but our library bought it, so I had to try it.     If you like Harrison's music at all, I would recommend this DVD.  The first 40 minutes are taken up with an introduction of the concert by Eric Clapton, introduction of Ravi Shankar, and Ravi's composition for the occasion, a three part affair titled \\"Arpan\\" -- the first part was a raga performed by Ravi's daughter Anushka (also Norah Jones' half-sister) on sitar. Second was one of George's songs performed by Jeff Lynne, and third, a symphonic piece that went on a bit too long, but was still fun to watch -- many different Indian instruments and players. I could not have listened to it for that long, as it did not have a strong melody, but when you can watch all the performers doing their thing, it is not tedious.    Next came a bawdy song by Monty Python followed by Michael Palin singing the Lumberjack Song. (George Harrison had business associations with Python, and was of course a fan.)    The remaining 90-minute section featured a large rock band fronted by different spotlight singers performing songs mostly by George Harrison. The band was very hot. One might even suggest that the performances were better than the original backing bands on Harrison's albums.     Billy Preston sang a song or two. There were at least two singers I did not know, including a powerful vocalist who put a lot of life into one of Harrison's last songs, Horse To The Water. Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers performed Taxman with exceptional verve. I was amazed. Ringo Starr sang Photograph and a Carl Perkins song. I thought his performance was a little too loose and offhand, but all in good fun. McCartney came to the stage next, and he almost looked like he did not want to be there. I don't know the why. Face it, he could not decline to attend this, but maybe had good reasons for not wanting to be there --perhaps he was just very sad. Still, he sang All Things Must Pass with feeling, just what was needed. Paul sang two other songs.    Clapton naturally performed While My Guitar Gently Weeps. In my opinion his singing of it was better than his soloing. He would have done better just to copy the solo on the record. (However I am not a huge fan of Clapton's guitar playing, so I was not disappointed.) Jeff Lynne sang another one, but I don't remember what it was. I do have two ELO albums from back when, and let me say that Jeff Lynne is a much better singer now than before. I enjoyed his contributions.    All in all, the performances were great, and the backing band was fantastic. I won't buy it, as it doesn't have much replay value for me. But I am glad I saw it. The only thing missing was Yoko coming to sing something. But that's another plus.    Why four stars and not five? A little too much of the Shankar composition for my taste, for one thing, and because it is not Harrison singing these great and cherished tunes, so it can never reach its full potential. George, we loved you.
B00005JLWN|2.0|Equilibrium starring Christian Bale is kinda like The Matrix but the message of the film falls flat. The martial arts and special effects were lame but the acting is good thanks to Bale (but he wears too much make-up). The middle of the movie is the best, especially that adorable pup. Overall, I found this sci-fi flick a snoozer.
B001IZZEEI|5.0|I gave this a gift for someone who LOVES \\"Sex and the City\\" -- This was a much better format for a gift than just the dvd set.  And if you are a collector, another reason to get it.  The packaging and presentation is beautiful.

My wife, who hates comic books, decided to read it to shut me up...Now she can't put it down!<br /><br />You know the old saying, don't judge a book by it's cover, right?

B001PPLIFU|2.0|This latest installment in the Bond series was on several 'Worst of the year' lists, and rightfully so.  Let me first say that I'm a huge Bond fan.  I see the film in the theatre and then get the DVD.  In some cases, I own both the DVD and the blu-ray of several Bond films.  That being said, this movie was terrible in its attempt to be a \\"Bond movie\\".  The reasons are numerous and I won't list them.  If you want to see a pretty good action movie, then you will enjoy \\"Quantum of Solace\\" (though not nearly as much as any installment from the Bourne Trilogy).  If you are a die-hard Bond fan seeking a superior follow-up to \\"Casino Royale\\", then you can safely skip this one.
1416562605|2.0|I can understand why some India fans do not like this book. The story is dragging slow, with much casual cruelty toward India natives.  Not a book I would recommend to anyone planning a trip to the Indian subcontinent.  I find that many times the Man Booker prize winners (other than S. Rushdie) are disappointing.  Read Salman Rushdie if you want to understand modern India.
B00133KFGW|5.0|This movie is brilliant.  It is one of the most touching movies about family and faith that I have ever seen.  The music is incredible, and the visual images are breathtaking.  The story is one of an orphan and his parents, who reunite through their music and their faith.<br /><br />If you are the type of person that needs absolutely every detail of a movie to be perfect and to jive without any flaws or \\"how could that possibly happen\\" moments, this isn't for you.  But if you are looking to be inspired and for an uplifting, hopeful story, this is perfect.<br /><br />For young children, I would not recommend this movie, because there are some elements that would probably frighten them.<br /><br />A beautiful movie!
0307277453|5.0|An illuminating and enjoyable read for anyone with an interest in life, the universe, and everything. Combines paleontology and genetics to illustrate how we evolved into the form we have today. You'll never look at a human hand (or a fish) the same way again.
B001IA96Q0|5.0|I picked this up when it was on sale for $19.99 last month. At the time it was cheaper than the basic two disc Blu-ray package.<br /><br />I really like the packaging. The Photo Book is inside a nice cardboard sleeve, and it pulls out from the left side. The book is a good quality hard cover with a plastic tray for the two discs. The tray is located inside the left hand cover, and on the right is the 80 page Photographic Chronicle with pictures taken by Unit Photographer David James.<br /><br />There is also a preface by Steven Spielberg, where he talks about the importance of Still Photography on the set of a movie, a forward by Harrison Ford, and an introduction by David James.<br /><br />The photos in the book are really nice. Included are shots of scenes from the movie, production shots, promotional shots, etc. Every chapter begins with a brief description by David James about what was being shot and some facts about the films production.<br /><br />And on the first page of Chapter 2, there's a picture of Harrison Ford with his arms around Steven Spielberg and George Lucas and Lucas is wearing a \\"Han Shot First\\" T-Shirt. Pretty cool.<br /><br />The two discs in this collection are identical to the basic two disc Blu-ray version that is also available, and at the time that I bought this version, this one was cheaper!<br /><br />All in all, I thought that this was an excellent presentation and a great deal. Highly recommended.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I read the reviews about this product and they rang true.  I work out 5-6 times a week and have done another popular dvd workout for a long while.  It was time for a change and this was it!  I recommend investing in hand weights if you are going to do level 2 and 3 on this dvd (if you don't already have them).  I have noticed a difference in just 1 week, and this workout has made my other workouts better too.  The price is right.  I am looking forward to more from Jillian.
B00005NTJM|3.0|It took me awhile to get into Jethro Tull. Discovering them from the prog-rock angle as I did, it was awhile before I appreciated their idiosyncratic fusion of various styles merged with frontman Ian Anderson's very British singing style, accerbic wit, and very strange stage presence (even by prog standards.) Be as it may, my musical tastes broadened beyond the Rush, Yes, and Crimson, and I became more palatable to their music after a good friend made a CD-R compilation for me one Christmas.<br /><br />Bear in mind that I didn't actually hear it until five years later (due to the disc not being compatible with most of my players), but once I did, I was very curious about this band and felt like perhaps delving into their complete discography. Not wanting to take it on all at once, I decided that one album per month would do, over the course of a couple years, and I opted to go with a chronological approach.<br /><br />I find Tull's first prophetically-titled recording to be of the utmost quality. Much different from their more well-known American radio hits, even if it hints at those later styles in a few pieces. I'm particularly into \\"A Song For Jeffrey\\" (which I first saw on PBS when they were previewing the Stones' Rock 'n' Roll Circus DVD), which has a perfect mix of 1920s-style vocals, ringing bluesy guitar, and some dirty harmonica. It gives Zeppelin's \\"Travelling Riverside Blues\\" a run for its money. Not to mention Robert Johnson.<br /><br />All of the other tracks are corkers as well, although I find that more album cuts stand out on the next few releases. I have fond memories of listening to this on long nights while delivering pizzas, smoking ilicit substances and driving around the rainy streets of my small town, \\"My Sunday Feeling\\" blaring out my windows while I tried to find houses in my self-imposed haze.
B000003N7K|5.0|Like Kind of Blue and a small number of other Jazz Albums, this is a flawless masterpiece where everything comes together on every track. The result is heartbreakingly beautiful music - so beautiful in fact that although I have listened to and loved this album for over 25 years, I cannot listen to it frequently. It's beauty and poetry forces me to stop anything I am doing insist that I focus purely on the music, and all too often it puts me on the verge of tears. (Warning - I cry in movies alot too :)    This jazz album is one of the United States great cultural contributions to the world and as long as people have ears to hear and hearts to feel, they will be listening to and loving this remarkable album.

B000Q67DEO|5.0|I first got this on lp (that's album for the new generation!) so long ago.  Fell in love with it then and love it still today.  The fast and drum pounding \\"Dreaming\\", the dreamy rhythmic \\"Union City Blue\\", the catchy \\"Atomic\\".  I still don't have much love for the namesake song \\"Eat to the Beat\\", but I play it for people when they want a good laugh :).  I still remember when they performed \\"The Hardest Part\\" and \\"Dreaming\\" on Saturday Night live.  Blondie never disappoints me.  The instrumentals in all the songs are always amazing. \\"Dreaming is Free\\".  Indeed.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|This is an absolutely first-rate story about the survival of the human spirit.  I watch this once a year, and every time, it makes me weep with empathy.  There are wonderful characters, funny, pathetic, and strong, as they survive in a brutal prison, run by a corrupt evangelical christian sociopath; the warden is the perfect mirror for the horror over which he presides.<br /><br />The story is perfect, full of struggle and wonderful surprises, recounted by Red, the friend of Andy.  Andy is a remarkably resourceful man, who pursues several agendas at the same time, with patience and passion and pain.  Red, who becomes his intimate and special friend, helps him and then learns essential lessons from him about the value of life and freedom.  It is amazingly good and completely believable.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.  One of the truly perfect films.
0143038419|5.0|I loved this book.  I know the reviews are mixed with some people finding Ms. Gilbert fickle or self-absorbed.  I found her voice genuine and I believe she was truly searching for meaning in our life.<br /><br />The book is about Ms. Gilbert doing 'a geographic' which in 10-step program lingo means that you leave your home and go somewhere else thinking you can start over and all your problems will go away.  In reality, wherever we go, we take ourselves with us.  Our inner baggage is just as present as our outer baggage.<br /><br />Ms. Gilbert starts her journey in Rome.  I agree she is very self-absorbed there.  She has every reason to be.  She has just ended a relationship, she is searching for something meaningful and she is trying to find it through travel.  In a sense, she is a tourist in Italy, not really going deeply into the nuances and sensibility of the country.<br /><br />She then goes to India where she partakes in a Ashram.  Interestingly, she learns the most from her Texas friend who gives her many life lessons that help to lighten her inner load.<br /><br />Her last stop is Bali. Here she comes into herself.  She truly becomes part of the culture, trying to understand it, evaluate its impact on her and to be nonjudgmental but pragmatic. She finds meaning in her life which she carries with her, hopefully, for the rest of her days.<br /><br />I don't want to go into the particulars of the travel as that would give away too much of the book.  Enjoyment of this book requires that each reader travel vicariously with Ms. Gilbert.<br /><br />I read the book and listened to her on my IPOD.  I loved reading the book and enjoyed her telling her own story in her own voice.  I highly recommend this book.  I think it will resonate more with female readers than men.  It would be interesting to get a break-down of the positive and negative reviews based on gender.

B001FSDOZO|5.0|If I could add more stars I would. Nickelback doesn't just make songs. They create stories in a span of three to four minutes. They can sing about addiction in one tune and then croon about how far someone would go for the one they love in the next. Mind you though these songs are not for the faint of heart or for sensitive ear drums. These are gut-punching tunes that stick in your head and disturb the neighbors if you jack up the volume enough. Other than that if you've never listened to Nickelback before, this is an excellent album to start off with!
0439023483|5.0|It's difficult to find the right words to even describe how good Hunger Games is.  I would definitely place it on my top 5 list of all times and I have read hundreds and hundreds of books.<br /><br />Katniss is such an engaging character.  The reader is drawn to her instantly, as we are plunged into a futuristic world of oppression, poverty and despair.  Katniss has taken on the responsibility of caring for her family after her father died in a mining explosion and her mother shut down.  Katniss is daring and ventures out into forbidden areas to hunt and gather food to sell to the people in her \\"district\\".  Her only goal in life seems to be keeping her little sister safe.<br /><br />The government has set up a lottery in each of the twelve \\"districts\\" in this futuristic country.  One boy and one girl are chosen to go fight to the death with the \\"tributes\\" from the other eleven districts.  When Prim, Katniss's little sister, is chosen for the Hunger Games as they are called Katniss steps forward and volunteers to go in her place.<br /><br />Katniss goes to the capitol with the other tribute from her district, a boy named Peeta, and there they must put on a good show before the game begins.  If they set up the right image they could get sponsors during the game, which means they will receive gifts and help once they enter the arena.  Sponsors are the difference between life and death for many tributes so it is important to give the people what they want.<br /><br />The game itself is brutal.  It reminded me a tiny bit of the show survivor, only in this game you have to kill off all the other players.  Katniss has a slight advantage from her hunting and gathering experience, but she must also use her wits and bravery to keep herself alive.  Foreign alliances with other players can be helpful, but true trust and friendship is practically impossible since there can only be one winner.<br /><br />The book drives its characters to the very edge of their abilities.  We see how people react in the most primal and brutal situations: forced to kill or be killed.  I loved seeing the tributes come up with different strategies for survival, and how the game makers who control everything in the arena throw the tributes at each other through force and bribery.<br /><br />I read this book yesterday, and had dreams and nightmares about it all night.  While this book is reminiscent of \\"The Giver\\", \\"1984\\", and \\"Brave New World\\" it has its own voice and its own story to tell. At the end of the book you will be left starving for more and I can't wait for the next book to come out.  I still can't quite capture the essence or brilliance of this book through the words in this review, so all I can say is go read it and you will understand.imal and brutal situations: forced to kill or be killed.

B0000A5A0T|5.0|I think this 1957 album is probably the best introduction to Coltrane for those who are either new to jazz or have not yet heard any of Coltrane's other albums.  It is one of the earliest albums recorded under his leadership and mostly features tunes that he wrote.  While Coltrane was already beginning to extend the possibilities of the saxophone in many ways, the numbers on this album are all quite accessible to anyone likely to appreciate modern Jazz (Bebop, Hard-Bop, etc.).    One benefit of starting with this album (rather than with Giant Steps or A Love Supreme) is that Coltrane is accompanied by trumpeter Lee Morgan and trombonist Curtis Fuller who provide some relief both to Coltrane and to the listener.  While Coltrane is capable of beautiful playing, he can be quite intense and possibly overwhelming to some listeners, especially on his later albums, and especially on his most famous album, A Love Supreme.  Morgan and Fuller are both dynamic soloists in their own right, but they aren't as challenging as Coltrane.  Additionally, I enjoy the arranged sections at the beginnings and ends of some tracks where all 3 horns blow together.    Each of the 5 tunes on this CD is outstanding, but other reviewers have already described them well enough.  I happen to really like the hard-bop style which typifies this and many other Blue Note records of the 50s and 60s.  Other reviewers see this as a reason to rank this album lower than later Coltrane albums which developed a more unique style.  But I wish Coltrane had recorded more albums like this one for Blue Note, especially with Morgan who is my favorite trumpeter and recorded many Blue Note albums with other saxophonists such as Hank Mobley, Joe Henderson, Wayne Shorter, and Jackie McLean.  (If you want to hear Morgan and Fuller together on another album, check out Morgan's Tomcat from 1964.)

0783230079|4.0|Robert Downey, Jr. can do it all; just take a peep at his body of work. Plant him in a drama and he'll emote like a mother. Hell's bells, he'll even throw in a believable foreign accent if it's a period piece ([[ASIN:B001DE29SS Chaplin (15th Anniversary Edition)]], [[ASIN:6305428379 Restoration]], the upcoming SHERLOCK HOLMES movie). His skills as an actor are so bonafide that, even in lighthearted flicks, there is a weight to his performance. HEART AND SOULS, coming out in 1993 and expanded from a student film short titled SEVEN SOULS, is a fantasy comedy, and Robert Downey, Jr. plays the lead character, breathing good life and substance into what for other actors would've been a hackneyed role.<br /><br />Um, this feels a bit silly, since this film came out such a while ago, but here comes the plot SPOILERS alert.<br /><br />The first half hour of the film introduces four strangers during one fateful evening in 1959, San Francisco: Julia (Kyra Sedgwick), a cocktail waitress who has just spurned an offer of marriage; Harrison (Charles Grodin), a mild-mannered librarian with aspirations of singing opera (but who chickens out of his audition); Milo (Tom Sizemore), a small time hood who comes to rue his latest petty thief; and Penny (Alfre Woodard), a single mother who ventures out for her night shift gig. They all end up on the same bus, and if you believe in omens, then that sign on the bus indicating \\"4- Terminal\\" probably bodes inauspiciously for these passengers. Minutes later, the bus careens off a bridge and the passengers die. We know this because their spirits promptly rise up out of the bus.<br /><br />At the same moment and nearby, a baby named Thomas is born - and the four ghosts find themselves inexplicably gravitating toward him. And as time went on, Thomas's parents would fondly marvel at their unusual toddler, who often seemed to be chortling over nothing (but we know better). One such instance, when the baby wobbles out of the living room, his dad shakes his head: \\"Guess he's off to laugh at the kitchen now, huh?\\"<br /><br />Young Thomas, naturally, is the only who can see and hear his ghostly guardians. When Thomas is seven, his strange behavior finally has the grown-ups thinking that he's disturbed (it doesn't help that Milo has the kid placing bets on the racetrack and flipping pages of Playboy magazines). The concerned ghosts, after some agonizing, decide to leave Thomas be so that he can lead a normal kid's life, and so they fade out.<br /><br />Twenty seven years later, Thomas Reilly has grown up a ruthless bank executive specializing in foreclosing on bankruptcies. What's more, his commitment phobia threatens to sabotage things with his gorgeous girlfriend Anne (Elizabeth Shue), who wants their relationship to head somewhere. Meanwhile, the four souls have remained anchored to Thomas and are distressed over how their boy has turned out to be such an ayhole.<br /><br />I imagine it must've been deadly dull for these spectral foursome, trapped in Thomas's company for so long and not knowing why. Thirty-four years later, the \\"why\\" is answered in the form of the very bus driver (David Paymer) who had killed them accidentally. Seems dude has become a ferryman for the dead, and so what if he's tardy by fifteen or twenty years in picking up these four souls? Bus driver informs them that they were supposed to have used the boy as a vehicle to \\"do the one thing you would've done before you died.\\" Except that now it's too late and they have to get on the bus to the afterlife. Of course, bus driver is guilted into giving the ghosts a brief extension on earth.<br /><br />CHAPLIN had already showcased Robert Downey, Jr.'s flair for physical comedy, so HEART AND SOULS merely adds a punctuation mark. The suddenly frantic ghosts find it a challenge to manifest themselves to Thomas and then to convince him that they're not figments of his childhood imagination. And then they have to deal with Thomas's reluctance to help and his anger at them for abandoning him. So, to \\"persuade\\" him, they take turns possessing his body. The boardroom scene will remind some of Steve Martin in [[ASIN:6305262225 All of Me]] as Downey takes on playing a coy young woman and then a tough street thug. The funniest possession scene, though, is when Penny takes over Thomas, and Downey has to play an irate black woman (\\"You want me to get loud, I will GET loud!\\").<br /><br />Tonally, HEART AND SOULS bears echoes of Downey's earlier film [[ASIN:0767807596 Chances Are]], also a fantasy comedy. Both films demonstrate that Downey can handle himself in frothy screwballs. There's always been a certain playfulness about the guy, anyway, which one can sense even in frenetic action films like [[ASIN:B00005JPS8 Iron Man (Two-Disc Special Collectors' Edition)]].<br /><br />Credit where credit is due, with this film, it's not just about Downey. HEART AND SOULS boasts a marvelous ensemble cast working seamlessly together. The chemistry among Sedgwick, Woodard, Grodin, Sizemore, and Downey pays off with several funny moments and a surprisingly strong emotional impact. Two tiny highlights which musically demonstrate this rapport are the two fantastic \\"Walk Like A Man\\" sequences. There's an old-fashioned feel to this film, and I mean that in a good way. I think that Frank Capra, master of sentimentality, probably would've dug this picture. He probably would've been down with the mawkish score, too - even if the score is one of the very few issues I have with the movie, feeling it at times to be too manipulative. It also doesn't pay to think too much about how certain subplots wrap up perhaps too tidily (ie: Penny resolving her unfinished business).<br /><br />Not that this'll ever happen, but a word of advice, in case it does: if you happen to glimpse a spectral green and white bus heading towards you as it phases thru solid objects, there's no point in scampering. To quote the stunned heavenly bus driver: \\"They're tryin' to lose me?\\" You'd do better to be the chasee in an L.A. police car chase (but don't do that either).nd his anger at them for abandoning him.

B001DHXT1G|5.0|This movie has awsome quality. Turn the lights down low, and it's almost like being in the movie theatre.  Great special effects and plot.
B001C3KCSY|5.0|I am not sure how long its been since I have ever purchased a CD and listened to the entire thing without skipping a single. This is by far, the best album I have enjoyed lately.   It easily beats Coldplay's recent release (& I like that one by the way). KoL have produced a record that exceeds by far their other releases and should be considered the best album of the year (a tie with Fleet Foxes). Its not only the usual popular songs on the CD, but its the entire album. Sometimes it feels to me as one long single (excluding, \\"Cold Desert\\"). The lead's vocals are dominant and expressive in \\"CRAWL\\", \\"Use Somebody\\" & \\"Revelry\\".   My only concern is that, now KoL are going to be considered everybody's favorite rather than being in a special niche.  Enjoy!
B001GAPC1K|5.0|Wasn't into comic books when growing up, but would consider now.  Movie plot was great and special effects even better. Excellent quality video production.  Highly recommend
B000P12LWY|2.0|This show is not good history and only intermittently interesting as soap opera. Some of the actors play interesting characters, but they should have all sat down and watched \\"Fire over England\\" together to get a better idea of how people used to act at court.    If it wasn't for all the graphic sex scenes, you might think it was some sort of school series intent on slooowly grinding through the details of the early reign of King Henry VIII of england. Except that even a California native like myself can spot the inaccuracies in the history of a place far away and long ago.    I've walked the halls and park of Hampton Court myself on holiday and it was fun to spot the scenes that take place there. In fact, there are several plays put on in the series in those halls that I enjoyed very much.    Not enough to make up for the other 9 hours and fifty minutes of the first season, however.
045122499X|5.0|A brilliant book, with a fascinating insight to life in the middle ages. A book that is difficult to put down.This book combines a riveting series of plots with well researched historical aspects of eveyday life of the time.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|What a joy this was!  I am usually a P & P purist, and just watched it so I could be a watchdog and critique it.  Boy was I surprised.  I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, waiting to see what would happen next.  Elliot Cowan equals if not surpasses Colin as Darcy, and, well they are both great.  Just like I believe we can love the Colin P & P as well as the MacFadyen P & P, so too can we love this version.  We can love them all, as it is the story that we love, and these are merely different interpretations!  Jemima Rooper is a joy to behold; no one else could have pulled this tricky role off but her.  Please no one spoil the ending for those who have not seen it, but the ending to Lost in Austen is a big and wonderful surprise.  I personally would love to see a sequel in which we see how Lizzy is doing in her adventure.  Shh.  Don't give it away!!!  A delight.  PLEASE EVERYONE WRITE TO IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT (they are releasing the US version) and make sure they hear that we all will not be satisfied with a product that does not deliver the Downtown scene.  Strength in numbers so everyone please write, because word is, that it WILL be deleted from the US version, and we all know how crucial this scene is!!
0061367036|5.0|big fan of the SUPERNATURAL tv show. I had to get this the moment my eyes fell on it! The book has all the demons they have on the show and even some exorcism passages. I can't wait til 'John Winchester's Journal' comes out.
B0013FXWU6|3.0|I just watched this movie last night, and I agree with many posters' synopses of the movie. It is shot very well, tells a compelling story about how oil began as a big business, which is told through the story of the company's founder, Plainview. I didn't have a problem with the story per se, but there were a few things that really bothered me, which ultimately resulted in my retiring to bed at the very end.    First, the story is very long. As the story develops we can see that Plainview and the local pastor will come to butt heads in the movie, which is foreshadowed from the outset by the characters' actions. Although dignity was given to the story line, I believe they could have edited out some scenes and it still would have been fine. There also could have been some dialogue in the first 15 minutes of the movie. I realize cinema is an art, BUT, unless something compelling happens, it can become laborious to watch.    Second, I really disliked Daniel Day Lewis's portrayal of Plainview. In becoming the character, Lewis goes from becoming Plainview to acting like an oil tycoon in the making, which effectively results in becoming a caricature of the main character, which is actually NOT good acting. Simply because Lewis can hold a pose in his face throughout the film does not merit an Oscar. I felt as though his efforts were too forced, and almost comical. I wish that he would have actually tried to become the man, rather than ACTED like the man. There's a difference.    Third, I really disliked the music. It reminded me of the movies from the 60s when filmmakers tried to be avant-garde with clashing sounds and music that had no discernible rhythm or tone, but I suppose, as with other aspects of this movie, is just a personal taste issue.     I really enjoyed the shots that were in the movie, especially when they struck oil when the son is involved.    Overall, good, but not Oscar-worthy in the least.
0452284392|5.0|I first came across Barabasi through a colleague who works in bioinformatics. Having read some of his technical papers, I was unaware that he had a popular book on his work. I was pleasantly surprised by the clarity of style. This is an excellent introduction to networks and the references found in the notes section easily allow further exploration.
B0019GJ4EM|1.0|Read the reviews at amazon.co.uk. It is upscaled standard definition. It looks like garbage. Don't waste your money, just wait for the official US release which will hopefully be better.
B001MW0J2Y|4.0|The first thing I'll make clear is that I'm every bit as much of a Frusciante fanatic as the authors of the rest of these five-star reviews. I can't give 'The Empyrean' five stars though. Four stars is enough, and it's a good score. I'd give 'Inside of Emptiness' and both Ataxia records four stars, and I'm a big fan of all of those.    I'm not surprised John Frusciante wanted to flesh this album out a little more than his last few records, considering the time he's spent contributing toward the mind-bending studio-tweaked Freakout melting-pots built by his good friend Mr Rodriguez-Lopez. But John's attempts at sonic manipulation were always going to be more serene than Omar's relentless audio confrontations. It's his nature. And the last time John attempted to really saturate his recordings with textures and bold psychedelic orchestration it resulted in 'Shadows Collide With People', which was as warm and lush a pop record as any Flaming Lips you'd care to name.    'The Empyrean' is explicitly a concept album. After this 'disclaimer', John has allowed himself more freedom and space in the structuring of the songs, and their shape when built into an album. Lyrical and musical themes recur, the sonic landscape is consistent in its variety, and John's voice takes on the role of Navigator through the dense and colourful hour from start to finish. Vintage keyboards and phase effects abound, and the use of reverb is key to the atmosphere created. The sound of the album certainly matches its celestial title.    I'll keep it brief from here: 'Before the Beginning' is beautiful, minimal, expressive, and expansive. 'Unreachable' is the most comparable song to anything from his 2004 records, and is where 'Empyrean' truly kicks into gear. 'Dark/Light' does a 180 from melancholy piano to s'...Record Only Water...'-style drum machine euphoric bass groove. 'Central' is perhaps the standout track, the last three minutes of which may be the amalgamation of every hard rocking momentJohn has done across the sound spectrum since he rejoined the Chili Peppers.    There are a couple of small problems though. Frusciante's songwriting is quite reserved and seems at odds with the heavy, prog-rock-esque arrangements and production. I don't know why he chose to alter the pitch of his voice on 'One More of Me', and I'm not sure 'Song to the Siren' serves much purpose here. Buckley's 'Star Sailor' version was definitive, John sings it conservatively, and more importantly - why cover it? Its lyrics fit, but John is one of the few musicians capable of writing songs as beautiful as '...Siren', he's done it before. Some kind of sister song to 'Leap Your Bar' or 'My Life' would have been better.    But as the title of this review states, these issues don't amount to much when the whole piece is as assured, honest and unique as 'The Empyrean' definitely is. Flea, Josh Klinghoffer and Johnny Marr appear too, and their contributions are as fitting and concise as you'd expect from these experienced and unpretentious players. The thematic unity and the successful exploration of textures is what makes this record great, as well as John's ever-improving voice.
B00011RPB0|3.0|How do you tell when you may've watched a 'post-modern' movie? When it's hard to tell anything else about the film.    It's never entirely clear what 2004's Oscar-nominated Lost in Translation - one of Bill Murray's rare ventures into 'serious' acting and Scarlett Johansson's introduction to the Hollywood heavenlies (which wasn't hurt by a 30-second indulgent glimpse of her ample behind right at the film's front) - was trying to get at.    Sure 1) we could say, 'Tokyo', but the city was everywhere yet (because of that?) nowhere. Tokyo is a land which drives Americans crazy, a fantasy-arena where life's details and granularity is hopelessly mixed up in triviality, obsessive formality and technological excess, where empty temples co-exist with crowded strip-joints; then again, who cares? One can't help but feel that Japan the nation was merely the medium for a vague pseudo-message not easily deciphered.    Or 2) was the show merely about a middle-aged man, Bob, struggling through a week of life in Tokyo and who happened to befriend a philosophy-grad, Charlotte, accompanying her husband on a business trip which leaves her feeling imprisoned in a Tokyo-imposed cage of meaningless activity? Yes, except there is no message here, no moral, no plot, no 'solution', no - one could say - point to the two hours of what seems like two people trying to do nothing but cheer each other up. And they do so via parties, with (cheap) philosophy, through one- and two-liners and, most significantly IMO, by staring at each other.    Were these the themes director Sofia Coppola was trying to get at? Staring and quietitude striving to transcend the superficial pauses of an urban chaos which ploughs on and on. Stillness and deliberate thoughtfulness when noise and buzz dominate and when life at home inflicts pain and relational dead-ends (both Bob and Charlotte never seem to end their overseas phone calls happy).    Maybe the whole movie was 3) motion-streaming a strange friendship just to see where things led to on their own. Maybe Coppola didn't know where she wanted the movie to head, and she was waiting for Bob and Charlotte to give her the answer i.e. there was no 'director', the script was 'writing itself'. Regardless, Lost in Translation often felt like it's title, so all ye movie-goers raised on clear story progression, be warned.    4) There are many other questions one may ask although, again, I'm curious if we were meant to ask them. Were Bob and Charlotte falling in love? If so, what exactly was preventing all-out romance, apart from marital fidelity? If not, then was the movie exploring the boundaries of Platonic affection between people who, for all intents and purposes, seemed drawn to each other (and if so, what's the conclusion?)? And why did Bob 'give in' so easily to a total stranger (so much for fidelity) and how did this figure into the movie (since not much was said about it)? What about Charlotte's long silent peerings into temples and gardens? Did those mean something?    5) Perhaps, in the final(?) analysis, Lost in Translation is about friendship - pure but not simple. It's about how friends are made, how a relationship progresses through desire (both sexual and otherwise), how likings and loves adapt, and, ultimately, how we acknowledge the end of a cherished stage (although I'm willing to bet there is no fixed meaning of the final farewell scene; it truly is anybody's guess what the point was, if there was even one).    We've all lived through difficult (but relatively short) phases in life which were redeemed on account of an individual whose presence made the occasion mean something, whose words and companionship redefined the experience from one of repulsion to one of warmth and rightness. Perhaps Coppola meant to depict such quiet relational miracles, the metamorphosis of two 'wrongs' (Bob and Charlotte being in Tokyo) into one 'right' (a week-long mutually supportive memory).     Lost in Translation, ironically, may really be a movie about being found - at least for a while.
B00005JPTK|2.0|This wasn't a very detailed film.  I liked it but was glad I saw it on cable and didn't pay the regular movie price or I would have felt cheated.    Also, his blatant advertising of Shrek in this movie was a little nauseating.   Smith shouldn't taint a good film with a mediocre one. Don't bother buying I Legend.  See it on cable or order it though internet library loan at your local library if it doesn't have it on the shelf.  Will Smith dropped it with this film.
B000002GB6|5.0|This is a benchmark album that slipped Chuck Mangione into the mainstream public's awareness. Simple yet affecting arrangements.

1400063515|2.0|Nassim Nicholas Taleb opines in his book that a great honor that could be bestowed upon him is if some scholar took the time and effort to auther a rebuttal book titled \\"The White Swan.\\"  Unfortunately, I will disappoint Mr Taleb and offer only an on-line review written by a decided philistine and usurp the title for this brief critique.    Mr Taleb is certainly correct on many of his contentions: that improbable \\"off-the-radar\\" events shape our world, that \\"professionals\\" in the prognostication industries (e.f. financial analysis and advice, economics, CEO's) are collectively charlatans, and that the human mind is biased through millennia of mammalian evolution to believe in causality and embrace the narrative where only random events may exits.    But his book is lacking in a number of respects.  The most prominent forms of evidence which he offers is to cite either his own superior intellect, life-experience, and erudite approach to life (and the repeated narcissistic autobiographic references do become very tiresome even within the first 20 pages) or to engage in demagoguery.  He draws parallels between himself and  those he respects and emulates (like Poincarre) and dismisses his critics and foes as philistines (hence my self-description above).  Indeed, I have no doubt that most financial analysts and CEO's are philistines.  But that fact and allusion to that fact does not constitute evidence to support Mr Taleb's arguments.    Second, he gets some concepts and facts painfully wrong.    He casually and repeatedly dismisses \\"the bell curve\\", and does so inaccurately.  He implies that the bell curve does not allow for rare events.  That is incorrect.  The \\"tails\\" of the bell curve extend to infinity and encompass the numerically improbable, but inevitable events.  Any element that can be quantified (wealth distribution as one example Mr Taleb reference several times) can and will have examples of rare outliers, which nevertheless exist within the bell curve.  Bill Gates' wealth is at the far extreme right of the bell curve, multiple standard deviations from the mean.  But it is not outside the bell curve.  Some variables are not \\"normally\\" distributed but these two can properly be described by appropriate skewed methods, such as nonparametric analyses.  Granted, the principal type of \\"Black Swan\\" that Mr Taleb describes is the qualitatively unpredicted event (e.g. jumbo jets crashing into the Twin Towers) that falls well outside the realm of the bell curve, but many, many of the \\"exceptions\\" that he cites are within the bell curve.  He is simply wrong in dismissing the bell curve.    Though Mr Taleb dismisses facts and knowledge as irrelevant (and is thus free to draw any conclusions from any observation, no matter how incorrect his facts are), there are some readers who will insist that he gets his facts correct before he cites fictitious scenarios.  To wit: at one point he states that doctors will avoid prescribing drugs which may be proven to offer benefit to a large proportion of patients because of the fear of uncommon side effects and their potential attendant lawsuits (the \\"Black Swan\\" of this example).  He is wrong.  In this era of evidence-based medicine, the entire medical profession has devoted enormous effort in exactly the opposite direction. The Federal government now scorecards hospitals on the same.  The risk is much greater that a physician failing to prescribe such an effective medicine will be sued for failing to adhere to \\"standard of care\\" than be sued for the rare \\"Black Swan\\" side effect.    As another example: research and discovery.  Correctly, Mr Taleb cites important examples of serendipity in scientific discovery (Alexander Fleming and penicillin).  But Mr Taleb is clearly ignorant of planned discovery and development.  Most medications which have emerged in the last two decades did not come about via serendipity but through a concerted process of target identification, receptor mapping, chemical synthesis (guided by knowledge of what side-branches impart what properties of absorption and solubility), with preclinical and clinical testing to follow.    He insists that the automobile and the atom bomb are the results of accumulated serendipity.  Perhaps that is true for one or more of the key elements that led to the invention, but let's not ignore the Manhattan Project nor the incremental engineering developments that have evolved the automobile from the Model T to its modern counterpart.      For Mr Taleb, facts are inconvenient items because they fail to support his hypotheses.      Finally, the writing in general is quite poor.  Again, Mr Taleb invokes an intellectual giant such as Poincarre to make the point that digressions and other irrelevancies are an example of a superior mind and only an ignoramus editor would dare suggest otherwise.  Ever the philistine, I will offer that flight-of-ideas is also a symptom of some forms of psychiatric disorders.  A poorly constructed chapter with random allusions transparent only to the author is a form of literary autism.     In conclusion,  worth a read, but borrow this book from your library, don't buy it.
1591841666|5.0|I bought this book as an audible download, before buying the hardcover book. I'd have to say, that other than the the audio for Steven Pressfield's [[ASIN:0446691437 The War of Art: Break Through the Blocks and Win Your Inner Creative Battles]] I have never listened to an audio program so many times. I lost count around the 8th time.<br /><br />Somehow, the book does not have as much impact as the audio, even though the content is the same. Perhaps because Godin reads the book himself and is a very engaging speaker? Regardless, either book or audio is a great choice.<br /><br />There have been quite a few negative reviews of this book. Perhaps it's a matter of timing? If you have already made it through \\"a dip\\" maybe the information does not seem as critical. I started reading and listening after a series of self-created job and career misfires, and although I was well on my way to some wonderful new successes, I was feeling rather burnt out because I was going in too many different directions.<br /><br />Seth Godin's book \\"The Dip: A Little Book That Teaches You When to Quit (and When to Stick)\\" helped me streamline and eliminate distraction and focus on what is important to me - regardless of any temporary setbacks or transitory fears. I found it very helpful.<br /><br />- Ryan<br /><br />By the way - Several people have complained that the book seems to repeat itself. That is true. However, it's also useful, as Godin's writing really helps to \\"wire in\\" the ideas and make sure you get them at a deep level.

0060899220|4.0|I'm not a professional cook and I have zero experience in the industry.  My only experience with the world described in Bourdain's \\"Kitchen Confidential\\" is having read a couple cookbooks, and having watched [[ASIN:B000OCXLA0 Kitchen Confidential - The Complete Series]].  I have however heard the gossip about this book, and how it made Bourdain a lot of enemies in the culinary world; how he exposed the secrets of chefs everywhere, and what REALLY goes on in professional kitchens.  An oft-mentioned quote from the book is how you should \\"never order fish on Monday\\" and \\"never order mussels unless you know the chef personally.\\"  I was looking forward to more industry secrets of that sort, along with lurid tales of sex, drugs, and general mayhem that is usually kept secret from outsiders.<br /><br />In the realm of kitchen gossip, Mr. Bourdain doesn't disappoint, for a total of maybe 3 chapters.  Other than a singular mention of a sexual encounter between a cook and a patron, some general discussion about drug use, and trash-talking about maybe two celebrity chefs, there isn't much in this book that I would consider an \\"expose,\\" and I can't figure out what the big deal is.  That's not to say that I didn't enjoy it.  It was an interesting read, especially since I know absolutely nothing about kitchens.  After finishing it, I did get a sense that I understood the industry a little better.  Bourdain has led a somewhat interesting life, and his stories are fairly entertaining.  The reviewer who mentioned that the book is much more about Bourdain than the world of cooking is fairly accurate.<br /><br />\\"Kitchen Confidential\\" is a pretty fun read, and I think cooks and the spatula-impaired alike will enjoy it, but I can't see how it deserves any of the criticism I can recall it receiving as an expose, simply because it wasn't that \\"juicy.\\"  The advice about not ordering fish on Mondays really only applies to New York City, and even then, I'm not sure how reliable it is, since Bourdain's logic didn't make much sense.  Does it really matter if I eat fish that's 4 days old instead of 2 days old, given that's both have been property refrigerated and stored?  Maybe my palate isn't as refined, but I doubt it makes much difference to me.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the culinary world, but as far as shock value goes, you will find much more before the first commercial break in an episode of Gordon Ramsay's \\"Kitchen Nightmares.\\"gic didn't make much sense.

B000P6YNSE|5.0|SO in the third season of lost, I'll admit that I got a little Lost. Although I've been watching since the beginning, during the first half of this season I was a bit stumped.<br /><br />Our losties were taken by the 'Others' and that's where the storyline started to get a little old. It was like ok what's the deal here? where are they? who are these people? but after about 8 episodes the season started to open up and get very very interesting. More answers were answered yet more questions were raised but in a good way. The finale to this season was very intense but totally paid off.<br /><br />As I said in my review for s2, this show can def get frustrating but given some patience you will not be disappointed.
B000OVLBIU|2.0|Terrible.  It is painfully obvious that very little effort went into the making of this film.  With movies like X2 and Batman Begins, how can anyone have the nerve to produce a loser like this?  Here is a news flash for the producers of this movie.  When I go to see a movie called Ghost Rider, that means I want to see the Ghost Rider.  I don't want to see Nicolas Cage, as Johnny Blaze, for 80% of the movie.  That is precisely what you get.  In the brief instances that you get to see the Ghost Rider, it's not too bad.  It's unfortunate that just when you get into the action, the director just can't wait to get Cage's silly mug back on the screen.  He is the usual one-dimensional character that marks most of his film career.  If that is not enough to turn you off, there is a painfully bad love story here, involving the terrible acting Eva Mendez, that is about as juvenile as you can get. Anyone who knows anything about the Rider, knows that it is a dark story.  Yet, the producers thought it fitting to throw in quite a few \\"funny\\" scenes, that just have no place here.  Talk about being totally out of touch with what the character is all about.  Your best bet for this movie is through the DVD.  That way, you can skip the bad parts of the movie, which are numerous.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|Wow!! that's all I can say when it came to season 4 of LOST. There are people coming to the Island..who are they??? why are they here? how did they find this mysterious island?

We get an understanding that this island is very special and unique and that maybe you don't really wanna leave it afterall. Hmmm.<br /><br />All I can say is that I'm so glad I stuck by this show because it just keeps getting better with every season and every episode. I'm absoultey obsessed!

With the exception of \\"No Questions Asked\\" (and, perhaps, Christine McVie's sweet but airplay-challenged ballad, \\"As Long As You Follow\\"), every song on this album should be familiar to most classic rock listeners, not just Fleetwood Mac fans.  In other words, unlike some groups whose \\"Best Of\\" compilations include filler among the gems, this one is all gems.

B000N6U0E2|5.0|Will Smith stars with his son Jaden in this true story about going for it all when life seems like it is giving you no opportunity at all.<br /><br />Chris Gardner was always working to make it selling medical equipment which he acquired out of his own pocket to sell to small Doctors offices.  His family life is in shambles and he is really going nowhere with a son who is caught between Gardner and his ex.  Gardner thinks about an opportunity he hears of working for an investment firm as an intern and he goes for it.<br /><br />He faces many challenges while attempting to even get into the program, where only one person of all who go through it are selected.  The premise of the movie, is that we in the USA have the right to pursue happiness.  It is not a given.  Carter worked to pursue what would make him happy and this movie is even a way to give back.<br /><br />You will see some of the actual areas where Carter actually operated, even the homeless shelter is the actual one where he stayed eeking out a living.  (The DVDs features will tell you a whole lot more about that that is even touching just by itself.)<br /><br />This is a movie about winning in life, and mostly, not giving up when things seem the worst.  I could name a cliche or two, but really, this man applied what it took for him to be a success, and Smith really delivers.<br /><br />I cannot understand the one and two star votes here.  This is a movie of meaning and Smith does an outstanding performance.  Get Pursuit of Happyness, you just might learn something.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|The plot of \\"Slumdog\\" has already been blabbed away. I enjoyed it a lot; life's lessons can teach a lot more than most schools.This is a finely crafted film, thanks to the always wonderful Danny Boyle; a whole bunch of wonderful kid-actors make the flash-back moments so hopefully  heartfelt.A wonderful cast. The amazing editing and brilliant photography add to the progression of the plot at large, showing past & present. I was impressed that this simple story, that almost didn't find a distributor, appeared to the public.  This is a feel-good film, but subtitles may keep some Oscar voters away. The Oscars have made lots of mistakes; the absence of Dev Patel as a nominee is just another Oscar travesty.  It's as earnest a performance as I've seen. \\"Crouching Tiger\\", Life is Beautiful\\", \\"Z\\", \\"The Emigrants\\", and other foreign language films have been darlings at the Oscars, all sub-titled. \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" is a worthy film. Kids should see it to know the importance of \\"learned knowledge\\", though the subtitles may not make it as accessible to the general public (and kids). I was moved by this film, and the impeccable artistry for a \\"small\\" film. Bravo, Danny Boyle! UPDATE: Benjamin Button was a much better cinematic achievement. It should've won.
B0015HOFZI|4.0|I have a few close-to-irreplaceable records that I want to convert to digital format which is why I went hunting for a turntable I could connect to my PC and also be able to eventually connect it to our regular stereo system. This turntable only took a few minutes to assemble and connect to my PC with the USB cable. The included software is adequate for my non-tech skills and the only problem I've encountered so far is that the software apparently is not always capable of distinguishing between the individual record music tracks and it will run two or three songs together. I have to learn how to break them apart. I'm also puzzled that when the time comes to replace the stylus that no part number is given or other clues in the instruction manual or paperwork on how it is to be done. I've only had a little time to practice with it yet but I think it is going to work very well for my purposes.

B001ACH4DS|3.0|This CD is NEITHER the masterpiece 5-star effort that most are labeling it, nor the 1-star crap that others are.  David Cook has an amazing voice, and while I no longer watch AI, when I heard him for the first time, I thought that finally America got it right.  This CD is really a sandwich of songs, with no meat in the middle.  The first 3 tracks get things off to a great start, and the last 3 tracks close it out nicely.  The problem is the 7 songs in the middle are very generic and unmemorable.  My recommendation is to save some money and download 1-3 and 10-13 and leave the rest.  If you are \\"digitally impaired\\", the six good songs make it worth picking up a used copy.

B00004SC3M|5.0|Sir Sean ( the quintessential James Bond of our youth) emerges from his retirement home and pursues and is pursued by the exquisitely beautiful Catherine Zeta-Jones who gives an admirable performance as the exquisitely beautiful Catherine Zeta-Jones. Her acrobatic endeavors (or those of her stunt double?) are truly impressive. The mandatory special effects and chase scene are included.  There are more plot twists than Bush/Cheney explanations for our invasion of Iraq.   The pertinacious flaw is the disparity in years between the aging Connery and the relatively youthful Zeta-Jones.   A great movie to watch while sitting on the couch, kicking off your slippers, munching popcorn and preparing to be entertained.

B001AJVR5M|1.0|Well well well... another cookie-cutter \\"little girl-crazy,\\" band. And from the way how I see it, this will be another episode of the quick ascend and swift descend of another band-gone-wrong.<br />But than again, this isn't my type of music but I feel VERY strongly about a few things concerning it. First, the highest issue I have is that The Jony Bros take songs from other bands and sing them. And sure, this is alright, but when the fans don't know that some of the songs they are singing are from The Beatles, or others, it really starts to tick me off.<br />Second, the music sounds cotton-candy-amped. They are the typical Justin Timberlake's NSYNC, Backtstreet Boys, Hanna Montanna, Hilary Duff, pieces of dookie that we see rise and than fall to a quick death of the pop world. I already said I'm not into this type of music, but even some of the stuff from NSYNC (Bye Bye Bye) or the BBs (I Want It That Way) were at least decent and intersting to listen to. The Jonas Brothers are not as \\"great,\\" as they are made out to be (there music makes me want to scream and my ears start to bleed); just powered by a Fluff Machine to provide the overly-girly-blonde-minded population that infest this planet.<br />Third, the lyrics are hysterical and totally original. They are the typical suger-coated c*R@9 that is launched at the hormonic girly population to satisfy some thwarted throats... sorry. I just can't help but keep bringing up that fact... The same basic lyrics that are song by other boy bands, about love, losing you're girlfriend to somebody else, peace, how everybody wants you and being popular.<br />Somebody hand me a barf bag.

031606792X|5.0|I Love the Twilight Series! I literally couldn't put it down for much of anything. My life revolved around it for 2-3 weeks?? Pretty sad,but i got sucked in, much like the rest. The only thing i can say is i wanted more, i was disappointed with the end, i would of liked it to have more of a big fight scene or blood if you will, and that was not delivered. But all the same it kept me wanting more and Thankfully Stephenie Meyer is writing another book to the Twilight series for the obsessive fans! It's Called Midnight Sun and so far,for those who have read the internet leak, it is Very promising & a wonderful second point of view!! Stephenie Meyer Rocks!
0143038583|5.0|What an eye-opening book!  This should be required reading for every American.  We don't even realize the junk we're putting in our bodies everyday and the destruction we're causing to the earth.  It's amazing how greed has destroyed what once was a sustainable and waste-free farming system.  I was already making casual changes to eat more organic and locally grown food, but after reading this book I've completely altered my diet.  No more fast food (ever!) and no meat or chicken unless it's grass-fed and sustainably raised (which thus far means I'm a vegetarian - until I find a local farm to buy from).  I recommend this book to everyone.  It will change the way you look at food.

B001PPLIFU|3.0|Though it grew on me with subsequent viewings, I am still not convinced that Casino Royale was that great of a James Bond film. But it's hard to argue with success and it did wet my appetite to see how the Daniel Craig era will shape up. So now, with Quantum Of Solace, I get my chance.  This is the 22nd entry in the Eon series; a series that has really changed the way movies present pulp characters on a continual basis. So, the 007 films didn't simply spawn a whole genre of 'superspy' action films; you can easily make a case that the Bond films spawned all modern action franchises from Die Hard to Iron Man. But after years of excess, the series is trying to re-position itself as a semi-realistic, serialized story of Britain's top secret agent.<br /><br />Quantum Of Solace is in fact the first direct sequel of the Bond series. And it often feels like a feature-length closing action sequence that was left out of the previous film. Quantum Of Solace opens minutes after Casino Royale ends; throwing the viewer right in the middle of a killer chase scene that pits Bond's gadget-free Aston Martin against multiple pursuants trying to prevent him from escaping with the evil Mr. White as they race down a perilous mountain road. It's a short, but damn exciting scene that sets the tone for the whole film.  The title montage, set to a fairly descent Jack White song, is weaker than Casino Royale's, but has a certain minimalist panache we haven't seen in some time. Then, the film gets down to business.<br /><br />Not to belabor the little plot there is, Quantum Of Solace revolves around Bond's attempt to uncover the shadowy organization behind the death of his lover, Vesper Lynd. His efforts quickly lead him to Dominic Greene (Matthieu Amalric of Munich and The Diving Bell And A Butterfly), a shifty environmentalist whose motives are less than altruistic. What exactly Greene's plot is, outside of trying to control Bolivia's (!) water supply, is as unclear as it is unimportant. Amalric is a fine actor, but his Greene is basically a weasel who is no match for Craig: he won't be making any \\"Bond's Best Villain\\" lists any time soon. And suffice it to say, antagonizing James Bond turns out to be a very bad move for him. Especially this particular James Bond.<br />I was critical of Daniel Craig's charm-free portrayal in Casino Royale, but he's definitely growing as a character here. Many critics focus on his constant anger, but this is - in fact - what this film is all about: getting past your anger and becoming a professional. So Quantum Of Solace continues Bond's development from \\"blunt instrument\\" to debonair gentleman spy we all know.  And Craig gets to slip in a little dry wit along with a good dose of brutality and butt whooping he's come to be famous for. It works for me, though I do hope that the following films let him relax and enjoy the finer things that have always been a part of Bond's DNA; this guy can really use a dry martini and a fine cigar, just to take the edge off.<br /><br />Overall, Quantum Of Solace is a lean and mean little film. Clocking in at under two hours, it's shorter than most Bond adventures and spends very little time on anything resembling character development or frivolity; basically taking the already streamlined Casino Royale formula and trimming even more fat. What's left is sinewy, dry and somewhat slight, though never boring.  Director Marc Forster is not as deft with the action as Martin Campbell, but I was always engaged. Considering Forster's previous films though, there are some sadly missed character opportunities (especially with the great Giancarlo Giannini and Jeffrey Wright, who are both given short shift here); which is puzzling.  And Bond's libido seems way down; he's much more into killing than screwing. Perhaps we should add a Viagra to that martini and cigar, throw in a couple of reasonable gadgets, add a few minutes to enjoy the beautiful scenery, and the next 007 entry can actually feel likea real James Bond film. As such, Quantum Of Solace is a solid B effort; an exciting action film, that barely seems to belong in the Bond series.such, Quantum Of Solace is a solid B effort; an exciting action film, that barely seems to belong in the Bond series.

B0017WCERM|5.0|This is by far my favorite Metallica album. When I picked this up, I was blown away by their intensity and raw power. It also has some great songs on it. Afterward, I picked up their previous albums and everything up to the black album, and this is still my favorite.<br /><br />This album, which I believe was their third, saw them really get their chops. It shows in the structure and quality of the songs.<br /><br />I can't say much more that hasn't already been said. Highly recommended.
0307269752|5.0|I almost put this book down at page 20 because I was so confused and uninterested in stock market numbers and financial quotes, but I picked it back up and gave it another chance. Then, I could not put it down! Unfortunately for me, that meant lots of lost sleep because this book is not a fast read, which is extremely unique for a \\"mystery novel.\\" I can streak through most mysteries in about two days. I loved that I had to take my time with this one and that I got so wrapped up in it that time evaporated.<br /><br />True, there are a few plot points that either don't make sense or could have been better written and I guessed part of the ending by about Chapter 5, but I still loved it.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have never committed to an exercise program until now. I will admit, the workouts themselves are not difficult, however the repetition and length of time you do them makes your muscles work hard! I like how Jillian conducts her exercises...3 minutes strength, 2 minutes cardio and 1 minute abs (I believe you do this repetition 3 times). She moves from one exercise right into another, this helps to keep the program moving along. Once you've done the same level a couple of times, mute the TV and put on your favorite music to keep you motivated.<br /><br />**Warning: Jillian is not a hand-holder. Her method of encouragement is to push you to go further and to challenge yourself. You WILL feel the burn, but it is so rewarding!
B000002UA9|5.0|Wow! It is amazing that there are so many hits in this album, especially since this was their first album in England. So many hits, and one of my favorites of all time (I Saw Her Standing There) is the first track! Even the lesser known songs are great and feel like classics. I don't think there is bad song on this record. If you don't own any Beatles albums and you want a taste of their early work, this is a very good place to start.

B00008FK14|3.0|I was a fan of Def Leppard and saw them live in Spain in the mid 80's. Their first three albums, particularly High and Dry were pretty good. Hysteria was the last vinyl album we bought of the band as the CD revolution was taking over. It was also the last album we bought by them period.<br /><br />The first time I heard this I didn't like it, but couldn't quite figure out why. The thing is a total hit factory, with most of the songs still being played to death on the radio. I like them well enough that I don't slam the off button on the dashboard, but I am pretty sick of those same old songs, all of which, by the way, come from this album alone.<br /><br />It is certainly packed at 63 minutes, which for vinyl is pushing the capacity limit. I guess you could say fans got their money's worth.<br /><br />It wasn't until years later that I figured out what was wrong with Hysteria. It is just too sanitary, too perfect, to the point that the band and/or producers sucked the life right out of it. There is no spontaneity, no sparkle, no... life to it. It is too clean and way overproduced. That was what has been bugging me all these years. This is an example of a band tampering with things to the point that they kill the sparkle this album could have had.<br /><br />Over the years, I've come to see Def Leppard as teenybopper metal, and if you don't see it that way, just listen to Pour Some Sugar On Me. I rest my case.<br /><br />There are some other good songs on here besides the hits, but they get little attention in the big picture and I wonder how many of those non-hits the band still plays live, if at all.<br /><br />Def Leppard is a great band, and they are still around. I really admire them for keeping to their guns. However, they have a penchant for overproducing their albums and it shows. I'd like to see them do a live-in-the-studio album, leave in a few mistakes. Make it sound like it was recorded by humans and not machines.<br /><br />If you are a fan, no need to recommend this. However, if you are just curious, turn on any rock radio station and you will hear all you need. Save a few bucks.any rock radio station and you will hear all you need. Save a few bucks.

Even though some of the songs from Meet the Beatles aren't here, this still has a great selection of songs and some big hits (such as \\"All My Loving\\" and \\"I Wanna Be Your Man\\"). There are a lot of covers on this album, but I love them all. The Beatles version of \\"You Really Got A Hold On Me\\" is absolutely fantastic and probably my favorite cover they do, but obviously not their most famous cover. I just really love that song.
045122499X|3.0|Don't like it as well as Pillars Of The Earth - but well-written - would rather be rereading Eye Of The Needle !!
B000000OPZ|4.0|One thing I can say about Dave Coverdale, he sure attracts some great backing musicians. If you start with his first album, you will find his career punctuated with a who's who roster of rock elite. This shows in the music. It is well done, very slick, and totally catchy.<br /><br />I saw him in Spain in the 80's and he had Steve Vai and Adrian Vandenberg with him. They put on a great show despite Vandenberg flubbing a keyboard line on one of the songs. At least that flub gave them a human touch that is a bit missing on some of this album. It is good, in fact, great in a lot of ways, but I just wish it wasn't so slick.<br /><br />One thing I noticed is that there are two versions of Here I Go Again. The one on this vinyl album is a bit heavier and simpler than the more orchestrated version usually heard on the radio. I'm not sure why they tampered with it, but probably to make it an even bigger hit would be my guess.<br /><br />This is heavy pop/hair metal. That standard hair metal snare drum sound is prominent, as well as their hair styles (though there is no photo of the band on my vinyl copy). This album in particular is a hit factory and you can hear many of the cuts on classic rock radio. This is another band I can tolerate over and over again, though it does get a little old, but not enough that I slam the off button on the radio.<br /><br />One thing I can't resist mentioning, is that they were pretty big in Spain in the 80's. There was this old man at a bar near our house and when he saw my daughter with a Whitesnake T-shirt on, he said, \\"Veetuh-snawkuh.\\" To this day, I call them veetuh- snawkuh.<br /><br />A couple of years ago, I saw Whitesnake here in Las Vegas at Mandalay bay. Of course, Coverdale was the only original member, but his band of hired hands, as usual, rocked. He still has it.<br /><br />I would've liked to see him get a little more down and dirty with the sound on Whitesnake, but still, this album rocks. Recommended.

THEY LIED! the money never reached my account and now they wont return my emails! THEY STOLE FROM ME!
B000002UAO|5.0|The album is AMAZING! Ohhh man, it is hard to beat that guitar in the song \\"The Word\\". The Beatles are definitely showing how much they have grown in Rubber Soul. This record is just something completely different and just fantastic. Words are hard to express this album, which is definitely another masterpiece from the greatest Rock band ever. Ringo brought back his country side with \\"What Goes On\\" and it just feels like it could be a Beatles song and is. It is all just really great
B00005J6UR|2.0|The case for the DVD was broken when it arrived and cannot be closed and the DVD was loose in the packaging.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This game has been a staple amongst my friends for years now.  The balance of luck, the ability to trade and negotiate, and the strategy on where to build settlements is appealing to the hardcore board gamer and the casual player as well.  If you are looking for a new game to add to your collection then this would be an excellent buy.  The single disclaimer is that the game only supports play for 3-4 people; if you wanted 5-6 players to play you would have to buy the expansion to go along with the game.
B0013ND30M|4.0|this transaction went very well, i got my DVD in a timely manner and have already enjoyed watching it.
B001AUEMFS|5.0|I think this Grammy winning song is interesting and uniqe because it blends classical music with modern day music.Rock on Coldplay!!
B000002UAI|4.0|Compared to some of their albums, no, this isn't the best of their work. Beatles for Sale is still a good album to buy. It may not have as many strong tracks as others, this still has some great songs (I'll Follow the Sun). There are also some really good songs that aren't famous, such as Honey Don't. Overall, looking back, this is a really good album. It just feels like it is missing something that their other albums had.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|I can't put into words how happy I am that this reunion came to be. The band was great..We all have to appreciate the fact that ever since Cream broke up, it was only on occasion that each member played in bands with just 3 musicians..i.e. Most of  the members band's had Keyboards, Rythum guitars, etc. My point is, for a great musician like Clapton, he had to resort back to doing all the guitar work, keeping the sound full, as a result of playing both \\"lead\\" and \\"Rythum\\". In any event, a wonderful job!!<br /><br />My only regret is that Clapton stuck to a strat for the entire concert, as opposed to using other guitars that he had played in Cream, such as a Les Paul, SG, Firebird, Explorer, etc. This is what I observed in NYC, at the Madison Square Garden concert. Even though he emulated the sounds pretty well, It would have been interesting to see him play the others...Anyway, all in all it was beautiful sight!
B000YPUF9W|3.0|Not as good as the first two Resident Evil movies, but entertaining.  If you liked the first two you will like this one, and if you haven't seen the first two start with those first before you watch this one.
B001ED7C58|4.0|Some of the songs on the soundtrack are really good, which make up for the songs I don't care for as much. My only complaint is that I didn't find out until after purchasing this from Amazon that if you get it from iTunes there are additional songs.
B000ZLFALI|4.0|Across the Universe is literally a beautiful movie and something every Beatles fan will enjoy wathing. The plot pulls you in, but fans will be waiting to see which song they use next. The reason this didn't get a perfect score is because of the story. I sometimes had a hard time following it, but luckily, this film doesn't need a story to be great. It has some brilliant visuals and songs that will have you dancing if you love the Beatles. The style of most of the songs are changed, but it still has the \\"Fab Four Feel\\" to them. Beatles fans, you need to see this movie. To me, this is the Beatles version of Pink Floyd's The Wall. Classic!
B0000035E7|5.0|Great HEAVY ROCK cd. Nirvana was truly a great rock band, forget \\"Teen Spirit\\" for awhile, the \\"grunge\\" label and hype-they rocked, and Kurt was a great pure songwriter. This is beer can rock at it's best. I bet John Lennon would have loved Kurt's vocals, especially the (primal) screams. Jam packed with killer guitar riffs, tight and efficient pop melodies, killer hard rock-punk gems like \\"Scoff\\", \\"Negative Creep\\", \\"Floyd The Barber\\" and the funked out cover of \\"Love Buzz\\" are awesome. Nirvana's first album remains a stone cold classic, and one of the greatest debut records ever. Right up there with Cheap Trick's first or the first Doors album. Believe it!  Bleach delivers the goods from start to finish. Recommended for anyone who likes to ROCK OUT.
B00003W8NM|5.0|First of all I love this movie, you should get the cheap dvd edition unless you consider yourself a true fan of the movie in which case this is the edition for you.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This is easily and by far my favorite book in the series. It's a little long for my taste, but I read it in a matter of a few days. Stephanie Meyer did a great job setting the scenes and describing the events that happened. Especially after seeing Twilight the movie, you can picture the events in your head while you're reading it. The only thing that made me sad is the end of the saga. I'm hoping she'll find a way to make another one!
B000002UAF|5.0|\\"A Hard Day's Night\\" is a treasure of pure music gold. Some of the Beatles best work is definitely in this album and  it all still sounds great. You can pick any song on this album and it is just as phenomenal as the last. How many albums can you say that about? I can't think of many other bands that have albums where every single song is great. This record is just proof that you can't have too many hits. Fantastic job and also a great movie
031606792X|5.0|quick delivery and book in good shape. also order book 3 which came quick also.
B001GQO50I|5.0|Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's The Doors! Who gives a rip if these aren't the master or first generation recordings of these shows. Leave that crap between the parties that actually have skin in the game. It's still a snapshot in time of a band at a very nascent, but very experimental and hungry stage, and it floored me. It's like whining about your favorite author being in a ragged old paperback instead of a collector's edition slick covered hardback. It's contents are still the same, so enjoy the f'ing thing. Seriously, some people have too much time on their hands. Get this version or get some bootleg version. Either way, just enjoy.
1594201927|1.0|If you believe that Milton Friedman and Augusto Pinochet are great 20th century heroes worthy of being worshipped; that hedge funds etc can cure all of the world's economic woes and you have a fondness for revisionist history written as being real, you will be very comfortable with this book.
B0000542D2|5.0|A day in the life of the Beatles, or so this film would have you believe since that is the premise of the film. Whether their lives were always this exciting or not, this movie is just great fun (especially for Beatles fans). The fab four's acting isn't the best, but come on, IT'S THE BEATLES! So, we can definitely forgive the one or two scenez where you can't help bt snicker. The script itself is actually funny and the soundtrack is nothing short of amazing. The end of the film when the Beatles finally play their concert is nothing short of iconic. Overall, a classic film that you have to see!

B000R8YC18|4.0|The opening images of the yellow taxi cab moving slowly through clouds of steam, seems an authentic vision of the city as netherworld, a landscape of gaudy nightmares... Travis himself is an unnerving combination of psychopath and naive innocent, a victim whose attempts to put the World to Rights produce yet more victims...<br /><br />Like other troubled heroes of the era, Travis is an ex-Marine, working nights as a New York taxi driver, observing with increasing disgust the human flotsam that comes into his cab... His attempts at human contact are a failure... An icy political worker whom he takes on a date (Cybil Shepherd) is repelled by his taste of porno films... He tries to rescue Iris, a teenage hooker (Jodie Foster), but increasingly his mind is under tension, and, prevented in his attempt to assassinate a Presidential candidate, he murders Iris' pimp Sport (Harvey Keitel) and a client in an orgy of what he intends a redemptive violence...<br /><br />Scorsese's film: a study of urban alienation, and a restless, fluid camera contributed to a view of New York as hell on earth, and mirrored the protagonist's growing insanity...
0765310015|5.0|There is a unique perspective used by Mr. Erikson to tell this tale which has me completely hooked.  Take diverse characters, loosely organized around two factions, the Malazan and the Free Cities whom are at war.  Add in powerful magic, that is NOT used by every other character in the book and while relating the story from several characters in successive chapters, read tantalizing tidbits referencing events that have been hundreds of thousands of years in the making.  Oh, add in some meddling gods, and implications that there are ancient magics (in this case, \\"Warrens\\") about to be re-discovered, all the while having been hinted from the outset that the Malazan Empire is about to collapse, leading to a potential Dark Age.  It is this over-arching sense of history in the making, which is compelling as you read the action sequences and perceptions of the many characters.  While this is not a series to be enjoyed casually, it is huge in scope and is worth the effort to keep track of the various characters.       Based on my own experience, very carefully read the first two chapters.  If you can understand what has happened up to that point, you can handle the additional characters as they are presented.         I also have enjoyed all the major characters thus far.  Personalities are still developing, but as with actual people, there are good and bad traits of each.  Its easy to sympathize in part to some degree with each of the characters, which to me is a sign that Mr. Erikson is a skillful writer.  He also lays out the setting for each character sequence without being overly wordy, which I appreciate.       In conclusion, this is a highly enjoyable book, although it must be read with care.  There are no cliches in this story, so if you are looking for a fresh fantasy tale, look no further.

B00062RCBW|5.0|This is an EXCELLENT boxed set.  Star Trek TNG is the best show EVER!  If you are a die hard Star Trek fan and don't have this then you aren't a die hard fan.  If you love sci-fi and have never seen Star Trek TNG in all it's entirety then you haven't experienced one of the best sagas in sci-fi.    Be wary of cheap knock-offs and the newer individual boxed set.  I've heard the newer boxed set has cheap construction and the DVDs come loose and move around in the packaging.  This is 100% unacceptable for something that costs $200+.  The boxed set with multiple boxes is very well made and the DVDs stay put and never get scratched.  I've had mine for 2 years now and the DVDs are like new.  Even the ones I watch time and again:    Yesterday's Enterprise  Inner Light  Damok  Future Imperfect  Neutral Zone  Best of Both Worlds  Hero Worship    The list goes on and on.  The only thing bad about Star Trek TNG is that it ended.
B000059GEI|3.0|The film was, perhaps, the splashiest of the year's musicals... It dealt with the joys, loves and heartaches experienced by a vaudeville family called the Donahues (spending their lives singing and dancing and touring) with Merman and Dailey as mother and father, and Ray, Gaynor and O'Connor as their talented offspring...<br /><br />All of them get to perform a large catalog of new and old songs by Irving Berlin in sumptuous arrangements, beautiful settings and on a big Hippodrome extravaganza...<br /><br />Daily and Merman hit the top; O'Connor--who had liked to build a barbed-wire fence around Marilyn--did it Scottish and came with some fine dances; Gaynor's love was dancing... and she was really cute; and while Ray got some thinking to do, he sells a very beautiful song (\\"If You Believe\\").<br /><br />Marilyn (appearing after 29 minutes screening) was deliciously charming, seducing and very appealing... She sang \\"After You Get What You Want\\" and \\"Lazy,\\" and did that tropical version of 'Heat Wave.'
B001L5SXQG|5.0|Good album.... really liked Queen of Supermarket, Kingdom of Days, Workin of a Dream.  Can't wait to see if he performs these on tour.
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|In many ways, The Illusionist manages to be what most movies only want to be: great entertainment. It's refreshing to see a movie that is a joy to watch because of excellent direction, beautiful cinematography, wonderful acting, and a compelling story. And it's an adult movie too, with grownup actors behaving like grownups. Not a single teenager in the whole film. How wonderful to not be bombarded with immature hardbodies and ridiculous amounts of unconvincing computer effects.<br />One major issue I have, though, is with some major plot holes in the script. The trick performed at the Prince's mansion with a sword the sticks to the floor is never explained, and I honestly can't imagine an explanation that would make sense. A strong magnet attached to the ceiling of the room below, removed at the last minute by an accomplice? This might work, but the prince and his staff would have had to have been in on it, which obviously isn't the case.<br />Also, and this is a major problem, (SPOILER ALERT) since the ghosts that Eisenheim contacts end up not being ghosts at all, how could he possibly be performing these tricks? it would be one thing if these \\"apparitions\\" were limited to the stage, but one of them walks through the theatre, past the police chief (who runs his hand through the \\"ghost\\"), and onto the stage. This could not possibly be a film projection. What explanation could there possibly be? None that I know of, and none is provided.<br />Still, despite these issues, and the fact that I was not much surprised by the surprise ending, this film is an absolute joy. Why can't there be more Hollywood movies made for intelligent, adult audiences?
B000089Q9G|3.0|\\"Three Colors Blue\\" is the first part of Polish director Krzysztof Kieslowski's Three Colors trilogy... \\"Blue\\" is set in France, \\"White\\" in Poland and \\"Red\\" in Switzerland, but all production was based in France... Not only are the colors of the trilogy those of the French national flag; the original intention was meditation on the ideals of the French Revolution: freedom, equality and fraternity... This suggests a political dimension to the work... But though like most Polish filmmakers Kieslowski had his difficulties with the Polish Communist system, its collapse by the early 1990s meant that he was not only free to work where he pleased, but liberated from the necessity for his films to engage directly in the political process...<br /><br />In \\"Three Colors Blue\\" Juliette Binoche plays a woman whose husband and daughter are killed in a car crash... Overcome by melancholy, she progressively withdraws from life, depriving herself of possessions and refusing relationships, a state of mind conveyed in part by the director's subtle use of color blue... But eventually she is able to accept the attentions of a lover and even to offer friendship to another woman who is pregnant with her husband's child... Finally, she completes the piece of music which her husband has been commissioned to write...<br /><br />The result is a work that has less in common with the Polish 'Cinema of moral concern' of the late 1970s than with the tradition of the mainstream European art cinema, in its concerns with alienation and the loss of feeling, countered by the transcendent power of love...

B001L5SXQG|5.0|This new album seems to have divided the critics. I belong to the group who think this is a truly great album - the one Bruce album I have enjoyed most since the River. There are similarites with the River also in the diversity of styles and some(for Bruce) light lyrics and poptunes.  What makes this album stand out for me is the quality of the songs. It is obvious that Bruce the songwriter has a flow right now. What Love can do, Kingdom of days and the Wrestler are only three examples of songs that belong to the best Bruce has ever written. The epic and fun Outlaw Pete is also a true gem and a track that will be a monster live. I think that the E-streetband has matured and play now more with nuances than muscles - a thing that suites these delicate new songs  All in all one of Bruce Springsteens top five an album that deserves repeated listenings

B001LF4IA6|5.0|I've been reading the reviews to Bruce's latest entry into his impresive catalogue.  I'll be honest I enjoy the big sound of this album along with the post production compression, it reminds me of my days growing up listening to Bruce on vinyl.  To be over critical of the production of this album would be easy, but it's easier to hear the incredible wordplay and melodies that Bruce and the E-Street bring to the table.  I was pleasantly suprised by this one!
B00164IV9G|4.0|Hey, you...stop sitting by the phone waiting for him to call...get up and go watch this movie!<br /><br />I have to admit, I'm not much of a rom-com watcher. Unlike others of its ilk, though, this flick wisely admits that relationships aren't all rainbows and butterflies, but that they are complicated, confusing, messes that aren't necessarily all sorted out by the time the credits roll.<br /><br />The premise is simple enough - the film claims:<br /><br />\\"If a guy says he'll call and doesn't, he's not in the hospital with a broken number-dialing finger; he's just not that into you\\".<br /><br />After a  mediocre first date with pre-recession real estate agent Conor (Kevin Connolly), the film's main protagonist Gigi (Ginnifer Goodwin), over zealous for date success and naively optimistic as ever, is certain that she has found Mr. Right. But when he doesn't call, her friends (Jennifer Aniston as Beth and Jennifer Connelly as Janine) comfort her with assurances of his interest and case studies of how they knew someone who knew someone in the exact situation - and it worked out for them, of course!<br /><br />Not that Beth or Janine are living it up in the mansion of romantic bliss, mind you. Aniston's character has been living with Neil (Ben Affleck) for seven years, and for five of the seven, she's been dying to know why he won't pop the question. Wholly against the institution of marriage, though, Neil says that he's totally committed to her and he doesn't need a piece of paper to prove...yadda, yadda, yadda.<br /><br />Connelly's character Janine on the other hand is married. Happily? Not so much. Ben's (Bradley Cooper) baby blues are soon tempted toward blonder waters when he meets Anna (Scarlet Johansson) at a convenience store one fine evening; how convenient. Too bad he's married, he reasons.<br /><br />Drew Barrymore easily plays Mary, Anna's friend. Her role is pretty forgettable; but then she did spend most of her time producing the movie.<br /><br /> Justin Long plays Alex, the woman conquering bar owner who decides to school Gigi in the thinking of men, no feelings spared.<br /><br />For the most part the story lines are tied together in believable ways and it's interesting to watch just how they're all connected - kind of like 6 degrees of separation.<br /><br />A tough pill to swallow:<br /><br />Perhaps too realistic at times, \\"He's Just\\" exposes the well-intentioned way we women attempt to comfort our spurned friends - not with assurances that despite her many attractive qualities, the guy just isn't interested for one reason or another.

0312427999|5.0|This book is required reading by every student of economics.  It describes in painstaking detail the interrelationships between academia-politicians-multi-national corporations and how they have created shocks that fueled unconscionable profits for companies and wealth for politicians throughout the world the past 60 years, while literally stealing the wealth of the nations and saddling its people with huge debt.  Published in 2007, it accurately predicts the results of the housing crisis and stock market crash - - that the US government (others as well), will provide assets of the country to the very companies that caused the shock through bailout and stimulus funds, which are debts that will eventually be paid by the citizens. Thus the US wealth has been given to these companies.  As a former believer in the free market concept, Naomi has opened my eyes to its results - - the human fatal flaw - greed.
0786888628|4.0|An excellent history starring the figures of the Korean war, from leaders like Truman and McArthur to squad leaders on the front line.  All play significant roles in this book and in the war.    The book gives an insider's look at the machinations in Tokyo and Washington as well as the tactics of the front line.  There are heroes and villains, brilliant strategists and egomaniacal fools.  All of them together give us an overall look at the first year of the war, before it settled down into a slugging match between two superpowers.    Halberstam employs richly researched information, both about the geography of the war and the individuals who fight it.  He pulls no punches when he tells of blunders by the higher-ups, while at the same time empathizing with the soldiers who not merely endure that first bitterly cold winter, but excel in spite of those in command.    The author's long-winded sentence structure sometimes causes me to have to stop and reread, but overall, it is a brilliantly written history of a war few people can or want to remember.  Halberstam does both the war and those who fought it justice.

B00005N9CV|5.0|It's very rare that I would use the word 'perfect' in any description, but this disc comes close enough for comfort. The song selection, the arrangements, Ms Krall's performances are all absolutely superb. Along with Trane's ballad disc & the orignal Getz/Gilberto collaboration, one of the best discs of the genre, ever, whether classified as jazz ballads or Bossa Nova.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|Great product, simple to set up. Rather than use the edge clamp, I drilled a small hole in my desk to use the through-clamp. I think it looks better this way. (But both clamps are included in the box, and easy to switch out.)    Cleared a LOT of desk space for me, compared to the old LCD stand. I can push my keyboard back under the monitor and have plenty of space to work, or push back the LCD, remove the keyboard, and have an almost completely clear desktop!    It reminds me of when I switched from an old CRT to my first LCD and marveled at all the new space I had...    I ordered a second arm, which I plan to modify to hold a laptop I use as a secondary computer.    I shopped around, and other LCD arms were from $125 on up through $350 or more. For $65-ish, this is a great deal.    The one problem: My Hannspree monitor needed to use an adapter plate to connect to the arm. The plate was included, but the included screws were too short. $1.29 at Home Depot and I was good to go:     FYI I used 4mm- 0.7 x 12mm hex bolts (x4)
B001JNNDGA|5.0|The movie is by far the BEST film of our generation. It has a great script, excellent acting and cimetography, and most important his wonderful message for all mankind.    You'll be amazed what Mel Gibson add to this film: a Raven, Relics ,an Earthquake...    I'm so glad this film will be out on blu-ray, which comes with DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, Video resolution: 1080p, Aspect ratio: 2.40:1, and Subtitles: English and Spanish.
0060882611|5.0|We purchased this book for our soon to be first Granddaughter.  It arrived on time, but the seal on the front was damaged.  Didn't affect the book, but didn't want to use it for our intended purpose.  So, I emailed Amazon, asking for another seal, or even offered to buy another book.  Almost immediately, I received return instructions for the book, and a notice that a new book was on the way.  It arrived a few days later, is perfect, and I mailed the original back.  This is what Customer Service should be.  I've used Amazon in the past, and will continue, as I know I'm dealing with a reputable company.
B001JNNDBA|5.0|I went to best buy today and this release is not only a 2 disc release(amazon says 1 disc), but also has both the director's cut and the regular version of the movie so Amazon's listing is either wrong, not updated or they have a different version.
B001GKJ2FW|5.0|\\"Mama Mia\\" is an entertaining fluffy, fizzy flick that will certainly not tax your brain. I've seen it three times on stage so was prepped for the movie version. It was fun to watch the way they movie-masters opened up the stage version to the panoramic natural setting of the beautiful Greek islands although the expansiveness didn't always click. Originally the musical's creators took some catchy Abba songs and wove them together into a plot-line that was above-average or more sophisticated than is usual when musical-makers start with a canon of songs.<br /> In Blu-Ray the Greek island settings are gorgeous. Meryl Streep is exceptionally good in this version as is Pierce Brosnan. Neither one comes over very well in the CD soundtrack when you can't see them acting because their voices can't carry the day alone. The entire cast does a creditable job.<br />Some of the musical numbers are way over-produced and over-peopled. Less would have been better. The early number \\"Money, Money, Money\\" is way over the top. The yacht scenes bear no reference to the island life and are a phony dream sequence. Some numbers are hectic, frenetic and seem like they're filmed in fast motion. There are too many extras bouncing up and down to the Abba beat and overpopulating the screen. Too many Greek peasant women and armies of dancers come advancing off the screen and into your lap. Everyone is dancing their hearts away.<br />Audiences unused to the unreality of the old-fashioned movie musicals are going to be overwhelmed by the overkill. We have forgotten how to suspend disbelief when it comes to the openness of musicals. Breaking into song has become bizarre for those unused to the old genre.<br />Meryl Streep uses her particular acting skills to put over certain numbers particularly \\"The Winner Takes It All.\\"<br />It seems foolish to quibble about a movie that has a lot of laughs, burlesque turns, snappy popsicle music, a pretty good plot, and keeps you entertained.<br />The movie has a vitality, a joie de vivre that is certainly good for these hard economic times. Just don't expect Sondheim or Leonard Bernstein. The DVD is crammed with extra features for those who have the time. This is a movie for those who crave sheer exuberance.vivre that is certainly good for these hard economic times. Just don't expect Sondheim or Leonard Bernstein.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|This movie was wonderful. After I saw Pride and Prejudice I did not think I could find another I liked as well. This one may have even surpassed P&P in my favorites. It was recommended to me and I recommend it as well!
B001ECDVZE|3.0|\\"Sin City\\" is a black and white film recreation of Frank Miller's b and w graphic novels with every so often a vivid swath of colored eyes, blood, or some villainous single color. Someone's blue eyes will appear in stark color and thrust themselves at the viewer. The stories are grim, gritty, morose, tough-minded. There's plenty of action, violence, and the scenes are set up to resemble the comic book world, a close approximation of what you would see in a graphic novel. Quentin Tarantino was involved as a guest director so you know what to expect. Computer enhancement was used. Many of the scenes are evocations of the graphic novel drawings--turning the static page into the kinetic world.<br /> There are really three stories melded together, each section with its own hero played by Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, and Clive Owen. The first and third parts come together near the end.<br /> The movie will make you uncomfortable, queasy, squirrely at times with its gritty realism, humorlessness, and starkness. The flick doesn't let up and give you a chance to breathe but keeps on its violent inevitable avenging pace. It's a melodrama gone spastic and ballistic. The avalanche of fateful action goes rolling on and buries the viewer who just hopes to come up for an occasional breath of fresh air. It's a claustrophobic, insular, crushing atmosphere.<br /> We're lucky all movies aren't made at this breakneck pace and with this intensitry, grittiness, and sense of futile inevitability. It's crime and punishment, avenging forces, and anti-heroes fighting against incredible odds. A movie for people with specialized tastes, but a worthy experiment.
0345495004|2.0|I am quick to blame Mamah for leaving a husband who pursued her for her intellect, took in her unmarried sister and orphaned niece, built her dream house, let her do what ever she wanted and going off with a pompous jerk like FLW to wait around until Frankie  was good and ready to visit her. However, maybe the blame is on the author for not having sufficient info  or imagination to flesh out a real woman instead of a weakling who sits and takes the guff that FLW heaps on her. It's a very long, drawn out book that really does not give us any insight or revelations to those who know the unhappy ending.

B001CC7PP8|5.0|There is nothing I can say about the movie that has not been said already, If you don't know by now it is a masterpiece.<br /><br />I am writing this in reference to the quality of the DVD's that are included in this 2 disc set. One of my pet peeves is having perfect DVD's & CD's (If you buy them new they should look brand new). So every DVD/CD/GAME/Blu-ray release I buy, I carefully inspect to my satisfaction. These Psycho DVD's have some circular scuffs that go around the discs. I even saw a fingerprint on one of them. I quickly returned the 2 disc set to the store I purchased it from & they gave me another copy (the last one). The same thing, but this time a little worse. I them returned it a second time. Since it was the only copy they had left, an exception was made to give me a refund.<br />I then go to another retailer that carried this Psycho special edition disc set and bought one. Guess what, the same scuffs and a couple of fingerprints. I traded it out for another copy just to find the same scuffs on the surface. I finally gave up & kept a set that was not so bad.<br />My complaint to Universal is : WHERE IS THE QUALITY CONTROL?? We collectors spend good money on your (and other companies) releases and we should be getting discs without scuffs, fingerprints, scratches, etc.<br /><br />I have noticed since Blu-ray & HD (R.I.P.) movies have been released, that standard DVD's have been getting cheaply made, i.e. warped/wrinkled looking paper used for the artwork/cover insert, cheap flimsy cases, scratched or scuffed discs. Almost like the companies don't care anymore about quality.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|When i saw planet earth go i sale i immediately broke down and bought it.  It it by far the best nature documentary out there.  This version is also the David Attenborough narrated version from the BBC, which i prefer to the American version with Sigourney Weaver.  The only real downside is a lack of special features in the set.
0545128285|1.0|I love the Harry Potter series.  I found it fascinating, fun, and surprising.  I was probably expecting too much from this.  The stories are dull and boring.  I really hope she puts more work into her next effort.
B000JBXXZ4|1.0|I received \\"Make Yourself\\" and \\"Morning View\\" for Xmas presents and I was blown away the first time I listened to \\"Make Yourself.\\"  I never knew that Incubus was *that* awesome.  I listened to those two albums almost every day.  So I was excited when I was finally able to buy \\"S.C.I.E.N.C.E\\", \\"A Crow...\\" and \\"Light Grenades\\" this past week.  \\"S.C.I.E.N.C.E\\" blew me away even more than \\"Make Yourself\\" so I had high hopes for the others.  \\"A Crow...\\" was ok, but not good.  And \\"Light Grenades\\" is plain terrible.  I must've gotten a different album than everyone else because I simply canNOT understand how people could think this is a great album.  The melodies are sappy pop song melodies, not rock melodies.  The intelligent lyrics with social commentary and self-awareness are gone in favor of lame love song lyrics.  Brandon Boyd's voice doesn't even sound like the same one from the earlier works.  Hearing \\"Light Grenades\\" has just about ruined Incubus for me because I can't forget what they've become while listening to the good albums.  I wish I could erase the memory of \\"Light Grenades\\" from my mind.
0316010669|2.0|I decided to read this book because Outliers was not yet in at my library.  With its low rating on Amazon, I should have known it wouldn't be worth my while.  There are some neat stories in there and interesting ideas.  My main problem is that the book claims to change the way we will think yet gives no instructions to do so.  It just gives a few examples on when intuition worked out really well and when it lead to unfortunate consequences.  Probably won't read Outliers now.
B001H9MWW2|5.0|Bought this album for my wife and she put it in my car on a trip...I haven't given it back.
0385751893|5.0|I loved this book.  Although it was sad, I really enjoyed the perspective from a little boy's view as the narrator of the book.  A great book for bookclubs and to share with teenagers.
B000000OMP|5.0|The sound quality of this CD is phenomenal.  I always play it loud.  It is a classic that never gets old.  Straight ahead rock and roll.  Brings back lots of memories.
0385340990|4.0|This is largely the creed I read by and so, I suspect, it is what kept me engaged by this novel even though some aspects of it just didn't really work for me.  But I feel no need to destroy the magic by dissecting its parts: this is a work of fiction and I enjoyed it as such.<br /><br />In January 1946, Juliet Ashton is looking for a topic for her next book.  Quite by chance, she receives a letter from Dawsey Adams of Guernsey who has acquired a book which once belonged to Juliet.  And so begins a correspondence which becomes a series of correspondences and then becomes the genesis of a book.  The writing engaged me: ` My farm is a lot of work and I did not want to spend time reading about people who never were, doing things they never did.'  I know so many people who can relate to this.  Or consider: `Marcus Aurelius was an old woman - forever taking his mind's temperature.'  Indeed.<br /><br />I was hooked: so engrossed in the views of individuals on the island that I really didn't notice aspects that would usually irritate me intensely.  The epistolary style seemed appropriate both to the times and the people, whereas some aspects of the ease of travel did not.  In this case, it was the journey rather than the destination that mattered and no two people undertake exactly the same journey.<br /><br />This is a book which draws me to want to explore the history more completely.  It is also a book that reminds me that both creativity and heroism can take many different forms.<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smith
B0015OKWL2|3.0|I enjoyed this film, although you can figure out the ending about half-way through.  I really enjoyed Pacino and DeNiro, but they're too old for these characters.  Pacino gives a flambouant performance, which is fun, but that you only see when a director has no control over him!  He literally steals the show with his mugging.  In fact, he's about the only actor in the film that seems to be enjoying himself.
B000BJS4TO|5.0|I received my order in a timely fashion and was not disappointed in the quality.
0316017922|4.0|Malcolm Gladwell manages to turn research books into stories that are engaging and exciting. It's a real gift. In \\"Outliers,\\" Gladwell supposes that there's no innate \\"talent\\" gene; that the Bill Gates' and Wayne Gretzkys and Robert Oppenheimers of the world are at least as much the beneficiaries of chance as they are of some talent that is so far beyond the rest of humanity. What's surprising is the deluge of research Gladwell trots out to support these assertions.<br /><br />Birthdates and next-level athletic cutoffs,what junior high and high school had a computer terminal, the culture of a kid's home life... they're all not just factors, but apparently DECIDING factors in determining how successful a given person is at a given craft or skill.<br /><br />The only reason I held back one star is because Gladwell doesn't go very far at all in trying to suggest how to harness his research. A terrific follow-on would be a study on how to use this data to CREATE outliers... wildly successful individuals.
1576754227|1.0|This would be a great book, if it were purported to be about ways to use your time productively and achieve your goals in the quickest, most efficient manner.    That isn't what it's advertised at, so it's not a great book.  In fact, I found it utterly useless.  I bought this book because I'm a procrastinator.  I have a lot of things that I need to do and instead, I'm writing reviews on Amazon and reading books designed to help me stop procrastinating.  This book is all about identifying your goals, removing any obstacles to achieving those goals, and finally learning to ignore all the things you do on a daily basis that aren't really necessary.    Where, in that description, does it say anything about \\"teaching yourself to just stop putting things off and DO IT\\"?  I don't have a time management problem, I have a motivation problem.  I could follow every one of the steps in this book and at the end instead of having a giant list of useless tasks that I don't feel like doing, I'd have a smaller list of more important and meaningful tasks that I don't feel like doing.    This book will NOT help you stop procrastinating.  The author seems to have misinterpreted \\"procrastinate\\" as meaning \\"not having enough time to do the things that are necessary to achieve your goals, and not having an understanding of your goals.\\"  I know what my goals are.  I know how to reach them.  I know exactly what to do and I also know what I don't need to do.      I'll just do it tomorrow.
B001F290E4|5.0|Seal did a great job of remaking on this CD.  It is a must have for a different rendition of music.
B000002MJ0|1.0|This is the worst crap ever. No talent, no ideas...just noise. No melody, not even a mood...just children playing around on electric instruments without a clue. What a shame that the people who listen to this...crap...waste their time, when there is so much good music to listen to: blues, r&b, classical, jazz, rock, punk, alternative, country, etc. This is nothing music for people who think they know what is hip but really know nothing.
B0019M06JS|5.0|Eliane Elias is a consumate artist.  She is very musical and always has the most excellent musicians on her reoordings.  This CD is rapidly becoming one of my favorites.  If you like bossa nova with subtle jazz vocals, you will dig this one.  Eliane has a wonderful group of musicians on this CD and they know how to deliver the bossa nova!

B0007MWZEK|5.0|[[ASIN:B0007MWZEK Cordless Swivel Sweeper - As Seen on TV]]  It is a quick pick-up instead of dragging out the large regular vacuum. It is lightweight and for me with Fibromyalgia, means less pain and I can clean-up more often.  Picks up everything on tile, linoleum and hardwood floors; which is great since I have 3 dogs and plenty of dust bunnies.  I feel my home is cleaner due to the Cordless Swivel Sweeper.
0199535566|3.0|This book is appropriately titled because the focus of the story is about social prejudices and preconceptions. The main character struggles to find her place in the world while dealing with social pressures and expectations. She falls in love with a man that is from a different rank, so the commentary on society ends up being wrapped in a love story. If you like British literature from that time period, you will love this story. I think it is a good book, but it's not really my particular genre.
B001ED7C58|1.0|this thing has hardly any music composed for it. its mostly just a bunch of slow sad songs already written and used in a hundred other movies already. unless you're starting a collection or something then its really not worth the money.
0451529308|1.0|This story is so incredibly melodramatic it's not even funny. Jo is such an unlikeable character. She's arrogant, fickle, and a complete drama queen. I was frustrated the whole time I read this book. I was hoping that there would at least be a good ending to this story, but the ending was the worst part of it. So Disappointing.
B000HWZ4A2|4.0|This is a classic film w/classic movie stars.  Nothing else needs to be said other than it is based on the life of Frank Loyd Wright, the architect that broke the mold.  Patricia Neal is stunning in the film but the real winner of the acting award should go to Raymond Massey for his fine performance of the newspaper mogul. Gary Cooper plays Howard Roark, the man who wouldn't conform.  Great stuff!!

B000Y8GFY8|5.0|I discovered Goldfrapp on \\"London Live,\\" an excellent concert show on the late MOJO network. Somehow, Goldfrapp flies under the radar of popular music, not quite getting the attention it deserves. I hope other people discover this talented duo and give them a listen. This album continues their excellent production, but I would recommend starting with Supernature or Black Cherry.

B000001FW9|5.0|Gentle Giant's first album was a great debut album showing promise, but they were sure quick in making a much more complex, not-so-easy to get into second album in 1971 with Acquiring the Taste. You have to bear in mind what Yes and Genesis were doing, not to mention King Crimson who were still in their Mellotron-laden symphonic phase (despite Lizard having a jazzier feel with horns added), and lesser known groups like Beggars Opera, Gracious, Cressida (all three labelmates of Gentle Giant), and Spring who still basically stuck to song-based progressive rock whose music wasn't too much more complex than the Moody Blues (these groups are also great, but don't expect GG complexities).    \\"Pantagruel's Nativity\\" starts off with some synth work from Kerry Minnear, and I believe Phil Shulman sings on this piece (he tends to have a high pitch similar to Kerry Minnear so sometimes you can get them two mistakened). He also gives some nice Mellotron work (he uses the rather lesser-known M300 on this album). There's some extended passages with horns being used from Phil Shulman. \\"Edge of Twilight\\" is a rather mystical sounding piece with some rather quirky passages and some elaborate vocal harmonies. \\"The House, The Street, The Room\\" is a harder-edged song, and Derek Shulman handles the lead vocals, as he often does on these more rocking piece (it seems Derek Shulman prefers more rocking pieces, while Kerry Minnear likes the more medieval influenced stuff). The title track is basically a synth piece, mass overdubbed Moog (it sounds like a modular Moog, but I'm not sure, although it's pretty obvious that Kerry Minnear used a Minimoog on Three Friends, Octopus, and the albums to follow). \\"Wreck\\" features some bass work, more great vocal harmonies, and a medieval-influenced passage where Tony Visconti provides some recorders. \\"The Moon is Down\\" is another song similar to \\"Edge of Twilight\\", while \\"Black Cat\\" has some nice use of violin. That's a really nice piece. \\"Plain Truth\\"is more rocking, with Derek Shulman handling lead once again, then Ray Shulman gives out an extended violin solo.    I remembered when I bought this album back in 1995, I had to listen to it many times to get it (it took me quite fewer listens to get into Three Friends, as that was a more accessible album). I really think Gentle Giant's uncompromising style was what seemed to have rubbed rock critics the wrong way (the band were never exactly a rock critic's darling). After a few listens, I come to the conclusion that this is truly one of their best albums, and it comes highly recommended!
B000W7JWUA|4.0|Settlers of Catan is a very addictive game, great for a night with friends and a couple of bottles of wine.<br /><br />The game is very competitive, easy to learn but still can get to be somewhat complex (which is a good thing, I think).<br /><br />The \\"trading\\" part of the game is specially good, and lets you build good strategies.<br /><br />100% recommended to anybody that wants to change TV and Sunday afternoon movies for something new.

B000002J1M|4.0|I have heard Genesis and seen them from the beginning to the great loss  of Peter Gabriel,Steve Hackett ,then finally Phil Collins.This album(CD)  has also been my favorite Genesis album. Again being a bass player,when I first got this album(yes record!) I was blown away with those great intricate parts and especially those bass pedals by Rutherford! But  with this album at that time there was so much going on it was hard to hear separation and true clarity. Now you have to check on this re-mix of this CD. It was re-mixe Nov.2008,with the \\"new stereo mix\\". Wow ! makes a great deal of difference. Separation clarity,my ears were elated! Way past ear candy,when you have heard this album as many times as i have then you hear something you have never heard before, a vocal harmony from  Phil or a guitar riff from Hackett that was seemed to be pushed into the mix.I listened to this on the way to work one day and heard \\"Horizons\\".  I almost had to stop the car,the chords were beautiful,pronounced,clear.You could hear Hackett moving his hands across  the fretboard of his guitar. I really miss this era of Genesis,they  were magical times. With this \\"new stero mix\\" I plan to buy the other   early ones and hope it sounds this good.Please go on that \\"journey again\\"  with this great band now with a fantastic sound.I always especially with this band,discover the old before going to the new. If you just bought the new Europe live Cd ,you are missing out in a lot of good music.I am sorry to say Collins could not \\"hit the high notes\\",so in this recording they lowered the tuning of the songs. I was highly disappointed,first they went on tour,instead of back to the studios for new material ,then tour their music. This CD I just bought for my collection. But go back and buy \\"One for the Vine\\",  Trick of the Tale\\",\\"Selling England by the Pound\\", \\"The Lamb\\" etc..  Man.its tough to grow old ,aint it though?
B0013FNC38|5.0|Jason Mraz is a creative genius.  His music cannot be defined by a single category.  His duet with Colby Calliet is lovely and I hope they do an entire record together someday. Thank you Mr. Mraz, you are an inspired poet and a charming live act.
B001M5UDGS|3.0|A kind of fun parody of the whole hero versus villian. I enjoyed it, wish I didn't pay for it but it was worth watching while extremely bored one afternoon.<br /> If you don't have anything else better to watch, this could sate that hunger for a few minutes.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I'm a Joss Whedon fan (Buffy, Firefly) and so when this came out I was anxious to see what he had come up with.  I was not disappointed.  This film is hilarious, and in my opinion it takes a certain amount of talent to write a musical for todays audience.  But to also present the cast and crew commentary in the form of a musical is genius.  It is an all around great production, and whether or not you are a Joss Whedon fan, I definitely recommend this DVD.
B001GZ6QBU|5.0|What can I say that can't really be found anywhere else? Not too sure but this installment of Batman was great and the Joker was phenomenal!
0439023483|5.0|This book was awesome! I've already read it 2 times, and I've only had it for about 2 weeks. It's completely different from most of the other books that have been coming out, which is refreshing. Although this book was rated for teenagers, I'm 26 years old, and I find myself thinking about what Suzanne Collins wrote all the time. The end of the book is a cliffhanger, stating \\"end of book 1.\\" I'll be on the look out for more from Suzanne Collins!!!

B001I82RVS|3.0|Don't expect the classy style of such films like Suicide Club or Another Heaven.  This is more Asian Anno-Noir (if that can be a description) that is meant to entertain with lots of (lots of) black-light hot glow red blood and cartoon style antics (which you gotta have with the idea of these mutations, so it works okay). And while I enjoyed the film, I wish I'd have rented first as I don't think I will re-visit it enough to justify the purchase and shipping.  I'm always leery of films that people put all these \\"OMG it's the next best thing to...whatever\\" and all in  caps and !! like they get paid by the keystroke..........so in this case as in any review...........beware.  (I think they own stock or work for the supplier, otherwise they just breed and type lots). The film is shock-shlock and meant to be, so if you like that you should enjoy this---but---if you are pinching pennies at the moment, give it a rent before you buy to see if this is just quite one you'll watch again very often.
B0011ZWOYS|5.0|All I can say this album is creative freedom to it's fullest. There is nowhere I mean nowhere on this album that his raw talents was completely surpressed. He was all over the place, this one of the first artists I have listened to and you can actually tell that he was high as hell. My fav track is Brooklyn Zoo. Just gotta love ODB
B000066C1N|5.0|I originally purchased this CD for the duet song featuring Bryan Adams and Sarah McLaughlin, \\"Don't Let Go\\" which is a beauty in itself.  I have since played the entire album and completely adore it.  The music is beautiful as well as Bryan Adams interpretation of the Stallion, Cimarron.  Hans Zimmer is a true genius with this soundtrack!!!<br /><br />Would strongly recommend!!!
B00122L1GC|5.0|If you're a DepecheMode fan I'm sure you'll agree this is one of the best CD's they've put out.   Their lyrics always have a meaning that goes so deep-or they do for me anyway.  Any DM fan will already have this in their collection.
0800177975|3.0|This movie has such a clever plot that never quite lives up to its potential, but does provide a few laughs and smiles along the way.<br /><br />I saw this movie in the theater when I was the same age as the young protagonist and I thought it was awesome! My how things have changed since those carefree days when a million cameos and lots of explosions could make up for terrible writing and weak direction.<br /><br />The Good: Tom Noonan as The Ripper is genuinely creepy and makes a great arch-foe for our Hero.  Jack Slater is a character with hilarious moments, especially when he calls himself, \\"Arnold Groundschmuger, the famous comedian\\". The spoof on the action genre is much funnier in retrospect than at the time of the film's release. Bridgette Wilson in cut-off jean shorts, 'nuff said.<br /><br />The Bad: Danny Madigan goes from being cute to annoying so many times it makes you wish Benedict would just shoot him already.  Once the movie crosses over into the real world and Jack's \\"crisis\\" with being a fictional character the movie loses its focus and gets to wrapped up in whatever moral it failed to get across to the audience.<br /><br />I would be willing to own this movie for the first hours worth of fun and comedy if not for the terrible pan & scan work that was done on the transfer (and I'm not shelling out $27.00 for the widescreen version).  Maybe someday when they release the LAH: Big Mistake Edition where we get an apologetic, film-roast of a commentary over a widescreen cut of the film, I'll fork over my dough, but until then: PASS!
B001CZVVWS|1.0|This potentially wonderful production has been ruined by inappropiate zooming, transitions, panning, close-ups of performers and even horns.  The video editing is dreadful and distracts from the beauty of the performers and the performance. This DVD could be used in a course for videographers and producers as an example of \\"How not to do it\\".
B00000F14B|5.0|Did you ever notice that Robert Preston never walks in this movie - he bounces and dances through every scene -eeee Gods!  Love this movie.  Dancing is fabulous, costumes are beautiful.  Excellent time
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I purchased this series with a bit of trepidation, due to so much \\"revisionist\\" history that seems to be in vogue these days.  However, I was pleasantly surprised at what I saw.  The acting is superb, and much of what is presented seems to correspond well with other historical books I have read.  The series holds one's interest from beginning to end--highly recommended.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Once again, Joss Whedon blows me away. Not only does he deliver with an amazing and funny main feature- the special features are just astounding as well. The musical commentary is just as funny as the movie itself and the ELE applications are a tribute to the creativity of the fans. This dvd is a must own for any Joss fan and I would recommend it to anyone who has a sense of humor!

B000W1YYEK|5.0|I bought the album when it first came out in 80' and have bought many cassettes and cd's throughout the years from wear and tear and I just downloaded again for my new computer.     This CD is requirement for my music collection. I am not a huge RUSH fan but the music on Permanent Waves sounds too good for mere mortals too create. This album will be looked at many years down the road much like Bach and Bethoven is right now.     Every Track Is Great -- The whole album builds until the last great track--Natural Science.    The only downside is only 6 songs, but thier all great so who cares.
080701429X|5.0|I have wanted to read this book for some time and finally I got around to it and I am so glad I did. The first part of the book describes the struggles of Frankl and prisoners in the concentration camps and puts you very much in the situation these people had to bear with.The author was able to find meaning even in the most terrible circumstances. The book is about making personal choices of how you want to define a situation and taking responsibility for the life that you give meaning to in each and every moment.    I realise now that when I am faced with a challenge I decide how I want to perceive it and to turn the challenge into an opportunity to grow and change as a person. When I see the TV news about how bad things are economically and the so called crisis in the world and then compare today´s events with the authors experiences in the death camps and how he found meaning in spite of it all - I know I can change my outlook and find opportunity in spite of what the media says.
B000PKG6TE|3.0|It is obvious at this point that what was once a stylish dirt of a sound, cultivated by all the distorted power-chord rock articulation by front-man Homme's electric skills, has run a bit dry. Good thing then, that at least half of EV avoids the sluggish onslaught by injecting a slightly more progressively metallic edge which accentuates the intoxicating ugliness that QOTSA do so well.

B0015AARJI|4.0|I have had this controller for about 4 months now and i still can't figure out a way to hold the controller without suffering from immense hand pain.  It's obvious that the controller wasn't even designed with American gamers in mind.  Sony, take a look at what your other competitors are doing with their controllers.  The wii controller is quite innovative and comfortable and the xbox 360's controller is quite accurate and also very comfortable to hold for hours.  Sony continues to only cater to the Japanese/Asian market and it shows in this grotesque 15 year old design.  The same damn controller for your last 3 consoles is a disgrace.  Yes, the controller looks good, has rumble, and is wireless, but that's all it has going for it these days.  My advice to Sony would be to just make a slightly bulkier controller (think the Logitech ps2) and fix the damn L2/R2 \\"triggers\\" so they aren't so slippery.  I still gave the controller four stars because it does what it advertises, but Sony should stop marketing their products towards only the Japanese markets and design a controller that is comfortable for all gamers of all ages.
B00005JGAB|5.0|This is the greatest punk album ever made. Defined the era. Saw them in June 1976 in NYC at Max's Kansas City. Changed my life, had never seen or heard anything like them before, blew my mind.
B001Q1QF2O|5.0|Lily Allen is one of my favorite artists of all time! She is so diverse and funny and amazingly talented! I fell in love with her debut cd [[ASIN:B000KG5EQE Alright, Still]] and I have anxiously awaited her followup album! It's Not Me, It's You has more than delivered!!! The music has changed a little and now has an electronic pop feel, instead of a ska pop feel. The new sound is absolutely brilliant and I love it! Lily worked on this sound with Greg Kurstin, who is one half of the amazing band The Bird and the Bee. If you like this album, check out the Bird and the Bee's new album [[ASIN:B001PE6OSC Ray Guns Are Not Just The Future]].    Every single song on the album is amazing and shines in it's own right! I can't pick a favorite because I love them all! This is sure to be one of the best albums on 2009 and it's only February!    Bottom Line: Buy this amazing sophomore album by Lily Allen! You will not regret it at all!!! :)
B0014I4KIK|5.0|Maybe I'm a little late to the party but the debut recording from Welsh born songstress Duffy has me blown away. Without being well acquainted in the deeper mysteries of gene splicing it is hard to imagine what could come from a mixture of Dusty Springfield, Nancy Sinatra, Marilyn McCoo, Shelby Lynne, Petula Clark, Rickie Lee Jones, Chrissie Hynde (or the chick who sang Girl from Ipanema) and believe it to be any more combustible or captivating than Duffy's auspicious coming out effort, Rockferry. Duffy has created a sound that I did not think possible in 2009 - sixties without satire.     You know the drill - new artist, one or two cuts are cool (if you're lucky) and the rest function as digital filler and/or make very smart home-made coasters. Duffy is the rare exception - every song on Rockferry grooves and/or shakes the house down with a sound that is reminiscent of others - but in the best way possible is completely new. Honestly, I have to admit that I was listening with such low expectations that as the album unspooled, the increasing odds of Duffy falling off the artistic cliff was certainly top-of-mind. It just never happened.    As for several of the other reviewers who seem very down on this record based on the overwhelming promotion that surrounded the release, I can only say that up until 72 hours ago, I had never heard of Duffy and am just reacting to the music without predjudice or prior conviction. On auditory evidence alone, Rockferry remains an amazing record and is brilliant from start to finish. Very highly recommended.
0671027344|1.0|Remember when this book was good and it was it was called \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\"?    The first 190 pages are well written.  The end is so contrived that you feel like you're watching an afternoon soap opera.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have to admit, there is a little hero worship involved when it comes to me & Jillian. I identify easily with her attitude (I'm not exactly a cuddly teddy bear) and her no b.s approach to things. This DVD doesn't disappoint. As Jillian says, if you want to do a 20 minute workout and get results, you HAVE to push yourself and make every second count. 30 Day Shred will do that for you. I'm not going to lie, it's HARD. Even level 1. Now, maybe coming from me, that won't mean much to people as I'm overweight and have been my whole life. But let me say this.. I've dropped over 50lbs since October '08, and 20 of them have come off just in the last month thanks to this DVD. You will work your butt off..literally ;) You will hurt, you will sweat, and you will want to reach into your television and knock Jillian out so that you can stop for just 5 minutes. Turning off the television never sounded so good..but DON'T. I've tried everything in the last few years and have lost as much as 40 pounds in 2 months. It always comes back-sometimes plus some. I've fought and struggled to do the right exercises, fallen for a few fads, and played the yo-yo game until I was blue in the face. Nothing ever worked. Now, thanks to the Biggest Loser and the inspiration I gain from the contestants and being able to identify with their struggles and the butt kicking workout I get from this DVD, I can honestly say that, while I still have a long road ahead of me (80 more lbs is my goal) I now have the confidence that I WILL make it and it CAN be done.<br /><br />Don't hesitate-this isn't a 'fad workout' that's popular just because the instructor is on t.v-it's real, it's hard, and it's worth every penny. Try it, give it a week, and I dare you to tell me you're not seeing results. Most of all, good luck and DON'T give up. You can do it.
B001LF4IA6|1.0|At one time Bruce used to take years between Albums before they were released. Many songs were recorded and he carefully selected what would end up on the Record. Now it seems lately he has been really cranking them out and it shows. \\"Working on a dream\\" seems like outtakes from \\"Magic\\" which was just as bad. The songs are emotionless and boring. The arrangements are contrived and stale. The band sounds muffled and distorted. What happened to the loud thunderous sound with the screaming guitars and distinct piano?  I'm working on a dream that someday Bruce will release something that I can really care about.
B000852GIQ|5.0|This is the most rewarding CD I've purchased in a very long time.  It DOES have the sound, like others have said, like Amelie, but goes beyond that general \\"Sound\\".  It's deeper.  the 6th track sounds like a mixture of Enigma and Amelie.  Others have a touch of early U2 (think Achtung Baby) Seriously...  Everyone who loves music should have this record, if only for it's depth, and creative appeal.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I absolutely love this movie!!! The music is fantastic, the singing phenomenal (the girls mostly), and the acting incredible!!!  Meryl Streep is absolutely at her finest (yet again) as Donna while up and comer Amanda Seyfried has the perfect mix of ballsy innocence and moxie as Sophie.  The bonus features are fun (Karaoke anyone??) and the commentaries great.  Blooper reel is funny and I could go on forever.  A must have for your collection.
B001EO748M|5.0|Season 2 was superb. The casting was just magnificent Henry and Anne were brilliantly cast the chemistry between them was unbelievable.    Natalie Dormer was the winner in season 2 she simply was Anne. At the end of season 1 I was so happy that I knew she was going to lose her head soon. In season 2 I was unable to watch the final episode where she was beheaded. I had to watch  at a month or so later I was so emotionally caught up in the series. She truly deserves an Oscar( if only the gave on for cable productions) for her performance in this series.    I can't wait for season 3 but I will really miss Natalie Dormer
B001KX50BK|5.0|My companion has adored this movie since its theatrical release, and she owned at various times a couple of previous editions.  She never seems to tire of it, and knows every scene and cites the pivotal dialogue as it's coming up.  That's love, folks, so I bought this Blu-ray edition for her birthday.  Knowing the movie as she does, a klaxon went off when brief scenes were omitted.  I was at first disappointed -- and a little angry -- when she told me that it was cut short by about five minutes from the 15th Anniversary edition.  However, thanks to Mr. Amith's very informative review below (if I could have voted \\"yes\\" for him multiple times, I would have), that's all cleared up, that this Blu-ray edition is the THEATRICAL release.  It hasn't been cut so much as RESTORED to its original length.  Why the studio simply didn't include both versions on the disc, as has been done with other titles, is an obvious question, but not one that needs to be answered to enjoy this.<br /><br />For the picture quality itself, the Blu-ray improvement is only slight, as it's not the type of movie that has a real advantage in hi-def.  It's a charming story with a sleek visual style, so it merely looks sleeker, but not necessarily more revealing.  Still, if you love this movie, you should treat yourself to the best transfer available, and, of course, this is it.  As noted, all of the bonus features from the 15th Anniversary Edition have been brought over.  If the DC is your favorite version, you'll have to wait a while.  Because this is a much beloved movie, more than likely, there will be a 20th Anniversary edition -- next year -- with probably both cuts on it.<br />_________________________________
B001ED7C58|5.0|I love the soundtrack to Twilight. I listen to it everyday at work, and have it loaded into my XBox360 and will listen to it instead of the music for some of my games. It also makes great background music while reading the Twilight series!
B001L5SXQG|1.0|I understand that Springsteen is no longer in his twenties and will no longer produce the type of music that made me a fan (i.e. \\"Born to Run\\" and \\"Darkness\\") but his age is no excuse for making albums this poor.  I know that he has obsequious fans who would give him 5 stars for recording an album of late night snoring, but how can anyone other than the most blind follower defend lines such as \\"He robbed a bank in his diapers and his little bare baby feet\\" (sang in earnest no less) and \\"As the evening sky turns blue, a dream awaits in aisle number two\\"?  The former is from \\"Outlaw Pete, a song that the Chicago Tribune called a \\"genre exercise that ultimately feels silly\\".  I couldn't put it any better myself.      I realize that Springsteen is trying to replicate the melodic overtures and production aesthetics of Brian Wilson, but the problem with that is obvious; he is not Brian Wilson.  This is shown again and again in melodies whose attempts at being adventurous simply evince the man's lack of creativity in this style.  Though the sound on this release is much clearer than \\"Magic\\" it is still muddy and warrants the dismissal of Brendan O'Brien.    The two bright spots on the release are the last two numbers, \\"The Last Carnival\\" and \\"The Wrestler\\", but by the time one finally gets to them they are not enough to salvage your listening experience.    I'm not sure how to fix things for ya' Bruce, but I do know one thing for sure: Whoever was responsible for that contrived inner sleeve photo of you lying in the yellow field feigning sleep needs to be gotten rid of.  Talk about pretentious!
B000002NCW|4.0|Mike Oldfield made a big splash decades ago with Tubular Bells. Several years later he has come out with a CD that seems to heavily embrace his roots (if he is Anglo). This is has a heavily Celtic influence. Noone hates blaring bagpipes in a parade like me, but he uses this instument, hushed its tone and makes it beautiful. If any is a fan of Celtic music, (there's a LOT of that music produced these days 'cause of Celtic Women and Riverdance) this is not essential but very highly recommended.<br /><br />\\"The Hero\\", moody \\"Dark Island\\" and moving \\"Voyager\\" are good highlights.<br />Another note, this guy has got to be at least 52 years old. He looks more handsome than ever, and for his age, looks great!!
0345479092|5.0|I found Tracy Hogg's approach the best so far, it gives clear guidance while allowing flexibility as she acknowledges that every baby and every family are different and therefore any advice needs to be tailored to each specific case.  I could not bring myself to follow any variation of the cry-out-method or Ferberizing but I really needed to get some sleep, so I tried the Pantley method (Elizabeth Pantley) which claims to be the opposite of the CIO but I felt it was a total flop and would take months to encourage a baby to fall asleep without the breast/rocking/patting.  On the other hand by following Tracy Hogg's advice I was able to get my baby to fall asleep on his own within a week without inflicting lots of crying or anxiety on him.  I am a breastfeeding mother and I feel Hogg respects and encourages breastfeeding but is also respectful of those who choose not to breastfeed, after all her book is not about advocating a particular feeding method but about understanding your baby and helping all the family have a good night sleep, a calm and happy time with the baby and for each (mother, father, baby) to thrive as individuals.
0440213525|1.0|Grisham books are great - I've read many - but this one has a serious problem.      The main character, Mark Sway, does the unthinkable.      Like J. Weavers' earlier review...  I kept thinking to myself, kid (Mark Sway) you're an idiot.  Tell anyone and everyone where the body is, then no one will hunt you down.    But I guess if you can accept him (ridiculously) keeping the secret to himself, then it all goes down fine.     Must be the movie was better.

0618154043|5.0|Unfinished Tales was originally published in 1980, a compilation of some of J.R.R. Tolkien's incomplete works by his son Christopher.  The book is arranged roughly chronologically, beginning with some material from the First Age, including a long segment which later was revised and published in 2007 as The Children of Hurin. For the Second Age there is a fascinating description of the island realm of Numenor and an annotated list of its Kings, and a long fragment of a tale Aldarion and Erendis, a love story set in Numenor's early years.  For the Third Age there is much material on the One Ring, wizards, elves, hobbits, and a multiplicity of other subjects.<br /><br />Unfinished Tales is endlessly fascinating to me.  I love the avenues of speculation it opens, and while I regret that Tolkien never got around to finishing these tales, I value these fragments even more for the fresh connection they allow to the mind and world of their creator.

1881273156|5.0|May 2010 update:<br />If you're wondering about the publication date and how the 2010 version different from the 2004 or earlier versions, the January 2010 version:<br /><br />1.  Has updated contact information for Gary Chapman and the publisher,<br />2.  No longer has a chapter about children<br />3.  Includes a promotional code to get access to a new comprehensive love languages assessment.<br /><br />My previous review:<br />I love this book!  It helped my marriage, and it also really helped me with my children and with my co-workers as well.  This definitely helps you understand people's motivations and their quirks, and how you can best communicate in ways that speak to them.
0061124265|4.0|I just finished \\"Veronika Decides to Die\\" and all I have to say is Wow!  It is amazing that a book like that can take you on such a journey that you appreciate life.  Paulo Coelho definitely has a gift of telling a story in such a way that you identify with the characters and you're looking at yourself at the same time, wondering if you share those same thoughts and illusions.  I saw this book last year and I wanted to read it but I figured it was not time yet.  I happened to order it last week and I picked it up and had a very hard time putting it down.  I think that I needed to read the book at this moment, because now it has the most impact for me.  Anyone who is questioning their life's purpose or feels stagnant because of the constant repetition of their lives will benefit from this story.
B001Q1QF2O|3.0|It seems that the sophomore curse has struck Ms. Allen and her newest work.  While there isn't anything necessarily wrong with it, the dual spectres of success and gobs of money have not translated into a great improvement.<br /><br />I'm not saying that there isn't a lot to like here--\\"The Fear\\" makes a very good first single, and songs like \\"Never Gonna Happen\\" and \\"22\\" have a lot going for them.  But others lack the universal drive/quality that was so abundant on her freshman effort.  It's one thing to be mad at someone (see:  \\"**** You\\"), but it's another for the complaint to be so generic that it's hard to identify with the song.  The production is much more polished and the language Americanized; still, the fact that it's missing the raw drive and rough edge of the first album makes these things a negative and not a positive.<br /><br />All in all, it's an interesting album, and it's one that marks Allen as a star with some staying power.  It's worth a listen, but not nearly as good as the first try.
0375826726|3.0|I read the first 2 books in what was previously called the Inheritance Trilogy (now Saga), and used a red pen the entire way through. The sentence fragments made me want to strangle whoever edited and then subsequently published the book.     Well now, this one's different. The grammar wasn't bad... in fact it's so different from the other 2 books that I'm having trouble believing that Paolini actually wrote the entire thing himself.  It seems like the editor rewrote parts of the book, instead of having Paolini revise them himself. The vocabulary is now at a much higher level, (perhaps a thesaurus was used?) the voice isn't the same from paragraph to paragraph and there is imagery that comes out of no where. The caliber of writing has gone up considerably since Eldest. I just don't see how it is possible for the writing style of an author to change so drastically in the middle of a \\"Saga.\\"     Paolini seems to have also rethought some of the larger plot elements of the book and decided to change them halfway through. I won't spoil it for those of you who haven't read it yet, but the first 2 books might as well be thrown out the window as far as the information in them is concerned. There are times throughout the book where I could just hear what the author was thinking. \\"Oh yeah. Plot twist that I JUST THOUGHT OF coming up!\\" Then you spend 4 chapters on that plot twist.     Overall an entertaining story, 8th Graders and below will love this book. It leaves the rest of us wanting our $18.77 back.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|Before I bought this DVD, I rented it from Netflix and the sound was terrible. I liked the movie so much that I decided to buy it from Amazon. Very good move on my part because it sounds great and I love the option that this DVD (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition) gives you to download a digital version of the movie to your PC. Also a good price from Amazon!!! I highly recommend this version of this movie!!!
1847670946|4.0|In the movie Con Air (1997), in one of the dialogues Cameron Poe (Cage) says \\"Many hands make light work. My father taught me that\\", to what Cyrus \\"the Virus\\" (Malkovich) snaps back \\"Know what my father taught me? Nothing.\\"     Even if your father has taught you nothing, he still may arouse your interest about who he really was. That's the essence of an absorbing narrative written by now-the President Obama a more than a decade ago. Written in a thoughtful manner, the story is based on young Barack's ponderings and reflections during his childhood, adolescence and youth. Although, during those formative years he has been able to meet his father only once, at the age of ten, the author implies that The Old Man, throughout the decades, has aroused young Barack's interest. From their only encounter he remembers the father's exceptional personality and above all - his confidence. It must have left indelible impression on Barry's memories, because the encounter during the whole narrative is evoked and examined again and again, several times. At one point, the author regrets that his father hadn't been able to tell him his true feelings when they met, any more than Barry had been able to express his ten-year-old desires (p.221).     This seems to be one of the reasons, why, as the narrative goes on, the next President is in permanent quest of himself and his way through life. Most probably, that also implicitly explains the reasons for attaching such an importance to any given person's descent, origin and race. It was stunning, in a way, to read, that after dating a white girl for a year, Barack visited her grandfather's house and realized that her world was as distant from his as Kenya was from Germany (p.211). If they stayed together, he says, he'd eventually live in hers, but that's not what he wanted, because he had been doing that most of his life.       Those beliefs bring him, first, to Chicago suburbs (part two), where he does social work at the grassroots level,solidifying his political outlook. He concludes with regret though, that even in a political base of then first African-American mayor of Chicago Harold Washington, discontent surfaced among people who preferred the dream to the reality and impotence to compromise (p.287). This time also coincides with the visit of his Kenyan sister Auma, who reveals him some fresh and unknown details about his father. Among those, was also The Old Man's quality to make everybody to think that he had everything, even when he had nothing (p.319).     Barry finally decides to go to Kenya (part three), where under Auma's leadership he meets his numerous relatives. He has two-sided view on the country and its people, but looking at Kenya with the eyes of a tourist he discovers that a confidence for long time in a history of mankind has been reserved for those born into imperial cultures (p.312). Sitting alone at the grave of his father, the author comprehends what his father might have taught him, if only silence, caused by fear throughout generations, wouldn't have been a hindrance.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|she's awesome.  Her music is breathtaking.  I can actually sing along and stay in key.  I highly recommend this CD for anyone who is an Enya fan.  And for those who aren't, this is a good way to get started.
B001KL3GWM|5.0|As it says in the beginning of the liner notes, this feels like home the first time you listen to it. While I can't read anyone's mind, I have a feeling that this may be the CD that the band has been reaching for. It touches all the places that they have gone on other discs (and they do like to cover alot of ground) but there is never any trace of anything feeling forced. I have most of their other discs & can't think of a better one for someone to start with. If you are already a fan, why don't you already have this? Highly recommended!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I've had these for about 6 months now, and I use them when its late at night and i don't want to disturb my roommate. They have great sound, very comfortable, and has a really long cord. I can literally move anywhere in my room with them on. The cord itself is coiled so it doesn't take much space. Its a soft cable so it straightens out easily, meaning it doesn't pull back at you if you've gone too far.<br /><br />The only concern I had was the lengthening of the two sides didn't stay in place. It could have only been my particular set since I didnt read any other review that had this. But the metallic extenders have numbers on them. I usually wear them at a 6, but most of them time when i take them off, they go to a 4. Not a big deal, its most likely due to the fact that the cups close together.<br /><br />I waited a few months to review them because it takes time to \\"break them in\\" and I wanted to review them once they were in fact broken in. When I first bought it, the sound wasn't very bassy, although the tones of the songs were extremely clear. Over time the bass started to pick up, perhaps due to the adjusting of the magnets inside of each earphone. Its been a great headset ever since.<br /><br />The built itself feels solid, it feels very durable. The one fear I have is the wire that connects to the headphone via the strap above your head seems in a very awkward place. taking off the headphones too fast may accidentally pull it out (though has not happened with me).<br /><br />Overall, these headphones will not disappoint. Its the best for its price, and even better then more expensive models I've tried. I've recommended these headphones to many of my friends and family, a few music majors that attend my college, and they all say they love it.

Unless you lived in a cave, you knew that there was quite a bit of hubbub about the movie's opening in the box office last year. The film's hype lasted quite awhile, and the movie was a huge success by both critics and in sales. It is second only to Titanic as the highest grossing film of all time. With that said, perhaps the bigger question is whether years down the road this film will have a place with the great films of all-time.     More so than any other Batman film, The Dark Knight seems to examine and dissect the psychology of good and evil. Unlike many other villains, Heath Ledger's Joker does not seem to have any driving force behind his apparent madness and evil. He is just evil for the sake of it, just to be on the opposite side of justice.  Morgan Freeman's character probably sums up the Joker the best when he says that \\"some men just want to see the world burn.\\" Being that Batman and the Lieutenant can't put a finger on this force of evil, stopping the Joker's destruction and antics becomes one of his biggest challenges. This Joker is adept at understanding others, and his seems to have a knack for pitting humans against each other, and getting to the root and instinctual evil in others; he knows how to get under one's skin. This makes him a truly profound villain.     Moreover, this is a film that truly epitomizes darkness in its symbolic sense. Chaos becomes a part of Gotham makeup once the Joker takes over, but chaos and evil are depicted as an idea as much as a crime. Unlike many of Batman's dilemmas in other films, this is one where there is no perfect answer. In this way, this film, much like its predecessor, Batman Begins, involves the hero having to look inward into his soul to find strength, as oppose to using sheer physical prowess to try to vanquish the dark side. And, thus, the ending leaves us to have to interpret whether Batman truly did make the rightdecision.     The Dark Knight is a fantastic film which definitely lives up to its hype: something hard to do in today's era of movie making.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I ordered this DVD set knowing exactly what I was expecting, and only hoping it would be in good condition. When I received it I was impressed with how well the discs were maintained. I was also happy with how quickly they arrived and with how well packaged they were.
B001GCUER0|5.0|Reading the last comment on Mad Men: Season 2:    Here in England the BBC has just started showing season 2 of Mad Men this week on 10 February 2009, this may be why it's dvd set has not been released yet. I believe it was the same with the Sopranos dvd issues.
B001NEK2GE|1.0|The hardware is only as good as its software. I'm fairly tech and play games regularly, so I am not unfamiliar with installing new game peripherals. Still, I was unable to get the G13 working on my system. I run a straightforward Windows Vista OS and tried using the G13 for 3 of the games Logitech officially recognizes on its website: Fallout 3, Warhammer Online and World of Warcraft... none of them worked. I've even gone so far as to manually input the game executable files with corresponding profiles I had set up on the Logitech G13 profile manager.  Another observation: The software does a poor job of recognizing games not installed in their default C: drive directories, it did not recognize of any games in the D: Drive.    The one star I am assigning this product is not a reflection of the actual hardware itself as I am unqualified to comment on that. The low rating is due to its inadequate software and software recognition--critical components of any game perhipheral. My experience with this product has been frustrating to say the least and I have sent it back for a refund.
B001FEA9QU|5.0|Not much to say, not sure why just one song from this CD is getting radio time (except that radio stations hate 7 minute long songs).  There are easily 5 songs that could be receiving heavy playtime on hard rock stations.  Great rifs, fast, furious but never sloppy guitar driven rock.
B00005JN0T|5.0|The movie will stand the test of time. Well written. Well acted. Well thought through. No outstanding oversights. With Independence Day it will endure.
B001HZK8FY|5.0|Amazon thank you....It came well packaged and as per the description. Happy with the communication also by Amazon.
B001EO748M|5.0|Yes, we are all aware that Anne (of a 1000 days) ends up beheaded.    We sit and watch the axe fall on three people before her, and although it is gruesome, it is not emotionally involving.    Now it is Anne's turn.  Waiting for the executioner's sword, she has flashbacks to when she was six or seven years old.  Flashbacks of a happy little girl and a wonderful family that loved her.  There was laughter and joy in her world.  People who embraced her, kissed her, and protected her.  This three minute scene will tear your heart out.  This scene alone is worth every penny you spent on this DVD. Bravo to the Director, Writer, and Cinemaphotographer.    And there is one other scene before this one, that is exceptional.  Five year old future queen Elizabeth is told by her governess that if she doesn't behave, she is going to hit her.  The look on that child's face is priceless.  Elizabeth's later rein is clearly expressed in that child's eyes.  Wow!
B0000542D2|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, sound was good, not great. I wish the special features had more of the Fab Four, studio takes, etc.
068987474X|5.0|And unfortunately, that's literal. This is the type of person who argues that he's beating her up because of his inner demons, but really he loves her. Men are wankers, and women are idiots .. that's what makes the world go round. There are exceptions to this but they are exceptions! To both men and women I say, be the exception for heaven's sake!

386521584X|5.0|Robert Frank is a genius. This book is a classic and I highly recommend it for anyone interested in any aspect of photography.
B001G9LVGG|2.0|I love Loreena McKennit but the majority of material on this CD was previously released by her on A Winter Garden: Five Songs for the Season. She did not even rerecord these songs they were identical. This was simply a repackaging and adding a few additional songs, which were not as good, to sell another album. Her rendition of In the Bleak Midwinter was disappointing. She did better work on her earlier albums. Quite frankly I expect more. If you never purchased the earlier CD or To Drive the Cold Winter Away then you probably will not be disappointed. But if you have I recommend you save your money for something else.
0553714546|1.0|I prefer Unabridged always, but was unable to purchase book 3 and 4 as Unabridged copies.  I listened to the first and second books and fell in love with the author and the reader was wonderful.  In this abridged version you loose so much of the wonderful writing, and the reader although not bad, is different and I found it difficult to \\"get into it\\".  There are musical interludes throughout which is when they skip the better part of the story so that you only get the gist of things.  If you read or listened to the full copy, you will not be happy with this abridged version.  I listened through but will find a way to find the Unabridged copy, who I do know is the same reader as book one and two.  I cancelled my order for the Abridged version of the fourth book in this series.  If you only listened to the abridged version, you would likely be pleased with this version, but if you heard the Unabridged versions, you will not feel satisfied listening to the abridged format.  I was very disappointed and so was my Mother.
B001HY3BFY|4.0|This is damn good music..i just wish they would get back to the sound on crusader.THIS STUFF IS A LITTLE TOO OVER THE TOP..remember denim and leather. It still is far better than-puddle of crud-nickle sack-3 dorks down and the doo fighters.....worth the purchase.
B00154GEFU|1.0|I can't believe i spent my hard earned money on this excuse for music..i want my money back!!Is Steve Howe actually playing guitar??That can't be Carl Palmer on drums!!If so..please retire and stay retired...there is not one good song on this mellow release.

B000X418UO|5.0|Great movie to watch on a cold rainy day in front of a crackling fire.  Great fun.
B0011UBDTK|1.0|Dont get me wrong, if it wasnt for the fact most of my disc for this item was scratched then it wouldve totally got 5 stars from me but that wasnt the case. Its too expensive for me to have recieved dvds i couldnt even watch. And on top of that, the seller i recieved it from CD WAREHOUSE or something like that was at first helpful but he sent me out the wrong replacement disc for one and when i bought it to his attention he was completely rude about it and gave me a 10 dollar refund to shut me up! Anyhow if i could leave this complaint under feedback i would but lucky for him it was already off my history so i couldnt. Anyhow, for the most part I LOVE THIS ITEM but i would NEVER buy from that vendor again.

B000BVS0L4|5.0|The Easton Press version of this classic is beautiful and well-illustrated. It is very easy to read and enjoy. If you have an appreciation for books and enjoy keeping a taste of luxury with you wherever you go, it is well-recommended.
0156907399|3.0|To be brutally honest I read this book for a literature class at my college and i didn't like it at all. i think it was the fact that i do not understand most of Woolf's writing.
1580084621|5.0|This is the ultimate in learning about Thai cuisine with a fantastic history of the evolution of Thai cooking with home run recipes !!!!!      A MUST buy
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This was an excellent but long look into the forming of our country.  I really got to understand all the problems that our forefathers had to endore in building and forming our country.  Should be one of the subjects tought in our schools.  The children today need more history and geograph then they now get.  Most do not know who Kennedy, Truman, or for that matter the last three presidents.  Highly recommend this DVD/CD to all.  A little long, but worth it.
B000068R1X|1.0|They butchered a classic! Frustrating to think how they took the time to remaster it the way they did. The only improvement in my opinion is the outro to Youre No Different. One Up On The B Side isnt even good or anything. Oh yeah and it sucks too.
B001MW0J2O|5.0|I am a huge Animal Collective fan. I have seen them live in a small club, and was blown away by the experience (so much more than a concert). I have nearly everything that they have recorded (including Panda Bear's solo efforts). I like all of their work; all of it has something to recommend listening to.    I think this album may prove to be their best. It is such a great mix of sweet vocal pop music (hints of Beach Boys) and their tribal electronics. If you're a fan go get it. If you just want to see what the deal is, I think you could do worse than starting with this album.
1552091090|4.0|I LOVED the price, I LOVED how fast it came in the mail and I LOVE this book.

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|this is my absolute favorate show on television. It catches your attention then just drags you in. I love phycological things like this im a big fan of ted bundy, and the river man. but dexter is diffrent exciting and embracing. I have never been so hooked on a show!<br /><br />It gives you chills, makes you laugh, makes you feel heartwarmed, and makes you feel hatered. It is the ultimate combintation all put into one amazing show. i can't wait for season 4 :)
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I recently ordered the CD of the music of \\"Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog\\" and I love it.  Joss and the kids are right on with these songs.  It's a good thing I like the songs cuz they get in your head and stay there for days!  Good buy, fun to sing along.  Note to parents - the DVD and CD are rated a definite PG-14 for certain parts.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|how are there 14 reviews for something that hasn't released yet?...i know the series is awesome but what if the special features on the dvd suck? whats the point of reviewing something that isn't available yet?
B001GKJ2FM|1.0|I got this on cable demand, where I could watch it and pay $4.99.  I thought it would be a bright, fun, guilty pleasure type movie to watch.  I like ABBA, and sometimes musicals are fun, like Chicago.  I didn't realize that by the end of it I'd want to stab myself and then blow myself up for good measure.  It was sickeningly embarrassing, the least of which was the singing, which yes, was atrocious.  Everything from the costuming to the direction to even the g-damn dance numbers left me exhausted and angry.  The casting was ridiculous.  Watching tired-looking bony horse-faced Christine Baranski fend off a young hottie while her bathing suit emphasized her wrinkled chest defied belief.  She's an attractive actress with a lot of brash sex appeal normally; couldn't they have made her look a little better?  Did Meryl have it in her contract that the other actresses couldn't outshine her luminous (goaty-looking) beauty?  And don't get me started on poor mannish elfin Julie Walters.  Watching her wrinkle up her face in song resembling an uncomfortable monkey and dry hump the air in her bad ugly hairdo with her short lumpy body encased in frumpy grandma clothes was beyond disgusting. I understand the premise that \\"middle aged women are vibrant and horny too!!!\\", but how these poor actresses were costumed only seemed to mock that.  Overall, the movie was the equivalent of listening to a loud toddler sing off key and pound spoons on a pot--perhaps adorable if you love him already, but vastly irritating to those of us who are normal and only hear it as noise.
3822837849|2.0|I was very pleased with the content until I got to page 238.  After that, I noticed many pages badly out of order and many pages added twice!  Amazon was very prompt in processing a replacement.
1401322336|5.0|I bought this book as a last minute Christmas/Birthday book for my boyfriend.  I saw it in the store, and knew we'd enjoyed the Bruchetta we'd made from his Italian book, so I figured why not - it was a \\"good enough\\" gift.    Initially the idea behind the purchase was that maybe my boyfriend, who works on contract and is thus frequently by himself and/or always eating out, might enjoy some simple meals at home and maybe pick up some new techniques/ideas.    However, as of yet, this cookbook has not left my house, and invariably every weekend we find ourselves headed out to the market to buy local ingredients to try something new.    First off, he's French, and obviously eats meat - and he even remarked how much he's learned from the quick guides at the beginning of each section on choosing meats and preparing them.    But what really potentially \\"shocked\\" me the most, were the vegetable dishes we've tried in this book.  I have been a vegetarian for 10+ years, and I have a wealth of cooking implements and cookbooks.  I expected, you know, \\"ok\\" dishes, and yet every time I have been blown away by what we've cooked - every recipe thus far has become a favourite - and must repeat.    The Tomato Salad, for instance, good god.  To think I've only eaten vegetables all this time and never tasted a tomato like that.  The Honeycomb Canneloni - blew my mind.  I honestly snuck back into the kitchen later to eat the leftovers.    This book turned out not to be a last minute Christmas gift, but potentially the most used gift I have ever given.  We've had such a blast cooking with this every weekend, and the recipes always deliver and are creatable by somewhat novices :).     Absolutely ecstatic I bought this :).
B001FB4W0C|5.0|I watched the first season and ordered the next two that night!Series has it all.Humor,suspense,and it's downright scary! Can't wait for season 4 to be released! 5 STAR'S all the way!
B001RR35I4|5.0|The opening scene of this movie is the first clue to its near perfection. A mother preparing dinner for her child, waiting anxiously for her to return from school. Her hope, and then distress as she hears people pass outside her door. While down in the streets of Berlin, her daughter is receiving a balloon from a strange man in a long black coat. We know what's going to happen, but it's still horrific to watch. Fritz Lang did an amazing job on this film. A simple story of the underworld, the police, and a single man holding an entire city hostage, and done with such precision and pre-noir darkness that is oozes creepy suspense from beginning to end.
0061139378|5.0|Coraline was a quick read.  I picked it up after dinner and read it within a couple of hours.  Written for children, probably middle school kids, I feel that adults too will enjoy this well written story.    Neil Gaiman has a wonderful talent for storytelling.  From the very first page to the last page I was lost in the book.  It was my first Neil Gaiman book but it won't be my last.  If you're looking for a creepy short story this book is the one to read.  It's not scary in the blood and gore manner but it's scary in the psychological way.  Not for younger kids but definitely for middle school kids and adults!      I enjoyed his book and look forward to reading more of his work.
B001LV2PA0|5.0|Not many people know of this film, surprisingly this is one of the most intelligently constructed and atmospheric horror movies of all time. Whenever I do run across someone else who has seen this film, there is an instantaneous, unspoken understanding in regards to the enduring creepiness of this film. If you are into horror flicks this is a must see for you.
1416562605|4.0|The dark/light metaphor used to differentiate the haves from the have-nots in India in this novel can be used for any country, but because this is India with its multitudes and incredible distances, has the ability to allow one person formerly of the Darkness to assimilate himself into the Light in a big way.  There is one quibble I have with this, but cannot reveal it without revealing a key plot point.  Here's hoping this auspicious debut will prove more fruitful for its young writer, unlike other Booker winning debuts of the past decade, whose authors have stalled and not produced other excellent works.
0767812387|5.0|The movie was a great price, quick delivery.  I have no complaints.  In addition the movie in itself makes you want to take salsa classes after watching it.
B0012IWHUU|5.0|I love DKM!  They never fail to please!  The DVD that comes with this edition gets you in close to the band.  Good music videos as well.
1581806574|5.0|I have to say that the book is extremely good. I got it and loved it the first time i read it. The instructions are easy to follow and the outcome is fantastic. i would give it a 6 out of 5 rating.
0751529818|5.0|Touching and emotional book. Remove all prejudices about sappy stories and after-school specials and you will take a life-changing powerful message from this book. The sadness and emotion you feel while reading this book will help to give you a different perspective on life. The discernable levels of symbolism add enjoyment for the reader. This book takes a night to read with effects that last a lifetime.
B00008G7UJ|5.0|Stunning visuals and great characters drive this movie.  Who would have thought that anyone could improve on Shakespeare's original Romeo and Juliet - Baz Luhrmann, of course!   This is classic Baz with his eye for  saturated colors of everything from cars and tattoos to the sets and costuming.  Wonderful, haunting music as well.  It's a 10 in my book.
B000001GE5|5.0|This is an incredible album. Each time I return to it I'm quickly reminded of just how masterful Chopin's writing is.    This is classic Pollini: playing characterized by incredible clarity and power. If you've ever tried speaking a foreign language, you quickly come to appreciate native speakers who enunciate well. Extending that to piano performance, Pollini enunciates incredibly well.    While Pollini's Etudes and Preludes receive much more acclaim than his Polonaises, I find everything in this album much to my liking. I haven't heard too many other performances of these works, but I do find Pollini superior to Perahia in the Etudes and to Argerich in the Preludes.    Of the 300+ classical CDs in my collection, these three are definitely among my favorites.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|This movie captures all the fun of Jane Austen's well-mannered parody of the gothic novel. If your significant other absolutely won't sit through the BBC version of Pride and Prejudice, try this instead. The characters are cleverly drawn, the plot is engaging, and Catherine's social predicaments are both delightfully amusing and strikingly familiar. You certainly don't have to be a devotee of Miss Austen to enjoy Northanger Abbey, but if you are, you will not be disappointed by this faithful and lively rendition.
B001QLHRW6|1.0|The one star rating is not for Leona, it's for Amazon (or probably more accurately Leona's record label) for charging $16.99 for this 17 track album.  Here's a hint, save yourself 16 cents and purchase each MP3 separately.
B000I0QL82|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites. no matter how often I watch it, it never fails to be a delight.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|I couldn't find this DVD in the store - it was shipped fast through mail and was an appreciated gift to my son-in-law
B000069HZP|5.0|I love this movie!  Fascinating, thought provoking, twisting, and unique.  I really enjoy watching it again just to think about the whole concept and if I missed anything.
B001D52XO2|5.0|Wondrous overview of Nina Simone's entire career - most of the truly remarkable performances and interpretations are here across 3 CDs and there's a DVD of a famous documentary about her output, ouvre and other big words.
0307454894|4.0|This is a GREAT MOVIE<br /> I saw it; and it is very romantic.<br />It's a very smooth, mellow drama that is unpredictable at times...<br /> Very dreamy in a way, and cold as the Germans usually are...<br /> It makes you think about love in a way that we don't get to everyday anymore.<br />I really liked this movie.<br /> I would give it a B plus.
B001JNNE64|5.0|I already owned the DVD version of the director's cut, but I had to get this because I'm such a huge fan. Now that I own it, I think it's clear that I made the right move. The improved picture quality is nice, and the book that it is packaged in actually has a few pages to it. Also - it comes with a CD that's got a few tracks of the film's music. I can't personally use the digital copy that comes with it since it's for Windows, but it's a nice gesture and 99% of the other viewers in the world won't have that problem.
B00005JKN9|3.0|With all due respect to the movie(The only reason I can't go below 3 stars), the movie AND special features being split evenly between two discs was a disappointment. One would think that when purchasing a 2-disc special edition of a movie, that disc one would contain the feature film, and perhaps any commentaries, and disc 2 would contain all of the special features. One would think. As a result, swapping out disc one and disc two is necessary to watch the movie in its entirety.  I love the film, and give it 5 stars, and the special features are sufficient, but feel like I made the wrong purchase since the film is not contained on one dvd.
B00003CY6M|4.0|I have just recently become a John Cusack fan and that is what made me select this DVD.  Having seen Kate Beckinsale before, I was struck this time by how abslutely beautiful she was.  I did have a little problem with her game playing at the beginning, ie: not giving her name and making fate be the decider as to their future.  Other than th at, I thoroughly enjoy John's obcessive search and the supporting cast was wonderful.  I recommend watching this on a cold winter night, with a glass of wine and someone significant with you.
B0000256VK|5.0|REVIEW: An art-rock touchstone that has had a tremendous and lasting influence on the British and American pop scene. Singer/songwriter Bryan Ferry, lead guitarist Phil Manzanera, and saxophonist Andy Mackay concoct a haunting set of song about weary and disatisfied lovers who desire for their relationships to reach the romantic and spiritually fulfilling \\"Avalon\\" of their ultimate happiness. Producer Rhett Davies and the group layers each tableau with a wash of dreamy echo and lush synths. At the time there had never been anything else quite like it. Of course now there have been hundreds of groups that have mined this particular sound: but there's no substitute for the original. \\"AVALON\\" is quite possibly the finest album ever released in the 80's, and its luster and emotional depth will forever be the crown jewel in Roxy's catalog of masterpieces. No matter if its the shimmering urgency of \\"Take A Chance On Me\\" and \\"To Turn You On\\", the murky funk of \\"The Main Thing\\", the slow afterburn of \\"Avalon\\", or the lucid cool that pervades the opening number \\"More Than This\\": \\"AVALON\\" is a major artistic statement, and another \\"must have\\" for your record collection. ANOTHER BIG PLUS: that beautiful cover photo!      HIGHEST BILLBOARD ALBUM CHART POSITION: Number 53.    HIT SINGLE: \\"Avalon\\" (BILLBOARD MAINSTREAM ROCK: Number 59).  HIT SINGLE: \\"More Than This\\" (BILLBOARD MAINSTREAM ROCK: Number 58).

B000Y7U98C|5.0|When I first saw this film, it was on DVD...and I wish I had gone to see it in the theatre.  The special effects were outstanding, and the story keeps you hooked from beginning to end.  Everyone in this film did a wonderful job of emoting their raw feelings, and Danny Boyle made this film into a complex blend of sci-fi and humanity.  Cillian Murphy comes through the screen and hooks you into the story so much that you feel like you are in the film with him as he strives to complete his part of the mission to the sun on Icarus-2.  A very underated film.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|This show has it all. It is well thought out, well staged, well dressed, well written and well cast. The storylines are compelling and the cultural references are clever and not cheesy.<br /><br />I see that others have gone on at great length, so I will be brief.<br /><br />In conclusion: I love this show so much that I bought a calendar of it that this artist made because she loves it so much too.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|Not to give anything away about the movie, since there is a lot of hype already around this movie. But the movie was just fantastic. Made me laugh, made me angry, and made me cry. As corny as it may sound it did all these things to me, once it comes out to DVD I will buy it. Great morals and finally movie where love not lust is the one thing that everyone dreams of.
B001C08RHA|5.0|Robert Downey, Jr. absolutely rocks in this film. Say what you will about his repeat trips to rehab and his \\"Hollywood Bad Boy\\" persona, but this is an actor who was truly born to play the title role. You can see just how much he enjoys himself as the playboy rich kid Tony Stark riding in a tank in the middle of a war zone, enjoying a drink and joking with the soldiers. You can't help but wonder how many of the lines were adlibbed by Downey because the ease with which he delivers his lines is just too perfect. Gwyneth Paltrow is refreshing as Stark's assistant. While Paltrow has presented herself as a serious (dare I say pretentious?) actress in the past, she seems to relax and allow herself to enjoy the film. Her red hair helps to downplay her natural beauty allowing her to carry herself as a slightly mousy woman in comparison to the supermodels her boss usually brings home. Jeff Bridges, as always dominates the screen. He is a powerful actor and a diabolical baddie. I am impatiently awaiting the sequel!
0375842209|5.0|This is my #1 book - and I've read plenty.  The writing style of \\"The Book Thief\\" is so different from anything I've ever read.  While I was skeptical for the 1st chapter or so, I quickly got into the rhythm of his writing style.  Using Death as the narrator was brilliant.  The characters where rich and the story extremely intense and thought provoking.  It really makes you feel (as much as possible), that you're that \\"fly on the wall\\" watching this incredible story unfold.  A must read, and in my opinion a must own!

B000003N8R|5.0|I purchased this album and Impressions recently when the only Coltrane albums I had were Blue Train, Giant Steps, Cannonball and Coltrane, and A Love Supreme (although I also owned some Miles Davis albums on which Coltrane was a sideman).  Previously, I would not have characterized myself as a Coltrane fan.  I liked other saxophonists such as Coleman Hawkins, Sonny Rollins, and even Hank Mobley more than Coltrane.  However, Crescent and Impressions showed me a more lyrical side of Coltrane's music that I find very beautiful and really enjoy listening to.    As others have mentioned, the album features 3 beautiful ballads (Crescent, Wise One, and Lonnie's Lament), a swinging blues (Bessie's Blues), and a showcase for Elvin Jones' drumming (The Drum Thing) which also features more lyrical blowing by Coltrane.  While some reviewers have indicated that they feel that Bessie's Blues doesn't belong, I disagree; it provides a very appropriate change of pace in the middle of the album.  All the tunes have sensitive solos by Coltrane (that demonstrate more restraint than he showed on A Love Supreme) along with great support and solos by McCoy Tyner, Jimmy Garrison, and Jones.    Overall, I consider this an even better album than A Love Supreme.  Amongst all the Coltrane albums I have mentioned, I like this and Blue Train the most.
0385338694|4.0|Althought this book was somewhat praedcitable. It was a good book. I love Sophie's books. I would love to see this one in a theater one day. I could just imagine what it should be like the. Sophie's writting style is that way. She makes to where you could imagine (with ease) the world she has created. Even after two years of not touching the book I still have the images in my head.
B000002I4S|4.0|I'm being a bit provocative with my review title here by giving technical and artistic skills like they do for figure skaters at the Olympics.  There is no question that Coltrane demonstrates extraordinary musical and improvisational skills on every tune of this album.  But I think the album lacks variety.  Listening to it is kind of like watching a figure skater do lots of triple and quad jumps without ever doing any spins or other skills within their routine.  I admit that my music theory is fairly limited, so I don't really follow all the harmonic innovation that Coltrane is demonstrating here.  But I do have several hundred jazz CDs and know that I prefer CDs with more variety.  It's true that Syeeda's Flute Song and Naima both differ from the rest of the album; but I find Coltrane's playing on Giant Steps, Cousin Mary, Countdown, Spiral, and Mr. P.C. very repetitious.  Each of the tunes is individually very good; but the collection lacks the variety that the best jazz albums have.    I find Blue Train a better album than this even if Coltrane's playing is not as advanced.  I also like My Favorite Things, Impressions, and Crescent more than this album.  They all have more variety and more beauty than Giant Steps.  There's no question that this is a very important album in the history of both Jazz and Coltrane, and I do like it.  But I can't give it 5 stars (or a perfect 10).

B001LRJH0U|4.0|New Mexico, 1882.  Virgil Cole (Ed Harris) and Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortenson) are about to deliver the pain.<br /><br />By nature, a western-themed movie is supposed to be slow.  The late 1800s were riddled with difficulties which made one's movements and actions deliberate, calculated.  It's up to Cole and Hitch, a former soldier, to ensure this purposefully structured way of life remains in tact.  As such, they live the nomadic life similar to Wyatt Earp, riding from one dusty town to another, ridding the townsfolk of lawless vermin who smell like goat taint.  In Appaloosa - a virtual Tombstone and OK Corral - the two lawmen face their most difficult reformation task in renegade rancher Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons).<br /><br />Shortly after their arrival into Appaloosa, they establish blunt order.  Disobey?  Go to jail, do not pass Go.  Resist?  Get a new ear hole in the middle of your face.  Previously, Bragg ruled the town like Brad Wesley from Road House (but without the naked pool parties).  His control so supreme, he barely hesitated before killing the previous marshal and his deputies.  With the new law in town, however, Bragg's men - especially a guy whose front teeth meet the butt end of Cole's pistol - are forced to abide by the law.  In walks Ally (Renee Zellwegger) to muddy the waters.<br /><br />Ally's arrival is the classic western folly.  Cole immediately falls for her prostitutorial ways because she is flirty yet cultured, and because she bathes often and chews her food nicely.  This, of course, leads to one of the following possibilities: A) She is used by bad guys against Cole's sensitivities, B) She turns out to be an actual whore, and wrecks Cole's psyche, or C) All of the above.  As directed by Ed Harris, it ends up being option C, with an extra caveat: D) Ally ends up being a turd in the punchbowl, whoring around town, and undoubtedly contracting the first STD of the Wild West.<br /><br />Simply put, Zellwegger's presence ruined this movie.  With Harris, Mortenson, and Irons, alongside Lance Henriksen, the strength of this cast is its grimy realism.  Each character looks like they've been in the sun too long with borderline unhygienic tendencies.  They look like they can drink throat-burning whiskey while firing a six-shooter through a needle's eye.  Zellwegger, however, looked as confused as a dog in a bathtub.  The fact that her character is a completely, unredeemable slut doesn't help either.  It's funny that early in the movie Cole says he's only been with squaws and hookers, and Ally's different.  Oops!  Guess her appa is a bit loosa afterall.<br /><br />Appaloosa is a well-acted, compelling Western tale.  The final battle is well done in the genre's motif; there may have even been a tumbleweed or two.  It's just that I hated Zellwegger and her character is all.s, alongside Lance Henriksen, the strength of this cast is its grimy realism.

B001M4YZ90|3.0|Double crossing abounds in this British tale of underworld backstabbing.  Russians, old Brits, petty thieves, a beautiful accountant, a homosexual gangster, and a crackhead cross paths , steal millions of Euros, beat an old man on a golf course (5-wood in case you were wondering), unearth an informant that led to a ton of jail time, all while watching and expensive painting - a lucky heirloom of sorts - pass hands from one party to the next.  Still with me?<br /><br />It's essentially a British attempt at the intricacies made famous in the Ocean's Eleven series.  Gerard Butler, Thandie Newton, and a few others are superb, but the film lacks true purpose or plot, and the introduction of countless characters causes a lack of development.<br /><br />It's not nearly as polished as it should be, and there's nearly no climax or resolution.  Well, I guess there was a resolution of sorts, and kind of a climax, but it's about as tied together as spaghetti.  Lots of promise, and great efforts from Butler and Newton - who is smoking hot in this one - but it has a comprehensive incomplete feel to it.  Unless this is a setup for a sequel, the betrayal and plot-twists leave far too many loose ends and only end up screwing the viewer.  Don't get me wrong, I thought the details and characters were well developed and compelling.  The depth of the story is superb, and the gritty realism of the drugged out music culture - particularly the Johnny Quid character, brilliantly performed by Toby Kebbell - provides a dark, cynical aspect to the entire storyline.  Like the famous \\"Archie Slap\\" described and executed in the movie, I'm left with a feeling that I've been affected, but I'm not quite sure what happened.
B0015OKWL2|1.0|What a miserable film!<br /><br />This storyline was so predictable and overdone.  I knew exactly how it was going to end.  I guess if you watch a lot of movies it is easy to become jaded and guess endings, but this was just so lame.<br /><br />The acting was not bad, John Leguizamo and Donnie Wahlberg were interesting, but overall the acting was not at the level I was anticipating.  And what is wrong with Carla Gugino ... why is she picking such strange roles that showcase her physical and sexual attributes, and not her acting?<br /><br />I am greatly disappointed.  This movie is a series of clich&eacute;s strung together that was not supposed to be noticed because we were supposed to be mesmerized by the De Niro/Pacino combo.  Like I said, poor man's \\"Departed,\\" watch that or Godfather 2 instead.

1400064287|5.0|Update: This book actually had an immense impact of a textbook I co-authored: [[ASIN:1478217200 OpenIntro Statistics]]. I would highly recommend Made to Stick to any and all teachers. It is a handbook for connecting students to knowledge.<br /><br />Below is an excerpt from an email to my dad. [Brackets] denote a slight modification.<br /><br />\\"<br /><br />I did bring \\"Made to Stick\\", which I finished last night on the plane and will bring to Rochester. At this point, I am tempted to say Made to Stick is the most practical and useful book I have ever read (no joke). Here's why...<br /><br />Below are two pitches I just made up to get someone to visit PaperbackSwap[ ]com (PBS):<br /><br />* By listing your old books and sending them out on PBS, you can earn credits for free books.<br /><br />* PBS offers a chance to give new life to old books by sending them to fellow book lovers.<br /><br />If you were running a PBS ad campaign, which line would you run to get the most people to visit the site?<br /><br />And which would most likely get you to visit PBS?<br /><br />I'm guessing you personally would be swayed by the second but would pick the first for the ad campaign. The first is logical and about people's self-interest so it should get more people to visit the site... right?<br /><br />Definitely not. The second uses \\"sticky\\" principles, notably bringing up emotions (generosity and belonging) while the first makes our minds get all logical, which is easier for people to detach from. The second one will be the more sticky ad. More people will be drawn to an emotional calling over saving money on books.<br /><br />So, as a statistician, the most important book I've read has taught me to no longer pick ad #1 but to pick (and how to come up with) ad #2? Far from it. The book gives guidelines on how to evaluate whether information -- be it an ad, a presentation, a project mission -- is sticky, as well as how to identify and make information sticky.<br /><br />And yes, I just \\"pitched\\" you Made to Stick using several of the sticky principles it discussed.<br /><br />\\"I just \\"pitched\\" you Made to Stick using several of the sticky principles it discussed.<br /><br />\\"

B001Q1QF2O|4.0|Not the best album I've ever heard, but I was impressed when I bought this. I've always liked Lily Allen since her first debut, but she'd definitely matured and gotten even better! As I said, I didn't absolutely love all of her songs, but many of them are now favorites of mine! And all of them seem to be stuck in my head. I love her lyrics, Lily Allen is obviously not afraid to speak her mind!    Everyone's At It: 5+ stars! This was on eo f my favorites. It's got a good message, and a catchy beat I can't get out of my head!    The Fear: 5 stars. Not one of my total faves, but also catchy, and the lyrics aren't half bad. ^^    Not Fair: 5 stars. This one is just plain hilarious! Not one I'll listen to all the time, but it's good for a laugh, and good example of Lily's shameless lyrics.    22: 4 stars. It's OK, but not amazing. One to listen to when my iPod's on shuffle and I'm not paying attention to the music much.    I Could Say:  5 stars. This one grew on me the more I listened to it, I didn't love it the first time I listened to it. Still, it's a good song.    Back To The Start: 5+ stars. This is one of my favorites from the whole CD! You can tell how Lily has grown and changed with her music in this song. Great beat I can't get out of my head, and great lyrics.    Never Gonna Happen: 3+ stars. This was one my least liked songs. It's alright, but I personally don't like it too much.    F*ck You: 4+ stars. I was impressed by this one, only Lily could pull this song off! And she did it well, definitely with some great imagination. Not for those sensitive to the 'F word', but worth listening to if you don't mind that! Which you shouldn't, if you're listening to Lily Allen anyways....    Who'd Have Known: 5+ stars. Another favorite of mine! All I have to say about this one is: Cute! It's an adorable song, one I\\"ll listen to a lot.    Chinese: 5 stars. A great song! I wasn't quite able to understand what she's singing about, but still a song that get's stuck in my head.    Him: 5+ stars. Pure brilliance on Lily's part! This, I'd have to say might be my favorite. I'm not sure what to say, except that it's amazing, and pure Lily Allen! Not for hard-chore Christian's though, since it talks about 'God'.    He Wasn't There: 4 stars. An alright song. I like it, it's cute, but I don't love it.    So that's what I think of the album, although really it's a matter of taste for what songs are the best. Either way, definitely worth the $3.99, kudos to Lily on a good sophomore album!

The bloody battle continues until a horn sounds. \\"My sympathies.\\" [Was there such a large open plaza?] Sixteen years later the young boy is grown up and released from an institution. The date seems to be 1863. Coffins are unloaded from ships. William Marcy Tweed schemes to improve the city and his fortune. We hear the names of the various gangs.

They attempt to rob a ship, and sell a dead body for medical science. There is a test for Amsterdam. They show the various methods of thefts by the crooks of that day. Criminality is rampant in the Five Points. [Caused by poverty or oppression?] they make an example of some men for a public hanging. Army recruits climb onto a ship while coffins are landed on the dock. Somebody shoots Butcher Bill. [Does this film have a plot or just a collection of scenes?] Amsterdam has a tender minute with Jenny. Does fear preserve the order of things? [Do the conversations make much sense?] \\"Who are you?\\" Will someone peach?     Butcher Bill shows his knife-throwing skills. There is a shocking surprise and a gruesome and revolting scene. Who killed a poor little rabbit? [Does the story make sense?] Will there be a grand fight to provide an exciting finish? William Marcy Tweed seeks votes in the Five Points. Voters are recruited; its not the ballots that count but the count of the vote. [Is the violence almost cartoonish? Does the film start to drag?] Now the tempo picks up when the mob attacks people and buildings. The army clear the mob from the streets, the navy bombards the people in the plaza. There is one last meeting for Butcher Bill and Amsterdam. [This movie doesn't have a good ending, was something cut out?]    The last scene shows the Brooklyn Bridge which didn't exist until years after 1863. This film was loosely based on Herbert Asbury's 1925 book. You may find the book \\"Low Life\\" by Luc Sante to be more informative and interesting. The Discovery Channel had a good film on the Five Points. It explains that \\"Dead Rabbits\\" meant \\"real tough guys\\" (Gaelic ráibéad). Fire was the chief danger in those days (candles, fireplaces). These stories tell little about the economic situations. The gangs here can explain the turmoil in some Middle East countries today. Does anyone believe corruption ended with Boss Tweed? Some say Federal, state, and municipal projects today don't get funded unless somebody gets paid. You can compare this to many business projects.

B0010358D0|5.0|I really loved the first 3D animated Appleseed movie when I saw it in the theater a few years ago.  This movie however was visually superior in every way, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The action scenes are great and the story was pretty engaging as well.  I felt an emotional connection with the characters, and the english voice acting was also well done.   Extremely well done 3D visuals, FX, and superb animation blended with motion capture made this movie one of the favorites of my entire collection.    Personally I don't have any complaints except one scene where a part of the character Brearios's head clips through his body a little when he is laying in a hospital bed, it was the only serious visual flaw I noticed during the whole movie.

B000FCKL6G|4.0|Before I start my review I'd just like to say I purchased and read this book before reading any of the other reviews, and this is my first time hearing about how Louis Gerstner was the \\"near downfall\\" of IBM. Most of the reviews of this book talk about Gerstner's public image and how he ruined the IBM culture, all of which I am not familiar with. I'll be reviewing primarily what was in the book.     I picked up the book after hearing about it from my managers manager, who commented on the management strategies in it. I generally don't read a lot of non-fiction, but thought it would be interesting to read about the world from a CEO's viewpoint. I wasn't disappointed.     Who Says Elephants Can't Dance gave me a great insight into what it would be like to be a high level executive at a huge company - their motiviations, thought process, and some strategies they might use. Several basic strategies were outlined which seemed general enough to apply in other situations, and they all made sense given the description of IBMs situation at the time. Most important (in my opinion) was the justification given for the strategies taken by Mr. Gerstner - most of the actions he took followed his basic strategies, and where he diverged from them he explains why.     While it definitely delivered what it had promised (explaining how Mr. Gerstner was able to make a large, slow company into a large, fast one), it did have some failings:   - It was not well laid out as a reference (if, for example you wanted to look up a particular strategy and how it was applied).   - It was written in a style which led me to imagine an aging man telling stories about his \\"good old days\\". This did keep the book interesting, but clearly downplayed the negative decisions and negative results, which I would have found interesting.     Other than the above two points, this book was an excellent read. It has definitely interested me in business strategy, decision making and management, and I would recommend it to others.

B0000X61UU|5.0|I have been using this DVD for several weeks now and I can already see results all over. I love this tape because it emphasizes proper form when doing the exercises. The variety of exercises are excellent! I am to the point where I am able to do more than 10 reps per move. I can integrate this DVD with my regular workout routine of walking in the evening, pilates, and step-workouts.     The hardest part at first was trying to find the strength within to complete all the reps, especially when it came to doing the chest and arm exercises. Cindy doesn't really push you since this is a DVD that \\"you can grow with\\" so I would sometimes quit early instead of pushing through to the end of the move.     I am looking forward to reaching an optimal fitness with this tape! I am getting to the point where I can do repeat sections such as the ab and back sections. If you are looking for variety in your workout, I would definitely invest in the Next Challenge Workout!!!
B001OXV5PG|4.0|I didn't read the standard edition of this book; however, this book standing alone, it was a good read.  The way that card tells the story, I have some minor issues with, but I did have a hard time putting it down.  The story itself was done well, though.    I think the premise of the book, that the child's mind is faster and better able to adapt than that of an adult's was put very well.  I also liked how the general from the previous engagement said that he would not have been able to do what Ender did.    That Ender's brother and sister got along in the way that they did, and doing what they did made the story line flow, but was a touch too far fetched for me to swallow.    All things considered, though, it was a good read.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This beautiful serious is all in one spot and brilliant quality with blueray technology.  Great buy, won't regret it.
B00006ZXSK|4.0|My wife wanted a copy of this film.  She loves the story.  The sets are great and the acting is engaging.  It is a wonderful retelling of a classic story, well acted and fun.
B000EUDAWG|1.0|It was already broken when it arrived.  The battery coil was disconnected so you were unable to use it because the battery was unable to connect to produce power.  Thankfully, we have handy people here.  It was a christmas present.  Two legs fell off recently.  Don't waste your money.  I will be using it as a halloween decoration.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|I tried to watch this movie twice but I had to turn it off after twenty minutes.   It was too handheld which is too bad, because the story had potential and it could have been a good movie if it was made better and less jumpy. Didn't they have a stabilizer in the camera or something like that?

B001M5UDGS|5.0|This is what happens when a writer's strike shuts \\"Hollywood\\" out of \\"Hollywood,\\" and all that's left are passionate writers, actors, musicians, and crew.  It has Joss Whedon written all over it - if you're already a fan of his work, read no further.  Dr. Horrible (played by Neal Patrick Harris) is quirky and endearing from the start, and the supporting cast are fantastic actors in their own right.  The DVD is very well produced and packed with special features.  You will want to watch them all.  The highlight is the \\"User submissions\\" section:  It has its low spots, but overall it's amazing.  Watch Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog, and you'll hope that this is the direction that hollywood is headed:  Smaller budgets, bigger hearts.
B0016NF06O|5.0|My favorite part of this CD is the beautiful instrumental backing, section work, and soloing by the superb Wynton Marsalis band. What a dream rhythm section this group would provide for any singer.<br /><br />Willie Nelson is, of course, mainly a country singer. But his own band leans heavily on bluesy inflections, and he has previously recorded acclaimed recordings of jazz standards.<br /><br />Willie's oddball vocal phrasing sometimes throws country musicians for a loop, but it doesn't faze these jazz musicians one bit.<br /><br />It's a good matchup by a talented cast of dedicated artists. These are not musicians who follow fads and sell their souls to be on the hit parade. Rather it is a tremendously talented group of artists who all have devoted many years to their craft, and yes Willie Nelson is one of them.<br /><br />Now what would be really fun would be a Marsalis / Nelson country album-jazzed up, of course. Remember when Ray Charles did that in the 1960s?
B00103584Y|5.0|Ah, the 1990's, before cell phones were ubiquitous and people still used phone cards. A great action movie, not too much violence and not predictable. Keeps you thinking too. The only criticism I have of the Bluray version is that you can see some of the scratches on the film, it seems this wasn't digitally remastered.
0061148512|5.0|I started reading this book about three years ago(at age 16) and I could not get into it for some reason. It is a book I have always wanted to read because it is a classic and I am so glad that I finally did. There is a lot of stuff in it that I would not have fully understood if I had continued to read it at age 16...  I sort of compare this book to She's come undone by Wally Lamb; about a young girl going through life \\"crazy\\". I would really recomend both of these books.
B000XYNFD2|5.0|I am very impressed.  This seems to be a very high quality watch.  I don't know much about watches.  Most of my information came from reading other reviews.  For the money I believe this was a good purchase.  It's nice now that I'm older to move to a more \\"adult\\" watch.  I get a lot of compliments.  It's heavy or solid.  I get a real sense of quality construction.  I've already scratched the band a little but I suppose it's unavoidable.  I made the right decision and would buy this watch again.  The quality is there.
B001LF4IA6|4.0|While not really an E Street Band-style record, this one still has plenty of strong songwriting. \\"Outlaw Pete\\" would have to be the only loser here, with its rip-off of, of all bands, Kiss and it's inexplicable 8-minute run time, but I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised by the rest of the album. The inclusion of the track \\"The Wrestler\\" is definitely a highlight, and overall it's a decent Springsteen album, probably a little more coherent and consistent than \\"Magic.\\"
B000002UAR|5.0|Right from the start, the album rocks with Taxman. I'm a big fan of their guitar solos, and this song just has one of the best riffs you can hear. Eleanor Rigby is really something special just for the fact of it having such a orchestra sound and a great chorus, and Yellow Submarine is another great example of the same. Starting off slow, Love You To just all of a sudden bursts into a great sound that you can help but move to. I'm a fan of George, and this song is just really great and unique with his playing of the Sitar. She Said She Said is another great song worth mentioning, and so is Doctor Robert and the classic Good Day Sunshine.  There is just a lot of rich music in this album and if you like Rubber Soul, then you will also love Revolver.
B0006OBPTA|5.0|This is an excellent collection that everyone should own. I bought it for my nephew and he loved it.
B001PPLIEQ|3.0|With the announced reboot of the Bond franchise with Casino Royale in 2006 and with Daniel Craig being announced in the role, nobody was sure that the reboot would be successful. Yet with its release in 2006 and with Craig having proved himself in the role of Bond, anticipation was high for its successor. Yet Quantum of Solace would prove unable to reach the bar set by Casino Royale.<br /><br />The problems seem to stem for the cast but, thankfully, not from Daniel Craig as007. Craig proves that the Bond he portrayed in Casino Royale could survive into another film. Craig proves himself again and again between the action sequences and the (relativly small amount) of dramatic sequences as well. The real shame is that Craig doesn't seem to have the chance to really act in the way he did in Casino Royale.<br /><br />Moving on from Craig, the rest of the main cast is questionable. Playing the role of Camille is relative newcomer Olga Kurylenko. The problem with using a relative newcomer is the fact that Kurylenko doesn't have much acting experience and it shows. Kurylenko lacks screen presence and chemistry with Craig or anyone else she happens to share the screen with at any given moment. It seems a shame because with a better actress, the role of Camille could have been much better.<br /><br />It has been said that a Bond film can be judged from the strength of its villain. If that is the case then Mathieu Amalric's Dominic Greene sums up Quantum of Solace: full of promise but disappointing in the end. Mathieu Amalric is a good actor without a doubt but the role of Bond villain is not a role for him. Dominic Greene is amongst the series least threatening villains who, like Moonraker's Hugo Drax, tries to be the \\"silent but menacing\\" type and only succeeds in being a self parody. The one time that Greene gets into a fight with bond it turns into one of the series unintentionally funny moments (people in the theater I saw the film in were laughing I'll leave it at that).<br /><br />The supporting cast thankfully is better, if extremely underused. Perhaps the best example of this is Gemma Arterton wonderfully done Strawberry Fields. I ask the filmmakers what is the point of introducing a character who in her introduction alone is more interesting that your female lead just to give her the least amount of screen time possible? Like Miranda Frost in Die Another Day, the \\"secondary\\" Bond girl should have been the primary one and vice versa. Much the same is true of the returning characters from Casino Roayle: Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini), Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright) and White (the wonderfully menacing Jesper Christensen) who all deserved far more screen time then they eventually got. Back to the question: why introduce them if you're not going to use them much? Judi Dench makes a welcomed return as M, who in her screen time builds on to the Bond-M relationship established so well in Casino Royale and thankfully there are plenty of those scenes. The real shame is that, outside of Dench's M, the supporting cast is underused massively.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest problem with the film is that the film suffers from an action overload. While the action sequences of Casino Royale were stunning, the same can not be said of those of Quantum of Solace. The filmmakers apparently took the Bourne films as a model because this film copies many of the action sequences right down to the foot chases and even a knife fight that is so reminiscent of the Borune series it could be called a rip-off. The film does have a few original action sequences in the film including the boat chase and one of the series best airborne action sequences. It's a shame that while there are good action sequences surrounded by a whole series of not so good ones. The filmmakers have made the same mistake they did with Tomorrow Never Dies: letting the action override the plot.<br /><br />One of the pluses of the film is David Arnold's score. Arnold adheres a little more closely to the traditional Bond score. After making the James Bond Theme non-existent in Casino Royale, Arnold allows it to slip in without it being intrusive. In fact Arnold with one moment in particular perfectly captures the feel of the earlier John Barry scores with the scene of Bond and Fields. Arnold uses Quantum of Solace to show off his ability to make a good Bond score. Unfortunately the main title theme \\"Another Way To Die\\" is amongst the series worst with some odd lyrics and an odd performance (the duet was a good idea if only the song had been better).<br /><br />Perhaps it was the raised expectations, but Quantum of Solace seems lacking in many areas. It's mixed main cast and action overload are its biggest problems and while it has many pluses (a good performance from Craig, an underused supporting cast and a good score) the minuses of the film are very hard to overcome. As a Bond fan I hate to say it but I will: Quantum of Solace is full of promise but disappointing in the end.g the James Bond Theme non-existent in Casino Royale, Arnold allows it to slip in without it being intrusive.

B000002UAU|5.0|Arguably the best opening song for a Beatles album, Sgt. Peppers is the definition of the changed band. The transition from what they were to what they became acheived the climax with this record,  and that is not to say the other albums afterwards were the ride down (no way!) When you think the Beatles, a lot of people think Sgt. Peppers and for good reason. It is just a really good album and you can hear all of the production and work that was put into it. It is easy to be jaded by all of the albums that have copied this style of music years later, but this was the original and very original for it's time. That is why it is still so good all of these years later and why this album is one of the band's most talked about works.
0571202284|5.0|The reviews for this book are overwhelmingly positive, and I don't have too much to add to what has already been said.  This is a great book on the techniques of animation.  However, if you don't know how to use your animation tools, this book won't help you.  If you are a computer animator, this means that you should already know the basics of your tools before tackling this book.  If you are a traditional animator, you should already know how to draw before reading this book.

B000VSBX34|5.0|From beginning to end, Help! is an amazing work of art! Every song that they do on this movie is at a different location and visually beautiful. The Beatles are just too cool in the videos as well. I really enjoy the close up camera during the song \\"The Night Before\\". They have a camera at the end of Paul's bass and you can see him playing really good and it looks awesome.<br /><br />The story of the film is hilarious and as good as any other comedy that came out at the time. There were parts that I still remember that make me laugh. The funniest scene, to me, is when they are in the restroom and the hand dryer starts tearing off the clothes of everyone that walks in. Hard Day's Night is a classic film, but I liked this the best between the two. Come on, this has a mini-Paul! lol.
B0009W5K0Y|5.0|I have both of Paramore's albums now. I think they are an awesome band. Their music makes me want to jump up and rock on. I enjoy listening to their music if I'm ever down because it perks me right up as soon as I hear it. Awesome band, and I recommend them to anyone who is into rock.
0321525655|4.0|I very much enjoyed this book. It has some very interesting ideas and concepts. At stages it feels a little to 'arty' though.
0061673730|1.0|This is by far the worst book I have ever read (even worse than the Tao of Pooh). I have devoted my life to reading all different kinds of philosophy books and usually withhold judgment because I am not ashamed to admit that I am uncertain and confused about the most important questions in life. However, one thing I CAN say with certainty is that this book is garbage. True, it does present some basic, central concepts of philosophy in an accessible way that would appeal to readers who don't know much about philosophy. In fact, Persig brings up points that I wish more people would consider. However, this book has destroyed lives, or more accurately, people influenced by this book have destroyed lives, and the author is a very bad person (I don't know him personally). I intend to write a more detailed review in the future of how exactly this book has destroyed lives. For now, I recommend reading the 6 pages of one-star reviews written here by other readers, including ones who are apparently educated in philosophy. Only the first page of these appears in the Amazon window, so be sure to click the links to pages 2-6.    Just the title is enough to make one suspicious. This book has almost nothing to do with Zen, as the author himself has admitted. The title is just a catchy marketing gimmick capitalizing on the exotic appeal of Zen. Read Routledge guides or something similar to understand Hume, Kant, etc. Don't contribute to the pocketbook of this evil author.
B0013ND30M|5.0|What can I say. This movie is a classic. I've  watched for the first time with my 2 yr old daughter (yes, I know.. but I had a poor childhood! although I read the story from books and knew there was a sleeping beauty movie somewhere out there!). I love the story and everything else but my daughter doesn't like it too much. She says is to scary. I am sure she will love it in a few years more.

B00006JJ1O|3.0|Does anyone remember who t.A.T.u. was?<br /><br />Yes, before Katy Perry was pretending to make out with girls this young and spunky duet created the gimmick that was faux lesbianism.  Who would have ever thought that would have become a gimmick.  What's nice about t.A.T.u. is that when you strip away the gimmick you still have some pretty good music, that is, if you like techno-dance-pop.  If you do then you are in for a treat, since just about every track here is primed and ready for the dance floor.<br /><br />Two teenage Russian lovers; what more needs to be said.  Their voices are not superb but they can sing, and while their music is not inspiring or really memorable, it is serviceable.  They are remembered more for their lifestyle (true or not) but the point is that they are remembered.<br /><br />The album opens with a bang, a nice techno bang.  The beat almost sounds like something left on the cutting room floor of Prodigy's last outing.  It's bouncy, upbeat and infectious to say the least.  The accents on these two girls add a layer to their music that separates them from everyone else; and that paired with the lesbian undertones makes their music all the more intriguing.<br /><br />Nothing displays that gimmick more than their debut single off this album, `All the Things She Said'.  You have to remember this song; right?  They played it everywhere, and the track became so big that these two girls who, without the gimmick would have collected dust on the shelf, were catapulted to the cover of like every magazine and were seen performing at just about every awards show.  They were instant stars.  The song in its own right is actually really good.  Surprisingly, the track is even effective lyrically, which is not expected.  A few years back my best friend and I were messing around on the acoustic guitar and we played this song and it actually works really well.  It's a smart song when taken into context.  The beat on this track is also really great; nice, strong and edgy.  It compliments the track very well.<br /><br />Both these tracks (`All the Things She Said' and `Not Gonna Get Us') have alternate versions at the end of the album sung in the girls native tongue.  Both tracks are nice but unnecessary.  They would have been better off to release two versions of the entire album in my opinion (actually I think they did, but I'm not for certain).  They aren't Rammstein; they sing in English so there is no reason to offer us the same track in another language when we're just going to skip back to the English version.<br /><br />Regardless, both tracks are nicely done either way.<br /><br />There are also two versions of the next track; `Show Me Love'.  There is the album version as well as an extended club mix.  I am usually very against club versions of songs because they tend to be ridiculous and ruin the original.  Not so in this case.  Both versions are great, but honestly, the club version is better.  Both have that club quality, the remix just amplifies it.  This is yet another track that lyrically analyzes the confusion these girls are supposedly feeling towards their love for one another.<br /><br />I'm telling you, this marketing strategy was GENIUS!<br /><br />Their cover of the Smiths `How Soon Is Now' is a brilliant touch to the album, playing to their own style with someone else's music.  It's a nice example of how one can manipulate the original intentions of a track just by their own presence on a track.  They also perform it very well, so that's a major plus.  '30 Minutes' is another really good track, stripped down and mellow.  In other words; it's not a club song.  It has some sincere and heartfelt lyrics and very delicate delivery.<br /><br />The album isn't free of filler though.  As I mentioned, the Russian versions of the two singles was unnecessary, but that's not all.  `Malchik' is bouncy and upbeat but also pretty annoying.  It's the one song on the album that comes close to giving me a headache, but I know a lot of people seem to like this one.  `Stars' is also not a favorite of mine.  It has an interesting structure, but I don't think it works as well as they were hoping it would.  `Clowns' is a decent track, but it doesn't pop as much as it could have.  Mocking the people who criticize their relationship, Lena and Yulia label them clowns here.<br /><br />The album is not disappointing by any means.  It has its low points but it balances them out with some genuinely refreshing song choices.  The album is worth getting for `All the Things She Said', the two versions of `Show Me Love' and the Smiths cover alone, but there is more here than that to love.  Whether or not their relationship was genuine, their music is pure unadulterated pop, and if that floats your boat then this is an album for you.  I give it a high C.  It could have been better, truly, but it's still worth sinking your ears into.favorite of mine.

031606792X|5.0|I've read all four books in the Twilight series and I loved them all. This book tied up a lot of things. I think it was left off so that Stephenie Meyer could write another one but the ending was great and well worth waiting for. One of the best in the series! I definitely would recommend reading this book and this series!
B000HWZ4A2|4.0|A decent adaptation, as would be expected given that Ms. Rand wrote the screenplay.    I would love to see it re-done as a miniseries, so that all of the secondary characters can be explored more fully.  Elsworth Toohey is not shown in the film nearly as much as he ought to be, and is not nearly as sneaky in the film as in the book. The face of evil should have been explored more deeply. Likewise for Peter Keating. The face of incompetent hollow-suit scum should have been explored much more deeply.    Too bad there isn't a Liberty Channel to take up the cause...

I have it on my iPod (along with Neon Bible) and their music is very uplifting and soothing. It reminds me off sunny brisk Spring afternoons. It reminds me of Broken Social Scene, so if you like them, you'll probably dig this.
B00000DHTF|5.0|TRACKS is a great collection of outtakes by Bruce Springsteen, with some B-sides thrown in for good measure. Picking out highlights is pointless, as most of what's here is great, even if the idiosyncrasies that kept it from being released on an album before 1998 are easily discernible. This is a set that you must own.
074322454X|5.0|I've watched the Band of Brothers HBO series on several occassions and have found it to be one of the most powerful productions I've ever seen. With that in mind, when my brother-in-law offered me the opportunity to borrow his copy of the book, I was quite happy to take him up on it. I have definitely not been disappointed.<br /><br />For me there were two main differences between the book and the series. One is that the text just simply isn't (and couldn't be expected to be) nearly as impactful as the TV version. The images on the screen of concentration camp inmates, battle, and violence just can't come through from a book the same way as they can on screen. In that way the book is kind of a toned down version.<br /><br />At the same time, though, the book can and does go into more detail in regards to certain participants in the story. For example, Webster plays a relatively minor part in the series but is frequently heard from in the book. To me that makes the book and series really complimentary.<br /><br />I will add that the two don't match up entirely in terms of the details. It appears as though the producers of the latter chose to blend some things, attributing certain actions to \\"characters\\" that the book says were done or experienced by others. It's generally fairly minor stuff, though.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you've enjoyed the series, you should enjoy the book.

B000001Y5J|5.0|I have never been a Nine Inch Nails fan but I love this CD. It is powerful and explosive. I particularly like the extra track, \\"Physical.\\" The only downside to this CD is the long interval of blank tracks in the middle. It isn't so bad on a CD as it would have been on a tape, but it is still pretty annoying.
0440236738|2.0|Obviously, as you can see from my rating, I don't consider this a good thriller. It does too many things that it should not.<br />The plot is overdone and much too implausible. The surprises come like hail stones in a storm. The characters are colourful and unusual, too much of that. There is far too much melodrama. The revelations of past events are plain junk food for the mind.<br />On top of that, the narrative concept sucks. You have a first person narrator who is in the middle of the plot, and then every few chapters, a 3rd person narrator shows up who introduces mysterious personae in mysterious circumstances, who are obviuously somehow related to the central mystery of the disappeared elder brother of the central man, and his mysterious alleged murder.<br />I give two stars instead of one, because the author is good at twisting the tale. But then, the book is totally superfluous.
B000002IOY|3.0|you can definitely tell Over Kill from a lot of the other \\"smaller\\" Thrash bands. at worst, however, they may come across as an Exodus rip off. but anyway, the riffs on TYOD are pretty driving considering there is only one guitar player.  the vocals arent for everyone.  i personally dont mind the higher pitched range that bobby 'blitz' ellsworth has but for some it would come across as annoying.    if you enjoy Thrash Metal it wouldnt be a bad buy however its far from the \\"greatest\\".
B001EO748M|5.0|It seems to me that the Tudors are very popular these days.  Everyone and his/her grandmother have written a novel based on one of the characters (Anne Boleyn and Queen Elizabeth I are the most popular) and it appears that Hollywood is fast on its heels.  I enjoyed the first season of Showtime's The Tudors despite the fact that it focused more on Henry VIII's womanizing and debauchery than on the political aspects of the time.  In fact, season one was full of inaccuracies, some of them glaring, and I asked myself if the producers had bothered to hire a consultant or if they'd simply decided to create a fictional version of the era.  I thought it was sad, especially with such an incredible cast (Jeremy Northam, James Frain, Sam Neill, Nick Dunning). So, I was reluctant to watch the second season.  You can imagine my surprise that season two is more closely focused on real-life historical events and less enthusiastic about young Henry's exploits.<br /><br />The political stuff that took place during Anne Boleyn's reign, mainly Henry's decision to destroy the church, fascinated me, but what floored me the most was Natalie Dormer as Queen Anne.  She brought this character to life, making her as complex and as human as possible.  She isn't depicted as an evil vixen here, rather an ambitious and passionate woman who fought for what she wanted.  Yes, it is more than implied that her father had forced her to do many of the things she did, but she did them with her eyes wide open.  She was no doormat!  The season finale belonged to Dormer as she delivered one of the most emotive performances I've seen on television.  I was practically in tears.  That episode was all about Anne Boleyn and her execution, and she will be missed next season.  Jonathan Rhys Meyers does a wonderful job playing the young and charming Henry VIII.  The character is despicable, though he is sometimes also depicted as somehow naïve about the people around him.  Meyers humanizes the character.  Henry shows a flicker of discomfort every now and then when it comes to ruining Catherine of Aragon and genuine pain for ordering to behead More.  The episode closes with Henry eating from a very creepy platter with a dead swan, which I think foreshadows his decline, looks-wise.  He gains weight around the time he's married to Jane Seymour.  Many great actors leave the series in this season (Northam, Dunning, and others), but new ones are introduced.  I look forward to watching season three.  One thing is certain though:  Dormer will be missed.ows a flicker of discomfort every now and then when it comes to ruining Catherine of Aragon and genuine pain for ordering to behead More.

1582701709|1.0|Let me tell you about how \\"The Secret\\" made me stop using a mailbox as a loo, while giving me loads of money!  I'm sorry, that hasn't happened yet, I just want it to be so, and I know, in my heart, that someday it will be. I also visualized a world in which people could move beyond flim flam, faith healing, mythical abundance, and tricks to make their way. I dreamt so fondly of a world in which people, by producing, working, and making the world a better place, would come together and support themselves and their community. It happened! That utopia has come to pass, and now no more self-help books are necessary! People are self-sufficient! Clearly, all it took was one person to make the universe realign and bring prosperity and love to all. If the universe was a cold, godless place filled with selfish people grasping desperately for the path of least resistance, that would mean that not one person on the earth has ever believed in a world beyond that. Thank the Lord that I can, alone, realign all the matter of the universe and bend physics to my will. My brain waves are part of the reaction, so they make it happen! Every part of everything is responsible for what it is, and our brains are so much more than pans filled with a soup of headmeat and electrolytes! Bless the day!

055358894X|4.0|I picked up Scott Lynch's The Lies of Locke Lamora with high hopes because I've really got a thing for stories about confidence men. I don't know why. I guess that's something to philosophize about another time...<br /><br />I did like Locke Lamora. Lynch has created a unique and fascinating world full of wonderful creations such as a crime boss who rules his empire from a houseboat, his little daughter who sits on his lap drinking ale and kicking subordinates with her steel-toed boots, a blind priest who begs for alms and eats gourmet meals off fine plates in his luxurious cellar, noblemen who live in glowing glass towers, a blood-sucking rose garden, alcoholic oranges, and women who fight jumping man-eating sharks for sport. This is truly entertaining stuff!<br /><br />The pace of the novel was quick and the plot was simple, but interesting. Flashback interludes often broke up the action, which was occasionally irritating. At first I wondered if the editor had dropped the manuscript and not got it put back together in order, but I soon realized that these flashbacks serve to give us information about the world without major info-dumps, and backstory on the characters without having to watch them grow up. The pace escalated during the last 100 pages or so, and I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Scott Lynch generally writes very well, but I do have three minor complaints in that regard. First is that the first half of the book is slightly over-written. The dialogue is too witty and clever. The smartest and best-educated people you know would have felt dull-witted while conversing with Locke and his gang of thieves. The narrator, also, tries a bit too hard to impress, and this makes for some slightly awkward prose. But the writing was toned down in the latter half of the book as the action picked up and things got more serious. I expect, now that Mr Lynch has proved himself, his writing style will become more natural, and better for it.<br /><br />Second is the profanity. While I don't mind reading profanity in a fantasy novel (especially one whose main characters are the dregs of society), if it is overused, it loses its potency. I once remarked to one of my grad school professors that he needed to coin some new curse words because he cursed so much that it was impossible for his students to know when he was really mad. Likewise, Locke and his friends curse so often for no apparent reason that, by the end of the novel, when those words would have been most meaningful and appropriate, they lose all effect and the climactic scenes lose a bit of poignancy. I don't doubt that Locke and his friends would curse as much as Mr Lynch portrays but, since we can't actually hear inflections and tones of voice, Mr Lynch would do better technique-wise to make those words count by using them to give us clues about a character's state-of-mind.<br /><br />Third, there are 499 pages in my hardback edition, and I think the word \\"alchemical\\" was used 499 times in this story. If you've got some friends who want to read The Lies of Locke Lamora with you, I suggest getting together with a bottle of your favorite liquor, appointing a designated reader (and driver), and every time he or she reads the word \\"alchemical\\"....<br /><br />But these are minor complaints -- enough to keep this from being a 5-star book, but not enough to keep me from greatly enjoying it. I'm looking forward to the next installment. If there's anything I like nearly as much as stories about confidence men, it's stories about pirates, so the two combined should be just my thing.

His stuff is always interesting at least.      The production is reminiscent of Born to Run.  They throw everything but the kitchen sink in.  From Doo wop background vocals to cash register effects.  Tons of piano and guitar fills.  All of it laid over one of the best rhythm sections in the short history of rock music.    The songs are all melodic.  Good tunes that stick.  You know what I mean.  A couple have lyrics that remind me of songs from the first 2 albums.  Characters and stories that sound absurd but come to represent different things for different ears.      So ol Bruce put it together pretty good here.   It'll be interesting to hear the next one.  And that's what a showman does... leaves you wanting more.

B001PPLIFU|2.0|I really do not know anyone who is such a bond fan as I am, (personally).  I have always enjoyed the bond films for their genre, style and the era in which they were produced.  One of the best things about these movies was the themes.  They had crazy villains, women with ridiculous names and gadgets from \\"Q\\" branch.  However since this \\"reboot\\" of the franchise, I've been a bit worried.  I enjoyed Casino Royale for many attributes but some things just didn't fit in a bond film, at least they had Martin Campbell.  Now you can say \\"It's the way Bond was supposed to be,\\" but think, why was Bond so popular in the first place?  Why did it last this long?  On to this film, the action was too real-like to be a Bond film, too much drama and it makes out Bond more of a stereotype being played by an actor rather than Craig being the real thing.  When you watched either Sean, Roger, Timothy or Pierce, they had their own way of style but they brought the character to life in their movies.  My personal favorites were Sean and Pierce.  Quantum of Solace was just taken too seriously to be a Bond movie, too caught up in emotion and adding elements to something you would see out of a Jason Bourne movie.  Roger Ebert mentioned, \\"James Bond is not an action hero!\\"  I just hope that they never hire a director again such as Forester, with one second action frame sequences or over exaggerated impacts.  I hope the franchise doesn't go sour with this new \\"popular\\" reboot disease that's currently in Hollywood.
B0012GMW0C|4.0|Wow!  I'm a big fan of early Journey but, I've never gone back to the beginning.  I'm glad I took a chance on this album.  It's a lot different than what I thought it would be.  Interesting and very progressive.  I would almost say it was like a progressive, rock, jazz style that after a few listens grows on you.  The more you listen to this, the more you get to appreciate the technicality of the music.  It is not the pop oriented Journey that many people are used to.  It makes me wonder where this band would have gone if this band line up had continued as it had been on this album.  Pretty cool stuff.
B0011HOEY4|4.0|The former bodyguard of a Harlem mobster decides he wants to corner the heroin market in New York City.  He not only wants to corner it, he wants to sell Grade A pure dope by cutting out the middleman and getting his supply direct from where it is made:  in the jungles of Southeast Asia.  So he goes to Vietnam himself (during the height of the Vietnam War) to establish his contacts, then smuggles the heroin into the country via military cargo planes.  His dope becomes such a runaway success he quickly becomes the biggest underground kingpin in New York--a mobster who effectively eludes the clutches of the city's corrupt police force, which wants in on the action--and the target of a 24/7 investigation by a handful of honest police officers.<br /><br />Such a story, if fictitious, would defy believability; but truth is indeed stranger than fiction.  Based on the true story of Harlem drug lord Frank Lucas, director Ridley Scott's AMERICAN GANGSTER is an outstanding depiction of the gritty, violent underworld, set in the turbulent Seventies.  Scott doesn't just film a scene; he presents a powerful visual that makes the viewer flinch.  From smoke-filled bars in Saigon to filthy Harlem tenements, Scott tells this gripping story through impressive, thought-provoking cinematography.<br /><br />Equally impressive is the cast, headlined by Denzel Washington as Frank Lucas, and Russell Crowe as New Jersey detective Richie Roberts.  Both actors are superb:  Washington as the brooding, sometimes sinister gangster; Crowe as the honest cop with several vices of his own.  Both roles are on an inevitable collision course; yet when this collision ultimately occurs, it's anticlimactic and almost glossed over, which was my only disappointment with this most remarkable film.  I was also impressed with Josh Brolin, the ringleader of the corrupt New York detectives on the take.<br /><br />Packed with action, drama, suspense, and intrigue, AMERICAN GANGSTER brings a difficult story to uneasy life, and shows that Scott plus Washington plus Crowe are a winning combination indeed.<br />--D.

0525951113|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and the technology that is behind the plot.  I think that we are not far away from these things becoming a reality in our world and should take note of the ways in which creative minds such as Daniel Suarez think up ways in which we could be vulnerable.      My one complaint is that I read this book too soon so now I have to wait for him to write the next one.

B00005JOA0|5.0|This production is an excellent adaptation of Anne Bronte's second novel, which I have just finished reading after watching this BBC adaptation first.  True, changes were made from the original plot to adapt it to screen; but those changes do not inherently alter the plot and/or spirit of the work - those changes primarily consist of some added scenes that are implied rather than described, and also a changing of Helen returning to Wildfell Hall after Arthur Huntingdon's death rather than Gilbert going to seek her at her uncle's house.  And some lessening of some of the subplots and dialogue.  On the whole however, all the performances are excellent and each actor played the part as described by Bronte to perfection.  Toby Stephens and Tara Fitzgerald are truly excellent as Gilbert and Helen Huntingdon/\\"Mrs. Graham\\" - the Tenant of Wildfell - who has escaped her debauched, abusive husband to try and rear her son away from the contaminating influence of his father.  BUT the performance that stands far and away above the others is Rupert Graves as Huntingdon - while the others are excellent - his is something like a volcano erupting on the screen.  I have NEVER seen such an amazing acting performance in my entire life by ANYONE as his performance as Huntingdon.  He plays Huntingdon's sociopathic reactive attachment disordered personality to perfection!!!!  I was completely amazed and blown away by it and thought about it for many days afterward.  If this had been a feature film he should have easily been nominated and won an Oscar for this performance - truly incredible.  I've seen him in other performances but this one will be forever etched on my mind.

0316017922|3.0|Gladwell seems to have perfected a formula:<br />1. Latch onto a catchy concept.<br />2. Think of a great, catchy one- or two-word title.<br />3. Write a thin, small book.<br />4. Start your book with a decent analysis of some facts that support your catchy thesis, hook the reader, then let the book slide into a series of anecdotes and stories. Don't \\"prove\\" your thesis, just illustrate it.<br />5. Charge a lot for it (in both absolute dollars and cost-per-word).<br />6. Get a terrific, minimalist cover design.<br />7. Let the royalties and accolades roll in.<br /><br />Each of Gladwell's three books (\\"Tipping Point,\\" \\"Blink,\\" and \\"Outliers\\") follows this formula. It's a proven winner, and at the end of this book, he goes into full rooting mode for another hit in his Acknowledgements: \\"[A colleague] and I have been two for two so far, and...here's hoping we go three for three.\\" Wow. Let's just set up a toll-booth.<br /><br />I don't agree with the five-star reviews. The book is just too thin, anecdotal, and un-analytical to be taken very seriously. On the cover flap, it says that \\"Tipping Point\\" changed the way we understand the world, \\"Blink\\" changed the way we think about thinking, and \\"Outliers\\" will transform the way we understand success. Uh, no. They are all decent books with provocative theses, but none has enough \\"there\\" there to change the way most people think about anything.<br /><br />I also don't agree with the one-star reviews. Gladwell's topics are provocative, his books are easy reads (this one took me just a few hours on vacation, and I'm not that fast a reader), and the stories and anecdotes are interesting. I found myself pretty convinced that birthdates are important to hockey success (so he hooked me with the first part of the book), but each successive chapter became less fact-based and more story-based. That said, it's a nice easy read, and I learned a thing or two. His books are not worthless.<br /><br />So I give it a nice easy 88-mph down the middle three stars. I must admit, I admire the success he has had with his formula. He makes it look pretty easy.e has had with his formula. He makes it look pretty easy.

B001AI6ZGO|5.0|AGITATION FREE arose from the WEST BERLIN KRAUTROCK scene back in 1967, but never obtained true international recognistion, unlike the BERLIN bands Tangerine Dream, with at least 50 albums, ASH RA TEMPLE/ ASHRA, and Klaus Schulze. For whatever reasons, AGITATION FREE fell just short of this level of international success.  This is a pity, because besides their first album MALESCH, their second album (called SECOND), and four other titles, this band has almost NO discography.  Nevertheless, their talent was recognized by the Goethe Institute, who sent the band on a tour of the Near East sometime in 1972. While on tour, the band made \\"field recordings\\" of Near Eastern musicians, and street sounds. Combined with their long experience jamming in the progressive, FLUXUS influenced BERLIN music communes, the album MALESCH was born.  Unlike most albums recorded today, this album works as a unit, flowing from one idea, song title, cultural and musical influence to another seemlessly.  The album opens with some Arabic street sounds, dissolves into a far out groove based song, only to dissolve again into a KOSMIK MUSIK influenced piece.  By the time that song winds down, youre propelled into a marimba based number, reminiscent of Steve Reich's  experimental composistions. Whether the band is focusing on their lead guitar player's smooth tone and fluid melodic movements,  or the elastic bass and drum interplay, or the organ and mellotrone washes, each song relaxes the heart, and excites the imagination simutaneously. When one theme is finished, more of their middle eastern FOUND STREET MUSIC is brushed over the soundscape, and a new song arises. Some have compared the band's sound to the Grateful Dead period, when they were transistioning between songs, with modal jazz structures, ambient sounds, and world percussion. (THINK: Europe '72, and the PROLOGUE/EPILOGUE songs).  It's an obvious comparison, however, there are no lyrics, interrupting the psychic, psychedelic flow of the music from one \\"number\\" to the next.  Both sides of the original \\"album\\" merge song to song. Neither is this KOSMISCHE MUSIK, where all the songs are 20 minute epics of meandering sonic washes, or those horrible synth arpeggios.  AGITATION FREE employs melodies played primarily on the electric guitar, with some keyboard and tonal percussion used for more than just color.  These colorful, miasmic negative spaces help to frame the density and beauty of the full band instrumental arrangements.  Even with the Arabic writing on the cover, and the middle eastern  titles to the songs, the real \\"world music\\" influence is nowhere NEAR as prevalent as you might hear in EMBRYO's \\"STIEG AUS\\" album, Or Dzyan's ELECTRIC SILENCE album, where arabic scales and instruments abound.<br /><br />Who would love this band? If you like music with psychedelic,  jazzy interplay, spiced up with bits of middle eastern music framing inventive instrumental rock, you'll enjoy this album.  If you are impressed with instrumental prowlness, and experimental composing, then you'll find this album to your liking. In fact, with the rerelease of these albums, along with new \\"bonus cuts\\" on each album, you can finally hear for yourself what has to be one of the best kept secrets of the KRAUTROCK movement.  Before now, you had to search out those GARDEN OF DELIGHTS editions, or find an old 1992 SPALAX MUSIC import from France, to hear this band.  And, take it from me, that gets pricey.  Right now, REVISITED MUSIC has these albums rereleased on CD, in nice, gatefold editions, with booklets that cover the history of the band, not to mention clean remastering.

In the first season, I really didn't like her. She was the other woman and she was determined to usurp Katherine. After watching the second season I fell in love with her. Despite her shortcomings and personal ambitions, I think that Anne was a very passionate woman who found herself the victim of political manipulations, especially those of her father.     Natalie Dormer was absolutely wonderful in this role! She really brought Anne Boleyn to life and I will miss her in the coming seasons.

B00008G8LF|5.0|I have watched this movie many times. As i have lived in Thailand for several years now, i can see the \\"recreations\\" of the Royal Palace as well as many other places in Thailand are breath taking. I would use the \\"subtitles\\" if you are wathiching it with anyone who is Thai. My wife is Thai and as she watched it, she commented many times that the 90% Chinese Actors who are in the movie \\"acting\\" as Thai and trying to speak the language is MAYBE 50% at best. Other than the language problem and the obvious \\"holywood\\" spin, it is a VERY good and positive movie of the events of King Rama the 4th and the problems between Thailand and the Burmese/British/French ( research your history) in the time period in the DVD. That said, i still watch it when i can. It is a great movie. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to have an inside too Thailand during that historical time.  Shawn

B00003CXRM|4.0|O Brother, Where Art Thou?  An all time favorite, I laugh out loud every time I watch this movie.  Some people don't get it, one either loves it or doesn't.   Great movie to have around whenever you want to \\"keep on the sunnyside\\"  D
0156030209|5.0|This is my favorite book of all time. Why? Because everyone who reads it will get something different from it. Just what is it about? Alot really depends on your own interpretation. To me, it is a commentary on belief systems and what you in your own mind want to believe, and how that affects what you do, etc.  This is a good book for young adults to read. I hope they don't make it into a movie, as I would not want to see a literal interpretation of this book (M. Night Shamalann (sp?)) has the movie rights.
B000059QYB|5.0|I really like this CD and had no problem in getting it from the seller. Excellent experience!
B000W1V5OC|5.0|The trimuphant and tragic \\"End of an Era\\" portrays the final Nightwish concert of Tarja Turenen.     To say it simply, the concert is a wonder. The songs, the spectacle, everything dominated, not a dull moment in the entire performance. Everyone performed to the peak of their abilities, and it shows. \\"Nemo,\\" Nightwish's pinnacle achievement, especially rang true. Marco's interruption of Tuumoas' solo is especially pleasing. You can see the pride in Tuumoas' face as Marco salutes him.     John Two-Hawks' performances were also enchanting. The Finnish crowd was amazed by this Native American legend's appearance. During his oration at the end of \\"Creek Mary's Blood,\\" he had the crowd silenced.    At the end of the performance, there wasn't a dry eye in the house, the audience, or the band. Jukka especially could be seen crying. I admit I was misty-eyed as well. It wasn't all from the wonder of the show, it was knowing as soon as this show was over, so was the Nightwish I knew and loved. (I won't dredge that controversy here.)    The only problem I had was with the documentary, which was a little dry, and the text so tiny you had to crawl to the screen to read it.
B000093OU8|5.0|AWESOME CD - every track fantastic - if you love Irish tinged music - even heavy guitar - this is a perfect CD
B00064AM6C|4.0|This was a great collection of old footage from the group. Very blues, very loud and fast paced. Great guitar work and shots of it. Its amazing how much noise two people can put out.
B000VH19CU|5.0|I kind of stumbled into listening to Nirvana after hearing throughout my adolescence that they were the progenitors of modern alternative rock.  After a few listens of \\"In Utero,\\" the group's last studio album before Kurt Cobain's suicide in 1994, I'm convinced that the statement is true, and that this album is the proof.<br /><br />As I sit here writing this review, we're coming up on fifteen years since Cobain's death, and the music of his alienation from society, and of his discontentment with fame, grows sweeter somehow with the passage of time.  Every song on the album drips with the raw anger and malaise of a man not at one with the world around him (to put it mildly, in Cobain's case), the lyrics sheer proof of Cobain's songwriting prowess.  The darkness comes to a head early with \\"Heart Shaped Box,\\" a personal favorite from the album, but bites back fiercely throughout the album.<br /><br />The sound of the album as a whole is considerably less polished than that of breakout album \\"Nevermind;\\" let this be a warning to prospective Nirvana listeners.  While \\"In Utero\\" is the band at its finest hour, it's also the band at its darkest hour -- and I mean that in a very figurative sense.  Cobain sings of being \\"[his] own parasite\\" (\\"Milk It\\") and invites people to \\"Rape Me\\" in one track.  The sound is raw, rough, elemental, even a bit dirty in places -- exactly what a grunge record should be.  In fact, it hearkens back to the unpolished edges of \\"Bleach,\\" but with the backing of a major record company rather than that of a small independent studio.  And it's a variegated soundscape as well -- we go from the screamfest of \\"Tourette's\\" to the slow-by-comparison \\"Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge on Seattle,\\" stopping by the nearly-released single \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" as well as the acerbically-named \\"Radio Friendly Unit Shifter\\" on the way back.<br /><br />If you're a longtime Nirvana fan looking to finally get their last studio album, or a discoverer of the band looking to get a representative sample of how they sound, you cannot possibly go wrong with \\"In Utero.\\"  This is most definitely the finest hour of one of the finest bands ever to play music.

0262731541|5.0|I found Bicycling Science to answer every question I'd ever had while pedalling along wondering if I could be more efficient with this modification or that modification.  It's one of those standard texts that if there were a course on cycling, this would be required reading.  Covering subjects from wheels to warping you have to have this on your shelf if you're a serious cyclist.  It is time to provide an updated version however as carbon construction is hardly touched on. Instead of spending thousands on components, save yourself the money and read what works to gain you speed and reduces your drag.

B001B6EAOY|4.0|I bought this for my psp because I needed some memory and don't want to spends tons on something I can get for half the price. So it worked right out of the box, I had heard that they get fried if you start your psp with it in there well it didn't happen to me so I must have gotten one of the good ones. Now when buying these its like a game of chance cause I bought another for my brother about two months after and it seems as though his is defective, there was a hit in your face clue cause this apparent adapter had no serial on the flip side of the adapter it was weird cause I had bought from the same company, the good news is I will be receiving a replacement for it..     So beware that your playing a game of chance but all in all you cant lose.. Would definitely recommend this product.

B000SFJWLU|1.0|all the good reviews out here had me excited; thought this would be good, solid new & perhaps driving agressive metal... but it is contrived & presciptive, unoriginal; like \\"let's write something that will pass for metal\\".  the riffs, bridges, and complexity could have been written by record company guys or some kids who don't have much creativity writing or playing their insturments.  can't imagine these guys really feel great about their sessions recorded here if they are talented (assume they must be, we didn't get it on this album though).      for comparison (of new quality metal), check out Divine Heresy, there's new metal playing agressively with talent & precision (although the vocals can be deemed recycled Phil Anselmo in his 90's Pantera prime) - but, for a metal head; there's no holding back on that album's 'metal-ness' or talent / skill / writing or the musicianship on the album.     yep yep, there's some personality issues and singer controvery already last month at one of their shows, so maybe that band won't be around for the long term (Dino C. seems to leave a wake of upset people around / behind him-> but also very successful bands, record & concert sales, and maybe some of the best metal recorded in the last 10-15 yrs (FearFactory, etc..)     as far as these guys, at least when Metallica simpled it down in the 90's + 2000's they always could deliver driving quality. these 'fists' just sound weak at times, when they slow down, bridge together parts of their songs (don't know which band member is the weak link / fill - but they agreed to record it that way), so it sounds like something done 1,000's of times before (would never compare the fists to being anything other than a band that got some good reviews because of the metal void).     i hope to be wrong.  maybe they are better than what they chose to record here and be more agressive with the sophmore record and not hold back, we all remember how sebastian back surprised people with a heavier \\"monkey business\\" in the band's sophmore album after that whining ballad about \\"18 & life\\" ... i hope this is the fists equivalent to Skid Row's '18 & Life'; if they are really the 'hope for metal' then they'll come back next with something so aggessive (like Pantera's Vulgar + Driven) that it doesn't even sound like the same guys.      cool name, but there's work to be done to live up to the name and the cover artwork.

B000DN5W4I|3.0|A fantastic show from Joe and his rhythm section...too bad you don't get to watch the band's performance.<br /><br />Camera angles change every couple of seconds, regardless of what the musicians are doing. Zooms and quick pans won't let you focus on anything. I swear whoever directed this thing has attention deficit disorder. \\"Here's a shot of Joe...no, it's a REALLY tight shot of his guitar..no, wait look at the bass player's little finger...oops, don't look at that, look at these candles...no, here's a shot up Joe's left nostril...but wait, look at the hi hat...no, the audience...no, not that...\\"<br /><br />Geeze, let me watch the BAND will ya? Back up a little so I can see something and HOLD STILL for more than a second or two! What are ya...a six year old on Red Bull? This performance deserves smarter production.
1416562605|4.0|The White Tiger was recommended to me by a friend who read it with her book club. I am so happy she lent me the book, because it was such an entertaining and quick read that I almost want to read it again to catch anything I may have missed.  The book itself is not complicated, but the implications it makes are. Following the life of a self-described murderer-on-the-run turned entrepreneur, the reader is given a look into the mind of this boy from the slums of India, who is given the \\"lucky\\" break of becoming a driver for a wealthy man. Adiga masterfully employs the art of exaggeration and minimalizing simultaneously, as death and murder is dealt with in lighter terms, but the experience of buying liquor for oneself is a transcendental life-changing moment. It is all rationalized in the mind of \\"the white tiger,\\" who manages to be a voice that the reader interprets as psychotic, endearing, pitiful and selfish, all in the span of one page.   The book itself manages commentary on the current injustice that occurs in India, without being preachy. While I can't say I am walking away from finishing this and still pondering everything within the story, I would still recommend it to everyone I know as a quick, enjoyable and very well-written read.
B001RONVC2|4.0|I am enjoying this book as will other fans of \\"Upstairs, Downstairs\\" as the characters (particularly the \\"downstairs\\") are derived from the charcters in that miniseries.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|I felt compelled to write a five star review as the four star average does not do this CD \\"Justice\\". It is the best Metallica recording since, and yes that includes the beloved \\"Black Album\\".  Having just seen the band in concert, I am happy to report that new tunes like \\"All Nightmare Long\\" and \\"The End Of The Line\\" stand out as setlist favorites alongside such classics as \\"Master Of Puppets\\", \\"...And Justice For All\\", \\"One\\" and \\"Ride The Lightning\\".
B000JVT09C|1.0|This movie probably wins my award for Worst Movie of the '00s.  Every single thing about it is terrible.  It's so bad that they're re-rebooting the franchise rather than try to make a direct sequel to this.  Barf.
B000A2IPP0|5.0|I remember watching this movie with my children. We all enjoyed it so much. It is a movie for all who have an imagination and think that maybe there are other beings in our universe.    There are so many movies made for children today that are really great, but I don't think there are any that can take the place of \\"E.T.The Extra-Terrestrial\\"    For some reason I thought about the movie during the holidays and ordered it at a well known book store that carries vidios, as they did not have it in stock. After the holidays they informed me they could not get the movie as their distributor did not have it. I was very happy that Amazon.com had it in stock!    I bought the movie for my three 1/2 year old grandson to watch. He loves anything to do with dinosaurs and other unusual creatures. He loved the movie, and I enjoyed watching it with his mother and him. His mother also enjoyed it very much, as she had seen it when she was young.    It was very refreshing to watch this heartwarming and beloved movie once again. It is now in my vidio library.    Sincerely,    Helen Snider            Unable to send this review to you, as there are no buttons to submit the answer to your inquiry. Is there a link that I can send this to you?
1400063515|5.0|I found this book to be one of the most fascinating books I have read recently, and I have been reading a lot of similar books. I will not summarize the book here -- you can read one of the other 479 reviews for that. Suffice it to say that Taleb presents new and fascinating ideas that I had never heard before and backs them up with logic and evidence.   Some complain about Taleb's tone, that he sounds smug or angry. I was a little taken aback by his tone initially, but after a while I found it refreshing. It wasn't pandering or condescending. If you are the type of person who limits your reading by the tone of the messenger, this book is probably not for you. But if you are open-minded, this book is well worth you while.  This book was life changing for me. It has changed my thinking about a lot of different things. As an economics major, I am even more suspicious of economists. More importantly, I have recently retired and have a large amount of my money in a 401k. I always agreed with those who said the stock market was the best place to put your money because it has historically always out performed all other investments over the long term. I now realize that perhaps I am being a turkey and have changed my investments.
B001F290E4|4.0|This is a great CD!  First of all,  soul music lovers are already going to know these songs...these are the songs that stand the test of time and sound just as amazing now as they did originally. Seal's voice is amazing! He has put his own twist on these, and he really has done a impresive job...It takes gumption to sing songs like \\"A Change Is Gonna Come\\" and \\"People Get Ready\\"...Seal perfoms them beautifully. If you have a decent system, you are going to be blown away...great sound. Do yourself a favor - buy this one, you will be delighted you did.
B000J3EEBY|4.0|I liked this CD.  That's the problem, I only liked this CD.  There is nothing on it that I could put a handle on and take it with me in my mind when I left the house without music.  That is unlike the rest of Loreena's music to which I have listened.<br /><br />By the way, it didn't figure into my rating, but I hated the packaging.  Instead of a durable plastic cover, it is a cardboard cover.  I've found this kind of cover scratches the CD quicker, then the CD notes are loose in the cover. When I tried to put it in my storage case, the notes fell out.

B0015AARJI|5.0|Over the course of owning my PS3 i've gone through 4, count them 4, regular PS3 controllers; they are light, and cheaply made. The joysticks got loose and unresponsive in a matter of a month or two, other buttons also became more loose. NOW, ever since I purchased the Dual Shock 3, i've played with this controller as a hardcore gamer for numerous months (I puchased it right when they came out for sale). To this day I still have it and it works great, no loose joysticks. Don't settle for the older PS3 controllers, you'd be wasting your money.    HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B0000062FN|4.0|When I was in junior high school, Santana burst on the pop scene with a sound like nothing else then played on the radio. The eponymous album was excellent but somewhat commercial. But then came Woodstock and the musical storm that was Abraxas. Powered by a commercially successful electrifying cover of Peter Green's Black Magic Woman and chock full of other innovative sounds, Abraxas defined Santana and has overshadowed almost everything else Carlos Santana and his bands have done.<br />That's too bad, because the follow-up, commonly known as Santana III is at least as good if not better. I remember buying this in high school on the same day I bought Fleetwood Mac's Future Games. At the time, I was still under the spell of Abraxas and did not like this on first hearing nearly as well as I liked that. But there were a couple of cuts, notably Taboo and Guajira, that I thought superior and that kept this in frequent rotation for a long time.<br />Fast-forward thirty five years and Santana III was but a pleasant memory filed away with the rest of my vinyl. Then one day it appeared in my amazon recommendations remastered with bonus tracks at a price it was hard to decline, so I ordered it. And do you know what? It sounds better today than I remember it to have been.<br />Now, I still like Taboo and thrill to Guajira, but I have also developed an appreciation for the rest of the album. Add Batuka and Jungle Strut to the list of favorites. As for the bonus tracks, any bonus is welcome and all three here are worthwhile.<br />If you are an early Santana fan, then be sure to pick this up. If you came to like Carlos Santana after his more recent surge in popularity, pick this up and hear what his band sounded like when he was in his prime. Though I was tempted to give this five stars, I had to drop a star when I noticed a few minor problems with the remaster, most noticeable at the beginning of Jungle Strut.
031606792X|4.0|Fourth Installment to the Twilight Series.  Good series, this book like the first three is good.  The writer does a good job bringing the saga to an end.
B001IHJ97E|4.0|While I understand the frustration of viewers who own conventional (ie. 4:3) ratio televisions, I personally am thrilled with this DVD remaster.      I still recall enjoying this film in 70mm in theaters in its initial release, and this new DVD does its best to attempt to recreate that for home viewing, especially on larger 16:9 televisions.  The change in aspect ratios now make the \\"Brainstorm\\" segments 'pop' in comparison to the narrative portion of the film.    The first DVD was not even enhanced for 16:9 TVs, so the picture quality is much improved due to that factor alone.    The lack of any notable supplemental features is disappointing, however.
B00005JPS8|5.0|My favorite comic book character has always been Iron Man.  I was excited when I heard that there was going to be an \\"Iron Man\\" movie, and even more thrilled when I saw the first trailer.  The movie more than lived up to the hype.  I mean, come on...who wouldn't dream of owning a powerful suit of red/gold armor like this?<br /><br />There are two big reasons why the movie is so well done.  First, there's Jon Favreau.  Favreau is a comic book fan.  I've said for a long time now, that you have to know the comic book character in order to do a good movie.  Richard Donner read Superman comics.  Nolan is a Batman fan.  Sam Raimi has been a Spider-Man fan since he was a kid.  Favreau knows the character of Tony Stark and Iron Man.  And Favreau pulls out all the stops to turn in one of the best superhero movies of all time.  I put this one up there with the two Batman movies, Superman: The Movie, and Spider-Man 2.<br /><br />The second big reason is Robert Downey Jr.  He makes Stark jump off the screen.  Downey Jr. gives Tony Stark all of the suaveness of the multi-billion dollar tycoon as well as his humanity.  Downey Jr. can deliver a line as good as any of the best actors out there.  He's always been that good.  It's a shame that his various \\"distractions\\" have prevented him from showing everyone how good he is...until now!  This is Downey Jr.'s \\"coming back\\" role.<br /><br />It seems Stark only cares about making money, no matter who it hurts.  And in this case, he's given a rude awakening when he finds out that his company, which manufactures weapons, is killing many people around the world.  It is at this point that he decides to put an end to the company, and Iron Man is created, initially to save his life, but also to help bring his own company down and destroy the weapons that he has created.<br /><br />Enter Obadiah Stane, wonderfully portrayed by Jeff Bridges.  He's Stark's second-in-command, and there's more going on within Stane's own agenda than meets the eye.  The last thing he wants is to see the company go under.  After all, helped get the company off the ground with Tony Stark's father.<br /><br />Gwyneth Paltrow is perfectly cast as Stark's loyal secretary, Pepper Potts.  She seems to be the only one who sees that the change in Tony Stark goes beyond the damage to his heart.  For Pepper Potts, Tony Stark has finally found his heart.  Paltrow plays Pepper Potts without going over-the-top.  She seems to have an attraction for him, but something holds her back, and the scenes with Paltrow and Downey Jr. are very good.<br /><br />Finally, we have Terrence Howard as Stark's best friend, James \\"Rhodey\\" Rhodes.  While in the comic, Rhodes is a former pilot.  Here, he's an air force colonel with a lot of power within the military.  Howard does a decent job with Rhodes, and who can forget his great line as he's walking by the suit of Iron Man armor, \\"Next time!\\"  (If you aren't familiar with the comic, Rhodes takes over the mantle of Iron Man for a time and even eventually becomes \\"War Machine.\\")<br /><br />The special effects are absolutely brilliant.  Seeing Iron Man soaring through the skies with his boot jets is a treat.  He looks real slick in that suit of armor, and it's especially enjoyable seeing him go into action for the first time in his red and gold suit.<br /><br />The best superhero movies are those in which the focus is on the character, rather than the superhero.  Tony Stark is a character we like, and Robert Downey Jr. is the reason for bringing him to life on screen. And through Tony Stark, Iron Man works all the more when he's finally on screen.<br /><br />If there is one thing that I wished for the movie, it's that there was a longer climactic battle scene between Iron Man and Iron Monger.  I was also hoping that some of the battle would take place in the sky instead of entirely on the ground.  I wanted Favreau to really show what Iron Man can do.  But something like this is easily overlooked because themovie is so well done.<br /><br />Also, \\"Iron Man\\" is just plain fun!  It never takes itself too seriously, nor does it really tread into darker realms like some superhero movies.  But then, Iron Man isn't supposed to be a dark character.  Wearing bright red and gold armor, he represents a hero from way back when; when heroes were knights who wore armor and helped to defend those who couldn't defend themselves.  Stan Lee himself said that this was a big reason why he created a superhero who wears armor.<br /><br />I can't wait to see more of Iron Man and Robert Downey Jr. in \\"Iron Man 2.\\"  I have a strange feeling that it will be even better than this one...and that's saying a lot.fun!

B000WGWQG8|5.0|This is a great series with superb acting on the part of both Laura Linney and Paul Giamatti. It gives a very good history lesson and brings the past alive in a moving, factual way. My husband and I looked forward to every episode, and we found ourselves even choked up at times as we saw our American history unfold! What brave people our ancestors were, and how unknown everything was to them. I highly recommend this series for all ages, you will eagerly await every episode!
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|The movie was full of action. The joker was great, performed by Heath Ledger (may his soul rest in peace), however here are my remarks about the movie:     - Continuous action for 2:20 hours made the movie boring instead of exciting     - Dark theme, extremely dark. The movie becomes depressing after a while     - The joker being extremely evil, deserved a worse ending instead of simply being handed to the cops     - The soundtrack was poor     - Batman in the end is shown to the public as the villain and gets chased by police dogs!!!!! What a horrible and poor way to end a batman movie       However, I got to say the best thing about this movie was the joker. The dark knight wasn't about batman but about the joker. He was so bad, evil, sick, and dead smart. His tactics and plans were amazing, I got to salute him.
B001GQACGE|5.0|I'm a big fan of Amazon and I always check out the reviews on music and books before I make a final decision on purchasing something.  Well, I should not have went by the reviews on making a decision to buy Beyonce new cd.  I kept putting it off on buying it.  Her four singles on the radio (Single Ladies, Diva, Halo and If I Were A Boy)were all songs that I liked, so I was like bump the reviews I'm getting this album! She sounds completely different in all of them.    A high five to Beyonce for blocking out the critics and haters and trying something different! When I slip this cd in my cd player I instantly fell in love with it.  I love her voice.  I love her words. I LOVE all the funky and unique beats. Beyonce was definitely being creative when she put together this album.  I will admit she's lacking the soul she so famous for having in her songs, but that doesn't take away from her cd at all.    She told fans it would be something DIFFERENT and very personal, so we were warned.  Yes, it's different but it's good.      My favorite songs are:  If I Were A Boy (not crazy about the tempo, but I love the words to this song)  Halo (beautiful and deep song)  Disappear (very emotional song..she seems to be pouring her heart out)  Broken Hearted Girl (all women should be able to relate to this one.  LOVED it)  Radio (I LOVE her voice in this song!)  Diva (This song is to ALL her haters! Especially the ones who love to talk shhh...lol.  Just listen to the words! And the beat..OMG..SICK!)  Sweet Dreams (This is my FAVORITE song on the entire cd!!!!)  Video Phone (SICK beat!!!! Cute song)    In life and in the entertainment world you can't please everybody.  If you are a true Beyonce fan and very open minded when it comes to music you'll love this cd, but for her fans who expect the same ole same ole from Beyonce you'll be highly disappointed with this one.    I was looking for Ego and Scared of Lonely on these cds, but I just found out they were on the deluxe edition.  Oh,and I do agree she didn't need two discs for eleven songs.  All the songs could have easily been placed on one cd.    Good job Beyonce! I love it!
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|A story of 5 New Yorkers who arranged a go-away party for their friend Jason whose travelling to Japan, only to discover later that night that their city is under attack by a huge monster whose truly unstoppable. Throughout the movie they run for their lives and they film it all on tape. So you see this movie from the perspective of a hand camera and you really live their horrific experiences.      Superb film, its like a good mix of Independence Day, War of the Worlds, Blair Witch Project, and Godzilla.
0060977264|5.0|I will agree with a fellow reviewer and say that \\"By the River Piedra...\\" is heavy on religious themes.  The theme with \\"The Other\\" is not my favorite.  I guess it's reasonable to believe that \\"The Other\\" is the antagonist, or perhaps there is no true villain.<br />There are many love stories in the world.  We'll say Romeo & Juliet is the cliche.  This story, in my opinion, surpasses any love story I have ever heard.  It's a modern day fairy tale (like most of Paulo's stories).  If the reader believes in that force known as love, then they will find themselves entranced by this story.  Throughout the tale, one will begin to see themselves as both lovers.  Every moment is beautiful, even the saddest.  It's a subtle, soothing tale for the heart.<br />As for the title of the review...<br />Pay close attention as you read.  If you find yourself very immersed in the story, you won't realize it until the end.  It's kinda funny though.
B001GKJ2DO|4.0|Sophie, a 20 year old girl whose getting married, invites 3 men to her wedding hoping one of them is her father that she never met. They arrive, meet her mother after a long time, and they try with Sophie to figure out who is her real father.      All the songs from the movie were originally composed by ABBA. Very nice and touching songs.     However there were more songs than dialogue, which kind of made us bored after a little while. I also wished it didn't include these little inappropriate scenes because it could have been a great family movie.     Overall, the movie was nice to watch. I rank it second after Moulin Rouge.
0307454894|5.0|We read this book for my bookclub and had one of the best discussions we've ever had.  It is a quick read, it pulls you in.  Interesting on more that one level - as novel and as history.
B000B5XOY8|5.0|I have seen this movie during my childhood around 100 times, but it so different now after you compare it to the other batmans that came after, including Batman Begins and the Dark Knight.<br /><br />Compared to the other movies, it is definetely one of the best. For a movie produced in the 80s, that one was very well directed. Very exciting with a very good story line.<br />Michael Keaton is a great Batman! Many think he was a better Batman than all the others.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson was also a great Joker. Thumbs up for him for performing the joker character the way he did. But I gotta say, Heath Ledger is the real Joker!<br /><br />Sound track is great. Batman's suit and weapons are very cool. I still think his batman car is way cooler than the ones in Batman Begins or Dark Knight.<br /><br />Great Movie after all.
B001EYGOEM|4.0|It's hard to forget just how awful her live performances are when you listen to the CD.  Obviously, pitch correction can hide a multitude of sins.  The sings are catchy but clearly designed to appeal to teenage girls.  It is impressive that she writes so much of her own stuff but after hearing her live, I think that maybe she should stick to songwriting
B000YAA68C|5.0|Great film by all means. Very romantic and sad at the same time.     Its about an American girl who was married to an Irish guy (Jerry) and they were both so much in love. Then, at the age of 35 he passed away from brain tumor.      Their relationship didn't end at that point. Before he died he prepared to her many letters that were planned to be sent in future dates. Letters asking her to sing at the Karoake (which she feared), reminding her of their beautiful moments together, planning trips for her with her friends, bringing her back to the place where they first met, and asking her to move on and fall in love with someone else.      She couldn't move on because she can't love anyone besides Jerry. She felt lonely many times. Her father left her and her mom at the age of 14, which made her promise herself to not be with any guy ever. Then she met Jerry who was a great man, but unfrotunately he died. She kept asking her self, why? What's the point?     In the end after facing the sad reality, she decided to move on. Actually, she probably will fall in love with that Irish singer (another guy) she met after Jerry died. We don't really know because the movie ended when she met him again in Ireland.      Quite a great film. I like it so much because at last I see a romantic movie that glorifies love between two married couple. All the other films describe love of unrelated couple, but this one was different.      Even though its sad, it teaches us the importance of being able to go one. People don't need to collapse when they lose someone they love. They need to know that this is life, and even if their loved ones have died, they are still alive in their hearts.     Wonderful movie, thumbs up
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|I saw the Broadway musical \\"Mama Mia\\" which was great. I think the movie version is even better because stage has limitations on size & effects. Some of the singing performance in the movie version (like Brosnan) isn't as good. But, that doesn't take much away. The thing about \\"Mama Mia\\" that I find so appealing is that the story line and song lyrics blend perfectly. It's one continuous story, rather than a story interrupted by songs forced into it like so many musicals. The best blend I have ever seen.<br /><br />\\"Mama Mia\\" is something most of us can relate to. Middle age love crisis that's a product of youthful indiscretion.  People of two generations finding their true calling after years of uncertainty & soul searching.  ABBA rocks!!  It's a great combination. Some critics may not like this movie, but I do, I do, I do, I do, I do.
B000YABYLA|4.0|Juno, a 16 year old girl, gets pregnant and offers her baby for adoption. She meets the perfect couple and they all agree that they will raise her child. Eventually the couple breaks up but Juno still gives her baby to the women who was committed from the very beginning to raising this child.     Juno then gets into a serious and loving relationship with her baby's biological father, whom is deeply in love with her, and so is she with him.     Interesting, sarcastic, and even a bit funny. A realistic film about a phenomenon that has been on the increase.     Ellen Page (Juno) is a very talented young address who will sure be a superstar one day.
0790730960|5.0|Batman happens to be my 4 year old daughters hero!  She loved all things Batman and when we realized this we instantly started searching for all of the Batman movies.  We immediately found the newer movies (Begins and Dark Knight) but struggled during the Christmas season to find the others!  After a lot of searching we found Batman Returns, this has to be one of her favorites so far!  I think this goes against all the rules of \\"sequels\\", usually the sequel to any movie is lacking in not only creativity but in just about all aspects.  Batman seems to be an exception to that rule!  The second is just as awesome as the first!
B000BEZPQE|4.0|You know a lot of the songs are going to sound the same when Corey has to tell you the name of it before they start playing.  But as the screaming crowds can attest to, the faithful still know every line and nuance.  If you're a casual fan this double disc probably won't interest you.  But if you're looking to enjoy your own private concert in your car to the annoyance of those around you, 9.0 Live brings more than enough.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|This is a great concert video.  The light show is breathtaking.  I must see for any Floydian.  Watch it in a dark room with the volume turned up a bit. I wish I was there when it was filmed.
B000PMLFRA|4.0|Lucas knows what is best for the Star Wars franchise and it is not Blu-Ray DVD .  The Technology has it's problems that has yet to be worked out .  Scream all you want Blu-Ray fanboys it ain't gonna happen not any time in the near future .  May the force be with you !
031606792X|4.0|I really enjoyed all four of the Twilight series books. I thought this book finished it up well, but I would still like to read more.  This book is an easy read, being geared for young teens, but it's a fun read. I was really surprised by the direction it took and it kept my interest.
B001Q1QF2O|5.0|Fans of the \\"hate this and that\\" of the first album will be slightly disappointed that Lily's new album takes a much deeper tone, but her latest album makes it up with better beats and more focus.<br /><br />I loved her first album, but after a while those songs did get a little old. It was her EP and some singles released after \\"Alright, Still\\" that I found to be richer and full of better beats. \\"It's Not Me, It's You\\" reflects the more mature and deeper music Lily is capable of making. I'll admit that not every song works, but most do and it leaves a lot of room for Lily to get even better with her next album.<br /><br />If you like songs that slap you around a little, songs with good beats, and songs that make you smile a little, pick this up.
B00004RFFS|5.0|I bought this movie for my friend. I wasnt interested in it, but we watched it together and it was so good. I'm gonna go bac to her house and watch it again.
031606792X|4.0|A must read that I couldn't put down until it was done!  I have read the entire Stephanie Meyers series and every book was better than the last. Gripping, enthralling and suspenseful this book helps you escape into another world mesmerized by every word.
B000002JNJ|5.0|thank you so much for your speedy delivery  and well described item.  GREAT SELLER!
0375707972|5.0|I was assigned this book for class but it turned out to be a thought-provoking and interesting read.  It brings up deep questions about morality, relationships, and guilt.  The translation was excellent and it felt as if the original were written in English.
B000002JOH|5.0|thank you so much for your speedy delivery  and well described item.  GREAT SELLER!
0743267478|5.0|Q&A is the book on which the movie Slumdog Millionaire was based.  It offers a very good look at several different societies and life-styles in India.  This is one of the best reads I've had in some time; and I highly recommend it for readers of any age.
B0018O4YT0|4.0|I finally watched this film after years of being curious about it. It was really pretty cool. Visually, it's stunning; a sci-fi/noir hybrid similar in tone (at least aesthetically) to \\"Bladerunner\\".<br /><br />Although the film is visually provocative, as well as intelligent and interesting, the main weakness is that none of the characters are really particularly engaging or well-rounded. So once you get past the nifty visuals and heady plot twists, there's not much to hold onto.<br /><br />It's interesting that this film came out so close in time to \\"The Matrix\\" because there really are a lot of similarities. Both films explore the idea that the mundane, everyday world around us is really all a ruse, and that some other force is using modern-day humanity as a pawn to advance their own agenda. And in both films, the main character is a unique man who has the ability to transcend the illusory game he's been plugged into and create his own destiny. I suppose both films are just modern takes on the age-old \\"free will vs predestination\\" dillemna.
B001KOFH2G|4.0|I actually saw this movie before getting into the series, so I really didn't know what all the fuss was about.  After watching it I thought it was a pretty decent SciFi actioner with some pretty clever jokes thrown in.  It wasn't until I watched the series sometime afterward that I realized how much it meant to some of the people around me.  As much as that movie was created to appeal to a broad audience, you simply don't get as much out of it unless you have a pre-existing affection for that crew.  Once I had that and went back to watch the film for a second time, it became very bittersweet to me, and, thusly, more important.  Not because it was somehow a better movie, but because it was part of a greater whole.  If I had only one complaint, it would be that some of the more overt Western themes seem to have been stripped down a bit when compaired to the show.  That was always something that I liked about the show and I did miss it somewhat in the film.  The Western-film lingo is still thrown around in some of the dialogue, but on the whole it feels like it embraces it's SciFi elements a bit more; I assume, because the producers found SciFi to be a more bankable concept for today's cinema-goers.
B001F0VHEM|4.0|Pink is a musical artist on a journey. I recently watched one of her first videos on YouTube, and I couldn't believe how awkward and uncomfortable she seemed in the manufactured role that had first been assigned her. Since her first album, she's continued to evolve and come into her own as a musician on her own terms, as opposed to a pop puppet.<br /><br />With \\"Funhouse\\", Pink takes her music to the most somber and mature place yet. Despite a few upbeat tracks, most of the album is reflective and mellow, dealing with issues of loss, regret, and conflicted motivations and emotions. While a couple of the tracks come off perhaps a little pretentious, you can't blame Pink for trying to grow as an artist. The best tracks, like \\"Sober\\" and \\"It's All Your Fault\\" pull off the difficult balancing act of being catchy pop songs with real emotional resonance.<br /><br />\\"Funhouse\\" might not be my favorite Pink album (which is still probably \\"I'm Not Dead\\") but it does have a couple of my favorite Pink tracks. I continue to look forward to following Pink along on her musical journey.
B0000067L2|4.0|It was a pretty good item. It was a birthday gift for my husband. He sure enjoyed it!
0316017922|4.0|This is equal to Gladwell's Tipping Point and better than Blink. It contains fabulous, specific examples of how brilliance is often a factor of early opportunities available to some and not others, from hockey stars to Bill Gates. The book slows toward the end, it seems as if there is filler to make it long enough for hard cover, and I can also make a case that the brilliance is in taking advantage of the opportunities that others ignore or don't appreciate. But it's a provocative, fine read.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great workout - it has 3 levels of intensity and to be honest even the first is tough but you get better and can move up.     What I like best is that the workouts are only 20 minutes so you can totally pushsyourself through plus I have seen results. It gets easier and it's not boring.
0316017922|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell has given us a wonderful and unique view of what makes some people more successful than others. I do think there are other key factors we need to consider as well. I recommend Bob Livingstone's book [[ASIN:1933648546 Body Mind Soul Solution: Healing Emotional Pain Through Exercise]] which provides exceptional information and strategies on how to overcome a variety of difficult issues through a unique approach to exercise.
031606792X|5.0|I love Stephenie Meyer, so this purchase was for my cousin, to complete her collection.
0345495004|4.0|For a first time writer, this was a well written factual non-fiction story about Frank and his lover.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|This is a remarkable documentary in scope and quality.  Made in the UK in the 1970's, it has a natural English perspective and focuses heavily on the European Theater.  However, it is balanced and does well at representing American, Russian, German, Japanese and other perspectives as well.  The most value to me was the testimony of military and civilian witnesses to the events not that far removed in time from the events.
B000002GJ7|5.0|When i stumbled across this album, I nearly dropped dead!  This is, in my mind, the most unbelievable displays of musicianship.  You won't be disappointed
B000MRAAJW|1.0|I did not realize when I purchased this product that it was for HD DVD's only so I never opened the package. I had a little difficulty navigating through the Web site to return it - Amazon was very helpful and ended up not charging me shipping to return it. I then ordered the correct version.
B001DUJNGS|4.0|All I can say is that this album is different from the other/previous albums of Enigma. Though some of the tracks bear the hallmark of Cretu, but most of them are unique in their own way. When I first hear it, I was not so fascinated by the tracks. Looks like they are quite ordinary. But after listening it few more times, I can say that they are indeed good. I think instead of discarding it by hearing it once, u should give it time and I bet u will start liking it.
1606800582|4.0|Good literature provides keen observations in behaviors and psychology of human beings when faced with moral choices and consequences, and this book definitely is filled with good stuff.  The main character, Mr. Henchard, is severely flawed and his iniquities are multiple, and yet, he also is so human and really hard not to have sympathetic feelings toward him in the end.  The writing is wonderfully philosophical and dramatic, especially the last paragraph of Elizabeth-Jane's reflection on life is movingly insightful.
B001ER4CSO|5.0|Ron Perlman IS Hellboy, just as he was The Beast in Beauty and the Beast, a primetime show at one time. I always enjoy everything he's in. This is a movie where the visual effects were actually a part of the movie that related strongly to the plot, and not just some razle dazle for audience 'eye candy.'<br /><br />Well worth the money I paid.
B000L3CHC0|5.0|This is my second Tissot and I love it. It looks much better than it's pictures.    Store shipped the package the same day, very quick service. Thanks.
B001K98MFU|5.0|The picture quality was stellar compared to the DVD and the English Dolby Digital Dub was using the same voice actors as Stand Alone Complex TV series.
B000W91RUG|5.0|My wife begged me for this for Christmas. Once I got it for her, we have continually laughed. To me, a future Seinfeld-type reputation should ensue for this comedy series. And Penny certainly doen't hurt the eyes, either, know what I mean?
B0000AQS0F|5.0|What can be said about this show that isn't described by every breath taking episode. It anything is to be said, it is that Firefly was a truly amazing show that was never given a chance. The cast of Firefly was superb. My favorite character is Wash played by Alan Tudyk. His sense of humor really lightened the mood of the show but also never took away from the parts that were meant to be hard, heavy, or sad. Joss Whedon really knows what the audience wants. Firefly was the greatest show ever. Just like his other creations Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Angel. This show was truly something special. I'm extremely happy that this show got a feature film, Serenity. I just hope that Fox will see the error of their ways and revive the show. I would really like to learn more about Book. He was a shepard who had an amazing knowledge of weaponry. That and I was hoping to see if Simon and Kaylee would act on their growing feelings for each other. Or if Wash and Zoe would see more turmoil in their marriage. But I guess we'll never know. But honestly, this show is perfect for anyone who loves a good sci-fi or western. Or a combination of both. And if you get this show, I highly recommend getting it's movie counterpart, Serenity to finish it off.
B0014KD46W|3.0|When I purchased this CD, and I read others reviews, I kinda expected a CD with powerful lyrics and beat. After listening, I almost feel some of you are trumping up this to make yourselves and your opinions look bigger than life. I expected something closer to the thump of the \\"Roll With It\\" CD. Nope, it doesn't get there. This did not satisfy my need to \\"feel\\" Winwood at his best. Seeing him live, or buying the \\"Crossroads 2007\\" and enjoying his interactions with the likes of Clapton, et. al, will just have to do.
0765342294|5.0|This is such a though provoking book. Once I started it, I couldn't put it down. Then afterwords, I wanted more. Definitely the best of the series, but Ender's Shadow comes close.    It follows a child and development of his psychology as he is forced to survive his environment. In this futuristic world, it is fascinating to discover some of the technology is similar to what we have today (seeing that the original book came out in the early 1990's).    GREAT BOOK!!!
B001JFZ118|5.0|I've been a long time Highlander fan, but with past DVDs I've always been disappointed with both the audio and video, got a PS3 and the audio problems went away, but the somewhat lackluster video was still present. The Immortal Edition DVD I had just seemed a little noisy or grainy to get any visual pleasure, even by Standard Definition means.    Then the 2009 Lionsgate came, whether this edition was remastered I'm not sure, though it does look more visually appealing to me, though I was a bit worried with the same Menu screen from my previous DVD. The image is not as good as Lionsgate's 2004 Highlander 2 DVD, but I'd recommend this one non the less. I so hope for all the Highlander movies to come to Blu-Ray and look and sound great.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|Political and entertaining at the same time. Set in what seems like a different world, it reflects much of our own social challenges of the time.
B00006F2TV|4.0|i like this movie the best out of all the spider-man movies. its great for kids to watch and has a little of everything in it. humor, a love story the villian so much. spiderman is a great movie for everyoe!!!!
8185300534|5.0|I Am That: Talks with Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj by Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj is a contemporary spiritual classic with a very direct, no-nonsense style. You may want to read one page at a time and contemplate the meaning of the pearls of wisdom. For instance on page (346) you find this passage - \\"In awareness you seek not what pleases, but what is true\\". On page (520) you come across this passage, \\"True knowledge is ever fresh, new, unexpected. It wells up from within. When you know what you are, you also are what you know. Between knowing and being there is no gap\\". Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj is a teacher who will help you come to a better understanding of yourself. He was a simple man who lived a humble life in Bombay until the age of 84. Many people have sought him out while he was alive.
B001HN6972|5.0|THE READER is a love story between Michael Berg (David Cross and Ralph Fiennes) and Hannah Schmidt (Kate Winslet).  But the two major twists to the film, which is based on Bernard Schlink's book, is that Michael is a young man, 15 or 20 years Hannah's junior, and both Michael and Hannah have so-called skeletons in the closet.  And it is only when years have passed that those secrets are revealed in the most unsettling circumstance while Michael is a law student and observes the proceedings for Nazi war crimes that took place in Auschwitz during World War II, which included female Nazi guards; the intensity in those scenes are highly moving.<br /><br />But the touching and somewhat puzzling part about Michael and Hannah's relationship is how Michael reads to Hannah.  He reads to her various classic pieces of literature, especially his droll reading of \\"Huckleberry Finn.\\"  But what would have a lasting impression would be a book called \\"The Lady and the Dog.\\"  As the film progresses, viewers will see the significance of Michael's readings and how his affections for Hannah, even as an adult, never faded despite subtle expressions that showed his remoteness towards her.<br /><br />Viewers can owe those scenes and the overall film to the screenplay by David Hare, the cinematography of Roger Deakins and Chris Menges, and Director Stephen Daldry.  All of their contributions are commendable in evoking the emotions of the characters and the storyline.  Indeed, this is another film worthy of Academy Award accolades in all categories.  And an exceptional film that promotes literacy.
B000EGCITG|5.0|I love this CD by Pink! Some of the language is harsh but if you like music that tells it like it is, you will love it too!  \\"Please Mr President\\" is an awesome song that was banned from many radio stations because it was against former President Bush. Some people can't take the truth. I bought this CD mainly for that song but ended up loving it all. Thanks Pink! keep em coming!
0545128285|1.0|The Tales of Beedle the Bard actually annoyed me.  I found the format to be confusing and it didn't tie into the Potter books for me.  I only grabbed it out of sadness that the Harry Potter series has ended.  I enjoyed how it ended and feel it should have been left at that.  This book seems over indulgent and for me...it was a waste of money.  Perhaps if I read it again in ten years I will feel differently.  Oh, well.  JK is still a genius and I can't wait to see the non HP books she puts out!
0385341075|5.0|This little book is brilliant. Mr. Jones transports you to a South Pacific island and drops you into the village as one more villager. You feel as if you are there on the island and one of the village instead of a reader. Upon reflection, there are so many choices made by the author that seem just perfect. He realistically takes you from quiet uneventful days to events of shocking brutallity. The weary, dispassionate nature of the murdering soldiers, the shy mothers taking turns as teachers, and the noble, selfless truth of Matilda's mother are absolutely real. Even little things, like the villagers' treatment of the pigs are just perfect.  The fact that all of this story is intertwined with Great Expectations is quirky, interesting, believable and engaging. I went back and reread Great Expectations. I would love to see this book read by students after they read Great Expectations. A great story is powerful.  As an aside, the island setting and the political conflict and war are real. Most of us probably have very little knowledge about the specific details, but outside knowledge is not necessary to the story.  This book was terrific for a book group discussion.
0783228007|4.0|Following the huge success of Dirty Harry, Clint Eastwood returned to the genre that made him a star, the western, in Joe Kidd, a turn of the century story about a range war.  Just sentenced to a 10-day sentence in jail, Joe Kidd is approached by a rich landowner, Frank Harlan, to serve as a guide for a hunting trip of sorts, a hunt for a Mexican causing problems with land rights by the name of Luis Chamas.  Kidd at first turns down the offer, but when Chamas and his gang steal Joe's horses and beat one of his hired hands, he signs on to help Harlan.  But on the trail with Harlan and his posse, Kidd finds out how brutal Harlan can be in his search for Chamas.  This was a good movie from director John Sturges, but it's only 88 minutes long.  Another half hour could have made this movie a near classic with some plot/character development.  As is, there's some good gunplay with some modernized weapons, scoped rifles and Mauser pistols.  Composer Lalo Schifrin's score is memorable, almost an Americanized spaghetti western score, and the locations in California and Old Tucson stand out too.     In one of his more relatively laid back roles, Eastwood plays Joe Kidd, a small rancher who sees a way to make some easy money after he's been wronged.  Kidd fights for the little man here when he realizes how corrupt people can and will be.  Robert Duvall is a good villain here, as always, as Frank Harlan, the landowner looking to kill Luis Chamas so almost 600,000 acres will be his.  Duvall's good but like several characters here, his part could have been developed more.  In a small part John Saxon plays Chamas, a bandit of sorts who is talked about more than he's actually seen.  Don Stroud, Paul Koslo, and James Wainright lend support as Harlan's guns-for-hire posse. Stella Garcia has a strong part as Helen Sanchez, Chamas' woman who is trying to help him no matter what the cost.     This was the first time I saw Joe Kidd, but reading some reviews I found out scenes have been cut from the movie. Take warning then, and trust those reviewers.  The DVD has a scratchy-looking widescreen presentation, production notes and cast and crew info, and a trailer that plays up the action in the movie.  An enjoyable Eastwood western for sure, not a classic, but one worth checking out!
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I don't claim to know a thing about the psyche of real serial killers, so I don't know if Dexter is anything like the real thing or a completely fantasy, but the character in this eponymous show makes for compelling viewing.<br /><br />Dexter is a serial killer, yes, but he's really a vigilante, and I'm not advocating vigilantism as an actual good thing for society, but it makes for an interesting character.  Dexter has a \\"code\\" and we learn in the first episode that he only kills people who have literally gotten away with murder, either by not being caught or slipping through the criminal justice system.<br /><br />Dexter's job puts him into a perfect position to learn the tricks of the trade and monitor police investigation: he works as a blood spatter forensics expert with the Miami PD.<br /><br />Michael C. Hall is brilliant in the title role, and the remainder of the cast compliments perfectly.  Kudos to Julie Benz as Dexter's girlfriend, Rita, who has two children from a previous abusive marriage, Jennifer Carpenter (who just married star Hall in real life) as Dexter's sister Debra, Lauren Velez as homicide supervisor LT Laguerta (who always seems to have an agenda other than what is stated), David Zayas as detective Angel Batista, who wears his heart on his sleeve, which makes him more human and vulnerable, James Remar in flashbacks as Dexter's now-deceased cop step-father and Erik King as intense Sgt Doakes, the only policeman who has an instinctive distrust of Dexter.<br /><br />The writing is brilliant, with gripping storylines and entertaining dialogue.  In the first episode we see that Dexter has a rival in the \\"ice truck killer\\", and as the season progresses we follow the pursuit by the police department and the admiration by Dexter.<br /><br />Dexter is an interesting character not only because he's a serial killer who dispatches bad people, but also because he reveals to the audience things he has hidden from himself.  In the opening episode he describes himself as a remorseless monster, but we see Dexter show honest care and, dare we say it, love for his fellow man and especially for his friends, coworkers and family.<br /><br />This show keeps you on the edge of your seat, but you also feel as if you're really inside a police procedural.  A word of warning - produced for Showtime but leased to network television as a fill-in during the writer's strike last year, \\"Dexter\\" has plenty of storylines and language that would be inappropriate for children.t we see Dexter show honest care and, dare we say it, love for his fellow man and especially for his friends, coworkers and family.

B000O1799U|2.0|As the story of the Supremes, I wonder why they didn't just make a bio-pic with the real music? As it stands, this is unsatisfying, and the original score is a screechfest that's not even close to Motown in style. This reminds of the awful Bette Midler 70s pic, \\"The Rose,\\" another attempt to tell a star's story without actually naming the star, in that case Janis Joplin. Eddie Murphy, as the Marvin Gayish singer, is sort of impressive here, but Jamie Foxx is expressionless as the Berry Gordy-like character. The dreamgirls themselves are forgettable. Watch it if you like ear-numbing screeching.

B0013ND30W|4.0|Me, my wife, and my daughter have seen this movie several times in a 55 inches LED LCD and I have to say that the graphics are spectacular. The colors pop out and the attention to detail is very impressive. It is like Pixar but 50 years ago. No wonder why this movie took 6 year to make. The scenes of the forest and the witch's castle are amazing. I watched the whole movie and was consistently impressed in this area.    The BD has a 7.1 DTS-HD Surround sound which obviously is far better from the original movie. However, I believe Disney dropped the ball in the sound area. The surround from the back speakers is overcharged, in fact there are scenes where it shadows the front speakers. Also the main central front speaker sounds awful and they could have enhanced this. I understand that they included the original lossless audio, yet still they could have enhanced this in order to appeal a new generation. he same way they did with the graphics.      Overall the movie is very good; however like in the middle it becomes a little bit draggy even for my three year old daughter, who is a Disney fan. There are some scenes when she  becomes a little bit bored, which rarely happens to her when she is watching Disney or Pixar movies.    I recommend this BD ONLY if you have kids that will enjoy the movie, you are Disney Collector, or you have seen this movie earlier in your life. Otherwise, I believe you WOULD NOT enjoy this purchase. The reason is because some scenes are lenghty, and the audio problems I mentioned before.    I personally like this film and believe is a good addition to our collection.    Karl
0060558121|1.0|Rubish.  Good premise, but wasted on a completely unlikable main character who, after being hired as a bodyguard gets kidnapped twice in a several day period.  Also bogged down by several x-rated passages that are there only to be x-rated.  How edgy!  Sorry Neil, I'm sure the Coraline movie will be cute though.
B001NP8PQW|5.0|If you are reading this review you already know this is a fabulous concert...but what about the Blu Ray quality?   The sound is everything you have been hoping for and more: this dvd has a high res DTS Master audio and a high res PCM track. I have never heard Robert's voice so well, on any medium. Everything else sounds great too.   The picture is pretty good for a Blu Ray (not as good as a high budget Hollywood movie but still very solid), and a marked improvement over the DVD version.   Stop hesitating, just get it!
0198534469|5.0|Many undergraduates leave university will all of the math they've absorbed in a jumble.  Reading this book along side with Stillwell's \\"Mathematics and its History\\" will go a long way toward putting all of that math in a useful context.  This volume, along with a couple of good reference volumes such as the new Princeton math encyclopedia should be within easy reach of everyone who uses analysis.  I can't say enough good things about this book.

0517548232|5.0|Of all the books I've read regarding economics and policy, this was by far the easiest to read.  It was hard to put down.  No abstract formulas or theory, just straight forward cause and effect, simple deductive reasoning.  Originally written in 1946, updated in `62 &`79, the economic policy areas discussed are timeless, i.e., relevant today.  Mr. Hazlitt discusses not only the immediate visible effects of implemented legislation and policy, but also the unintended consequences to the community at large, the not so visible effects.      I would recommend this book for everyone, from the casual observer to the economic scholar, and (in my opinion) should be required reading for all politicians and policy makers.
0802798225|5.0|I really enjoyed this novel by Simone Elkeles.  It was essentially a story of forbidden love, an almost epic romance, but put into a YA novel.  There is the \\"bad boy\\" Alex, who lives in a lower income area and is a member of a gang.  He has his issues in his life, but has a tough/bad reputation at school.  Then, there is the \\"Golden Girl\\" Brittany, who seems to have the perfect life, but really, she doesn't.  And, unlike some girls in her positions, she is not spoiled or self-centered.  Of course, they are made for each other.      I am a sucker for these kind of stories, loving Veronica Mars and Logan Echols kind of pairings (from the TV show Veronica Mars).  So, even though it has a fairly predictable plot, if it's what you want to read, pick this up!    The characters are really well done, in my opinion.  I do not personally know any Spanish speaking gang members, but I do know that some of the Spanish in the book should not be repeated in a polite setting (so, there is a feeling of realism in the book).  I thought both Alex and Brittany were very well-developed characters who grew with each other in the book.      The writing style is easy to read and very engaging.  I picked up the book and could not put it down, finishing it in one night.    There are some sad/hard/slightly graphic parts to read in the book, but it is expected.  I had fairly high expectations for this book, having read Leaving Paradise, and felt they were exceeded.  While it is not an original idea, I loved it and would recommend it to anyone wanting to read a very well done teen romance.

B00140PK6O|5.0|One of the glories of recent television history, \\"Cranford\\" is thoroughly delightful.  A story with overlapping plot points hinging on petty small-town customs, it has deeper undercurrents and themes, which underscore the universality of how tradition, the individual, and the larger world intersect.  The universally flawless performances (something nearly unheard of in Hollywood productions) of the British cast, some very familiar, some much less so, with an exceptional screenplay cobbled together from several novels make for an experience that surpasses most period pieces.  What at first seems to be a superficial satire of an isolated village overseen by a variety of small-minded elder women ruled by meaningless conventions and intentionally oblivious to the larger world becomes a story of how people adapt as a result of the personal and social forces around them, and how all this can bring out the inherent goodness in most people.  This last quality is what is ultimately so rewarding.  An optimistic and rosy-hued perspective to be sure, but it manages to be very, very sweet without making your teeth hurt.  In other hands it could have been a silly, treacly, manipulative farce, as it incorporates elements of camp, comedy, and social satire as well as social realism and tragedy, but here it makes you weep and wish for more.

Even with my degree now completed, I am glad I invested in the 3rd edition of Field's textbook.

B000UNYJXQ|1.0|In keeping with Moore's philosophy of keeping things 'free', I resolved to see this movie where it would cost me absolutely nothing but rather forcing someone else to pay for it.  That's free...  or Moore's warped sense of it.  Of course it isn't free...  nothing is.  So many half truths in this propaganda fest, that it boggles the mind where to start.  Hmm, how about this: Moore only shows injuries as his examples of where the US system is lacking and Canadian and UK systems are so superior.  Never any long term diseases such as cancer or heart surgery, where these systems fail miserably.  I'm sure he looked for some poster cases to use, communists always do...  and couldn't find any.<br /><br />Nor does he show that that canadians and UK citizens middle class get gap insurance to get access to exotic surgeries in a timely manner.  So those citizens pay incredibly high taxes for their basic care, and to subsidize Moore's entitled class, but then they pay a 3rd time for insurance on top.  Moore never talks taxes.  Nor does he ever talk about how American costs feed into R/D budgets to develop new techniques that freeloader UK and canadians get at incredibly reduced prices.  Which means if we go socialized then all their developments will cease and probably will generate a scarcity of resources when the profit margin leaves it in the face of government price controls.<br /><br />And of course these countries mooch off the US military costs for stability to forego their own.  To make Moore's idioticy a reality, the military would have to be reduced drastically.  That's fine, but that also will create pressure on those freeloader nations' budgets to have to once again defend themselves.<br /><br />Now let's look at economic downturns, such as this one.  Your healthcare requirements don't decrease in downtimes but state tax revenues most certainly do.  the UK just raised their top rate to 61% to make up the shortage.  That's obscene and absolutely not sustainable.  When he talks up this one french family, they itemize on the screen their income and mortgage bill but forgets their tax burden.  It's garbage.<br /><br />If we want to talk socialized medicine that's fine, but let's have the whole story and not skewed so awfully.<br /><br />And then there's france.  France now has less GDP than South Korea.  It's an empire in decline and declining still.  Moore's fantasy world of france suffers from high unemployment, high taxes, muslim rioters, and declining industry [they have tourism and wine and cheese].  And why, because socialists like Moore deincentivizes work and productivity.  This will surely eat away more and more at France until it falls into 3rd world status.<br /><br />And of course there is king sicko himself:  Moore.  Under his system, the government could just as easily deny him coverage for being too fat and sedentary.  I'm sure he'd love that, subscribing to the theory that people are sheep that need to be instructed what to do.<br /><br />bonus round is when he's talking up our 'socialized' schooling as being a good thing but then later on laments that our graduates can't locate England on a map.  Good job, Moore.  That sums it up just perfectly.<br /><br />to help with the facts that others have disputed:  England's 61% rate is located here:<br />[...]<br /><br />still, there are other issues at stake, I believe Moore cherry picks his sob stories the same way that others will cherry pick what to comment on my review.  Moore has valid points but it's shown through a propagandist lens.  To think that he's giving you anything other than a lopsided view of medicine is disingenuous at best and naive at worst.  My personal problem with his advocated health system is that socialism in general is an anthesis to liberty.  If you want to abdicate your liberty taken away for a soft tyranny, have at it...  it's when you try to take mine that umbrage will follow.<br /><br />if you really want to reform health do the following,tort reform to keep malpractice insurance low, reform immigration policy, and allow cafeteria style/cross state border competition in health insurance, and insurance portability with tax deductions (won't see these ideas debated in congress].  Or you can be a sycophant for government sponsored care..  despite the fact that the government has a terrible track record on anything it's ever done before.  the few things it used to be good at, roads/clean water/war it's slipped at.  easy to see why, politicians can't build legacies on those things, instead they need 'signature legislation'.  terrible.d allow cafeteria style/cross state border competition in health insurance, and insurance portability with tax deductions (won't see these ideas debated in congress].

0307269752|5.0|After reading an entire series of novels written by Micheal Connelly, John Grisham, David Badacci, Dan Brown and John Sandford, I was desperate to find a good mystery novel to fill the time. I came by this novel through an article written by Stephen King for EW magazine about the 10 must read novel for 2008. I'm glad that I follow his advice. This novel has all the right elements for a fantastic mystery/crime/detective/psychological thriller/serial killer/torture  novel. It has 3 story lines that neatly woven together, and the author did know how to build up the tension and the aura to push the reader's adrenaline. This is a very long novel with little \\"down time\\", it grabbed my attention throughout. If you love the authors I mentioned in the beginning of this paragraph, you will definitely enjoy this one.
B001KO3FFW|4.0|I have watched American Idol before when it first came out with Kelly Clarkson....But then stopped watching until one of my friends sent me a clip of David Cook this past AI season.  I was completely blown away by his vocals. After that, I started to watch the show again and wanted this man to be the winner for this competition. In which he did...Finally when his CD dropped in stores and listening to the CD several times that day...I love the rock feeling to the CD. And when I heard \\"Permanent\\" my mouth dropped from vocals from Mr. Cook...As well as the emotion that you hear from him is unbelievable.  This is one of the best \\"first\\" (Analog Heart being his first) LPs I've heard in quite a long time. I am very impressed by Cook's talent and songwriting. I am looking forward to seeing what he does in the future.

I highly recommend ThetaHealing for those who are spiritual healers, those who are on the path of self-growth and all who seek to become aware at all levels of emotion and mind that we are one with Creator/God and all that is. She has become an instrument to teach healing as the disciples of Jesus Christ accomplished. Vianna has presented her experience and knowledge in ThetaHealing in an easy to understand, effective way. She teaches so specifically and carefully  repeating her method with simple variations so that you can find clarity to resolve most any problem no matter what you need help with. As a healer I have found it opened up the means to be even more effective and thorough than I had previously been.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|If you've seen the Lord of the Rings trilogy directed by Peter Jackson you may agree with me that there would be no point in anyone ever re-making these films. They're as good as it gets. The same is true of the 7-part HBO series, John Adams. As much a historical drama of the origins of our decision to break with mother England and the execution of the Revolution, this is a love story. John and Abigail Adams were deeply in love and were, as they referred to one another, dearest friends. John Adams for all his brilliance and bluster and courage, was not a complete person without Abigail. Without her sage advice and unfailing encouragement of her husband, you could argue, we might not have had a Revolution given his key role in it. All of this is wonderfully presented in this HBO series. The \\"no expense spared\\" appearance of the production is spell-binding. Life in Boston, Paris, London is depicted realistically, warts and all, in an unromanticized way that allows us to enter into that world and become part of the larger than life events that were transpiring to create this country. All of the high praise heaped upon Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney for their acting are well deserved. This is a series that will stick with you long after you've experienced it.

B001GZ6QC4|4.0|This movie looses so much from big screen to small, and it wasn't because I was watching it on a 9\\" bedroom model. When I walked out of this movie this past summer, I was truly wowed, wowed like I hadn't been since perhaps Jurassic Park or Saving Private Ryan. Those movies, like this one, were huge rushes of emotions and action and swept you up in their intensity. Watching it at home was fun but it certainly wasn't the same, and in that lowering of excitement, I was able to view it more objectively. That said this movie is still the best of the entire Batman legacy. Then again, I think the original Adam West version is second on the list if only because of the shark scene and the bomb disposal one. Forget the schizophrenic Tim Burton visions or the two follow-ups to his pair. Burton tried too hard to be dark and scary yet couldn't resist the colors and flash of comic books, and the Kilmer and Clooney versions sacrificed all sincerity and gravity at the altar of camp and smugness. The first of these newer Batman movies wasn't bad but it lacked a really great villain. Of all the potential possibilities, we are given an effeminate Scarecrow and a horribly hackneyed mob boss. For criminals to work in the comic book world there has to be a connection between the superhero and the villain. With Spider-Man and Doc Ock, there was the scientist link and the struggle between using brains and/or skills for good or evil. With Batman, there is the damaged orphan who eternally fights his own darker, angrier side and thus the ideal villain is someone who plays up to that turmoil.  Michelle Pfeiffer did a good job engendering some sympathy to go along with her psychosis with her strong turn as Catwoman, but any interplay between the two was undermined by the fatal inclusion of DeVito's disgusting Penguin character and the devotion Burton gives to the inane plot. As the maniacal and insidious Joker, however, Heath Ledger hits it out of the park. Indeed, The Dark Knight succeeds purely on the performance and writing for The Joker character. What makes it so wonderful is that the Joker is a character who cares not for the traditional bad-guy vices: money, power, or fame. He simply wants to inspire chaos for the sheer joy of seeing people devolve to the basest part of our collective human nature.<br />As for the rest of the cast, the one thing that can be said is that they can't carry the movie on their own. Again, that's why Batman Begins was merely okay and not great. I've never been sold on Christian Bale, and his grunting \\"in-character\\" speech is just silly. With all his high-tech skills, are you telling me he can't rig up some voice augmentation? Please. Michael Caine is good but largely reduced to wise-cracking/wisdom dispensing clich&eacute;, Morgan Freeman is much the same, and Gary Oldham is relatively unspectacular. As for Maggie Gyllenhaal vs. Katie Holmes, what difference does it make? Neither does any more than Kim Basinger, Nicole Kidman, or anyone else in the bland, thankless role as Bruce Wayne/Batman's gal pal. Batman's girl was never as integral to the plot as M.J. or Gwen Stacy is to Peter Parker/Spider-Man, so why waste time with female interests? I actually like Bruce Wayne's skanky playboy vibe, the whole two-gals-at-a-time thang that gives the rather dour character some levity, so why mess with that by trying to create depth? Bruce Wayne is already quite a piece of work who doesn't need a woman to give him demons. He's already chock full of `em. Besides, if I am to believe Batman's ethos, I need to know that he has neither the time nor interest in romance because the world needs saved from itself and there just ain't the time for serious relationships. Love `em and leave `em, Batsy, there's evil to fight.<br />In the end, however, this is a movie about The Joker and how this delectable character, arguably the best villain in comic book history, brings his toxic insanity to full bear on the world of Batman. In the hands of Jack Nicholson, I couldn't stop seeing R.P. McMurphy after a few too many mocha lattes. Nicholson played it so over-the-top that the whole movie sagged under the weight of his wink-wink portrayal. It was so clearly an actor hamming it up in a juicy role rather than something believable. With Ledger, the actor is lost in the character and we see The Joker as the man he is, a raging \\"agent of chaos,\\" wrapped up in a creepy, wicked leer. The Dark Knight excels because Ledger left us with one bravura swan song, a character portrayal that accomplishes what so few comic book movies have been able to do; transcend the limitations of the comic book and create a character as memorable and frighteningly lovable as Hannibal Lecter or any of the many other great ones in cinematic history. When Nicholson's Joker died at the end of the first of Burton's movies, I was glad because it was a case of good riddance to ham acting. When Heath Ledger laughs in utter joyful mania while dangling from the skyscraper, I was sad because I knew that we'd never again get the chance to see more of this brilliant character in any of the sequels.<br />The Dark Knight is not a fantastic movie, but rather a good movie blessed with a superb, Oscar-worthy performance.on, I couldn't stop seeing R.P.

159102594X|3.0|There are some sites that compare fantasy authors and a few are putting Abercrombie up near George RR Martin above such others as Abraham, Rothfuss and Lynch.  I don't get it, there is pulp fiction quality to this book.  Although the author clearly has a very good (dark) sense of humor, and writes well, the book -- which might provide a decent screenplay -- doesn't really cut it as a standalone work of literature.  From my point of view, it simply doesn't compare to the Long Price Quartet or the Lies of Locke Lamora at all.
B001H5X7I4|2.0|I had read review after review which hailed Tropic Thunder, but shortly before seeing it, a friend who has similar taste, said she literally fell asleep during it. Two extreme points of view that had me wondering which side of the opinion aisle I was going to stand on. Consider the two stars my answer. This movie was hugely disappointing. Critics seemed to love it because it skewers Hollywood, another of those insider movies that, for me, are far more smarmy and self-congratulatory than they are funny or memorable. Mel Brooks has always done this kind of thing well but Ben Stiller is not Mel Brooks and Tropic Thunder isn't even in the same ballpark as Blazing Saddles or even Silent Movie. The problem is that they spend so much time ripping on each other in some glorious back-stabbing fest that they forget about the rest of us who neither care about studio moguls, agents, or bloated celebrities nor find them people who are interesting, at least I don't. Whether Tom Cruise plays a great studio exec or Matthew McConaughey pulls off the loyal agent to Stiller's Tugg character are considerations that have no interest to me. None of the characters is that interesting and it is hard to care about the vanities of actors or the Hollywood pecking orders therein. There are no really funny jokes, the plot is ridiculous, the gags get tired very early on, and the best part of the movie is the opening pseudo-trailers. You know a movie misses the mark when the best it can do with Jack Black is reduce him to a smack-addicted Hollywood clich&eacute; going through withdrawals in the jungle. Hilarious! I'm sure Robert Downey, Jr. found much to laugh about in art imitating life, but I sure didn't. This movie is as predictable as it is dull: Stiller is an aging action hero who believes his own hype, Downey, Jr. is a method actor who spends so much time getting into other characters that he has none of his own, the gangsta rapper-turned-actor turns out to be a closeted homosexual, and the one untainted guy, the nerdy naïve newbie played by Jay Baruchel is the lone touchstone the rest of us are supposed to identify with. And yet, he worships the very people who are so unappealing to me! Everyone is a phony, brown nosed, spoiled, selfish brat in this movie. Why would I care what happens to any of them? Whether this movie is accurate in how it sends-up movie making and all the boorish people involved is beside the point. I simply don't care at all about that E! garbage and watching a two-hour movie that had all the thrill of being the outsider at a work party was a huge waste of time. The only thing I do care about is my entertainment dollar and Tropic Thunder isn't worth the money I spent to watch it.ntainted guy, the nerdy naïve newbie played by Jay Baruchel is the lone touchstone the rest of us are supposed to identify with. And yet, he worships the very people who are so unappealing to me! Everyone is a phony, brown nosed, spoiled, selfish brat in this movie. Why would I care what happens to any of them? Whether this movie is accurate in how it sends-up movie making and all the boorish people involved is beside the point. I simply don't care at all about that E! garbage and watching a two-hour movie that had all the thrill of being the outsider at a work party was a huge waste of time. The only thing I do care about is my entertainment dollar and Tropic Thunder isn't worth the money I spent to watch it.

1594201927|4.0|Ferguson writes a good general history of money and  credit along with anecdotes peculiar to each historical period covered. You won't find a history  of market speculation or analysis of booms or busts  but you will find examples of financial innovation  which by 2007 led us into our current crisis. The  author bases his \\"Ascent\\" book partly on Jackob  Brownowski's \\"The Ascent of Man\\" book and PBS series.
B00169XU8I|2.0|What can I say? You either love her or you hate her.  I am sorry to say, but on this one, she missed the mark completely.  I miss the Madonna that actually had a message in her albums.  Erotica, Ray of Light, Bedtime Stories (my fave).  These albums all said something.  This album, does have one message and it does say one thing...\\"GIVE ME YOUR MONEY\\".  That's it.  Its over produced, dated, and just plain bad.  What the hell happened to her?  I mean, Confessions.. was good, but this, not even close.  I miss Mistress Dita, please bring that Madonna back!
1400082773|5.0|Even reading this story of race and inheritance after Barack Obama took the oath of office as President of the United States of America, it seemed to me totally unlikely that the wonderful young man who is the subject of the story could ever have risen to the highest office in America. On the other hand, when you experience the thoughtfulness of his writing, you understand his ability to overcome the challenges of race in America, his struggle to grasp his father's life and the meaning of family, his understanding of other cultures and you are very hopeful for him.<br /><br />As I read this book, being of the same generation as Barack's father, I found my self rooting for this young guy as if he were my own son and worrying when he did things that led him off in the wrong direction: his idle years as a teen, his youthful fondness for pot and liquor, his smoking. But luckily these preoccupations faded for him as he found purpose in his life and my fatherly concern was not necessary. But my fatherly love for him remained -- I wanted him to succeed.<br /><br />In the chapter called \\"Origins\\" he writes about an attitude he learned on the subject of `respect'. He writes: \\"And something else, too, something nobody talked about: a way of being together when the game was tight and the sweat broke and the best players stopped worrying about their points and the worst players got swept up in the moment and the score only mattered because that's how you sustained the trance. In the middle of which you might make a move or a pass that surprised even you, so that even the guy guarding you had to smile, as if to say, \\"Damn...\\"<br /><br />So, as I followed the growth of this boy into the man who became President last month and took on unprecedented challenges to our country: Two wars, shattered economy, and a battered reputation; he made those moves that surprised everyone and I could only smile and say, \\"Damn....\\"<br /><br />What a fine book, a great writer and a remarkable President!
B00127RAJY|5.0|Love the workout you get.  I am only on the first of three stages, but love it.  Just when you think you can't take anymore, she either gives you the words you need or it comes to an end.  It's only 20 minutes, but you work it all. Highly recommended!!
B001F7MSFM|1.0|Ok, first off I have to address the voice of Abe Sapien.  I realize the whole story behind David Hyde Pierce refusing credit in the first movie because he felt the performance of Doug Jones was brilliant.  Agreed.  Doug Jones does a brilliant job wherever he appears.  However he just doesn't carry Abe Sapiens character the way Hyde Pierce did.  I too LOVED the first movie.  Can't count the number of times I have seen it.  But there was no threat to the world.  I never feard for humanity.  I never feared for Hellboy.  And the overblown accent of Dr. Strauss was a movie killer.  Even Sargent Schultz and Kernel Klink has better and more digestable accents.  Beautiful imagery.  TERRIBLE story telling.
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|Great movie if you like broadway musicals.  Caution for parents: the premise is a daughter looking for her father -- but the mom isn't sure which of three lovers it was.  Not explicit, but the more savy child might pick up on it and then there are those many questions to answer...
B000R8YC18|5.0|I just bought the 2 disc dvd, and watched it last week. I just thought \\"there are no actors who can act like that nowadays\\".  I also thought the humour was good. Trying to chat up Betsie, chatting to the special security services man, chatting to the pimp. He was so natural. Ive been around a lot myself, and you do get bad ideas in your head, and want to do exactly what Travis did. I suppose thats the point of good acting - making you believe it is real. Given that De Niro was only about 30, he really was amazing. Two thumbs up. The Dear Hunter was also in the same league as this.
0312370849|5.0|In reading Sarah's Key, I gained a new respect and reverence for the millions of people that had to endure the Holocaust. The tragedies and fears that Sarah had to go through made me stop and think about the children of the Holocaust and what they actually went through. I can't even begin to imagine what their little eyes had to see and be a part of during those horrific years. I truly enjoyed this book and would refer it to anyone.
B000VUQ4HW|5.0|Sometimes, I think that from over hundred years of Cinema history the best, the most creative and exciting years were in the relative beginning, in the first decades of the 20th Century. The old films that I've watched lately don't seem old - they are timeless. Their beauty and mystery -unsurpassable, their influence - immense, the pleasure they bring - incomparable. Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens made in 1922 by F.W. Murnau is one of these movies. It is so finely crafted, so well thought of, so lovingly produced, so beautiful to look at, and so creepy and genuinely scary that I believe it will stay one of the best films of the horror genre and true inspiration for present and future directors, and not just horror film directors. A Symphony of Horror is a pure cinematic delight, poetry on screen from the first shot to the final. Werner Herzog came quite close in 1979 in his updated color version of the same film but I prefer Murnau's film a bit more, perhaps, because it was the first one and Murnau had no previous film to compare to or more likely, because no one, even fabulous Kinski could not be as creepy and frightening as Max Shreck.<br /><br />The B&W photography with astounding use of sepia gave some scenes a somber dramatic, Gothic tone. Each frame deserved to be captured and enjoyed for the sheer beauty and elegance. The scenery was breathtaking, storytelling - solid and compelling. Hans Erdman's 1922 score created a perfect sound background for the story. The most fascinating asset of the film though was not even acting but simply presence of Max Shreck. What a mesmerizing magnificent ugliness that would not let you take your eyes off his face, fangs, ears, and spider like fingers. The first film in the vampire series, Nosferatu started genre of poetic horror, the most interesting and artful in the family of horror films.
B0013XS8A2|5.0|Mike's autobiography tells us: he loves classical music. Maybe he has been to wish to create a classical album for a long time. I love it very much. He's music reaches mature and clam level: both melody and mind.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is by far the best presentation of any war film. It is based on fact and narrated by survivors in some cases. It's an up front, personal look at this company of paratroupers who served in WWll. We watched it on HBO, got the VHS collection and now have the DVD collection.   Whether you're a history buff or not, don't miss this one.
B001C4CI8A|5.0|I noticed all of the reviews got clumped onto the BD, but at least the intricate story has been covered adequately by everyone here. A very detailed story based on Ignatius' book that came across beautifully on screen. The stand alone performance of Mark Strong (once again) makes this entire film re-watchable and makes it a recommendation on him alone.<br /><br />The most challenging part of this BD was how to set the display. There are so many brights and contrasts, intertwined with intense darks and solemn indoor sequences, that it leaves it open for how you wish to best see the saturation lines. The best result/test was watching the dark black helicopters attacking the convoy whilst it is speeding through the bright desert. That sequence by itself has made for a solid BD display in the store. The sound, picture and presentation all look worthwhile for BD ownership. No complaints.<br /><br />The special features are thorough and cover virtually all aspects of the production. Different options are afforded to you should you wish to watch them separatley or while watching the film. The additional/deleted scenes in 1080 are a mixed bag of what should have stayed or was rightfully cut. The alternate ending was much more enjoyable for character closure, and the BD live options have some fun material. Also an interesting option involving a \\"cross-graph\\" of snippets from Scott, Leo and Crowe about the story and characters that you can select. The Digital Copy disc is included as disc 2.
B000WC3A0S|4.0|Rocky, like a soap opera will have you hooked in no time. The first DVD is slower paced but lays the groundwork for the rest. There are enough surprises and twists in the plot to keep you wanting to watch. By no means is this an academy award winning plot or acting but it's entertaining.
0061537934|5.0|I received this book as a Christmas gift and it did not float immediately to the top of my reading pile.  After a slow start, my involvement with the characters deepened and I was sorry when the book was over.  It is a bit of a tear-jerker, but books that touch our emotions are infrequent.  This one is well-written, with characters of depth.  I like that Enzo lacks opposable thumbs and speech.  His words are precise and thought-provoking. There are 321 pages of text.  As the book is small and the print is large, it can be finished in one or two sittings and it will be time well-spent.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|I got a disc or two into the first season...and then found myself scrambling to find a way to obtain all 7 seasons. I am now on the verge of watching the last episode of the series and just can't bring myself to do it yet. I'm not ready to say goodbye. Get ready to embark on an adventure as you watch the characters experience all of life's ups and downs in Stars Hollow and beyond.  You'll laugh.  You'll love. You might even cry.  Give Gilmore Girls a try. You won't be sorry!!
0670019925|4.0|I've been a fan of Lodge's for many years now, and this book did not disappoint. It's full of his trademark puns and humor, yet in many ways it's more serious than some of his earlier work. Lodge takes on his usual subjects here--academia, relationships, power--but this book has a kind of urgency about it, the urgency of a man facing down his own mortality. I laughed out loud in many places, but closed the book with a lot to think about.
B0007TKNII|5.0|This is the most stunning film portrayal of The Phantom ever!! Gerard Butler mesmerizes with his eyes, and though not a classically-trained opera singer, Gerry's voice contains such raw emotion, the viewer is swept along in this beloved tale. The rest of the cast shines: Emmy Rossum and Patrick Wilson as Christine and Raoul are exceptional. I recommend this film to anyone, and give much credit to director Joel Schumacher and to Andrew Lloyd Webber, the composer and producer, for this extraordinary, visually lush movie.
1439136653|5.0|This book is a wonderful work.  Of course it is fiction and the author does take some liberty along the way in terms of coincidence and chance, but it is weaved together so well that the book is a gripping read.      Ram Mohammad Thomas is an orphan from the wrong side of the tracks who manages to get on a game show and win the grand prize which causes a great concern and his arrest.  As far as others are concerned there is no way that he could have done this without cheating somehow.  This is set forth quickly at the beginning of the book and the rest of the book is set up to show how he was able to answer the questions with chapters with the level he is playing for (1,000,2000, 5,000 etc)    Each chapter is a short story on its own and at the end they all tie in, for the most part, to make a whole story.  Yes, there are some coincidences.  Yes, some of the things may stretch belief slightly, such as Salim and an incident that occurs.  And some sections may not all be equal.  BUT I found myself turning the pages quickly to see how the questions and life events tied in on each chapter and to see how the book resolved.      When it was all said and done I was very happy I picked up this book for a recent trip to India and in fact and read it along the way.
B000HC2LI0|3.0|The West Wing fully deserves five stars for the show itself ~ there simply is no better television anywhere. This \\"deluxe\\" boxed set, however, leaves a lot to be desired and barely rates two stars. Most importantly, there are no subtitles (i.e., \\"closed captioned for the hearing impaired\\") for the last three of the seven seasons. Nowhere in the advertising or packaging is this mentioned. My set was also missing one disc entirely, something I didn't notice until it was well past the deadline for making returns. (There are close to 50 discs in the set ~ stupid of me not to check to make sure that all of them were there when I received the set, but I didn't.) Finally, one of the discs has a flaw, making it impossible to view the last half of one episode. I should note that I bought my set through one of Amazon's resellers and that the quality of the set was rated \\"excellent ~ like new\\". Either I was ripped off, or the reseller didn't bother to check the set properly before selling it on to me.
B0001KZM3O|5.0|Excellent quality CD. I listened to this album since it was out on cassette  tapes. The difference in sound quality is very clear.
B000W91RUG|1.0|I ordered this and a book for friend's birthday.  I qualified for super saver shipping, but when I had the products sent separately, I lost that.  I think that's kind of cheap - I was still charged the same amount for the items.  Also, the Big Bang Theory has not yet been received, and we are talking over 4 weeks later.    I love the item, (we own it), not happy at all with the service.
B000WMA6FA|4.0|This would have received 5 stars if not for one thing:  It didnt follow the actual story line close enough.  There are certain instances where the actual written word is difficult to follow in motion picture, but that isnt the case here.  The scene where grandma dies was different, the story about Rose of Sharon was different.<br />Other than that, the acting was GREAT and the overall experience was good.  I recommened this movie, it will be great if you have never read the book, but may be a bit of a disappointment if you have.  Final word here.  Read the book anyway!!
055357342X|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said? This book is already legendary. This book is simply one of the greatest fantasy novels that has been written. You want lovable characters? Check. Story line that bleeds greatness? Check. And a world that is so detailed, and filled with such history that you wish our mundane world possessed such attributes? Check. If you enjoy fantasy and haven't read this book you need to be tried for heresy because this is what every fantasy hopes to be.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I am so glad I purchased this DVD. The only actor I knew was Don Sutherland. It is such a romantic movie about Lizzie who can't Stand Mr. Darcy and realizes later how much they are  alike and how she falls in love with him after telling him to take a hike. I have probably watched it more than 20 times .
9707704667|5.0|Este libro me fascino, la historia la describiria como retorcidamente enferma y masoquista pero sin duda cautivante.  La narrativa me atrapo totalmente, es descriptiva en detalle cosa que particularmente me envuelve. Me traslado desde Francia, hasta Peru, pasando por Japon...  Nunca habia leido nada de Vargas Llosa... gran error, definitivamente es una historia que recomiendo a los amantes del suspenso.
0143039482|4.0|As I was reading The Winter of Our Discontent there was something about Ethan Hawley's character that reminded me of Willy Loman, Arthur Miller's tragic hero in his play Death of a Salesman. In Miller's work, Loman is a salesman who has lost touch with reality, and always is after what success is about, as he imagines talking to his dead brother Ben to try to get the answers to life. A man who was probably most successful in his daydreams than real life, Willy Loman might be considered an underachiever or loser by some, but there is a certain sympathy we carry for him. I bring up this character because Ethan, in The Winter of Our Discontent, has some of these same qualities, although he is not established like Loman (even in his own musings or dreams), and more glaringly, he is not as likeable or forgivable. Ethan also strives to gain a piece of the American dream, as he comes from strong family roots in New England, and works as a clerk in the town's local grocery store. Feeling the pressure from his wife and two kids, he wants to move upward in the world and be able to provide the wealth and comforts that make a father a success. He wants to carry on the family legacy with pride, and attain the status that makes him a success in his own mind. In this way, Ethan Hawley is a man with ambition; however, Macbeth was ambitious too. The crisis of conflict that Hawley ultimately experiences is that he gives in to moral standards to become \\"someone\\" in the world, which means setting aside morals, friends, and conscientiousness in hopes of attaining this status. Much like a Shakespeare tragic hero, or Willy Loman, he continues onward, attributing all things to fate, but ultimately has to come face to face with himself.<br /><br /> Hawley makes several key decisions that ultimately affect those close to him negatively. He loans money to his childhood friend Danny, a town drunk, to supposedly help him get some help with his drinking, but knowing full-well that he will drink himself to death with the money. He also gets him to use his own property as collateral if he shouldn't pay it back. His boss, who once gives him the advise to \\"look after number one,\\" is deported after Ethan reports him to authorities; once this take place, the store becomes Ethan's, and he is no longer \\"just a clerk\\", but owner. Hawley also has plans of robbing a store in his mind, and is only stopped just short of doing this. One ironic aspect is when Ethan's son, Allen, plagiarizes on his \\"I Love America\\" essay and is scolded; just as Ethan has cheated the system to get ahead, his son has followed in his footsteps, yet only his son gets reprimanded for it. Ethan seems to legitimize his own actions: \\"Strength and success--they are above morality, above criticism...In effect no crime is committed unless a criminal is caught\\" (187).<br /><br />Unlike many of Steinbeck's novels, this one uses a good deal of inner character monologue to reveal the protagonist's train of thought. In that way, the writing style is not typical of the simplistic narration that Steinbeck often uses, and sometimes there is more to what Ethan is thinking or doing than it actually seems. Some have both praised and criticized Steinbeck for using characters to project aspects of human morality, and The Winter of Our Discontent, his last novel, is no exception. While I didn't enjoy this novel as much as some of his other stuff, there are flashes of exceptional writing. For any Steinbeck fans, this is a novel that is a bit different than the others in that we are taken away from the California setting, and into the character's point of view.to death with the money.

B000N6U0E2|5.0|Will Smith turns in one of his best performances as a down on his luck single father who has hit rock bottom financially but shows great strength and determination to better things for himself and his son.    He gets a chance to become a stock broker, and you find yourself drawn into his life and the challenges he faces.  There are many great scenes that Smith turns in, but one of the most gripping is when he tries to find a make-shift bedroom in a subway.  Heartbreaking.    Overall a great movie which shows how Will Smith can turn in solid performances in non-action/non-comedy roles and is all the more compelling since the movie is based on a true story.     Highly recommended.

1400082773|4.0|The book tells a story of race and inheritance.  It is a lyrical,  unsntimental and compelling memoir of the son of a black African father and a white American mother.  His story begins in New York, where Barack learns that his father has just been killed in a car accident .  This sudden death brings about a change in his life to a small town in Kansas  from which he traces the migration of his mother's family to Hawaii.  He  then goes to Kenya where he meets the African side of his family and has  to confront the truth about his father's life and reconcile his divided  inheritance.  The book is well written and gives an insight into the man  who has become our president.  The book should be in every home and library

0061706620|5.0|Since the beginning of this TV series, I've been mystified and fascinated with John Winchester's battered leather-bound journal and the occult contents of it: notes on dozens of creatures, spells and rituals and even (as they appeared on the CW's official SPN site) a few bits about what sent him on his hunt in the first place. So when this book was first announced, my hands started itching to get this book.<br /><br />And I am far, *FAR* from disappointed in this. The small illustrations are clearly recognizable to people who've watched the show closely (like me!) and many bits and pieces of the text are clearly bits that the Winchester brothers have quoted as they've delved into their dad's notes when they found themselves dealing with a beastie they hadn't faced up before. And there's lots of odd bits written in some kind of mysterious code that's bound to mystify the reader and send them digging around to find the means to crack the code. There's a lot we've seen and a lot that's bound to be a surprise, and perhaps a hint of things to come in the show itself. I've only got one carp, and that is that it isn't bound in faux leather to simulate the actual journal, but I might do the crafty-geek thing and find a way to rig it up that way.
B001M72JC2|3.0|The Butterfly Effect is a pretty cerebral science fiction movie that seems like it's pretending to be one of those trendy MTV-styled thrillers. On the surface you have Ashton Kutcher and other good looking kids going from scene to scene with cool music in the background and such... which is fine for bringing in that crowd. What I really liked about the movie were the questions that it was raising about Ashton's character and what he can do: if you can go back and change your past what implications would come of it? The Butterfly Effect pulls this off almost perfectly.    The movie spends a fair amount of time in the beginning establishing Evan's (Ashton) life as a youth and all of the serious problems he faced. This is some intense stuff. You really get pulled down in the mud in these scenes and get a good idea of how messed up Evan's life was and how much he had to overcome to get to Ashton's age. By then his need to change his past, along with his ability to, gets the movie started to the point. Is this beginning long and drawn out? Does it pull you too far from the direction the movie ultimately goes? No way. While it does go off on a tangent of sorts that's exactly what you need.     The rest of the film deals with his jumping back and forth to his past, trying to change it for the better, and having to deal with the results. This is the meat of the movie and this is where you see the complications between dealing with a traumatic past and how much worse it can be trying to fix it. Ashton didn't get a lot of praise for his performance in this movie, which is sad. Although his face is unforgettable from his past exploits he didn't come off as That 70's Show's Kelso or the host of MTV's Punk'd in any way. He really showed his acting chops in this movie.     The special effects on this movie played well with things like its time/space warping scenes. Cinematography is worth noting too. Different eras of Evan's life seem to be depicted with different lens filters and other camera tricks that give the scenes a very signature look. All in all a very solid production.     Now the theatrical release has an ending different from the director's original vision. If you ask me they made a good choice with the theatrical ending. It makes more sense and it fits better in the overall theme of the movie. The alternate ending goes way out there on left field, even with the director's cut filling in little scenes that are supposed give foreshadowing for that ending. It's just a lame ending in my opinion. There are lot of people who say they prefer the alternate ending and I can only think they do because it's such a radical departure from conventional endings.     Now this Blu-Ray release is actually an import and doesn't come with any special features and whatnot other than enhanced picture. As a matter of fact this release will only have the director's cut of the movie and the theatrical release is not there at all. That includes the director's \\"alternate ending\\". This sucks for people who want to compare between the theatrical and director's cut as they are pretty different on how they end (and believe me that makes all the difference).     The Butterfly Effect is a great movie, but this Blu-Ray release isn't. No extra features. No commentary. No both versions of the movie. It's better to wait for a better release or just get the Infinifilm edition DVD, which has both versions, deleted scenes, documentaries and more.
0307269191|5.0|This is the first book I've read by Murakami and I was very pleased.  As a life-long solo athlete (strength & cardio) I could relate and appreciate many of the points Mr. Murakami expressed.  This work blends memoir and introspective training insight.  By the end of the book the author had gained my affection and respect.  Because of his grasp of nuance and clarity of thought, I would strongly recommend this book to life-long athletes particularly those of solo events.
B001KMB6VE|3.0|It's a shame this film didn't do better. The concept is really cool, the action is tight, the acting is good, and the special effects are dynamic. Even the script seems well enough written. So what happened? Well... nothing actually. And that's exactly why the movie failed.     The movie starts off strong with a really nice dystopic view of the future. You find mercenary Toorop (Vin Diesel) in an almost post-apocalyptic eastern europe and Babylon A.D. pulled this off very well. There are a fair amount of little details that are given about the world in the first part of the movie, and it's presented in a way that feels more like exploring and less like forced fed exposition. The movie never lets up on how well this new world is presented even up to the contrasts in a mega-modern United States.     The action and tone of the action feels like a mix of Diesel's previous romps like XXX and Riddick. This a good thing by the way as he works well in his element. The action is flashy and impressive without being like an over-the-top Michael Bay explosion-fest. If you are an action movie aficionado you may feel like most the action is more \\"been there... done that\\" sort of thing even if the action is good.     The acting is solid as well. Diesel shows some subtle and convincing set of emotions. Michelle Yeoh felt a little subdued, but it works. Melanie Thierry played probably the most emotional character in the film, and handles the direction fine.     So what went wrong? I did say there was a solid script, and I meant it. By that I meant the exposition was presented well and the dialog wasn't corny and felt convincing for the genre of the film. Script is one thing. Story is another. This is where the movie fails. The plot is cliche' and without any real story development. Toorop must protect a \\"special\\" girl with special powers. Sure the powers come up cool, but plot-wise they are pointless. There is never a decent explanation as to why everybody is going through all the trouble, and whatever explanations they give you are incredibly underwhelming.      I'm sorry folks, but all the atmosphere and action in the world will not cover up a story that goes through the motions without any true payoff in the end plot-wise. It's the basics of storytelling to have a beginning, middle and an end. The writers seemed to have gotten their beginning down great. The middle needed more meat, and apparently they totally forgotten the whole concluding a story respective of how it was set up. It's like after the film established the setting and characters it coasted through action and exposition scenes; just going through the motions.     The Blu-Ray is the way to go. A lot of scenes will stand out better considering the increased detail you get. Amazon seems to be missing the full details on the audio options. You get DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 in English AND Dolby Digital 5.1 in French. And yes this movie would be a good audio benchmark from what I've been hearing. You also get subtitles in English SDH, Spanish, Cantonese, Korean, and Mandarin.     Special features are kind of your standard fare. Although there is some goodies that Babylon AD fans should get a kick out of. I believe all of the featurettes are high def (some 1080i and some 1080p):    - Genesis of Aurora: This is a five minute animated \\"prequel\\" to the film. I think the name makes it obvious what those minutes will be about.    - Hummer Sequence: A deleted scene that runs about 2 1/2 minutes.      - Scene Evolution: Over 50 minutes of various behind the scenes features. Bonusview enabled (can be played back while watching the movie with Blu-Ray profile 1.1 or higher).     - Babylon Babies: This is the name of the book that inspired the movie. Thus this 11 minute featurette is about the author and he talks about stuff from the book.     - Arctic Escape, Flight of the Hummers, and Fit for the Screen: These are featurettes on various stunt sequences in the movie. The first two are about specific action sequences while the last one is about the fight and stunt choreography. Total runtime is just shy of 30 minutes.     - Babylon A.D. Commercials: A series of \\"made up\\" commercials. Also Bonusview enabled.     - D-Box Support: If any of you actually have these moving chairs in your home theater now you can plunk this Blu-Ray in your system and get all shaken and rattled and whatever the heck that expensive chair does for your enjoyment.     Babylon A.D. should have been much better than what we got. How much better? Overall story overhaul for the second half of the movie better. Still if you really, really love cyberpunk movies you may still enjoy this one a lot from just the atmosphere alone. Action junkies MAY like it. If you absolutely need a full and well rounded story in order to enjoy movies then you're out of luck.
B000WC3AKI|4.0|This a review of the DVD, not the movie. There are as many opinions of the movie as there are people to watch it.  The newest DVD is a vast improvement over the first two releases. The image is cleaner with stronger colors, better matched to the theatrical print. It also has few in any visible mpeg artifacts. The sound is essentially a match to the second DVD release, without the DTS track. The big improvement in sound is on the commentary track. In the previous release, the movie's audio wasn't reduced enough in volume and would often overwhelm the commentators, to the point that one couldn't understand a word they were saying. This is corrected in the new version.  The second DVD in the set is largely made up of previously released material. But there are two documentaries added that make it worthwhile. \\"Twister Revisted\\" is an interesting anecdotal look back on the production. Also included is a History Channel documentary that gives viewers a look at the reality of tornado research.  For those of you with whom this is a guilty pleasure, it's defintiely worth the investment.
B0019GJ4EM|4.0|Only goes to show you Clint Eastwood and Charles Bronson aren't the only  80's people who can portray a wicked-cool tough guy. Escape from New York is John Carpenter's post apocalyptic answer to those lone wolf anti-heroes we used to see in the classic westerns. Though the movie is rough around it's edges I see this one as one of Carpenter's better movies.     Stick an anti-establishment ex-military dude, load him up with weapons and drop him in a city controlled by roving gangs of convicts. That's Escape from New York in a nutshell. What makes it work? The characters. What makes the characters work? The actors. You get a nice slice of star power in this movie with the likes of Lee Van Cleef, Ernest Borgnine, Donald Pleasance, Adrienne Barbeau and a slew of others. Put them together and you have some pretty sweet performances. Even Isaac Hayes (Chef of South Park) plays a surprisingly interesting role as the Duke of New York. Considering he was a popular singer back then and not an actor I'm impressed. Of course Kurt Russell owns the screen as Snake Plissken. Thanks for Russel's portrayal that name will go down in sci-fi history.     Special effects aren't much to speak of. Most of the movie is based on set design of a ruined New York City. Not exactly high budget and it shows. The special effects that are on the movie are in the beginning and are quite impressive in a very subtle way. First off you have the model work that really brings the trashed city to life. Also there are some images they put on a display screen that have an impressive and very convincing three-dimensional effect you wouldn't expect by first looking at it. Although it's brief, it's neat enough to be worth noting.     Action there is plenty. You get running gun fights, arena death matches, exploding land mines, and a race against the clock. Kind of like a street gang movie with more props. They do get into that tired cliché of killing off as many good guys as you can so the hero can be left alone. Such a shame when considering alternatives to that predictable formula. Plissken is a relatively one dimensional character, but in a way that's the beauty of him. Just keep in mind you won't see much character growth in him.     The Blu-Ray release will be the best release to date. Keep in mind this movie was released in the early 80's and John Carpenter is a budget director so the quality of the source material will guarantee this movie will never look like a high def film you're used to seeing lately.   In spite of what you may hear there is a noticeable improvement in picture contrast and clarity between this Blu-Ray and all other DVD released previously. There is also audio in DTS HD and Dolby Digital 5.1 to boot.     The special features are worth noting too. You get the same commentaries (one originally from the laser disk release) and documentary as in the Special Edition DVD, but as a special bonus there is a brand new interview with John Carpenter not found on the DVDs. You also get the original opening of the movie in all it's... um... glory (yeah, it's still pretty ugly).    Escape from New York could be called your standard post apocalyptic/gang war type movie, only this is the one that set that standard in the first place. Many people consider it a classic and I tend to agree. It's an interesting look into that harsh cyberpunk future without all the gadgets and tech in the way. It's not a classic in the sense of the greatest of the great, but it is a landmark in science fiction heritage and should be respected as such. If you want the best release to date with the most extras (as in one new interview) the Blu-Ray is the best way to go. If you don't really need the slightly improved video quality then the Special Edition is still worthwhile.
B00005N5S2|4.0|Gregory Peck is excellent. His acting is superb here. This movie would be incomplete and bad if Peck wasn't in it. I admire Gen. MacArthur and am one of his fans even though people call him a crazed general. I think he should have been allowed to finish the job he started in Korea. If he had been given the chance, we'd not be stuck with a split Korea and a belligerent China. At any rate, this movie is one of my favorites along with Patton of course. Also the visual effects are not satisfactory mostly due to the technological advantages of 1960s. Like the scene where naval vessels are shelling Philippines and MacArthur along with PH president are observing the scene. It's kinda childish at best but heck, I like the movie. However there are some minor errors in the script (which I might very well be wrong and plz correct me on that):<br /><br />When Gen. MacArthur is planning to re-take Phillippines with Adm Nimitz and FDR, he (Gregory Peck) talks about the beach landings in Anzio, Italy. The Anzio happened in Jan and Feb 1944 whereas this talk of retaking Philippines took place in 1943, months before Anzio beach landing occurred. So there's one thing that's debatable.<br /><br />One other thing is where his aide approached him about the plans to drop the A-bomb on Japan and general says something about the biggest invasion of history and he is upset that it is gonna be done by an \\"Air Force General\\". Well, duh! Air Force didn't exist in fact until 1947. So I am not sure if the wording is correct there. Maybe Army brass referred to army air corps as Air Force. I don't know but it doesnt ring true. Again, I hope I am wrong. ;-)<br /><br />All in all, I give this movie a great rating for its superb portrayal of an American hero.

B000RO9PXC|5.0|I am always ALWAYS a big fan of all live recordings from The Doors. I initially started listening to this band in 1999 and had my first exposure to their live recordings in 2003. A little odd at first but eventually I grew addicted to it.    This particular 3-CD set features two seperate concerts in Boston on the same night. Jim is drunk for both concerts and this adds to the bands spontaneity and charisma when performing live, and this is why I absolutely love their live performances; each concert has its own personality and style, depending on Jimbo and his particular state.    If you are a big Doors fan like me, then there is no reason to hesitate. Get this CD and hear, among other things, what Jim does to Light My Fire on the 2nd night, unbelievable!
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|\\"Get busy livin' or get busy dyin'\\" is the theme of this great prison film about second chances. This movie stars Morgan Freeman as 'Red' and Tim Robbins as 'Andy' an innocent banker, who meet up in prison from two very different worlds, to become lifelong best friends. Their performances were incredible and very poignant. 'Shawshank' is a wonderful story of how friendship prevails and stands the test of time, hardship and injustice, as others have mentioned. I will simply say it's a purchase that is a must have and is beyond a 5 star film. I enjoy movies that are well written and well acted with meaning and this one is the best. I'm amazed it didn't win an Academy Award. This is a must have 5 star purchase with the best ending ever!<br /><br />I did enjoy watching the Amazon video above of Morgan Freeman speaking about friendship in 'Shawshank' between Red (Freeman) and Andy (Robbins) it sums it all up!

B000068OCS|5.0|Koyaanisqatsi meant for me - when I was 18 years old - the definite eye opener on how beautiful nature is and how bad \\"civilization\\" messed up with it.  It also shows the hectic way people live nowadays, with fast images of people and cars moving in different situations in a city, moving all in the same directions, going nowhere, and going nowhere very quick.  Since then, my view on what our \\"civilization\\" pretends to be took a definite turn.<br /><br />The images are beautiful and of poetic quality.  The music by Philip Glass is great.  I have seen this movie several times, and I still find it one of the best pictures ever made.
B001PB3NWK|5.0|I ordered this film from Canada because you can't get the second part in the UK and it was totally worth while. The Pope, The man is wonderful and a little more accurate than A Man Who became Pope which took liberties with the early part of JP's life. I was profoundly moved by many aspects of both films-I will treasure this DVD.     Both films are a beautiful, moving tribute to a man who taught love and practiced what he preached. I think they are wonderfully acted by the title roles- I cannot recommend them highly enough. Pope Benedict himself gave them a favourable review but you don't need to be Catholic, Christian or even religious to recognise the goodness of JPII and see the gift he had with people- especially youth.     This film captures the essence of who Karol was and what motivated him in a time of oppression and fear. It puts the message of John Paul's papacy 'DO NOT BE AFRAID' into a new light when you see how hard he must have struggled not to let fear conquer him in his life.     In 'KAROL; THE POPE, THE MAN' the actors reprise their roles - Piotr Adamczyk is utterly superb in portraying the Pope to the point of his death. This young actor really does deserve praise. Together these are truly great films that inspire and uplift like the man himself.     I hope as many people as possible get the chance to enjoy them
B000SINT52|5.0|In Fahrenheit 9/11 the strange relationship between the Bush family and the Bin Laden's is exposed.  Both families had interests in the Carlyle Group, one of the major arms suppliers of the US military.  That partially explains how it was possible that 24 family members of the Bin Laden's were flying to their home country after the attacks, the only planes officially permitted to fly at that time by... the White House...  All other planes were kept on the ground.  An ex-FBI agent claims this to be totally absurd.  If you have a suspected murderer, you first talk to whoever is close to him, family members first.  That's what any cop would do.  Why didn't president Bush let this happen ?  Was he afraid something could have been revealed?<br /><br />This picture also shows there never really was any serious effort to find the suspected \\"Bad Guy\\", Osama bin Laden.  It took the US military two months to start looking after him, sending only 11.000 troops to Afghanistan, just enough to have a new president in office, who helped US corporations in to build a new pipeline.  The search on Osama bin Laden was stopped before it ever began.  In this picture, you will literally hear Bush say : \\"I don't know where he is and don't want to spend much time on it\\".  So here we had the biggest \\"foreign attack\\" on the US, performed by 15 Saudi's, under alleged orders of Osama Bin Laden, and Bush doesn't care !?  Probably because either he had nothing to do with the attacks, or worse, because it would have been too dangerous for him telling the full truth, should they ever have captured him alive.  We must never forget Bin Laden was a CIA-man.  And the saying goes : once CIA, always CIA.<br /><br />Although Bush doesn't care finding Bin Laden, he insists in fighting a \\"war on terror\\" !  Who are the enemies then ?  Well, it seems that YOU are, or maybe I am.  After 9/11 everybody suddenly became a possible \\"suspect\\".  A Fresno peace group was infiltrated by a secret service agent !  A retired man going to a gym was visited afterward by the FBI (!) because he made a casual remark on Bush.  And at airports breast milk was considered suspect.  This \\"war on terror\\" was above all a war on the liberties of the American people, although it's called, with a certain irony, the \\"Patriot Act\\".  And the American people believed it.  The objective was having the American people to turn to their \\"leader\\" to protect them.  But protect them from who ?  The most dangerous men at that time had their office in the White House.  They were the \\"leaders\\" - like Cheney and Rumsfeld.  And in this atmosphere of fear the war on Iraq was started, in March 2003, when Iraq had nothing whatsoever to do with the alleged \\"foreign attack\\" on 9/11.  Rumsfeld says in this movie, after you see some images of dead babies, children, women and men in Iraq, that the military puts \\"a lot of humanity in the war effort\\".  I don't believe in God, but Rumsfeld does give me a pretty good idea of what the Devil looks like !to a gym was visited afterward by the FBI (!) because he made a casual remark on Bush.

B0000CDL93|5.0|If you ever thought about Eisenhower's wise words in his farewell speech : \\"beware of the military-industrial complex\\", and kept wondering what he really meant, well, look at this film.  President Kennedy wanted a Pax Americana for the world.  (By the way, when was the last time you ever heard those words ?)  President Kennedy wanted to make peace with the Soviet Union, and he wanted to retreat all troops from Vietnam by 1965.  The day after he was killed, Johnson took over and immediately sent more troops to Vietnam.  The US would stay there till 1975.  The war was lost in human and political terms, but the \\"military-industrial\\" complex got richer and more powerful.  Bell sold their helicopters, General Dynamics their fighters, etc.  War is the biggest industry in the US, but the public doesn't know how it works.  We aren't allowed to know, because of \\"national security\\".  So there's a lot of money to be made, since furthermore, there's no sharp line to be drawn between the military ordering equipment and the industry offering it.<br /><br />This film is very important.  It shows the exact point in history when the US lost the very significance of its democracy.  Since then, the US are an evil empire, where foreign politics doesn't depend on the personal ideas of the elected president, but on what the military-industrial complex wants.  Obama already said he would increase the defense budget.  He also said he wanted to retreat troops from Iraq, but immediately added that the situation in Afghanistan merits more attention.  Obama promised change, but he didn't even remove the secretary of Defense of Bush !  What kind of change is this ?  In his place, I would be scared to death also.  Remember Kennedy fired Dulles from the CIA, and who \\"helped\\" trying finding out who killed president Kennedy in the Warren commission ?  Yeah, precisely : his good old buddy Dulles...  What kind of \\"democracy\\" is this ?<br /><br />This film shows in quite some detail how the conspiracy was forged.  To begin with, all standard security procedures were violated.  The major of Dallas changed the route of the presidential car, so that it included a slow turn.  A lonely shooter was blamed, and killed before the public could hear him say he really worked for the military intelligence - where he was taught Russian and was sent to Russia as a double agent.  He just managed to say to the cameras he was \\"a patsy\\".  Then Ruby, Oswald's killer, was injected with cancer cells, so he couldn't tell who was ordering him.  Immediately after the killing of Kennedy, CBS reported that \\"president Kennedy was hit by three shots\\" !  How did they know that ?  Who said that anyway ?  It was false, to begin with.  The Zapruderfilm showed there were at least six shots !  And to prevent the truth to emerge, the autopsy of Kennedy was interrupted by some admirals, taking the corpse away to Washington, where the brain of Kennedy \\"was lost\\" and the photos of his dead body manipulated.  More intriguing is that in New Zealand the newspapers had the full story of Oswald and his fake biography four hours before he was actually charged with the murder of the president, following Colonel Fletcher Prouty, X in the film, and author of the book \\"JFK - The CIA, Vietnam and the plot to assassinate John F. Kennedy\\".<br /><br />Hitler said in \\"Mein Kampf\\" : The bigger the lie, the more credibility it gets, \\"since it would never come into the heads of the people to fabricate colossal untruths, and they would not believe that others could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously. Even though the facts which prove this to be so may be brought clearly to their minds, they will still doubt and waver and will continue to think that there may be some other explanation.\\"<br /><br />Ambassador Joseph Wilson said : \\"... a majority of Americans, wanting to trust in the president and his words, actually came to believe that Saddam had nuclear weapons and was somehow responsible for the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.\\"<br /><br />Now, in the fake democracy the US is nowadays, it seems very likely that even 9/11 was orchestrated by the military-industrial complex.  I know you'll probably have problems believing this.  I had trouble to believe it myself, I'll tell you.  Hear me out, and above all : compare with what happened to Kennedy.  To begin with, the murderer was immediately identified.  No need to go through a thorough investigation.  Osama bin Laden was blamed immediately by Bush.  How did they know that ?  This is very weird, taking into consideration that the intelligence was apparently a total mess, since those attacks happened in the first place.  Now, as happened in the case of Oswald, Osama bin Laden was CIA, and the saying goes : once CIA, always CIA.  Now, if you have a suspect, like Osama bin Laden, then it's even stranger that you let all his family members fly away on 9/12, when not a single other plane in the US was allowed to fly.  Probably, like with Oswald, the military-industrial complex was not interested that the public became aware of the connections Osama bin Laden still had with the CIA, or maybe they didn't want to reveal the relationship of the Bush and the bin Laden families, shown by Michael Moore in his film Fahrenheit 9/11.  What's for sure is that the White House wasn't interested in a investigation.  George W. Bush also interfered with Congress investigating the attacks, saying - on the record, see Fahrenheit 9/11 : \\"It's important for us not to reveal how we collect information.  That's what the enemy wants.\\"<br /><br />We also have a clear problem with some \\"evidence\\" that was shown to all of us on 9/11.  They told us the Pentagon was hit by a plane.

There weren't any remains of a fuselage, the motors, the wings, no, nothing at all, let alone some bodies...  Compare with any other plane crash you have seen photos of...<br /><br />To make the similarities with the Kennedy assassination complete, it is also very intriguing that the BBC announced the collapse of the Solomon Brothers Building (WTC7), a huge skyscraper, 23 minutes before it actually happened !  Even worse, when they announced it, you could still see the building erect on the live images behind the speaker.  Don't believe me.  I don't ask you that.  I prefer you check it out for yourself : do a web search with the words \\"Solomon brothers collapse BBC\\".<br /><br />Now, the collapse of the Solomon Brothers building is at the same time the \\"magic bullet mystery\\" of 9/11.  I do not know of any law or force in nature that when two skyscrapers collapse, it will always take a third skyscraper down.  In this way, the Solomon Brothers represents the \\"magic collapse mystery\\" of 9/11.<br /><br />As with the Kennedy killing, we have to look beyond the facts, and ask WHY this happened, and take a look on the consequences of this \\"attack\\".  The list is as follows : (1) the war in Afghanistan, (2) the invasion of Iraq, (3) the Patriot Act, limiting our democratic, civil rights and (4) the Guant&aacute;namo prison, where people were jailed without legal defense and even tortured.<br /><br />When presidents of the US draw a line between Good and Evil, I always feel uncomfortable.

0143036556|5.0|Jared Diamond wonders if one day, tourists will be looking to the rusty casco's of skyscrapers in New York, like we now look at the ruins of the cities of the Maya's, overgrown with the jungle.  The answer is clear.  The question is not if the US Empire will fall.  The question is : when ?<br /><br />The US Empire is just a short phase in history. It will collapse, like all other empires before.  And it will probably go down for the same reasons, for exhausting its natural resources.  Oil has been industrially exploited since 1901, but at current consumption levels, we'll only have for maximum 150 years left.  At the same time, the burning of fossil fuels is producing global warming, which affects the availability of drinking water and will produce climate shifts affecting agriculture also.<br /><br />Is there a way out ?  There certainly still is.  There is no mysterious solution behind the horizon.  It is very simple.  The World Scientists' Warning To Humanity, issued on November 18, 1992, is quite clear : \\"A new ethic is required - a new attitude towards discharging our responsibility for caring for ourselves and for the earth.  We must recognize the earth's limited capacity to provide for us.  We must recognize its fragility.  We must no longer allow it to be ravaged.  This ethic must motivate a great movement...\\"<br /><br />To begin with, we should treat nature with respect.  We should change to sustainable production and consumption.  But to do this, we should change our interpretation of welfare.  We should stop being compulsive consumers buying a lot of toys (car, TV, cell phone, iPod, etc.).  Studies have showed that material objects don't produce happiness.  On the contrary, they only produce frustration, since \\"newer models\\" appear continuously on the market, and people try desperately to follow and to \\"upgrade\\" to whatever new things are launched to the market.  It is clear that happiness cannot be achieved through consumption.  Happiness can only emerge by things that move deep emotions, simple things that are... totally free... like love, friendship and the contact with nature.  Henry Thoreau taught us a lot about how to learn to leave things alone.p emotions, simple things that are... totally free... like love, friendship and the contact with nature.

B000TUXL2A|4.0|Mark Knopfler's \\"Kill to Get Crimson\\" is about as far away from the amped-up Dire Straits albums of the late 80s and early 90s as you can get.  Virtually none of the pep from \\"Walk of Life\\" can be found - instead we're faced with an album of quiet, mellow tunes replete with meaningful lyrics and soulful guitars.    And that's a good thing.    This is one of those albums that's a perfect accompaniment for driving by yourself on a quiet rainy afternoon, or sitting by the fire half-reading a magazine while thinking about life, or enjoying some quiet time with friends and loved ones.  The songs tell stories that should be listened to and thought about - no repetitive rock-anthem stuff here.  And each song is backed by Knopfler's trademark guitar - always a pleasure.    While perhaps not an album with universal appeal, it sure as heck will be keep finding its way to the top of your playlist or back into the CD shuffle tray.  Check it out.

0393330435|2.0|I received this book as a gift from my wife who knows of my nostalgic love of the 8-bit era of computing.  I almost wish I hadn't read this book, as it changed my impression of the character and credibility of Steve Wozniak.  I had always thought of him as a soft-spoken, somewhat whimsical, brilliant engineer, who was the actual brains behind Apple's successes.  Being of Polish descent was an extra bonus, since I am as well.  I was always amazed at how Steve Wozniak could tolerate the rantings of the sociopathic Steve Jobs.    After reading the book, my opinion of his character has fallen.  Steve's ego is an overwhelming presence throughout this book, and colors what would otherwise be a more entertaining read.  I do understand that he is a brilliant guy, and has done many clever things throughout his life, but so have several other people, especially in open source - with far less ego.    His facts also leave something to be desired, although I believe this to be tainted by his having a personal role in things.  The MITS Altair was the first personal computer, and the Commodore 64 came to be far more popular than the Apple II, eventually being in the Guinness Book of World Records as selling the most units.  Even Xerox PARC pioneered much of the technology that Apple used much later in its own models.    For those with a love of the 8-bit era such as myself, I recommend a couple of more entertaining reads: [[ASIN:0887309895 Dealers of Lightning: Xerox PARC and the Dawn of the Computer Age]] and [[ASIN:0973864907 On the Edge: the Spectacular Rise and Fall of Commodore]], which are far more factual and in-depth reviews of that era than Steve's ego-driven homilies.

B000YXMMAE|5.0|I am ashamed to say that I didn't give Radiohead's masterwork In Rainbows much of a chance on first release as I had been previously let down by the not-so-inspired Hail to the Thief back in 2005.  But let me tell you this straight up... even if In Rainbows doesn't do much for you on first listen, on the third or fourth it will hit you like a ton of weird fishes. This is without apology the band's greatest achievement to date (which is saying a lot I know)... but seriously, this album is like taking the best elements of everything in their illustrious career, chewing them up, and then spitting them out in one big \\"rainbow\\" of colours.    Let's start with the lyrics and vocals by Mr. Yorke. Of all comparisons, I am happy to state that this shares most in common with 1995's The Bends in that Yorke is writing about personal themes again, maybe even more personal than on that landmark recording. Songs like Nude, House of Cards, and All I Need sound like he's singing directly to someone, expressing intimate feelings of loneliness, shame, and love. These were elements that were either fragmented or completely missing from albums like Kid A and Amnesiac. However, the experimentation of those equally great recordings still remains an integral part of Radiohead's arsenal of talent. Jonny Greenwood brings in string arrangements, trippy beats, and that haunting ondes Martenot he has mastered so well over the years. Meanwhile, it is apparent the rest of the band has had an equal part in the genesis of the songs just as they did in 1997's critical darling, OK Computer. Special emphasis must be given to Ed O'Brien's background vocals which have become a huge part of the band's live performance and are quite lovely in contrast to Thom. Phil and Colin continue to be the steady backbeat to the most adventurous rock band since Pink Floyd and they do so gracefully, without trying to steal the show.    And that just might be the greatest compliment I can give to In Rainbows. Every member of Radiohead is talented enough to flaunt their gifts like most rock bands on radio tend to do. But instead, Yorke and company practice the gift of restraint and focus on the needs of the song. Limiting the cd to 10 tracks is proof of this discipline and it pays off more than can be imagined. After the 43 minutes are over, it leaves you wanting more and more....
0345479092|5.0|Preparing for our first newborn, I read many many books, and had made this book to be one of my favorite reference baby books. I read the book since I was 4 months pregnant, and had been using it for months until my baby is one year old. Thanks to this book, that I was able to differentiate my son's cries - whether he was hungry, wanted to be cuddled or in pain. I also learnt his feeding schedule and made the daily journal, which was very helpful for his Nanny when I was back to work.

0446677450|3.0|Let's quell any rumors here and now: Robert Kiyosaki has made his money from this series of books and supporting MLM, or Multi-Level Marketting (i.e. Amway/Primerica/Mary Kay/Girl Scout Cookies). This is not to say there is anything wrong with it, but it is a \\"Best Selling\\" book not because of authorship or information, but because of hype and motivation.    I will give this book credit for one thing though: it started my interest in financial independence, and without reading this book or playing his Cashflow game, I would have simply gone on life without a budget, investment/retirement plan, or self-marketing myself.    Pick up an actual book on actual finances, learn about stocks, learn about going into business for yourself. You need to understand money, where it goes, how to balance and budget. This book will not teach that, so I would look into something that does: [[ASIN:0470038322 Personal Finance For Dummies, 5th edition]] might not be a bad start. [[ASIN:0452289211 The Neatest Little Guide to Stock Market Investing]] might be another.    Let me sum up what this book will teach you:    Financial literacy is key. Chances are you learned money from your parents, and unless you were born with a silver spoon in your mouth, they probably did not teach you about the inner workings of money. They do not teach it in school either, so you are left to learn on your own. Robert contends that \\"Rich Dad\\" took time to demonstrate self initiative. See the books posted above, and the very last, for a good start on personal finance.    Pay yourself first to force yourself to invest. Learn how to generate the money to pay your bills. \\"Necessity if the mother of invention\\" and will fuel your creative outlets to earn more.    Avoid purchasing liabilities, or things that do not generate income. Rolex watches, fancy cars, going out to eat all the time.    Purchase assets, or things that have the potential to generate income. Stocks, bonds, real estate (market willing), and otherinvestments.    Use money from assets to fund your liabilities, or reinvest it.    If you can take these lessons to heart, you can save yourself on this purchase.

B000002H97|3.0|I've never been able to successfully listen to the second half of Metallica's self titled effort without losing interest immediately. Once \\"Wherever I May Roam\\" fades out, the album essentially deflates and meanders along aimlessly with fairly mediocre and forgettable tunes like \\"Don't Tread On Me\\" and \\"The God That Failed\\". The record is briefly reinvigorated by introduction of the beautiful ballad \\"Nothing Else Matters\\", but only briefly. From then on, \\"Metallica\\" continues on its downward spiral until it reaches the conclusion with \\"The Struggle Within\\" and i'm left feeling disappointment and confusion.     While the heavy production and pristine sound really enhances Metallica's sound and the album in many areas, in others it just adds too much weight without substance and the result is a bloated, over the top mess.     The Album still receives a 3 star rating, because while it wasn't a wholly solid album overall, it still contains six 5 star tracks, of each are some of the most celebrated songs by fans (and myself) in Metallica's entire catalogue. Check out that 12 string bass in Roam!
0375413405|5.0|752 pages. Black & white. No photos.  Side column lists ingredients and their quantities, for copying to your shopping list.  Main column gives step-by-step instructions.    It satisfies both my curiosity and my appetite. It is a joy to watch the food transform as I cook. When it's finished, it smells good, and I can gulp down at least 3 servings.    If you are new to cooking, you should read from the beginning, and learn how to use a knife. Also, for beginner cooks like me, it usually ended in not-so-great food when I changed recipes slightly. So I have the book nearby and read it after each step.    My favorite chapters are those on soups and vegetables. It even tells you how to peel onions!    I have learned that great cooking does not require a refrigerator at home, or fancy cookware.    Do you prepare for disasters? Do you store canned foods in large quantities? I have not had to evacuate, but I'm inclined to take a copy of this book, too.    A cautionary note: Many recipes use butter, which is unhealthy. I usually substitute with extra light olive oil. This is not a fast cookbook.
B001E1BNWI|5.0|I purchased both a physical, digital and LP version of this disc in anticipation of its release. I was not disappointed. The packaging for both the physical CD and LP version is phenominal. There are a few minor discrepencies with the CD packaging (for instance, the coffin cut out obscures much of the lyrics), but the LP package is absolutely flawless. It was very well put together and i'm proud to say i own it.     Each individual LP sleeve shocases the brilliant artwork also seen in the CD version, and as a bonus the entirety of the album's lyrics are printed on their own sheet for quick viewing. The lithograph seems a bit pointless to me, but worthy of framing (if that's your thing). I should note the box the LPs come in is very fragile and easy to scuff, so be wary when storing or displaying it. I don't really care for it, but i can understand other collectors who would.     Since the LP's are printed on 180gram slabs and mastered at 45RPM, Each song takes up the entirety of one side, each disc having two songs (5 total sleeves, each with a piece of artwork on either side).   there is some controversy over sound and production issues, but i don't think they are large enough to really bog the record down in terms of overall quality. For those with questions about the mastering on the vinyl as compared to the mastering on the CD version, unfortunately the LPs were cut from the same master tapes as the retail version and suffer the same compression issues many fans mentioned. I will say though that the vinyl version has a warmer, beefier overall sound and is still leagues above the retail edition.     The music is awesome. Metallica really put out a fine record in 2008, and one i am happy to announce i listened to over... and over... and over... and OVER again until i was just too burned out to listen anymore. I highly recommend this box set for any avid collector or any die hard fan with an extra $115 bucks to spend.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Not only is this gameboard easy to use, but it's so intelligent that it automatically adjusts to whatever program you happen to be using. You can program keys or keystrokes simply by using the MR button. Could not be any easier. FYI for all you with Windows Vista, you must run the G13 program as administrator or it will not work. This is so much more comfortable for prologed gaming than just using the keyboard. The joystick also helps if you want to get really lazy, although it takes some getting used to due to its sensitivity. Overall, I highly recommend the G13 for everyone who loves PC gaming.
1563890119|5.0|Any new review of Neil Gaiman's Sandman series must at least MENTION those who came before. This series, which represents a decade of Mr. Gaiman's professional life, was originally published by the DC Comics imprint Vertigo, and is now available as a set of ten softbound \\"graphic novels.\\" Each of these volumes boasts a foreword by a different notable personality, and these introductions share one commonality: they are positively lavish in their praise for Mr. Gaiman's opus.    The \\"introducers\\":        * Karen Berger      * Clive Barker      * Steve Erickson      * Harlan Ellison      * Samuel R. Delaney      * Gene Wolfe      * Peter Straub      * Stephen King      * Frank McConnell      * Mikal Gilmore    This list (in case you didn't notice) includes some of genre fiction's all-time greats. It was this list (which I discovered as I was idly perusing the back cover of my newly-purchased copy of \\"Preludes and Nocturnes\\") that gave me my first clue that I was onto something rare.  \\"OMG,\\" I thought to myself (and yes, sometimes I think in acronyms). \\"If THESE bad boys of fiction have deemed the Sandman worthy of praise, then it's certainly good enough for me!\\"    As for the books themselves?  They did not disappoint.    The Sandman series loosely chronicles the life of Morpheus, King of Dreams. Dream and his alliteratively-named family (Death, Destiny, Delirium, Despair, Desire, and Destruction) comprise the \\"Never-Ending,\\" and it is the trials and travails of this group that makes up the heart of the Sandman series.    Though this work falls squarely in the realm of \\"fantasy,\\" it is the tales' pragmatic humanity that makes them great. In The Sandman, Gaiman explores a broad range of worldly issues ranging from man's struggle with mortality to intra-familial communication to the onerous responsibilities of work. Gaiman doesn't shy away from life's most fundamental affairs, and he somehow manages to do this in an easygoing style tinged with just the right amount of wry humor. What's more, his literary acumen is such that EVERYONE will catch a reference to something they've read, and I suspect that everyone will miss many more.    Comic books are supposed to make you laugh out loud. But tear up? In public? And what comic book author quotes Kipling on life after death?!    \\"They will come back, come back again,  As long as the red earth rolls.  He never wasted a leaf or a tree.  Do you think He would squander souls?\\"  -Rudyard Kipling    (You've got to give him points for brevity!)    The Sandman is the real deal. It's art, it's literature, and most importantly it's a damn good story. Though I'm not overly familiar with the medium, I can safely say this: The Sandman is the first work I'd recommend to a reader completely unfamiliar with the genre.
B00004U8DR|2.0|This was my first album when I was a kid in junior high.  I've owned several LP versions and had the CD until my kids lost it.  I replaced it with this expecting it to be faithful to the original, but was stunned to hear a different mix of Break on Through.  Some \\"genius\\" added more vocals which totally ruined it for me.  Don't screw with a classic.  If you want the original version go to e bay and get the 1988 released CD.

It has helped me to become a kind communicator. I can express the loving kind intent I have in a way that is understood and appreciated by others.

This will eliminate the arguments and tangents that usually come up and it will allow you to be completly understood in a loving way. It's amazing!
B001DJ7PQ4|4.0|Just saw the last of S4, and we were knocked off our seats.  In just about every way, S4 outdid past seasons, smacking us upside the head - funny, sad and (almost) always exciting.  The new Who series continues to achieve that rare balance for seasoned sci-fi franchises, rewarding fanboys without enslaving itself to them, enticing newcomers w/o having to dumb itself down.    The disc begins w/\\"Voyage of the Damned\\", a Christmas treat putting our hero aboard \\"Starship Titanic\\" as she sails into destiny.  Following last season's lead, the Christmas ep. is annual rite - the doctor tries to drown his sorrows, being between companions.  Instead of Catherine Tate, the Doctor teams up with a surprisingly effective (and sympathetic) Kylie Minogue.    \\"Partners in Crime\\", the regular series premiere, returns the none-too-rough charms of Donna Noble (Tate) as she and the doctor investigate a suspicious corporation's seeming cure for obesity.  Sure, it's a setup we've seen before (evil Aliens plotting under the guise of doing business) but the story works because it creates a new dynamic between the characters that's more than just a variation of \\"Doctor/Rose\\".  Setting the tone for the stories to come, \\"Partners\\" manages to be funny, gross and cute all at once .    In \\"The Fires of Pompeii\\", a routine trip to ancient Rome (?) turns catastrophic when our heroes find themselves at the foot of Vesuvius on the eve of Pompeii's destruction.  This was a great story, with Donna (and the rest of us) learning the hard way just how paradoxically powerless a Time Lord can be before the forces of destiny.  Also great, the story works (in the best Whovian tradition) by working through guest characters who are more than useless bystanders.    \\"Planet of the Ood\\" reunites us with the squid-head-like Aliens last seen in Season 2.  The Ood were slaves, and lingering questions about that situation are fully explored here.  This was another predictable episode in terms of plot - we know who thebad guys are and how the story should resolve itself - but the presentation outweighs the predictability.  This definitely a standout story.    With the 2 episode Sontaran story (\\"Sontaran Stratagem\\" and the \\"Poison Sky\\") the season begins  a low arc - giving us a weak story meant to bring back the classic Sontarans to the new series.  Despite also bringing back UNIT and Martha Jones, and laying the seeds for expanded roles for Donna's family (her grandfather is played by screen vet Bernard Cribbins), this story just went through the motions.  It wouldn't be so bad except that the arc goes into a 3rd story - \\"The Doctor's Daughter\\", which dumps our heroes into that reliable sci-fi plot device, the endless war between two races who don't even know (or care) why they're fighting.  Russel Davies doubtlessly wanted to take some potshots at militarims (giving almost equal time to the Sontarans and the toy soldiers of UNIT, then following up with a story taking soldiering to its logical conclusion - war without end.  Unfortunately, it's been done before - repeatedly.  Fred Freiberger must be laughing his head off.  After all the gravitas, the Doctor & Donna take a well-deserved rest in the English countryside, and find themselves in an Agatha Christie-style whodunit, complete with sneaky guests, giant wasps and Agatha Christie.  It's a minor story that manages to put the season back on track - and the season only picks up steam after that.    The two-ep. story, \\"Silence in the Library\\" and \\"Forest of the Dead\\" is more than enough to make us forget earlier lapses .  The Doctor and Donna find themselves on a library world, and alone - their only company being some rapacious monster (or swarm) hiding in shadows, and a team of archaeologists trying to learn the library's most terrifying secret - namely, what happened to everyone there.  At the same time, we meet a young girl for whom the library, the shadows and the Doctor are all just some bad dream.  (Since movies like \\"The Matrix\\" and \\"6th Sense\\", fantasy just loves stories that hit on our ability to decide the real from the illusion - and this arc is one of them).  Great atmospherics, a consistently enigmatic plot and characters to match make this an unforgettable story.  Among other things, we finally see that it's possible for time lords to run into people they know before *they've* met them (?)    The darkness grows with \\"Midnight\\" - a claustrophobic story that strands the doctor inside of a tour bus plying its way across a poisoned planet.  Deadly xtonic radiation has made Midnight a world as beautiful as it is forbidding.  This was a great story, among other things the Doctor finds his charming cleverness becomes a liability - certainly among those who aren't clever or charming.    \\"Turn Left\\" gives us the year that wasn't - what if The Doctor hadn't met Donna that fateful Christmas?  Unfortunately for Donna (and the rest of us), this alternate history follows our own too closely, with crashing star-liners, invading Sontarans and labor camps for foreigners.  This was a great story because it skillfully and bravely re-imagines other Who stories, and also because it sets the store for the finale.    And as for that, Who is no disappointment.  Davies tosses in everything - faces old and new, companions of the past, dark realizations and enough Daleks to destroy the universe - and a few other surprises.  The finale skillfully weaves themes and clues developed over the course of the season.  That's right, the Bad Wolf is back.  The finale is big, it's loud and by the end you'll probably be scratching your head just trying to figure out what just happened, but that just means you'll have an extra reason to slip these discs in and hit play.  With iits knotty plots and complex clues, the new DW outdoes the competition, proving you don't need constant snogging (or threat of it) and pottymouth to make a truly mature sci-fi epic.
0743289684|4.0|I heard Ayaan Hirsi Ali speak at a conference in Washington, D.C., about a year and a half ago.  She was inspiring, to say the least.  She has overcome daunting challenges.  She embodies a lot of the courage I personally wish I had.  I was listening to her more because she was religious and became an atheist than for her views about Islam, per se.    I got her book and read it, and enjoyed it thoroughly.    However, I was dismayed to follow her in the months since then.  She's become a bit of a tool in the hands of Islamophobics and war-mongering neo-cons, which is a sad thing.  Someone here expressed their concern that her experiences didn't represent the general way of life among Muslims, and that Islam is not the problem.    I agree that Islam is not the problem.  RELIGION is the problem.  Believing something to be true without any evidence is the problem.  Ayaan escaped that, and did so courageously.  Hearing her speak about her journey out of religion is inspiring.  Her politics: not so much.

Well, not so with this album; especially to me, a \\"baby boomer\\" who remembers really good music in the style of Dusty Springfield, Tina Turner, etc.    THIS particular purchase of \\"Rockferry\\" was for my daughter, who, upon listening to the album in my car while we drove together, wanted the album immediately.

Bob Marley & the Wailers were geniuses that created music that will be timeless for hundreds of years to come.  I am about to purchase this product today.  It will be the 4th set I have purchased!!  Over time people have borrowed some of the Cd's and never returned them.  I have also had \\"former\\" friends (LOL) who have stolen them without asking because they loved the box set so much!!  I have been forced to keep buying this set.  I will just have to put it on my IPOD and then keep the box set in a safe deposit box at my bank!! (LOL)  There are songs on here that I had never heard before because they weren't the big hits that most people have heard.  But they are the best songs in this set.  This collection really expanded my love for Bob's music.  It also contains a lot of the hits that are well known but are usually in different formats or are the live versions.  I am usually not a big fan of those but for this set they are simply amazing.  This box set is my favorite collection of any music.  I prove that by having to buy the box set every year.  But I am happy to do it for Bob's surviving family.  I just wish more artists would use this as an example of how to create a box set of someones career in music.  I would spend a hundred dollars a set if I had to.  Its worth EVERY PENNY!!

The day it arived at my house I was excited to open it up and begin to relieve the show that made me laugh and cry. Amazong packaged the set amazingly. It was tightly wrapped in 2 boxes so that it wold not get damaged while being shipped. After I tore open the boxes I grabbed my set out and examined it. No dents or marks. Amazon did a great job with the packaging. The set itself is beautiful. You open it up and inside are 6 different cd cases inside. Each case has a friend on each. One side is when they were older as the show progressed and the other side was a picture of what they looked like when the show first began. The disc in each case did the same thing. Then i noticed that there was a big booklet inside. The booklet is long and includes a note from the creators about how the show came to be and also rundowns of each episode. The booklet is beautiful cause there are also promo pictures of them inside which are very nice pictures.    Overall I have to say that I am very satisfied with this set. There are 40 discs inside. There are also special features as well. I am happy that I get to remain friends with Rachel, Ross, Monica, Chandler, Joey and Phoebe. This show is a hit and a must have.
B000LPQ6DE|1.0|I am frankly astonished at the popularity of this adaptation of Charlotte Bronte's masterpiece. The plot, certainly, is little changed, and the soundtrack and cinematography create a marvelously gothic feel. But the actors are terribly miscast. Ruth Wilson is a pretty good Jane, her only major flaw being that she is far too pretty and vibrant. Toby Stephens is not only far too attractive, but he plays Rochester as Hugh Grant might have done it - down to the roguish winks. Rochester broods - Stephens sulks for the first few scenes and then turns himself to flirting outrageously with Jane, something the original character never did until he was engaged to her. The original dialogue is replaced with dumbed-down anachronistic paraphrases. If the screenwriters had changed the dialogue to fit in better with their adaptation, or even to add their own artistic touch, it might have turned out acceptably, but these are line-by-line paraphrases of original speech. The quotations themselves, while not obviously out of place, contain just enough subtle anachronisms that they fall awkwardly from supposed 19th century lips. And this is not the only example of the screenwriters assuming they would be pandering to idiots - I'm pretty sure that anyone of the slightest intelligence could tell that Blanche Ingram was nasty without having a ouija board spell out \\"heartless.\\" Not to mention that in the 1830s, a non-spiritualist like Rochester would be very unlikely to possess such a thing as an ouija board.
B000W1V7K4|3.0|i bought this BD for $8. 3.5* story; 4.5* video; 4* audio; 3* acting. i think HIS 14 should be in jeopardy if no major change.
0446579939|4.0|Another easy reading story in North Carolina.  There is one character in this story that is not likeable and you wonder what Sparks has in mind for him.  But the true part of the story is the love story and searching for a meaning of a lucky photo that Logan had found while on duty in Iraq.  He comes home to search for the woman in the photo.  Thank you Nicholas for another great story.
B000TGJ8A8|4.0|this BD movie story is simple. the only reason i purchase ($13) is that i like Jessica Biel. 4.5* for video, 3.5* for story, 3.5* for acting,4* for audio.

I cannot WAIT to see what she does for a ENCORE! This book is  a beautiful, personal, amazing scrapbook/diary/journal. You really get the  feeling that Kat wanted to honestly explain her love and passion for her Art and her life. Not only is this a TATTOO TRIBUTE but she also goes in  to her love of music, her childhood, her family and ALL of her passion's.  We get to see and understand WHAT makes KAT, KAT. ***PLEASE KAT IF YOU CAN EVER FIND THE TIME...WRITE ANOTHER ONE because THIS is SOMETHING ELSE   that you excel at !

B000N3ST3Y|4.0|I like Genesis better live, actually. The 80s synth is a bit too prominent on their studio albums for my liking, but there's no denying that the circa-1990 version of the band had a slew of well-crafted pop-rock hits...just think of songs like \\"I Can't Dance\\", \\"Invisible Touch\\", \\"No Son of Mine\\", and \\"Jesus He Knows Me\\".  And this collection has them all. It's not really for serious fans, they'll have all of this material already, obviously, but for casual listeners who don't know, don't like or just don't care about the Peter Gabriel-years and the lamb which laid down on Broadway, \\"Turn it on Again\\" is a really great purchase. And the Peter Gabriel-fans can easily find all the stuff that they like on the 1998 box set.    This is indeed the best of the Phil Collins-years, if you will. There is bound to be some personal favourite missing, but again - this is not for hardcore fans, this is a single-disc greatest hits-compilation, and a very succesful one at that. And what is here is terrific: \\"Land of Confusion\\", the dramatic \\"Mama\\", \\"Hold on my Heart\\", \\"Throwing it all Away\\", all the aforementioned MTV-era hits...and one oddity, the Gabriel-era classic \\"I Know what I Like\\", which the compilers might have been unsure how to categorize since it features both Gabriel and Collins.  But anyway. \\"Turn it on Again\\" is where you start out, or where you finish up, perhaps, if you just want the hits. A really fine collection of songs.

B000WCBPOG|5.0|Its Moulin Rouge meets the 60's.  Fantastic!  I've never been a big Beatles fan (not to say I don't respect the greatness of their work).  But, this compilation has won me over completely.  The raw talent of voices is a breath of fresh air.  Production is genius as well. Each song is an art piece within itself.  Enjoy!
B000024E9J|5.0|REVIEW: From the sinister, Mother Goose enchantments of the \\"NURSERY CRYME\\" LP: art/rock legends Genesis (with Peter Gabriel in lead) crafts a follow up album imbued with the aura of Judgement Day. Bearing the inscrutably comic title \\"FOXTROT\\": the record positions the group as the musical half-way point between such progressive rockers as Yes and Gentle Giant. The centerpiece is, of course, the oft-praised twenty-three-minute epic \\"Supper's Ready\\" which blends everyday scenarios into an apocalyptic tale involving the ravagings of the Anti-Christ, the battle of Armaggedon, and the victorious second coming of Christ Jesus who has \\"returned to lead His children home/to the take them to the New Jerusalem\\". It is an extraordinary work: quite possibly the best of its kind to ever come out of the \\"classical rock\\" movement. However, the rest of the LP is no slouch: with such fan favorites as \\"Watcher Of The Skies\\" and \\"Get 'Em Out By Friday\\", the stately \\"Time Table\\", the complexly layered \\"Can-Utility And The Coastliners\\", and the lovely guitar instrumental \\"Horizon's\\" there can be no doubt that Genesis had thrown down their gauntlet in the bid for art rock supremacy. Judging from the contents of \\"FOXTROT\\": they certainly deserve the nomination.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|There is little more to be added from the other reviews.  If you have Blu Ray and/or a 1080p capable set, this is as good as it gets.      While the packaging may indicate 1080i, our Panny 800U reports a 1080p data stream coming from this BBC version through at least the first two disks.  Whether that was the native production resolution remains unclear.
0446579939|5.0|My coming upon this book was very unusual and totally out of the normal for me.  First of all, I do not generallay read \\"LOVE STORIES\\".  I am more so into Theology and Personal Development books.  I was taking my Mom to a Doctor's appointment one day and as I went to get her something out of the Vending Machine, this young lady who was sitting on this bench caught my attention.  Yes, she was attractive, but I also notice that she was very deep into what she was reading.    During the time we were there, I ended up walking past her 3 more times.  Each time her concentration never waivered.  On the third trip past, when I going to move my truck closer to pick my Mom up and I commented to her that she was really into that book.  She looked up with a nice, but simple smile and responded that it was a great book.  Not a lot of words, but I could clearly tell she was enjoying it very much.  So I did not want to disturb her any longer, but finally on my last trip as I was walking my Mom to the truck, I noticed she was still there and still as focused as the first time I went past.  I for some reason had to know what she was reading.  She was wearing a very nice Gold Necklace with a Cross, so I thought perhaps it was a Theology book or some type of Doctrinal book that might interest me.    So I politely asked her if she minded if I asked her the name of the book and she just as politely gave me both the name and the author.  The unusual part of this is that I went out that evening and bought the book.  The title had really caught my attention.  I even started to grab a couple other of Mr. Sparks books (I believe they were At First Sight and True Believer), but again this was not really my subject of interest so I thought I would start with one.  That was on February 3rd.  I finally finished it yesterday!    Now for my comments.  I taught the book was fabulous.  I loved the characterizationn (to include Zeus and especially Nana, she reminded me of some I knew and some of hercomments sounded like something this person would say).  There were storylines that really caught my attention and the book just seemed to flow smoothly.  Probably much more so the rainfall that flooded the rivers as mention in some of the more suspenseful parts of the book.    This is the first time I have ever writtrn a review on a book I read and I know most of what I wrote about was how I came to read this, but trust me, for someone who was out of his realm as far as subject matter, this was a great read.  Bootom line is, I enjoy a good book no matter what the subject.  I am a strong believer in the more you read, the better you continue to be at reading.  I also enjoy a good author and I was impressed with Nicholas Sparks enough to give him another shot!    Finally, the thing I enjoyed most was that it was not so much as Love Story that a man who simply enjoyed romance such feel insecure about reading it.  I also came to find out that he also wrote \\"A Walk To Remember\\".  I have not read the book, but have watched the movie several times and consider it one of my favorite!  I will be picking up that book and the others I put back.    Thanks to that Young Lady, whomever she was!

B000CNESU8|5.0|When black comedies work, they make us laugh in spite of ourselves at things we know aren't funny. They also make us think. NETWORK is the perfect black comedy, exposing the insanity / idiocy of television and it's incredible power to pacify and destroy. It is to TV what DR. STRANGELOVE is to the cold war, CATCH-22 is to military madness, and LOLITA is to... well, you know. Others have commented quite eloquently on the prophetic, damningly accurate portrayal of television, its perpetrators, and its legions of hypnotized viewers. I will only add that no other movie stabs so ferociously at the medium. NETWORK draws blood! Everyone should see this movie at least once, before drifting back into comatose, tele-narcotic  bliss... P.S.- I must now say that the internet has usurped the power of television. It is now the black hole in which we gladly shove our minds...

B000UBMWG4|5.0|The Blu Ray version of Blade Runner is amazing, at least for the theatrical releases. Unfortunately there seems to be a bad run on the disc sets. My first set was missing the final cut edition of the movie.  It had a duplicate workprint disc with the disc 1 label.  After arranging a an exchange, I just received a second set with the same problem. Apparently others are facing the same problems as well. If you order the set be sure to check disc one and five to see if they are the same discs. One can compare the two discs for similarities.  Disc five has one commentary line and has a poorer screen quality than the other editions. Disc one is supposed to be a high quality edition which disc five is not.

0676979025|5.0|I must be almost the last person in North America to read Yann Martel's unforgettable tale, \\"Life of Pi.\\" Consider that there are now over 1900 reviews of the book on Amazon despite the fact that only a tiny percentage of a book's readers will ever take the time to do that, or that 16,095 members of Library Thing own it, making \\"Life of Pi\\" the 21st most popular book there.  Well, I can finally tell everyone that it was worth the wait.<br /><br />Yann Martel has written an inspiring story about the defining event in one man's life, an event that 16-year-old Pi Patel miraculously survives when so many others around him do not, something that shapes the rest of his life.  It does not hurt, of course, that the story involves a shipwreck, a 450-pound Bengal tiger, one small lifeboat drifting the vast Pacific Ocean, cannibalism, and a mysterious island in the middle of nowhere.<br /><br />Until his mid-teens, Pi Patel is raised in remote Pondicherry, India, where he and his brother are lucky enough to live on the grounds of the zoo managed by his father.  Pi's father, though, becomes disillusioned with the Indian government of the mid-seventies and decides to move the family to Canada.  The Patel family leaves India on the same freighter carrying a large number of zoo animals destined for new homes of their own in North American zoos.  Plans for man and animal alike, however, change one day just before dawn when Pi realizes that the ship is rapidly sinking.<br /><br />Suddenly the ship is gone and Pi finds himself sharing a 26-foot lifeboat with a severely injured zebra, a female orangutan elder, a manic hyena and, most importantly, a tiger so large that he alone fills half the boat's limited space.  Animals do what animals do, especially when faced with starvation, and only Pi and the tiger he calls Richard Parker are still around when the boat reaches land 227 days later.<br /><br />Yann Martel mixes realism and magic to just the right degree, allowing his readers to suspend their disbelief to the degree that everything that happens seems possible - and then he throws readers the kind of curve ball that will leave them standing at the plate with bats on shoulders, an alternate version of his entire story.  Each reader will have to choose for himself the version he believes to have happened, a choice that will tell much about the reader himself.  I cannot imagine a more perfect choice for book club discussion than \\"Life of Pi.\\"<br /><br />If you are one of the few yet to read \\"Life of Pi,\\" you have quite an experience ahead of you.egree that everything that happens seems possible - and then he throws readers the kind of curve ball that will leave them standing at the plate with bats on shoulders, an alternate version of his entire story.

1400032717|1.0|My son has autism, we live with autism, my friends are parents of children with autism, from my viewpoint Mark Haddon's book was an dispassionate rehashing of a younger Dustin Hoffman's Rainman character in London...not completely disagreeable, but I found it insulting and limiting to people with autism.  In the search to keep the story interesting,  Mr. Haddon uses Kurt Vonneguts' clever drawing style.  I wish there was something new and fresh here, but it was a tired cliche of unconscious people doing unconscious things in a dirty dark world. Even the writing style was arduous like freshman writing for college composition class.  yawn.
B001KZVQJI|5.0|I couldn't be more pleased with the incredible picture quality--no compression artifacts--and the 5.1 DTS surround sound! It's a terrifically well done action movie to begin with and has great acting and writing with excellent plot and character development. In the theatre it tends to drag and seems too long, however, at home it's perfect--even the extended version which runs 200 minutes, because you can view it in several sittings if desired, so it always remains fresh throughout. The special effects, which are quite possibly the best ever, come across beautifully on the Blu-Ray version, and the final scenes on top of the Empire State Building, with planes buzzing Kong, come completely to life with gorgeous, magnificently convincing imagery of the 70-year old NYC skyline near sunrise, with incredibly realistic surround sound effects and soundtrack. If you have any fear of heights you'll definitely get queasy--that's how real it is!! This is a great bargain for a fantastic Blu-Ray film!

B001CIPU3G|5.0|I've been listening to Trivium ever since I first got their 2005 release \\"Ascendancy\\" back in 2005 of course, and it instantly became one of my favorite metal albums. Their 2006 follow-up \\"The Crusade\\" was a more thrashier, faster, blistering outing that featured more melodic singing and less screaming. I loved that albums as well. Now, for the band's latest album 2008's \\"Shogun\\", Trivium have brought back the in your face metalcore-ish screaming and growling vocals that were present on \\"Ascendancy\\" and combine them with the intense thrashiness and melodic singing of \\"The Crusade\\" all in one heavy, blistering, yet melodic and thrashing epic metal album with seriously mindblowing results. \\"Shogun\\" is simply thus far, the best album that Trivium have put out, no questions asked, as well as one of the best metal cd's of 2008.<br /><br />For this album, Trivium have hired Nick Raskulinecz to produce the album, and his production is just brilliant, while Colin Richardson handles the mixing duties. The lyrics are absolutely brilliant and amazing, and definately some of the best lyrics that Trivium have written with some songs dealing with ancient Japanese and Greek mythology, and also themes based on the stories of Prometheus's punishment, (Of Prometheus and the Crucifix), sea monsters Scylla and Charybdis (Torn Between Scylla and Charybdis), Chronus eating his children (He Who Spawned the Furies), and the nymph Callisto (Like Callisto to a Star in Heaven) are present as well. This album really has such and interesting balance with each song going between heavy, and then melodic, and then back to heavy. Matt Heafy does such an outstanding job with his vocals, switching constantly, and yes I DO mean constantly from melodic singing to the no holds barred screaming and growling in almost an instant. This album definately features Matt's best vocal performance yet. The guitarwork by both Matt Heafy and Corey Beaulieu is just amazing throughout. The riffs are just thrashy, chunky, crushing, and downright heavy, and the solos are blazing, blistering, ripping, and insane. This album is just loaded with guitar solos left and right, and if you're a guitar solo junkie like myself, then you'll definately enjoy this album. Paulo Gregoletto's bass is also great, and he even plays a couple of bass solos on track two \\"Torn Between Scylla and Charybdis\\", and of course Travis Smith's drumming is fast, hammering and merciless, and he also does an outstanding job on the double bass. Travis is easily one of my favorite metal drummers today, and he just slays totally throughout this album.<br /><br />Every song on \\"Shogun\\" is long, epic, and of course amazing with most song clocking in at 5 minutes or more and several clocking in at nearly 5 minutes, and the last song which is the title track of course at nearly 12 minutes long. Some songs on here are thrashy, some are progressive, and while some others are downright melodic. Let's take a look at some of my favorites on here. Track one \\"Kirisute Gomen\\" is a brilliant opener and one of my favorite songs, which starts off shortly with some acoustic guitars which are quickly followed by panning drums, and some smooth electric guitars, and after when you hear Matt sing the opening line \\"HE WHO WALKS THE FIRE BREATHES\\", the song unleashes a barrage of insane, thrashing drums and drilling, machine gun riffing that will make you go crazy. Matt's vocals are outstanding, the chorus is very melodic and addicting, and the solos are just wicked and fantastic. Track two \\"Torn Between Scylla and Charybdis\\" features more awesome riffs and solos, and two great, chilling bass solos by Paulo as I mentioned earlier. \\"Down from the Sky\\" is another fantastic number that starts off very anthemy, before kicking into a catchy, moshing drum beat, with some catchy pumping riffs, and the melodic sung chorus is excellent as well. The lyrical theme of this song is the tyranny of World War II leaders, and the act of cruelty dealt tothe Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, when two American atomic bombs were dropped on them. My personal favorite song on here is track four \\"Into the Mouth of Hell We March\\" which is an awesome melodic thrasher that lyrically tells an awesome story about a shipwreck (please read the lyrics for that song). This song also features repeative and constant clean and screaming/growling vocals from Matt, along with some great verses and two outstanding melodic sung choruses (the first one is very addicting), as well as more amazing guitarwork including some addicting harmonized melodies, and a blistering and blazing solo section at 3:41 with some fast thrashing drums backing it up.<br /><br />Track five \\"Throes of Perdition\\" is another highight on here that features an awesomely heavy main riff along with some more nice soloing, and a nice radio-friendly chorus, and not to mention that the vibe of this song is very groovy and pulsing, and is guaranteed to get your pulse going like nuts. Another favorite song on here, track six \\"Insurrection\\" is another blistering thrashfest that is highlighted by lightning fast riffage, blazing double bass drumming from Travis, as well as fast, aggressive Hetfield-esque singing from Matt, and there's also an ultra-brutal death metal break during the middle part, and some more great soloing after that. \\"Of Prometheus and the Crucifix\\" is another killer melodic thrasher that features fast, hellish machine gun-like riffage, tight, punishing drumwork, more fiery, blistering solos, and another superb melodic sung chorus. Track ten \\"Like Callisto to a Star in Heaven\\" has more thrashy, pummeling riffs and hefty, stampeding drums, and excellent vocals from Matt, and another blazing solo to boot. The 11+ minute title track \\"Shogun\\" is the crown jewel of this album as well as the longest song that Trivium have written thus far, and it's a very creative and progressive song as well. The song starts off anthemy just like \\"Down from the Sky\\" did, only to quickly kick into a heavy and crunchy yet melodic and catchy headbaging mid tempo pace until the 4:00 mark, the song breaks into an acoustic passage, and then later at 4:40, Matt breaks into a ballad-style melodic singing voice that is reminiscent of James Hetfield, that is until later the song builds up heavier momentum, and near the 8 minute mark, the song thrusts into a barrage of violent thrasing riffage, thundering, pummeling drumwork, harsh screaming/growling vocals, and there's also some vicious, firing solos that are included in this part as well.<br /><br />There is certainly no doubt that \\"Shogun\\" is by far Trivium's most mature and best album to date. Everything on this album I mean, from the album's brilliant production, to the awesomely outstanding lyrics and songwriting, to the beyond amazing musicianship, this album has truly everything that will make the devoted metalhead happy. Definately an epic beast to say the least. Highly Recommended!!cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, when two American atomic bombs were dropped on them.

Everything on this album I mean, from the album's brilliant production, to the awesomely outstanding lyrics and songwriting, to the beyond amazing musicianship, this album has truly everything that will make the devoted metalhead happy. Definately an epic beast to say the least. Highly Recommended!!
B000A2W1X2|5.0|\\"Firelight\\" is one of my favorite films.  I call it a classic, although many have never heard of it.  I recently showed it to the acting class I teach and the room broke out in applause at the closing credits.  With my videocassette copy quickly becoming outdated, I decided to get a DVD.  William Nicholson directed this.  He has two Oscar nominations for his screenplays for \\"Shadowlands\\" & \\"The Gladiators.\\"  \\"Firelight\\" is certainly lyrical, moving slowly.  But it builds with such a certain steady climb with the rising action that by its climax, we hate to stop watching.  I think this is Sophie Marceau's shining moment, despite excellent appearances as Princess Isabelle in \\"Brave Heart\\" & as Polina Delacroix in \\"Alex & Emma.\\"  As Elisabeth, she is mesmerizing.  Her intensity is so subtle yet gloriously clear.  One moment where she looks at a bare Charles rising from a swim, she catches her breath just a little and then struggles for control.  Stephan Dillane plays Charles Godwin.  I recently saw him in [[ASIN:B001F0TM4Y Savage Grace]].  He also played Thomas Jefferson in \\"John Adams\\" and the husband to Nicole Kidman's Oscar-winning performance as Virigina Woolf in [[ASIN:B00005JKTI The Hours]].  As Charles, his performance also is a tightly controlled one that seeks to explode once behind closed doors.  Dominique Belcourt plays their daughter Louisa, sassy & unruly.  Lia Williams who was recently in [[ASIN:B000UAE7P4 The Christmas Miracle of Jonathan Toomey]] plays the sister-in-law Constance.  Hers is another subtle but riveting performance.  Kevin Anderson from Chicago's Steppenwolf Theatre & whose first film was as Tom Cruise's buddy in \\"Risky Business\\" plays John Taylor, an Ohio farmer striking up a deal.  Joss Ackland who was in \\"Shadowlands\\" plays Charles' father Lord Clare.  I pull this film out and watch it every year or so.  It never fails to grip me, even as I begin to know it frame by frame.  A classic!  Bravo!

B0007GAEGC|5.0|I can hardly breathe when I'm listening to Celtic Woman! Brings out the Irish/Scotch in me even when I'm unsure there is any.  These women have such clear, true voices.  I have 3 of their CDs now & don't regret buying them.  They're all very good.
B001O3TCH4|5.0|I saw Donna at Harrahs Tahoe in the early 80's. Her show was high energy and her vocals were over the top. This album brings that \\"Time and Place\\" back to life.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|My wife and I aren't totally nutty about our 2 yr old being exposed to violence on TV but we do avoid it 98% of the time. Part of the remaining 2% is Ratatoullie.    Ratatoullie is a good kid's movie aside from the two scenes of gun violence: one in the beginning where an old woman shoots up her house trying to kill two rats and another where a woman is seen pointing a gun at her lover during and argument just before the discharges off camera and they are shown to embrace. Aside from those scenes, I think that the movie is appropriate for virtually any age. Plus, it's one of the few kid's movies we have that I'm not sorry to be subjected to. :)
B00000JY1X|4.0|...with 69 songs there's going to be something to love, and something to hate, on this 3 CD set. None of these songs have energy enough to rise above the crowd and be distinct and memorable, but a lot of the music is infectious, silly, inventive and sometimes beautiful.
B0002C4JE4|5.0|I bought this CD because of \\"Carolina In My Mind\\" but was pleasantly surprised that I remember most of the other songs as well.  When going gets tough, it's fun to play music from another, perhaps more romantic, time.  James Taylor's voice, to me, is very soothing.
B001GKJ2FC|5.0|I love this movie, it's not your typical action movie, it's really extreme and improbable, but that's what I want in my movies and I loved this one, the Blu-Ray looks amazing, the resolution is so good you can actually see Angelina's wrinkles. Excelent sound and the extras are pretty good too. I can't really comment much about the extras because the most important thing for me is the movie itself, but the digital comics were really well done and they didn't take much time to view. Definetly worth it if you like all-out action movies.
B0002IQEHI|5.0|A case of mistaken identity sends a charming advertising executive on a cross country adventure filled with terror, murder and, believe it or not, love.  Yes, `North by Northwest' is Alfred Hitchcock at his finest.  Engrossing, deceptive and visually stunning; this is the type of `no holds bar' entertainment that keeps you glued to your seat throughout and begging for more upon the roll of the credits.<br /><br />The ever so dapper Cary Grant plays Roger Thornhill, a man mistaken to be a undercover agent by enemy spies.  When they fail to kill him he winds up getting himself in deep with the feds as his story about kidnapping and spies seems as preposterous as it is convoluted.  Roger has to then take maters into his own hands in order to save his own life.  This is when he meets the beautiful Eve Kendall, and as soon as sparks begin to fly his whole world gets flipped upside down.<br /><br />I don't want to give away too much, but the great thing about Hitchcock is being able to experience it the way he intended; knowing very little.  The more you know the less you can truly be surprised by everything that Hitchcock has in store for you; and believe me, he has a lot in store with this one.<br /><br />From the stunning sets to the brilliantly choreographed stunts, this is a complete package; a marvelously crafted action thriller that actually has substance.  It doesn't trim away the intelligence to deliver a half hearted spectacle but balances the two brilliantly, as do most of Hitchcock's films.  The film is clever as all get out, which makes watching Roger get himself in and then out of trouble so much fun.  The performances are also very good here.  Cary Grant is an actor I am not very familiar with, but general consensus of his work is that he is more charm than depth.  I found him a perfect balance of both here, able to fluctuate effortlessly between his emotions and his characters grasp of his situation.  James Mason is amazing as the sinister Phillip Vandamm and Eva Marie Saint is stellar as Roger's love interest Eve.  She has this sensuality that permeates her scenes and draws us into her mystery.<br /><br />LOVE IT!<br /><br />Anyways, I totally recommend this one.  Like I said, I fear for saying too much so I'm cutting this one short.  It is totally worth it though, for any film fan.  It is just a great film, no matter which way you look at it.  Even those who are not fans of Hitchcock (like my wife) can enjoy this film.  If you love movies, you'll love this.and Eva Marie Saint is stellar as Roger's love interest Eve.

B0001N9ZKW|5.0|You could label this folk rock (and most reviewers have), but this is really much more. Superb songwriting, great band, and a haunting sense of time and place all combine to make this a real classic.
B00004XPPB|2.0|Viewing this movie shortly after seeing \\"Goodfellas\\" and two years worth of \\"The Sopranos\\" may have been an error on my part.  \\"Donnie Brasco\\" just isn't as good.  I can't put it in simpler terms.  All of the Sopranos characters are three dimensional, and one develops a certain empathy for them, if not admiration of their values.  They laugh, live, drink, live.  The same for Goodfellas.  There is nothing even two dinensional in Brasco.  Not one of the characters ever breaks from the fake tough guy scowl.    The acting isn't the problem.  The movie has a fine cast.  The flaw is in the writing.  For example, the character played by Al Pacino is a petty, small time cog in the mob, from start to finish, with one notable moment.  Brasco doesn't really change much from an FBI agent, trying to pass as a criminal.    In short, I just wasn't convinced in the sense that I am convinced by Tony Soprano et al. or by the trio of comrades in arms in Goodfellas.  Perhaps I would have had a higher regard for the subject film if there were not much, much better films about the mob.  Forgettaboutit.
1400082773|5.0|I gained much insight into President Obama's grappling with issues of race and identity when he was a young man, reading this book.<br /><br />There's already so many reviews here though, I'll limit my next comments to the audio CD.<br /><br />PBO narrates the audio CD himself.  As you'd expect, he's in strong voice, well-cadenced and passionate.  The reading is captivating and well-paced.  I accidentally borrowed the abridged version from the library - an annoying mistake - but it felt like a complete story, so no regrets.<br /><br />The audio CD also includes a new prologue from the author, older, reflecting back on his past.  It concludes with his 2004 speech at the democratic convention, which is even more electrifying in the context of the what we learn about the author in Dreams from My Father.
B00000JGOJ|2.0|Just as many that enjoy this movie are appalled by the mindless action movies, most women and men will be put to sleep by this movie. Excellent cast and directing will not endear it to those that feel impromtu chatty movies are for women and men with with a lack of self assurance. Well that or psychiatrist interested in getting your hard earned money by having you visit regularly. I have the same issue with doctors that just want to check things out all the time. I appreciate those concerned enough to want to discuss things, but to me this is no more entertainment than the mindless action movies. And quite honestly they are easier to sit through. I couldn't watch all of this because as much as I like the stars in it, it was like going to a weekend talk session with a high school counselor. Now if I was depressed for some reason or unsure of myself, I could go for that. So unless you are, you may find this movie a bit overly dramatic yet not realistic. Good quality DVD with good replayability for people that enjoy talky movies. If you enjoyed this catch \\"200 Cigarrettes\\" or \\"Sidewalks of NY\\".<br /><br />CA Luster
B001DPHDCY|5.0|I last read this Dr. Seuss story in elementary school, and have forgotten all but the basic premise.  So I went into watching this movie with no expectations as to story or execution.  I was happily surprised.  The story moved briskly, the dialogue was great, the animation was flawless, and every scene was full of eye candy.  The soundtrack was upbeat orchestral music, and mirrored the mood of each scene.  Probably the best was the comedy; neither ridiculous nor slapstick, it is original, zany and unforced.  This is Jim Carrey's 2nd adaptation of a Dr. Seuss movie, and I can't say which is better.  This movie is also another outing of Carrey and Steve Carrell together, and either could have carried the movie.  The level of the movie is appropriate for an entire family, as there are no scary or risque scenes.  I highly recommend it.
0810970686|5.0|I bought the book for my 9 year old son. He loves it. He was reading the book and laughing most of the time. He has all the Wimpy kid books and he loves each one of them. In the future if there will be more new coming in we will buy them. There are very good.
B000002513|5.0|I must admit- When I first heard this album about 20 years ago, I thought it was a little bizarre.  Over time, I have realized that it it truly a masterpiece.  This album is so creative that it takes music to a whole new level....You can almost feel yourself standing on the street corner watching Bruce and the band on \\"The E Street Shuffle...you're on the boardwalk for the emotional \\"Sandy\\"...you're in a smoky bar for the jazzy \\"Kitty's Back\\"...\\"Wild Billy\\" is the worst offering here, but still unique in its own way.  Incident on 57th Street is a classic Springsteen story song and it blends right into \\"Rosalita...\\"  As the E Street Band leaves everything on the stage, here comes \\"New York City Serenade which is possibly the finest piece of music Springsteen has ever penned.  If you want Top 40 tunes, then try Born In The USA...If you're looking for raw Springsteen that launched his career- enjoy every second of this album.
B001ACH4DS|4.0|Really good album - David Cook proves he deserved to win.  The only thing I wish is that he had included some of the songs he sang on the show to win the title.
B000B8IA2G|5.0|I have always liked the Stargate programs, from the original movie to SG-1. But, while I liked SG-1, I lost interest after about the fifth season. When Stargate Atlantis first premiered, I did not watch it, as so often a good series is beaten to death in attempt by the film companies to milk them for all they're worth. So, I did not actively start viewing Stargate Atlantis until it was well into its fourth season. I was truly 'captured' by the series then, and could not wait to get the seasons I had missed. Thank heavens for dvds! Season 1 is awesome, and Atlantis has brought a freshness back to the story that it had lost.
0151008116|5.0|The author is one of the best story tellers that I have read. The reader is truly there on the raft and in the lifeboat with Pi. The story is so vivid that I had to keep reminding myself that it was not a real life survival story. The story has many deeper meanings and can be read many times I am sure with each new reading opening up new truths about life, spirituality and man's place in nature.
0743290119|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much. I would much rather read this than to sit in front of the tv or computer.

B0002STNQ2|2.0|I had been looking forward to reading \\"Prey.\\"  Crichton was such a master at the futuristic thriller that I was hoping for a good read.  Unfortunately, after 200 pages, I couldn't go any further.  The characters were not interesting and the premise was unbelievable--even for Crichton.  The storyline was completely predictable from the beginning and I completely lost interest.  Crichton has produced some fine novels such as Andromeda Strain, Timeline, The Great Train Robbery, and State of Fear.  \\"Prey\\" is not one of them.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|Glen has a terrific voice and his music is inspiring and uplifting. This was a fantastic movie.
B001J4E1D8|5.0|I first saw this movie on Masterpiece Classics and fell in love with it. It is one of the best adaptations I have seen and I think there couldn't have been better actors chosen for this movie. If you are a fan of Thomas Hardy's book then this movie it a must.
0312370849|2.0|I read this book in two days-devoured Sarah's storytelling and mired through Julia's voice. Julia's part of this story is laborious and boring. I was expecting so much more as this book was so highly recommend by a friend who said she was crying through most of it. I laughed at how cliche the themes were in Julia's voice. I knew the ending about 3/4 of the way through. If you are looking to learn more about the Vélodrome d'Hiver round-up (something I knew nothing about) this is a great beginners introduction. Sarah's story is wonderful and tragic, but couldn't make up for the cliche Julia side.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I'm sure this is a nice box set, but I think that I'm going to wait for the Alien box set that also includes the movie Prometheus in it. I gave this box set a rating only because I had to to be able to post this review.
1416511946|2.0|After the first few pages it all runs together.  Nikki shoots up, feels bad, sees people that aren't there, has strippers come over, repeat.  Page after page, after page, after page of Nikki whinning.  Much better books out there about bands that are not nearly as over-rated as Crue.
B000NIVJEU|5.0|This is a wonderful movie. I don't understand how anyone cannot give this movie a 5 Star rating. It was a fun movie to watch and a very beautiful movie, I've watched it over 20 times and I find it just as exciting every time I watch it. I recommed this movie to everyone who like a clean cut movie.
B00005JPLW|1.0|this was a awlful movie the story was bad and i would never tell any one too watch this movie the real story is better not the worst movie ive seen but its right up there please do not watch this movie if your looking for a good history movie watch gladiator or brave heart or rob roy

B001ED7C5I|4.0|I've waited quite awhile for Tracy to put out another collection... and I'm not disappointed. Mellow yet catchy as only she can do.
B000V7FZ7U|5.0|Though Mick has aged a bit, he doesn't miss a beat, his voice is just as melodious as it was in his prime. He has some of the best musicians and the music reflects this.  The band seems to be enjoying what they do.  I loved the female backup singer, she has presence.  The lighting was sometimes blinding, but the venue was just right to give a large crowd a cozy setting. It was enjoyable to see the 40 & 50 something crowd dance and sing-a-long.  A must have if you are a Simply Red fan and if you're not. Its just Simply good music.
B0006FO8RA|5.0|Bad parenting/decision-making and emotional/mental instability aside, Britney Spears is definitely a hit maker.  She, and everyone involved in the production of her projects, really know how to create a fun, pop-y product.  Britney's work is like the junk food of the music world, but I love junk food, mixed in w/ more \\"nutritious\\" fare in my musical selections.<br /><br />I love listening to her music in the car, particularly when I'm stuck in traffic (I live in L.A.), but even when the road is open and clear, the drive goes more quickly and is more enjoyable when I can sing along w/ the artist, and even do a little chair-dancing or head-nodding.  This kind of music is also excellent for when you're having a little trouble getting started on tasks like cleaning, and as working to a rhythm is often preferable for me, food prep/cooking is made more lively w/ Britney's music.<br /><br />GREATEST HITS:  MY PREROGATIVE is a fun compilation of the best tracks from her multiple albums, where you can listen straight through w/o skipping tracks.  There are a few new tracks added, as well, including an energetic and sexy cover of the Bobby Brown hit, \\"My Prerogative.\\"  Britney may not be the kind of artist who can sing well live, and isn't someone who seems to be dedicated to her craft as a musician, but her music is of the production-oriented variety, anyway, so none of that affects my love for this album...it's fun and light, and music so infectious that it gets you singing and dancing couldn't be all that bad, right?
B000005GYI|5.0|I believe this is of the most important albums of Brazilian music history. Although influences of jazz, pop rock and bossa nova are visible, its original character stands out. You will only understand its beauty when you listen to it. Wonderful songs, beautiful arrangements, and the unique Milton's voice at its best. An indispensable album for music lovers and an excellent start for those that are not familiar with Brazilian music.
B0001Z53MY|5.0|I all but wore out a vinyl copy of this when I was a kid.  A great pop classic without a minute of filler, in my book.  This is a little more dramatic of a remix than some others I've heard -- most of the guitars are in the surround sound speakers -- but I think it really works well.  The \\"Making Of\\" video is fun, too.
031606792X|2.0|This book is just plain stupid. It's as if a 13-year-old writing fanfic penned it. Somehow, in the final book, Meyer made me dislike every single character.    And what kind of name is Renesmee anyway? I think Brangelina sounds more credible. Sheesh.    I was hugely disappointed. Then again, I am a grown woman reading a teen series. But honestly? I expected more. I wouldn't have read the other three books if I didn't enjoy them. This was awful.
B001P5HI4A|4.0|<<Disc 1:   **Theatrical Cut (Widescreen Feature)   **Director's Extended Cut (Widescreen Feature) with added scenes from Barbra's Archives    ** MOVIE ** Option to play either the extended director's cut (which includes added deleted scenes) and the theatrical version.>>    Sorry, but I received my DVD yesterday, and I couldn't find such option to either play the extended director's cut or the theatrical version. There is only one version to play, and it runs 133 minutes and some seconds, so I suppose this can't be the extended cut.    There are some deleted scenes in lesser quality though, but these are not included in the film. You can only watch them as an extra. Or am I blind?    I'm a bit disappointed, as I already own the fairly good Region 2 DVD of this film, which in PAL (with a PAL speed-up of 4%) runs 128 minutes, and I only bought the US version because of the (to my understanding non-existent) extended cut...    ***EDIT: It was MY fault!!! Accessing the movie from one of the sub-menus does not give an option to play the extended director's cut, and that is from where I always started the film. Just pressing \\"Play\\" in the main menu DOES give that option, but I did not know and I did not try, as I was looking for the \\"switch\\" to choose. ;-)***

B000ZLFALI|5.0|How did I miss this movie when it was released in the theatres?  This is a beautifully filmed story (yes, it has a plot) set to the background of Beatles' songs sung by a phenomenally talented group of newcomers.  It's theme of peace couldn't be more appropriate for our times. It soars as high as your imagination.  You'll never think of G.I. Joe the same way again.
159562015X|5.0|My husband and I read the book and took the test.  It was probably one of the best defining moments we have truly ever had.  We've taken personality assessments and different things before but this really took information and spit out something accurate.  The information isn't really earth shattering because you have likely gravitated towards your strengths before. But reading about your strengths in a positive light and seeing how the combination is unique and what it offers in your life is very helpful!!  I have recommended this book to so many people and have bought it for about ten of the closest people in my life.  I haven't heard a negative yet!!  I should truly contact the publisher for a discount.  I'd love to have a box of them to give out... One of my strengths is encourager so it's no surprise that I want everyone to do well and succeed!!!!!

It is meant for about the 6-10th grade reading level. It is a series that you can pick up, put down, then have to pick back up!
B0019T9FL6|3.0|Hudson has a great voice and the CD, thankfully, is produced without her oversinging most of the songs -- which she prefers to do.  The duets are there just to attract anyone who might like the artists.   Does anyone like Fantasia's annoying voice?   The duets are awful.   The CD has variety with gospel music it could have and should have done without, and has a few good songs.   It could have been much better if the goal would have been great music instead of how do we get young people to buy it so that we can make the most money possible.   I think this CD will lose alot of 40 and older fans of Hudson.
0670888788|4.0|I discovered this book at the library three years ago but it<br />has since gone \\"missing\\" from collection, hence my purchase. I sought this book because it gives historical and literary context to an important classic, with period illustrations. It's lovely in every way. High price is why I didn't give it 5 stars, though (obviously) the expense was worth it to me.
B001F290E4|2.0|Unbelievably bad idea!   Seal has such a distinct voice and original songs.   Why would he do a CD with all known songs that don't need to be re-done?   I think he is too busy with the drama-life of his wife and too many kids  -- the wife clearly wants to have the attention - And I think the producer came up with an idea to try to make $$$ by making a fast CD that they probably finished in 2 days.   Waste of time, talent and looks very lazy.
B00005JN8Z|5.0|Well, why did it take so long? This film that MGM spent a fortune on has been sadly neglected by \\"the powers that be\\". But now it's FINALLY available in all of its Techincolor glory. The \\"extras\\" are nothing to speak of for such a super production that remained one of MGM's top grossers for years. The comentary is by a dullard who fails in every department (a schlock movie hack). This is the decades most LAVISH production, and this \\"authority\\" is way out of his element - shamefully ignorant of this production in every department. But don't let this fools ramblings deter you - This is a magnificent bundle of Technicolor lavishness.   It's now at long last, beautifilly restored. I'd like to have seen what was left on the cutting-rooom floor (a few cut scenes appear in the trailer that's included on this release). Rozsa's MAGNIFICENT score is no small part of this films attraction. The soundtrack masters were destroyed in a studio fire and the rerecordings and suites worked out by Rozsa himself don't have the primitive ferocitey of the original. They are versions of Rozsa's \\"concert\\" revisions and can't hold a candle to the soundtrack sessions, much was lost. The mostly British cast proves Taylor's wooden preformance to be \\"out of their league\\", he's pretty bad - Ustinov & Laffan are evil delights, Kerr, delicate & simpering (with the most beautiful hands I've ever seen). The great Finlay Currie, a Scotish Peter (who else rolls those R's like Currie - no one could say RRRome like Currie, who appeared in so many costume epics.  The sets & costumes have NEVER been equaled, lavish in the extreem (a joy to freeze-frame). This MGM extravaganza really started the 1950's epic series (to pull 'em  away from TV) - But every other effort, (LAND OF THE PHARAOHS (campy Collins, & get a load of who wrote the screenplay!), the absurd: SIGN OF THE PAGAN, and THE SILVER CHALICE (Mayo's eyebrows!) the terrifically tacky; THE PRODIGAL (that Turner walk!) was trashy & cheap compared to QUO VADIS. The ROBE was the exception, it was good and did have quality. Perhaps the pinnacle had been reached with QUO VADIS. Ben Hur is it's ONLY equal for pure spectacle.  In any case, this is a long awaited release, heavy on kitch, technicolor extravagance, and sets and costumes that are stunning. Ustinov walks away with the picture, with excellent British support.  The restored print is everything one could hope for - GLORIOUS!
140003180X|5.0|I loved this book.  I actually joined his fan club after reading it.  He's a delightful author, and writes about good people.  It's slow paced, and has a feeing thats vast and slow, yet not boring, but how I imagine how life in Botswana might be.  I want to go there now.  I just bought my fourth book of his.
0385338732|4.0|I read all of Sophie Kinsella's Shopaholic series and the UNDOMESTIC GODDESS and I would have to say that this book runs along the lines of these other books.  These are fast and fun reads.  The plot is easy to follow and is rather predictable, but if you're looking for a fun and light reading book with a happy ending, I highly recommend this book (along with Ms. Kinsella's other books).  I thoroughly enjoyed it!
B001MW0J2O|5.0|Animal Collective, Merriweather Post Pavilion is amazing and i can't stop listening to it and i'm afraid that i'm going to ware it out if i don't stop.  I'll go back to Strawberry Jam for a while. Just a little while.
067144901X|5.0|We absolutely loved this book since we got it.  It is getting close to retirement as the pages have lovingly been worn to the brink of falling apart.  Great visuals - fun and simple cartoons.  The words are fashioned to rhyme and have definite appeal to kids - newborn and up.  There is nothing I would change about this classic.

006113127X|3.0|Let's see.  When FACTOTUM begins protagonist Henry Chinaski is an uninspired, ambivalent, insipid, unmotivated, degenerate, vapid alcoholic.  When FACTOTUM ends protagonist Henry Chinaski is an uninspired, ambivalent, insipid, unmotivated, degenerate, vapid alcoholic.  In between author Charles Bukowski (who himself had quite the vagabond life) has Henry drifting aimlessly, listlessly, from one menial job to another, from one floozy to another; on and on until the jobs (how many times did he pack fluorescent bulbs?) and the drifting and the women bog down into a numbing grind of redundancy.<br /><br />Fiction becomes compelling and interesting when the protagonist is placed in a situation he doesn't want to be in, in a place he doesn't want to be in; that's when we have conflict, when the character adapts, either evolves or devolves, to resolve said conflict.  Yet in FACTOTUM, Henry is perfectly content being a bum; he knows he'll soon be fired each time he's hired, he knows he'll be moving on after the next one night stand.  There's no conflict at all, and, even more frustrating, there's no resolution as this novella winds to its ho-hum anticlimax.<br /><br />On the bright side, the writing is simple and concise, and Bukowski peppers Henry's musings with occasional rapier wit.  (\\"For each Joan of Arc there is a Hitler perched at the other end of the teeter-totter.\\")  The clever writing amps this review to three, instead of two, stars.  Which is much more than FACTOTUM's Henry Chinaski deserves.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, [[ASIN:142573152X The Reckoning]]
B001GZ6QBU|1.0|This is similar to doing a remake of Sleeping Beauty and having the plot revolve around the challenges of narcolepsy!  Come on - it's supposed to be a COMIC BOOK. Escapsim!  I turned the movie off half-way through, 'cause it was so lame. The Joker's profound and disturbing schizophrenia, the struggle between Batman as hero or vigilante - it might be a wonderful movie, but it's not \\"Batman\\"  I may be dating myself, but I'll stick with Jack Nicholson's \\"Joker\\" portrayal - over the top, comic book villain. I've got nothing against a serious portrayal of the emotional issues discussed in this movie, but it struck me as false advertising to suck me into a BATMAN movie and then pass this thing off on me. I think the legacy of this movie is that it will be a classroom presentation for abnormal psych classes in colleges. Possibly valuable, but certainly not the reason I wanted to see it.
006097625X|5.0|This book was required for a class I had. I wasn't exactly thrilled to read it but after the first chapter, i couldn't put it down. This is a really innovative way learn about comics as well as understanding them, like the title says. Very well done! It has a lot of strong points and has a lot of insight on to subjects we dont pay attention to. I recommend this for anyone who is interested or wants to learn about making/drawing comics. At the same time, it applies to more than just comics, but movies, video's ie: stop motion animation.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK
0743454529|5.0|This book is one of the sadest ones out there.  It is about humanity, and selflesness.  Usually selflesness is a good thing, but where do we draw the line? Is there a time when it is OK to be selfish, and give up selflessness? The book strongly and unbiasly relays the burden selfless decisions incurr on it's loyals.  The little girl with the ability to save her sister, is suffering from her constant giving; and to live a normal life, she must quit giving, and may result in her sister's death.<br />Then fate brings a twist to the story, and the book ends unexpectedly, leaving the above questions left un-answered.  The ending higlights how unfair and sneaky life is.  It's a good book to read if you are feeling sorry for yourself, and you think your life is miserable, and are looking for a story worse than yours, so you can feel better...  Therapy for those who need help to appreciate their blessings.

B00003CX9W|4.0|Overall, I am very satisfied with how quickly this arrived.    Thank you!
B001JNNDGA|5.0|I'm looking forward to this Blu-ray release.  Fantastic movie!  Very moving and true to the scriptures.      For the believer, this is a must see movie that provides a great depiction of the events of Good Friday.  While not pretty to watch, it will make the following scriptures even more poignant as you see the price that was ALREADY paid for healing, forgiveness and reconciliation by the Lamb of God:    Isaiah 50:6  I gave My back to those who struck Me, and My cheeks to those who plucked out the beard; I did not hide My face from shame and spitting.    Isaiah 53:4-6  But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; The chastisement for our peace was upon Him, And by His stripes we are healed.    1 Peter 2:21-24  For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow His steps: \\" Who committed no sin, nor was deceit found in His mouth\\"; who, when He was reviled, did not revile in return; when He suffered, He did not threaten, but committed Himself to Him who judges righteously; who Himself bore our sins in His own body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live for righteousness -- by whose stripes you were healed.    Zechariah 12:9-11  \\"And I will pour on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem the Spirit of grace and supplication; then they will look on Me whom they pierced. Yes, they will mourn for Him as one mourns for his only son, and grieve for Him as one grieves for a firstborn.    For the non-believer, it should be even more uncomfortable to watch.  There's clearly a message for them too.  It's the very same message provided to the Pharisees and Sadducees which rejected their Messiah.    Psalm 118:22  The stone which the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone.    Psalm 14:1 (repeated Psalm 53:1)  The fool says in his heart, \\"There is no God.\\" They are corrupt, their deeds are vile; there is no one who does good.    Isaiah 6:9-10 (TheMessage)  He said, \\"Go and tell this people: 'Listen hard, but you aren't going to get it; look hard, but you won't catch on.'  Make these people blockheads, with fingers in their ears and blindfolds on their eyes, so they won't see a thing, won't hear a word, so they won't have a clue about what's going on and, yes, so they won't turn around and be made whole.\\"    And the whole argument over whether or not Mel Gibson depicted the Jews as evil is just plain ignorant.  Jesus is a Jew.  His disciples and his mother and brothers were Jews.  It wasn't the Jews, or even the Romans, that nailed Christ to the Cross.  It was our sins.  And neither Jew nor Roman was able to force Him to go through the Passion.  He did so willingly!    1 Peter 2:24  \\"He himself bore our sins\\" in his body on the cross, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness;\\"    John 1:29  The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, \\"Behold! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!\\"    John 10:17-18  \\"Therefore My Father loves Me, because I lay down My life that I may take it again.  No one takes it from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This command I have received from My Father.\\"    The message that He preached to the religious leaders, priests, lawyers, fishermen, tax collectors, soldiers, and whores, Jews and Gentiles alike, 2,000 years ago is the very same Gospel (good news) for today.    Luke 4:15-21  He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue, as was his custom. He stood up to read, and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. Unrolling it, he found the place where it is written: \\"The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor.  He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the oppressed free, to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor.\\"  Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant and sat down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him.  He began by saying to them, \\"Today this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.\\"     Hebrews 13:8  Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.    2 Corinthians 6:2  For He says: \\"In an acceptable time I have heard you, and in the day of salvation I have helped you.\\"  Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.    And the question that Christ asked His disciples is the same one He asks of everyone.  It's up to each of us to respond with our own lips.    Mark 8:27-29,31  Now Jesus and His disciples went out to the towns of Caesarea Philippi; and on the road He asked His disciples, saying to them, \\"Who do men say that I am?\\" So they answered, \\"John the Baptist; but some say, Elijah; and others, one of the prophets.\\"  He said to them, \\"But who do you say that I am?\\"  Peter answered and said to Him, \\"You are the Christ.\\"  ...And He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.    Just as depicted in the \\"Passion of the Christ.\\"  So, what's your answer?    Romans 10:8-13  But what does it say? \\"The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart,\\" that is, the message concerning faith that we proclaim: If you declare with your mouth, \\"Jesus is Lord,\\" and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved. As Scripture says, \\"Anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame.\\"  For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile--the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him, for, \\"Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.\\"    Hopefully, you do so in this life rather than after.    Romans 14:9,11-12  For to this end Christ died and rose and lived again, that He might be Lord of both the dead and the living. ...For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.  For it is written: \\" As I live, says the LORD, every knee shall bow to Me, and every tongue shall confess to God.\\"  So then each of us shall give account of himself to God.    Philippians 2:6-11  Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness.  And being found in appearance as a human being, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death -- even death on a cross!  Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
B001O2N0P0|5.0|U2 is a band of change. That is what has kept them a force in the music industry for so long. They are not a one trick pony like many of the bands out there today.   That being said, though it is true that this cd is not \\"classic\\" U2 like The Unforgettable Fire or War (my two personal faves), it is clearly NOT a one star review (what is your problem Christopher?)  The song Vertigo has a great guitar groove and shouldn't be trashed because of a spoken intro in spanish that some people don't like.  The song City of Blinding Lights is the best U2 song of the past decade and that alone is worth the price of this download.
0810970686|5.0|This is the third book in the series \\"Diary of a Whimpy Kid\\" and it doesn't dissappoint.  My 7 year old devours these books.  We bought the first one last summer when visiting the U.S.  He read the entire book in one go, and as we can't get them in the UK, I've ordered the rest through Amazon.com.  Since we bought this one (about a month ago) he has re-read it 3 times.  If you are looking for something to get boys to read, this is perfect.  It's full of gags, silly comic strips, and is pitched just right.    Can't wait for the next one.
B0018AVNKC|4.0|Coraline, the new movie based on Neil Gaiman's YA novella, is a visually impressive film (especially in 3D) that captures a child's fantasy/horror world in frightening detail.  Coraline is a young girl that has just moved to a new town with her distracted parents.  As Coraline is exploring her new surroundings, she discovers a tiny door in one of the rooms of her house.  She goes through the door, and discovers \\"the other\\" world, where everything is brighter and better--the parents more attentive, her favorite foods everywhere.  Coraline soon discovers that something is off with the other world in general, and in particular with the \\"other mother\\" the woman who controls this alternate world.  Soon Coraline is in a rush to escape this world--but will she make it out alive?<br /><br />Coraline was directed by Henry Selick, the man behind the Nightmare Before Christmas.  Coraline was done completely with stop-motion animation, which makes the animated world Coraline inhabits look creepily real at times.  The detail in the film is stunning.  And there's something neat about a movie that has dolls and an alternate world where everything is made \\"by hand\\" as key plot points being actually made by hand by a team of animators that make and move little miniatures to make the film.  Seeing the film in 3D just enhances the effect--and makes it feel like you are actually in Coraline's world.<br /><br />I've seen other reviewers describe Coraline as horror movie for kids.  I think that's accurate.  The main premise of the movie--that you could end up in a world that looks better on the surface but actually turns out to be full of evil--is a pretty scary prospect for kids, in the same way that Grimm's Fairy Tales are.  I would definitely make sure a kid is not going to be totally freaked out before I let them see this movie.  But even if the kids aren't ready (or you don't have kids) adults should see this movie just to experience the visual effects.  This is one you just don't want to miss!
B000NVIXDW|5.0|I read the negative reviews and although I agree with some of the nitpicky points, the fact of the matter is, Buble can take any song, make it his own and you have to listen.  I think the only song I skip is Me and Mrs. Jones just because it is about adultery, not because he can't sing it.  The tone of the album is definitely darker, a downer and deep blue, but when you have a singer like Buble, exploration, variety and new paths are a must.  He can not be relegated to just a Frank Sinatra or Nate King Cole impersonator.    I love the variety, I love the different treatments, arrangements, the variety of songs, tempos and beats.  Keep it coming Michael!
B00006LIRI|1.0|Let me tell you somethin', this is one powerful band. Back when I was a youngster, I couldn't be bothered to think about much except for u2, David Lee Roth, and the Fat Boys. My school work sure did suffer as a result of these 3 Artistes Grande! I remember even blowing off the assignment of reading \\"Beowulf\\" so I could read my slightly used paperback about the rock godz, u2. They was all devout christians, except for the manager, and the bass player Michael Clayton. Him and the manager used to partake in their share of the vices, whilst the other 3 blokes (that's what they call \\"mates\\" in the British empire) were being devout and cranking out more hits than you could wave a flag at.     Unfortunatley, the period of 1990 to 2000 was not good neither for me or for this once proud band of blokes. I tell you the truth, I was encouraged because of the pictures of the buffaloes on the cover. Perhaps there was a catchy campfire song or somethin' to play during a spirited boar roast. Those of you familiar with my other reviews know that Boar Roastin' songs is my second favourite genre to Sea Shanties. But when this CD arrived at my flat (that's what apartments are called in the British Empire) it was not to be.     I'm not no expert of music, but I believe that the problem with the limitation of u2's music from 1990-200, is the marginalization of the bass playing of Michael Clayton. Half of these songs sound like they have a keyboard playing the bass instead of him. Could it be that the religious differences of this band had finally caused a \\"riff\\"? I don't know. But I feel bad for Michael Clayton because Paul Hewson is no saint either, you know. A few years back, I was at a u2 concert where he made everybody be quiet while he clapped his hands. He said \\"everytime I clap my hands, another child dies\\". I screamed from my not-very-good seats to \\"please stop clappin' his hands then!!!\\" If that's what gets you into the U.N these days, then I fear for all of us. Let's hope for better things during the years 2010-2020!
B000088E6D|5.0|This the album that not only introduced a new talent, but I believe it is destined to be a \\"classic\\".  Michael not only has a voice, but he has the talented ability to take a song and sing it in a way that makes a person like me just melt and feel like he is a man in love with ME.  That is the magic that separates people that have wonderful voices and musical talent, but when they sing songs, it sounds like a musical exercise or a showcase for their vocal range.  Not Michael, he sings songs like the early Barbra Streisand.  He takes familiar songs, pours his soul into it, the honey voice, the emotional depth and ooooo...baby, I'm yours.  Timeless!  Classic!  Unforgettable.
B001EO748M|5.0|So-o-o good!  There's so much written here I'll simply say this series is riveting, and if you get it on DVD you have the bonus of watching one episode flow into the other.  Natalie Dormer has perfect chemistry with the ruthless King Henry.  Too bad they can't receive Oscars, it's some of the best acting in years and Natalie Dormer challenges even the great Meryl Streep and Cate Blanchett. If you like historicals and aren't persnickety about details, this will keep you on the edge of your seat wanting more!
B00070Q7VO|5.0|This is the best of his first 3 CD's.  Every cut is outstanding.  Every song digs in and resonates deep in the mind, heart and soul.  When I was a teenager in high school, my guilty secret was that I prefered listening to Barbra Streisand to listening to the Beach Boys, Beatles, Rolling Stones, Motown and Aretha Franklin and all the other musical geniuses that were busting out and climbing the charts.  She had a way with love songs that made me want to sing them to all the boys I had a crush on.  Now I listen to Michael and I want to get dressed up with dancing shoes, \\"baubles, bangles and beads\\" and dance the night away with my honey buns in a romantic dance club.  Some of the reviewers can pick out a stand out song, I can't.  The whole CD is so good, so full of wonderful songs and Micheal's incredible interpretations that I cannot say anything but enjoy, enjoy and shake your bootie to Michael Buble :)
B000KC8O3S|5.0|An inclusive collection of musical support to the first and second series that is excellent.  This CD includes two versions of the Doctor Who Theme at the front and the back of the collection, and what is in between brings together the tenderness, danger, silliness and in places a kind of James Bond, 60s sound that makes you realize what a free spirit our Doctor is while glimpsing into his powerful and world-changing reality.  It is nice to put a face to some of these tracks:  The Doctor's Theme, Rose's Theme - musically channel their namesakes and bring us a little closer to them.  Cassandra's Waltz should be played in every elevator (lift) in every high-rise, yes?  Madame de Pompadour is dreamy, poignant and as precise as clockwork, and what is titled The Lone Dalek evokes a sense of deep longing, deep space, black holes and impossible planets.  A collection that is perfect, sensitive, beautiful, frightening and full of energy.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon!  You must have shipped my copy in the Tardis.  I ordered it on Sunday, selecting Free Supersaver Shipping.  I accidentally used an expired gift card, corrected my mistake Sunday evening and received the CD on Monday before lunch.
B001GAOY5U|4.0|I really thought it would be awesome to watch a movie in 3d AND HD...but unfortunately they havent come up with a way to provide a 3d experience at home without discoloration of the characters. Due to the glasses everything in the picture has a green tint. it kind of defeats the purpose of HD. all that aside, the movie is pretty good! I havent yet watched the 2d version, so i really cant review that aspect of the disc, but there are some neat 3d effects despite the green people.
B00005JMEW|5.0|One thing about Quentin Tatantino is, either you like him or you don't.<br />KILL BILL VOL.1 is a fantastic storyline to me, I don't quite enjoy KILL BILL VOL.2. A lot of killing, chopping, blood and XXXX words, this is definitely not for under age.<br />For me, I love this movie.<br />Pure entertainment, great acting, great martial arts action, great graphic, and great music.
B000002A3T|5.0|Pink Floyd's second post-Roger Waters and would be the band's last release \\"The Division Bell\\" is an excellent disc.  Like its first non-Waters release, A Momentary Lapse of Reason, it proves again that the Floyd could carry on and make great music without their former bass player and main songwriter.  The band's swan song disc is full of great Floyd music including \\"Take it Back\\" and \\"High Hopes\\".  If you missed this one back in 1995 go back and check this one out. It's a Floyd gem.
B000002ORU|4.0|This is one of the better box sets out there, and it's a pretty good summation of The Who's amazing journey of a career.  It starts out with some songs when members of The Who were The High Numbers, and it contains almost all of their major hits, and some awesome, hard to find gems.  It's not just hard to find songs we have here, but snippets of dialogue from concerts, commercial jingles, and comedy jingles as well.  The \\"Abbie Hoffman incident\\" dialogue is kind of cool, when Hoffman interrupted The Who's performance to complain about the show, and Townshend chased him off with his guitar and swore at him.  There are two great comic bits called \\"University Challenge\\" and \\"Poetry Cornered\\".  There is a great live version of My Wife recorded at Swansea in 1976, where the band seems rejuvinated and totally kills on the song.  The songs Join Together, Let's See Action, and Relay (which were all released as solo singles and never officially appeared on any albums) are included here, and they're awesome (especially Join Together, one of my favorite Who tracks).  They also wisely include only two tracks from the post-Moon era, You Better You Bet (from Face Dances, their best album post-Moon), and Eminence Front, the only great song off the It's Hard album.  The booklet that is included is excellent as well, giving an excellent overview of the history of The Who.<br /><br />However, with all box sets, there are questionable choices.  The version of A Quick One (While He's Away) is a mix of the studio and the live version (from The Rock and Roll Circus), and it doesn't segue well.  Another decision (which is kind of infuriating) is that they only included 4 songs from Quadrophenia, which is The Who's best.  And to top that off, the version of The Real Me isn't the original, but a version recorded while Kenney Jones was auditioning to be in the band.  It's not bad, but it's nowhere near the intensity of the original.  And the version of 5:15 is the shorter, single version.  They also included the single version of Who Are You (a mistake), and they shortened the song Guitar and Pen (which has great music but lousy lyrics).  The songs all segue as well, and sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn't.<br /><br />If you're a Who fan, buy this set.  The positives outweigh the negatives.also included the single version of Who Are You (a mistake), and they shortened the song Guitar and Pen (which has great music but lousy lyrics).

1400082773|5.0|Beautifully written, fascinating story, couldn't put it down.  Obama is a deeply spiritual person, introspective and  self-critical.
B000F9RB9Y|2.0|My wife loved this movie, eventhought the acting seen bad now compare to then. Like the 300 movie, not as much, this movie starting to stop working and freezing. IM not sure if it is my new sony 550 BD or just that I bought both movies on the Amazon website. I will have to buy another BD somewhere else to see.
B001HZ9ABM|4.0|I really haven't thought much about this album since I bought the LP many years ago.  Other than the beautiful \\"Odessa\\" the other tunes sort of dropped out of my sightlines.  But after purchasing and listening (again and again) I've come to appreciate what a wonderful piece of work it was. The demo of \\"Odessa\\" is spectacular, and songs like First of May, I Laugh in Your Face (love the line, The Elephant smiles...)and Never Say Never Again keep swirling around and percolating to the surface.     Critically speaking - the instrumentals are a bit overblown, but still beautiful, and the newly released songs aren't great.  However, all in all, well worth waiting for.  My first velvet CD!
0515127485|3.0|After devouring \\"Fatherland\\", one of the most enjoyable books I have read in the three or four years since, I became a Harris fan. So it was with great expectation that I bought \\"Archagel\\" coupled with \\"Enigma\\". Last year I purchased \\"Ghost\\".<br /><br />I give \\"Fatherland\\" 4½ stars, \\"Enigma\\" 3½, \\"Archagel\\" 2¾, \\"Ghost\\" 1¾. These figures may seem ridiculous, and anyway can't be posted due to Amazon's rating system, but they reflect how much I liked each book (for me, five stars is a rarely attainable maximum, the one that only the \\"hundred you'd take to the desert island where you're marooned\\" get.<br /><br />Amazons.com's and Publisher Weekly's ed revs adequately summarize Archangel's (strange that Harris, with his knowledge of history and his penchant for using the original language, i.e. \\"Panzerarmee\\" for Panzer Army, didn't choose to transliterate the name as \\"Arkhangelsk\\" instead of the old English usage) plot, so I'll skip it here.<br /><br />Why do I rate this novel as average? Mainly for two reasons:<br /><br />(1) After a really gripping and convincing beginning (the story of Rapava, which constitutes a little less than 15% of the novel), written so well that you almost think you're there, listening to Stalin speaking, the book's quality drops a step -although maintainig some suspense- until the Western historian Kelso (perhaps the connecting thread of the novel) and a photographer, after a series of Moscow episodes, decide to go to Archangel to find out whether a certain historically invaluable item -Stalin's personal notebook- really exists (this part takes about 65% of the book). The last 20%, in or near Archangel, falls a further step: the surprise (I don't know if it can be called a twist) is simply neither plausible enough nor consistent (in particular, one character's mood swings are described so tersely and unconvincingly you'd think Harris was under pressure to finish the book somehow).

6305252572|3.0|Whether this is the original buddy cop movie which launched a whole genre or not it's  certainly one of the best. Ganz (James Remar), an escaped convict, goes on a violent search for money that him and a couple of partners stole and hid three years ago. Only a few people know where the money is hidden and one of them is Luther (David Patrick Kelly). Ganz meets up with him and Luther tells him that he can't access the money for a couple of days so Ganz takes his girl as collateral. He plans on hiding out at a hotel but the cops trace a stolen credit card that Ganz used to pay for the room and show up at the hotel. A gunfight erupts and of the three cops on the scene the only man to survive is Jack Cates (Nick Nolte). Cates wants Ganz even more now that he is a cop killer and he starts his own investigation  hoping to anticipate Ganz's next move. He learns of the hidden cash and realizes  what Ganz is after. The only other person left alive who was in on the job is a fast talker named Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy). He's  in prison serving out his last couple of months on a three year sentence. Thinking that he can lead him to the money before Ganz gets it Cates springs Reggie from jail on a 48 hour pass. Cates is all business but Reggie wants to enjoy being a free man and get a little action. The two hate each other immediately and they spar both verbally and physically. They make a great team and are a lot of fun to watch. There is a lot of humor in watching Nolte as the raspy voiced and hung over cop trying to control a live wire like Murphy (making his film debut). Director Walter Hill would practically remake this movie in the 80's as Red Heat but this is the version that works. The film is raw and gritty with plenty of violence, nudity, and language. There are even a few nasty racial slurs between the two men. Remar is terrifying as Ganz and it is nice to see him and \\"Warriors\\" co star Patrick Kelly in a complete role reversal from their characters in that Hill classic. This is one of Hill's best films as it shows his considerable gifts at directing exciting action scenes and coming up with great one liners for our heroes to deliver between gunfights and explosions.

0439023483|1.0|I picked up this book because it received such acclaim in Publishers Weekly Magazine. \\"Booksellers' choice to win the Newbery!\\" etc. Well, I wasn't one of those readers who couldn't put it down. I couldn't wait to close the book and return it to the library! The time we live in right now is depressing enough with the economic situation at hand, and reading this book was sheer torture ... brutal, grim, violent, and hopeless. I had to skip to the end because I couldn't bear it anymore. I wanted to be done with the book already. What is it that everyone sees in this? The writing is adequate enough, but the story line - that a society would send kids into the arena to kill each other until one was left standing - is hardly the sort of plot I'd recommend for teens. The hype on this book was truly disappointing to me, and I wouldn't recommend it.
0312360266|1.0|I like other people on here thought the cover was nice and was a sucker for it.  But as the saying goes, don't judge a book by its cover.      Personally, I started out liking the book.  Yes I thought it was rather odd at first but it honestly was going alright and then the story just got too...weird.  I think that with the plotline this story could have been great.  But the book is just too out there.  The teenagers in this book aren't normal in any way (I don't mean how they are vampires either).  They don't talk like teenagers.  Especially Zoey.  The things she says would be stuff a 5 year would say.  I'm 16, the same age as her and never once have I heard someone my age talk like her.  This was the main reason I put the book down.  Shes not someone to relate to in any way at all and the plot just kinda goes down the hill after awhile.  I was really hoping to like the book but now I'm so glad I never bought it and I never plan to either.  I never did finish the book and I never plan to either.
B000F6IOC0|3.0|Having only just seen the original film I was keen to see this sequel, as based on the cast, and the little trailer I saw it stood a good chance of matching or bettering the earlier film which I rated at 3.5 stars. This gets the same score from me.<br /><br />The good:<br />As I say its a good cast - the addition of Derek Jacobi adds some depth to the movie. The special effects are very well done, with Marcus being a marvellous winged creation whose endearing habit of spearing people remains a highlight. The opening prequel sequence set hundreds of years before is well done and sets up the story well.<br /><br />The bad:<br />As with the first film this is a little lacking in sympathetic characters. Now fair enough they are all vampires or werewolfs but even so I think the makers could have made a bit more effort. Rather inconsistenly throughout the film Selene (Kate Beckinsale) remains the beautiful bewitching vampire. Even when provoked she never turns into a winged beast like the men do. Perhaps female vampires are different? Towards the end I began to get a little tired of Selene picking up yet another gun or machine gun and pointlessly shooting it into her opponents with little effect. At best its a distraction, so why continue to show it throughout the film....<br /><br />Having said all that, it is a rollercoaster ride, and if you like the subject matter (which I do) there is no doubt you will enjoy this a lot.<br />Its worth seeing the first movie first as this does continue directly on from that film.

076790592X|5.0|I am not a person who generally enjoys reading non-fiction, but this book changed my mind. I read this book on my mother's suggestion.  This is a story that changes a person's life; it makes them believe that there is still good in the world.          Few authors have the ability to tell more than one story in a book, while intertwining them flawlessly.  The most prominent story is of Morrie Schwartz's last class.  The second is of Morrie as a young professor at Brandeis University.  The final story is Mitch Albom's growth through college and beyond.            Mitch has an interesting and unique writing style. Much of the book is told with out dialog, told mainly in Mitch's mind.  Not many books could work with this style, but Tuesdays with Morrie is an exception because so much of the story is physiological.  A big part of the story is how Mitch reacts to Morrie's lessons and how they slowly change him into a better person, one more like youthful one of Mitch's college days.          Morrie is a person that is full of knowledge.  Most of the dialog is the book are one liners from Morrie.  His lines are about anything under the sun, from love to death, religion to marriage.          By reading this book, the reader comes to know Mitch and Morrie.  In so many stories, the characters are just people that can seem unreal and unattainable.  Mitch can be seen in so many people in the world today.  Morrie is like a great big teddy bear the makes you want to hug him and listen to everything he says.          I read this in about two hours on a plane with about 75 high school students around me (myself being one of them) on a band trip to London.  With the noise band students can make, it is a miracle that I could concentrate at all, but I could not put this book down.    Tuesdays with Morrie is an amazing book full of knowledge that is short and sweet. It is a great and easy read for anywhere, any time.

From all of these the people are in flight, and they come into 66 from the tributary side roads, from the wagon tracks and the rutted country roads.  66 is the mother road, the road of flight.\\"  -- John Steinbeck, The Grapes of Wrath<br /><br />  I live near Route 66, or what is left of it, in San Bernardino County, the largest county in the continental United States. The great highway which  used to connect Needles on the Colorado River with San Bernardino is mostly gone now, replaced by strip malls and freeways.  But a few reminders remain. The Tee-Pee Motel on Foothill Boulevard .... Little concrete tee-pee rooms with barred windows against the meth-heads and gangbangers.  There are still hamburger stands and greasy spoon diners, and signs memorializing Route 66's place in the history of the West. Etched into the mountains behind the old road is The Arrowhead: a geological anomaly which was revered by the Indians and now is the symbol of the region.<br />Once a year, San Bernardino... where 50% of the population is on public assistance of some kind, and which has the highest proportion of parolees in California... holds a \\"Route 66\\" festival to commemorate the muscle cars that made the region famous in the 50's and 60's. It is the only sign of life in a moribund community.<br /><br />  It's difficult now, 70 or 80 years later, to understand the desperation of the Okies in the face of the dustbowls and their obsession to reach California.  And there is irony in that California...the Land of Gold and dreams ... is now mired in unemployment and debt.  Its budget is $ 42 billion in the red, its once awesome aerospace industry virtually nonexistent, its highways impassable, and its once world-class educational system a disaster. The Okies have been replaced by illegal migrants who still work for less than legal minimum wage, lack health care, and face deportation or worse.  In a larger sense, the US is as close to depression as it has been at any time since the 1930's.<br />  John Steinbeck's epic depiction of the Joad's journey to California ranks among the best American fiction and social history.red, its once awesome aerospace industry virtually nonexistent, its highways impassable, and its once world-class educational system a disaster.

0767817664|5.0|This is simply a very entertaining horror flick with a good mixture of suspense, comedy and good special- effects. The kids - William Ragsdale, Amanda Bearse and Stephen Geoffreys - are all excellent but the two adults - Chris Sarandon and Roddy McDowell - steal the show.    Sarandon is very cool as the vampire; cocky, arrogant and smooth. He is easily the best character in the movie. McDowell does a nice job as the reluctant vampire slayer.    The special-effects are good and the film is played strictly for fun, even with the suspenseful scenes. In fact, it reminds me of the word \\"camp\\" because it's so hokey in spots. Yet the film definitely has its scary moments.     Note: I watched this 3-4 times on the tape so I am familiar with most of the film and after seeing the DVD, I swear several short scenes are missing (such as Bearse's quick shower scene).
B000002UAR|5.0|I envy people who have not heard Revolver before - that rush, that indescribable experience of listening for the first time - if there is anything I miss about the Beatles, it is that - it is not the first time anymore.      Revolver is a work of art; from the cover design (and please do me a favour - get the LP; the CDs have not been mastered and does not hold a chance against the stereophonic noise of the record - the way it was intended - raw, biting yet melodic & lush).     The first six tracks stand like African trees on a stormy night; or a summer day - providing shelter & comfort - in their own way of course - it will take decades for the first lime listeners to fully understand the structures of songs like Taxman & Love You To, much like Miles Davis & Brubeck's Take Five. Same goes for Eleanor Rigby, with its breathtaking grandeur & expanse, with words like burning coal, only eternal.      From the seventh track, Revolver takes off like a jet plane and does not stop.  My friend, you have to listen to believe what God's creatures can do, when they put their minds together.     The CD is a joke of sorts.  Flimsy, lightweight and a sound that just disappears .. does not make the air heavy - perhaps, one day my prayers will be answered & we will get remastered compact discs of the entire Beatles catalogue.  Like Stones & Dylan.     Is this the best album ever made? Is it better than Dylan's Highway 61, or Stones' Beggar's Banquet? Or better than perhaps Sgt Pepper? I do not know - you have to decide for yourself, come up with your own thoughts and put them in your own words -     Perhaps in a sermon that no one will hear.

B001P9KR8U|4.0|The camera pans the white monoliths baking in the glaring Indian sun as Jamal's street smart brother Salim waves his hand towards the burgeoning panorama of construction concrete and dust and in a manner of introduction (he has not seen his sibling for years) explains that the site of this savvy new business park in Mumbai's boomtown of finance and commerce once contained the unbelievable (from a Western stance) dichotomy of vibrant patchwork color and dingy garbage-fill filth that like a Bizarro-World sunburnt vision of Legoland constructs the mire mosaic slum in which the Brothers Malik were born.<br /><br />In director Danny Boyle's 2008 film \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" one gets the impression that as the apprehensive Jamal, the child-to-teenage protagonist, struggles to emerge as a viable force with which to be reckoned in his own right--he consistently overcomes one trial of urban treachery after another as all the mythic heroes from Hercules, Jason and Krishna do, literally rising from a sludge of excrement in a moment of quasi-lightness as he imperturbably pursues a coveted autograph from a Bollywood actor helicoptered into the capital amidst a scattershot of plastic and cardboard garbage fluttering as innocuously as autumn leaves--so does modern day India strive to reinvent itself, wishing to shed its reputation of over population and poverty with the apparent ease of a bulldozer flattening acres of slum dwellings to reveal a real-time optical illusion of power and prosperity shimmering with the promise of world-class commercial status after the dust settles.<br /><br />Whether or not Boyle had this analogy in mind, \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" fascinates with its vivid depiction of a transitional India in a twist on the typical rag-to-riches storyline where grossly-over-populated-slum boy makes good and, of course, gets the girl of his dreams. Jamal, a chai-wallah (tea maestro) for a large telecommunications firm inadvertently finds himself on India's version of \\"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\\" complete with smarmy jokes and a slick Bollywood version of Regis Philbin. Unlucky Slumdog, with just one question to go to win 20 million rupees, is arrested for cheating and spends most of the film's running time in the police station explaining through life-lesson rather than lifeline vignettes just how he knows the answers to questions that have stumped far more educated contestants. Through the devise of flashback, the audience cringes as Jamal and his older brother Salim played initially by younger child actors, watch their mother murdered by a marauding group of Muslim-hating crazies and as orphans fend in a horrific stomach-churning world of harsh endurance that seems more hellish than anything Dante could imagine. Somehow they survive some downright disturbing almost vomit-inducing entrapments escaping from personifications of evil that Dickens would have loved to make you hate. On average Boyle dishes up an extra huge serving of fraternal devotion with zings as tangy as an expertly concocted chutney as the brothers and Jamal's love interest, Latika, barrel through the underbelly of their country undergoing two other actor reincarnations before the final denouement revolving around the television game show studio hot seat.<br /><br />Bottom Line? \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" gruesomely depicts an India that few would want to visit. Set in Mumbai's Dharavi slum, the otherwise could-be predictability of the boy-meets-girl, boy-conquers-adversity formula escapist fare takes on the additional nuance of the travelogue, introducing the viewer beyond the Pillars of Hercules to an unfamiliar world where dragons lie and commerce wants to reign.

B0018AVNKC|4.0|Nobody can drench a book in creepy, dank atmosphere like Neil Gaiman, infused with humor and more than a little horror.<br /><br />Fortunately that flavour is kept alive in the movie adaptation of \\"Coraline,\\" brought to life by the talented Henry Selick. It's a haunting little dark fairy tale full of decayed apartments, dancing rats and eerie soulless doppelgangers, as well as a gutsy heroine who finds herself in this ominous \\"other\\" world.<br /><br />Newly moved into an aged apartment, Coraline (Dakota Fanning) is bored. Her parents are too busy to do anything with her, and her neighbors are either insane or boring. The one exception is Wybie, a boy who annoys her no end.<br /><br />It's the sort of relentlessly dull world that any little girl would want to escape from -- until Coraline does. She encounters a plastered-up door and a colourful wormhole, leading to a doppelganger of new home. In fact, it's so similar that she has a button-eyed \\"other mother\\" (Teri Hatcher) and matching \\"other father,\\" (John Hodgman) as well as great food, games, a shimmering magic garden, a chorus of circus rodents and magic toys.<br /><br />At first Coraline is fascinated by the other world, especially since her other parents are as attentive as her real ones aren't. Then she finds her real parents sealed inside a mirror. With the help of a sarcastic cat, Coraline ventures back into the other world. But with her parents and a trio of dead children held hostage, Coraline's only hope is to gamble with her own freedom -- and she'll be trapped forever if she fails.<br /><br />Neil Gaiman's book \\"Coraline\\" is a brilliant dark fairy-tale vibe -- decayed apartments, dead children, spiderwebs, beetles, disembodied hands, button eyes, and an insectile button-eyed woman who wants to claim Coraline for herself. It's a fairy tale world that turns into a nightmare realm where souls are lost and horrific things scuttle in the shadows.<br /><br />Most directors would turn the story into a cutsy, unscary affair... but not the director of \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" and \\"James and the Giant Peach.\\" Instead, Selick gives it a dark, cobwebby atmosphere, brilliant colours and surreal details (the button eclipsing the moon). And it's full of lovely details that could have been silly (the creepy-crawly claw hand) yet work brilliantly.<br /><br />The story starts off as merely surreal, but grows more ghastly and eerie as the movie unwinds -- and in the last third, the slow-moving story suddenly spins into a thoroughly spooky territory, and a truly terrifying climax where the Other Mother shows her true self. And along the way, there are plenty of wonderfully creepy moments -- the three ghosts in a rotting bedroom/mirror, the offering of buttons and thick black thread, weird circus acts, and much more. The horror is subtle, the delicious creepiness is not.<br /><br />Coraline -- the Alice in this Notsowonderland -- is a wonderful little heroine: strong, sensible, self-sufficient but still fairly freaked out about what is happening around her. Normally I'm not crazy about Dakota Fanning, but voice-only she's quite good in this role.<br /><br />The sarcastic cat is a wonderful counterpoint, and the movie's original character Wybie makes a nice companion (albeit an extraneous one). And the other mother is the stuff of nightmares -- she's utterly inhuman and merciless, and by the movie's climax she's become the stuff of nightmares.

B001GKJ2DO|5.0|This is an amazing movie.  I grew up with ABBA, and I'm a huge fan.  I've seen the play twice, so I knew what to expect, but this movie exceeded my expectations!!!  It is so tastefully done, and the actors are all wonderful.  Whether you've seen it or not, BUY IT!! You will watch it over and over.
B001GZ6QC4|2.0|Don't get me wrong, it's not a totally terrible movie, but this movie is pretty incoherent. Christian Bale is believable as batman, which is no small accomplishment. The highlight performance of the joker is okay, better than others, it is creepy in a clown sort of way, but slightly overrated.
B000F8O2OM|1.0|Stargate SG-1 is a great series (at least until Rick Anderson got bored in the later seasons) and would be a welcome addition to any science fiction aficionado's collection. Therefore, I eagerly ordered the first three seasons in the \\"Thinpak\\" edition from Amazon only to find that each of the seasons included episodes that pixelated and or were otherwise unwatchable (e.g., no sound for one of the characters or, in one case, a disk that would not even load). I reported the situation to Amazon and they promptly sent me replacements for all three seasons. Unfortunately, the same disks had the same problems in the replacement sets. I reported the situation to Amazon again, and received (in part) the following reply:    \\"As it seems that the problem with this item is more widespread than we originally thought, we are not able to send another replacement. We are returning the defective items to our suppliers. We will get new stock into our fulfillment centers with in few days. Hence I request you to place the order after few days for this item so that you may not face this inconvenience in future.\\"    Caveat emptor.
B001GKJ2E8|3.0|\\"Wanted\\" has some well-made action sequences and even some surprising plot twists. Angelina Jolie is actually okay in this. The main issue is just that the story is so incredibly hard to believe and is just there as an excuse to do some wild CGI effects, so it comes off as fake and gimmick, in the end the viewer feels let down and not satisfied.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I have really enjoyed this CD.  Having read the books and having seen the movie twice, I can visualize the music with the picture.  I just wish the words were included with this CD.  I listen to it every day.  Thank you for this opportunity to share my thoughts.  Janet
0060899190|5.0|I <333 Postsecret and think it has a great message.  I think this book is perfect for all adolescents and adults. 12+ though I'd say.    But I think it makes a fantastic gift. Especially for any sentinmental or hopelessly romantic people you know.  Also a great casual gift such as birthdays.  But also works as a thoughtful gift such as Christmas or Valentines day.     I say it is well worth the money. Hope this helps! =D
B00001W9G0|2.0|The film is annoying for its pretentiousness and loose ends. The most realistic sequence is when the mousy Katie takes advantage of Hubbell's drunken condition in a NYC nightclub to take him home to sate her lust. Throughout the picture the hapless Hubble seems unable to push her off. The romance consist mostly of her efforts to intrude herself into his life which she at once resents and covets. It never makes any sense why Hubble and his friends are able to party and have affairs in NYC at different during the war while in the Navy. The war was a very cushy experience for all. It was not your dad's war, the one in which people slogged through Europe and the Pacific and got killed or maimed.  Also, weird is the way the accidentally meet years later seemingly unconnected. What about the kid? Hubble didn't care? This very aggressive Jewish girl from NYC wasn't down his throat for increased support payments every time he made another buck?.Add the loose ends to red propaganda that saturates several scenes  and you might need an antacid.
B001IAOEXU|4.0|Pros<br /><br />-Fit snug, dont fall off during use.<br />-Made of same plastic as normal PS3 trigger.<br />-fingers will no longer slip<br />-improve comfort and feel overall<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />-A little too much money for some plastic<br />-Can fall off when putting the controller down<br /><br />I got these about a month ago, love them.<br /><br />Personally i never really found a problem with the normal PS3 triggers except on racing games. My fingers would slide and it would feel like a chore trying to keep my fingers on them for long periods of time.<br /><br />But this product fixed that and they fit perfectly on the controller, they also are made of the same plastic as the normal PS3 triggers so it feels natural.<br /><br />The down sides of it are that they fall off if you put the controller down hard or in a weird way. But i never had them fall off when i was using the controller.

B000VS6QTK|5.0|I've owned this concert in VHS and later on DVD. now i had to have it on Bluray. After doing a comparison switching the input on my 1080p hdtv between the bluray with hdmi connection and my DVD player with stereo RCA cable, the difference is amazing, and then you realize how better is bluray over DVD image qualitywise. The bluray concert is the same as the DVD, and it is fun to watch it over and over again. I had the chance to go to AC/DC concert last year, and i must say it was very similar to this 1991 concert in UK, so this bluray concert is a great way to experience AC/DC live at their best.
B000E0VKXW|5.0|I listened to this CD happily as a child, and now delight in the fact that my toddler reall enjoys it, too. It's fun and wonderful with for children without being obnoxiously annoying or sweet. Still a winner after all these years!
0743289692|4.0|I chose to read this book because I was honestly shocked to tears by some of the reviewer's comments.  I couldn't believe some people can write such blatantly prejudice things about Islam.  I stupidly believed that people can't possibly be harboring such aggressive and hateful feelings for me and my family, but given the harsh criticism of our religion these reviews reveal, I have to think twice about that.    This book is wonderfully well written, and truly compelling.  I admire Ayaan Hirsi Ali for not only having the strength to face the horrors in her life, but for further taking up the cause of all women in her plight and fighting for them fiercely.  She is absolutely a hero of our time to stand up against such oppressive practices.      In fact, her book moved me so deeply that I too am inspired to stand up for what I believe is right.  And I cannot just ignore the deeply prejudiced comments that I have read in these reviews (on both sides of the debate).      To say that Ayaan's experience represents a very small minority of the experience of Muslim women seems too obvious, but it might need to be said.  Islam is currently the 2nd largest religion in the world, with roughly a quarter of the world's population as Muslim.  Do people really think that 1/8th of the world's women are living under these conditions?  Absolutely not.  I am a Muslim woman - and I graduated from an Ivy League university, am leading a happy career, and am an equal with all the men in my life.  I just hope that people can see that the harsh brutalities that Ayaan faced are not the result of her being from a Muslim family.  I am so sorry that these types of things happen in the world, but to even think that they are sanctioned by Islam is absurd.    On the other side of the debate, people saying that Ayaan is a Muslim hater, etc is very wrong.  She had had an incredible life, and her story is one that should be written and told.  To criticize or try to intimidate people like her who are brave enough to speak out is shameful.  As a Muslim, I can certainly understand feeling the need to defend the religion, given the horrible light in which Islam has been cast in recent years.  But the sad reality is that these things did happen to Ayaan at the hands of a Muslim family.      But it is important to remember that this is her story...not the story of all Muslim women.
B0007PLLQ0|4.0|I loved this movie as a child, and I just recently bought it to watch it again and its still an awesome movie, all the specail effects and everything are just amazing special for the movie in that time. It was made in 1987.  ANd if you watch movies from then they are really cheesy and the special effect kind of suck, but all in all this movie is great I love it!
B000N3ST7A|4.0|Stevie still sounds great.  Nice Cd to hear her great hits. songs not quite as good as with Fleetwood Mac
B00005YW4H|1.0|Norah Jones sounds the same through all her albums. She sounds like she went to bed with a sore throat and woke up and started singing.  She seems to have that feeling you get when someone walks in and flips the light on when you were asleep.  She leaves her listeners the same way, bleary-eyed and half-asleep.    Her 'mature voice' and style I've read about, and heard is less engaging than, say, Ben Stein with a twenty year, pack-a-day cigarette habit reading me his grocery list.    In short, don't fall for the hype.  Re-title her albums as 'music for insomniacs'.
0307265730|4.0|I really enjoyed reading Unaccustomed Earth. It is a collection of short stories with a slightly longer story towards the end. I looked forward to coming home each day after work and having a read.

031606792X|5.0|I was an outsider to the storie since this was my 1st read of the series. It sort of felt like coming in late on a season of tv but I feel like I was catching up. I thought it was a good story, a little sappy but well written. I must admit, I couldn't wait to read it again each day it really  made me keep coming back to it.
0439023483|5.0|\\"The Hunger Games\\" is a must read. If you are looking for a YA novel that knows how to pull you in and doesn't ever let go read this book. I have not enjoyed a novel this much since \\"Harry Potter\\". \\"The Hunger Games\\" consists of likable characters, amazing imagery, and unrelenting suspense and action. I read this book in two days and I'm usually a slow reader, but I had to know how it ended. Since this is the first in a projected trilogy, I cannot wait for [[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire (The Second Book of the Hunger Games)]].

B001GQ2TGA|4.0|This album came just in time for Christmas and the start of winter.  I have all of Enya's albums and I don't consider this to be in the same genre as her other albums.  This one has a theme.  It represents the fullness of Enya's work and is highly polished, full of energy and with different styles.     \\"And Winter Came\\" is basically a reworking of Midnight Blue from an older B side album.  However she added vocals and more layering.  She created some extremely soothing sounds on this introduction song. I wish there were more instrumentals like this one.  \\"White is in the Winter Night\\" is a catchy song with a sound that reminds me of \\"Only If\\".  I was pleasantly suprised by \\"Trains and Winter Rains\\"- a darker urban sound which is totally un-Enya like, but it works and I found myself humming the tune.  \\"The Spirit of Christmas Past\\" is more of a journey song, which though sounds kind of sad is very beautiful.    \\"My! My! Time Flies!\\" is the most contemporary song she's ever done.   Enya finally introduced a short guitar solo and has a late 1960's sound.  Its creative, but think is too trendy for my taste.  \\"Oiche Chiuin\\" is a re-rendering of her celtic version of \\"Silent Night\\" which she did as a solo years back, but this is a full layered version.     Overall a good album, but does not come anywhere near to Watermark or Shepherd Moons my two favorite albums.  I long for the simplicity of Watermark. Compare the beauty of On Your Shore or Evening Falls and the abstraction of Storms in Africa.  I don't think she will ever go back to that.  Enya relies too much anymore on the same kind of rythyms and cutesy pizzicatto string sounds.    I think she has gone as far as she can with the way she does her music.  Even though her music is all about the layered vocals and textures, she's far better than what the familiar instrumentations on her keyboards can do.  I believe she literally could write music for an orchestra and as she says on her website, she should might write a ballet next. I hope she does.
B0001VV1GK|5.0|We were looking for a parking garage for our almost 3 year old son for Christmas this past year and read such great reviews about this one, that we made arrangements with Santa to get it!  It was less expensive than most of the others we were looking at, but I am also so glad Santa brough this one, because now I am loving finding matching pieces to go with the garage.  Our son got the road system Deluxe for his 3rd birthday and has had so much fun playing with it together (along with his Ikea train set that connects to it as well.)  Unfortunately, our 1 year old likes to climb the parking garage when it is on the ground, but it definitely shows how sturdy it is - when a 20+ pound baby can literally stand up on it.  The one down side, is that the cute little wooden cars that come with it are basically cast aside so the Cars (from the movie) cars can be driven on the road, etc.  In Conclusion, I think that most of the under 6 set would love this toy as well as all of the other Plan City toys!
1577314808|4.0|How to become aware of the useless, unproductive thoughts that the unaware mind can drag you through.
B001EN71DG|4.0|This is great set of STAR WARS.First - it has mastered versions with great quality and second-there are original versions of each movie.This is very important to me,becouse few yaers ago i have stoped trying to find original versions without new Lucas animations,and here they are.This original versions are not remastered so it comes with weaker resolution,but all 3 versions are great becouse they come directly from cinema to your home theater.They are all witj flickers and everything that movies had till late `90.They are like new Rodriges nad Tarantinos movies,like they are shooting them intendenly to be in that cinema spirit.So,this movies are not for your big DVD LCD or PLASMA TV , this movies are only great and fullfiling if you watch them with projector,with your real home theater.I am telling you,these original versions watched on projector,REALLY PUT ME BACK TO 1985 when i was little boy and watched for Return of the Jedi for the first time.Even the sound is more floating with movie than in remastered version,remastered version somehow doesnt have spirit that this original theatrical realises have.This box would only need 3rd dvd per movie for extras like shooting of the movie.You have narators (Lukas etc),but one more DVD would be complite collectors set,that`s why i give it 4 stars.I highly recomend it.

B001EOQWFI|5.0|My daughter really enjoyed this movie in the theaters. I was very excited to get it for her on Blu-ray. We bought this version b/c it comes with a digital copy to keep on the laptop for travel and we wanted to see all the extras. We haven't even scratched the surface on all the extras. This version is well worth the extra money! We have watched the movie itself countless times now and the picture quality and sound seem almost better than when we saw it at the theater! I highly recommend this movie for children and parents! Imagine your kids being entertained by a movie that basically has no real spoken parts for the first 15 minutes!
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I was not really into this series when it was on HBO.  I watched the full length movie and was instantly hooked.  I started looking around for the series and I was turned off by the idea of having to by each season separately.  I live in a studio and I honestly do no have room for all of the seasons.  I saw an advertisement inserted in the sex and the city movie for the complete series box set.  I had to get it!  This is one of the best movies purchases I have ever made!  I looked at Barnes and Nobel and Borders they had the movie for sale for almost $300!!!!  I love amazon! I bought it for $115 with overnight shipping! What a deal.  Everyone that loves this show or has just gotten into it, SHOULD BY THIS!

B001P9KR8U|5.0|While commenting upon social inequalities and religious tensions in India, the film careens along with the mad intensity of a Hollywood action feature.  Or should I say, Bollywood - for the plot takes its basic structure from countless Bollywood movies, with two brothers, one \\"good\\" and one \\"bad\\", a beautiful girl caught in the middle, and truly hideous villains - yet, reportedly, it has not been a hit in India itself, possibly through being implicitly critical of harsh realities.  The use of the game show to structure specific plot points is contrived, but works fantastically well.  The characters, again much like in an action film, are charismatic without suggesting too much inner complexity, and this suits the wild visual and auditory ride that constitutes the film's prime appeal.    For someone like me only distantly acquainted with Indian film and culture, this was a totally unexpected blast of melodrama and social commentary.  Definitely worth seeing.

B000VZUT64|5.0|I love every track of every album Robin has ever made. I am especially endeared to the albums where James Dewar left his unmistakable mark on vocals. Bridge of Sighs, I am proud to say, has never left my turntable, 8-track, cassette, walkman, or iPod since it was released. It is the most gutsy, raw, macho, masculine testosterone driven piece of music and collection of songs to ever be written and put on one album. It just melts. I listen to it over and over again. He is on tour and NOT to be missed. Why he is not in the R & R hall of fame is unconsciounable.

The ramps are the only parts that come off and we could glue them down if it becomes an issue with the little guy removing them.  Well-made.  I am glad I purchased this one.  The little car that comes with it is small, but rolls as well as or better than many of the Hotwheels cars we have.  We purchased a set of three autos from Plan City as well and though they seemed a bit pricey, they are a quality product.

Jamie Oliver brings creativity to his recipes. We've made several of his recipes so far and they've all be great. Especially the guiness and cheese pie.
0450040186|4.0|This is the best book I have read by Stephen King and it should be considered as a modern masterpiece. As I said in the title, it is not so much a \\"horror story\\" as it is a psychological drama. King takes his time to set the mood and introduce us to the world Jack lives in. At the same time, strange things start happening in the hotel. As these bizarre events begin to unfold, Jack's mental state deteriorates. It doesn't have a lot of chainsaws and screaming women, but King convincingly pulls you into this vortex of madness that is absolutely chilling.
B001LMU182|5.0|[PLEASE NOTE: THERE WERE TWO BLU-RAY RELEASES FOR \\"AKIRA\\", THE BANDAI BLU-RAY REVIEW OF 2009 and THE FUNIMATION \\"AKIRA: 25TH ANNIVERSARY\\" RELEASE OF 2013.  I AM GOING TO INCLUDE BOTH ON THIS REVIEW BECAUSE AMAZON DOESN'T ALLOW FOR SEPARATE REVIEWS]<br /><br />[THE BANDAI \\"AKIRA\\" BLU-RAY REVIEW]<br /><br />\\"AKIRA\\", the 1988 anime film that became the masterpiece of mangaka and director Katsuhiro Otomo.<br /><br />My first viewing of \\"AKIRA\\" was back in 1993.  I have to be truthful, it was one of those films that I had to watch several times because I felt I was missing something integral.  Each time I watched the film, there was always something new that I picked up and for anyone who has seen this animated film, just how much was put into the animation, the detail for an animated film.<br /><br />In 1988, Disney had \\"Oliver & Friends\\" and being touted as the first animation to utilize hand drawn art and computerized graphics and as the film incorporated some darkness that may scare the kiddies, in Japan, \\"AKIRA\\" was a film that would set records in the Summer and eventually get a limited release in theaters.<br /><br />The film would surprise and shock people because this was not a children's animation, this was geared for adults.  And did it look awesome at that time!<br /><br />Flash forward over 20-years later for the Blu-ray release!<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />For one, the film is now in 1080p and 16×9.  Having seen this film evolve with each release from the VHS to LaserDisc and then DVD and now Blu-ray, for a film created back in 1988, \\"AKIRA\\" just looked amazing.<br /><br />From the action scenes and just watching it on a large screen, I was amazed of how great it looked. Again, this is a 1988 release and I compared it to Disney's \\"Oliver & Company\\" which was remastered and recently released on DVD<br />.  But for an animation of that time, it looked like an animation of that time.  \\"AKIRA\\" looked fantastic!<br /><br />The colors were vibrant, I swear I was noticing background art from the film for the first time and that's considering that I watched this film probably two dozen times already.<br /><br />As for audio, this is where Bandai Entertainment has really gone out of their way to create a top-notch product.  Being audiophiles themselves, the full capacity of the Blu-ray disc was used for the audio.  \\"AKIRA\\" is the first film on Blu-ray that is released in 192 kHz/24-bit in Dolby TrueHD 5.1 sound.  The highest level of sound quality attainable right now on contemporary media.<br /><br />CD's are sampled in 44.1 kHz and reproduces at 20 kHz.  This Blu-ray is sampled in 192 kHz and reproduces at 96 kHz.  CD's are 16-bit, this Blu-ray Disc, the audio is 24-bit.  The original soundtrack of \\"AKIRA\\" was originally recorded as a master tape that contained frequencies up to 100 kHz and so, with Blu-ray technology, this soundtrack on the Blu-ray is how the composer intended for people to listen to it.<br /><br />With that being said, the audio of \\"AKIRA\\" is just phenomenal.  From the music and the taiko drums, the the various sound effects of the motorcycles to the crowds that are protesting.  The film just comes alive with this soundtrack on Blu-ray and really, was floored by the outstanding quality.<br /><br />I watched both Japanese and audio soundtracks.  A few things I need to let people know is when you see the menu being offered in Japanese or English, if you select Japanese, you get four choices of audio.  If you select English, you get only three selections (Japanese Dolby Digital 5.1ch track is not on the English selection but the Japanese menu selection) of audio but I'm sure that most fans will be listening to the Dolby TrueHD tracks.<br /><br />Also, another note is that this release features the Pioneer 2001 English audio dub and not the 1991 Streamline dub.  Having been subjugated to the Streamline English dub which was terrible in my opinion, this Pioneer dub is more to my liking.<br /><br />With that being said, with the Blu-ray disc focusing so much on audio quality and using the Blu-ray disc for that purpose, that would mean that special features that fans were accustomed to on the VHS or DVD release will not get on the Blu-ray disc, so don't toss your DVD's out just yet.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />The Blu-ray disc was utilized completely for audio, thus there is not much room to put anything else.  Included are the two teaser trailers, the TV commercial, two trailers, storyboards (Still images) and a 32-page color booklet.<br /><br />The 32-page color booklet features 16-pages that go into the science behind the creation of the audio for \\"AKIRA\\" and \\"Hypersonic\\" which is \\"a medium that allows for the expression of something that was never possible for conventional sound limited to 20 kHz\\".  Also, an \\"Interview with Katsuhiro Otomo\\", \\"The Effect Animation That Made AKIRA Shine\\" and more.<br /><br />So, missing are the \\"Production Report (The Making of Akira)\\", \\"Sound Clip (a documentary of the creation of the soundtrack), director's interview and the documentary on the Akira restoration that were included on the DVD.  So, don't throw away your black tin DVD special edition just yet.<br /><br />The Blu-ray case comes with a slipcase (front cover shown above and rear-side features the image below) and according to Bandai Entertainment, the slipcase and the 32-page booklet  are part of the first press only.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"AKIRA\\" will always be regarded as one of the top animated films of all time.  It set a precedence in animation quality in the late 80's and the 90's due to its detailed scenery, the vocal dub matching the lips (\\"AKIRA\\" was the first anime production featuring voice acting done before the animation was completed) and utilized over 160,000+ animated cels in order to achieve the fluid motion throughout the film.  Again, this was animation geared for adults and has become a classic, must-own animated film.<br /><br />I have to admit that having watched the film so many times, by the time the DVD came out, I think I was burned out on \\"AKIRA\\".  So, watching it nearly eight years later on Blu-ray and hearing the audio really bringing the film to life.<br /><br />It's hard to explain but having watched this film nearly two dozens times, this was the first time that I actually watched  and thoroughly enjoyed the film.  I was excited because of how much life the TrueHD audio brought into the animation.  Just sitting down and hearing the taiko drums, the motorcycles revving, the people talking and to hear the overall soundtrack, it made a big difference for me watching it now than any of those times watching it before.<br /><br />I was amazed by the vibrancy of the colors of the film, but I admit that I was waiting for the dust and the scratches and to my surprise, there were none.  They cleaned this film up pretty good.  So, aside from the much talked about audio, the video is no slouch either.<br /><br />Last, I know that the direction of the Blu-ray in terms of going for superior audio quality is exciting for the audiophile but for those who want the special features that were featured on the DVD or fans of the original Streamline dub have a valid argument for them wanting inclusion of those features.  Personally, I love releases that managed to include as many features as possible but in this case, having something unprecedented for a film and getting superior audio quality, it may not matter to casual viewers/listeners but I totally agree with the Japanese reviewers, this new audio makes a big difference when you view this film on Blu-ray.<br /><br />So, superior audio quality versus older special features that probably would be in regular 480p anyway, personally I would rather go with the superior audio quality.  Again, the production report has been offered on VHS and DVD already (and the DVD release of \\"AKIRA\\" was just too cool to own and by no means will I ever tossthat release out).<br /><br />What has made me even more excited is that the process invested in order to create this 192 kHZ process on \\"AKIRA\\" can hopefully now be used on other Blu-ray releases.  \\"Mobile Suite Gundam\\" movies on Blu-ray anyone?  How about those films in 192 kHZ,  24-bit ala Dolby TrueHD.  That would be awesome!<br /><br />So, \\"AKIRA\\" has opened up possibilities for Bandai Entertainment and overall, although not loaded with special features, the improved audio and video quality can't be ignored.  Again, \\"AKIRA\\" belonged on Blu-ray and it's a solid release.<br /><br />What can I say?  \\"AKIRA\\" on Blu-ray has definitely made me excited for this film all over again.  An incredible Blu-ray release that is simply a must-own!<br /><br />================================================================<br />[THE FUNIMATION 2013 \\"AKIRA: 25TH ANNIVERSARY\\" BLU-RAY REVIEW]:<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Akira: 25th Anniversary Edition\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1 aspect ratio).

How about those films in 192 kHZ,  24-bit ala Dolby TrueHD.  That would be awesome!<br /><br />So, \\"AKIRA\\" has opened up possibilities for Bandai Entertainment and overall, although not loaded with special features, the improved audio and video quality can't be ignored.  Again, \\"AKIRA\\" belonged on Blu-ray and it's a solid release.<br /><br />What can I say?  \\"AKIRA\\" on Blu-ray has definitely made me excited for this film all over again.

B000059T1V|5.0|Muddy Waters at the Newport Jazz Festival.  Seems like a match made in heaven! And, indeed, this is a fine live work, featuring some of Waters' greatest hits. One interesting feature is four extra tracks from studio recordings. Three of these are also sung at Newport, so some interesting comparisons can be made.<br /><br />The band: Muddy Waters (born McKinley Morganfield), vocals and guitar; James Cotton, harmonica; Otis Spann, piano and vocals on \\"Goodbye Newport Blues\\"; Pat Hare, guitar; Andrew Stephenson, bass; Francey Clay, drums; Langston Hughes, Emcee and lyrics for \\"Goodbye Newport Blues.\\"<br /><br />A few samples of the music. . . .<br /><br />The lead song is \\"I got my brand on you.\\" The blues sound from the band is, for want of a better word, exquisite. Classic blues. The opening lines:<br /><br />\\"I got my brand on you<br />There ain't nothin' you can do.\\"<br /><br />The sound is wonderful.<br /><br />Then, one of his all-time greats--\\"\\"I'm your hoochie coochie man.\\"  The opening lines--<br /><br />\\"The gypsy woman told my mother<br />Before I was born.<br />You got a boy child comin'<br />Gonna be a son of a gun.\\"<br /><br />Once more, great blues licks from guitar and band. Waters' voice is in fine form indeed.<br /><br />Another classic, \\"I've got my mojo working.\\" This starts with the rollicking piano work of Otis Spann. Cool lyrics at the outset:<br /><br />\\"I've got my mojo working<br />But it don't work on you.\\"<br /><br />Another terrific live version of one of his classics.<br /><br />\\"Goodbye Newport Blues.\\" Because of a riot, the 1960 Newport Jazz Festival shut down early and was suspended for awhile.  Langston Hughes, the poet, jotted some lyrics about the unfortunate close of the event.  Otis Spann sang those lyrics in this piece. A couple lines give a sense of the sentiments in the lyrics:<br /><br />\\"Oh what a gloomy day in Newport.<br />Everything is sad, sad, sad.\\"<br /><br />In the final analysis, this is a satisfying experience.  The live songs are played with energy and style. And comparing the live versions with three studio versions is itself an interesting sidebar here. Want to get a sense of Muddy Waters live? This isn't a bad place to check.ive songs are played with energy and style. And comparing the live versions with three studio versions is itself an interesting sidebar here.

B0002J4ZWS|5.0|Definetely one of the top three movies I have ever seen.  Though of course it depends on who is in the audience, there's no doubt that it will change lives.
0596522347|2.0|While there is some very good rules of thumb to follow, for the most part is very basic. I thought that the examples shown were going to be a bit more stylized and less off a traditional format.
B00005LC4Z|5.0|Definetely one of my top three movies.  There is absolutely no doubt in my mind, that what most people got out of it was an archetype that they could forever make fun of, but for me this isn't the case.  You've never had a friend like this, actually I think most people go their whole lives without ever really having a friend at all.  Forrest Gump is a true friend.  I've been blessed enough in my life to know someone like this.  People surely think that he's some dimwit worth nothing more than making fun of, but I've read something like 100 books on spirituality/religion/psychology/philosophy, and I can think of no other \\"archetype\\" that fits the mold of nirvana or real enlightenment than Forrest.  If it were \\"in\\" to be as humble as him this sick world would instantly be healed and have zero problems, but instead he is forever mocked and crucified.  Anyways, a classic film and my third favorite of alltime.  7 stars out of 5.
B001N44BVQ|5.0|Not only an current issue, it is a real excellent performance of DiCaprio, who performs in a mixture of \\"The Departed\\" and \\"Blood Diamond\\".

B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series is very very good. It is one of the few that stuck to its own mystique and style of earthy cowboyish mutts traipsing across space in a junket. Very thrilling, very different. It's too bad the series ended.
B001ECQ75A|5.0|They animated martial arts! They created new technology to animate martial arts. That was a super cool part of this movie. Even more than that was the message. Everyone has awesome talents and abilities if they look at themselves closely and accept who they are. Jack Black was perfect as the Panda and the animation reflected his animated personality. I laughed so hard tears came to my eyes during this movie, especially during the final fight scene. I've watched that over and over, laughed every time.
1416594884|3.0|Most of John LeCarre's novels have a nuanced and subtle quality that becomes enhanced by the dilemmas faced by his characters. In his latest novel, A Most Wanted Man, most nuance is absent, and the bluntness matches that of other modern spy thrillers, but not of what readers have come to expect from this master of the genre.  Given that this is a lesser LeCarre novel, it doesn't mean readers should take a pass. Like other artists considering how to write post-9/11, LeCarre dials up his anti-Americanism, and reveals the consequences of policies with which he adamantly disagrees. The man in the title is Issa, a Chechen Muslim, and the illegitimate son of a Russian Army colonel who attained wealth during the confusion following the breakup of the Soviet Union. Issa enters Germany illegally and ends up in Hamburg, where he is helped by a lawyer named Annabel Richter for an organization that aids displaced people. Issa believes that the private bankers at Brue Freres can help him, and a chunk of the novel involves exposition about Tommy Brue, the remaining banker and the secrets of his bank's past thanks to his father's decisions. Tommy and Anabel provide for some interesting dialogue and action. The closest character to some of the best created by LeCarre in the past is Gunther Bachmann, who leads a domestic spy unit. A Muslim cleric who does 95% good becomes involved in the action. Of course, the involvement is in the 5%. This is a fine novel for an airplane trip or a vacation: enough to keep the brain mildly engaged, but not much more.<br /><br />Rating: Three-star (Recommended)

1416562591|2.0|I paid no attention to Aravind Adiga's debut novel, The White Tiger, until it won the Man Booker prize, and then I decided to read it. Adiga is imaginative and clever in the way he has structured the novel, and in how he explores the levels of darkness in a society polarized by wealth. The narrator and protagonist is Balram Halwai, who rose from poverty in a villiage in India to become the driver for a wealthy man in Delhi, and then the owner of a fleet of cars serving Bangalore. His path to wealth was through murder and theft. The novel is structured as letters from Balram to the premier of China who is about to visit India, and wants to learn how to apply the entrepreunership of India for China. Adiga presents wealth in India as corrupt, and the wealthy as venal and abusive to those who work for them. While the darkness can be comic at times, the starkness of the contrast between wealth and poverty, and the triumph of evil makes The White Tiger a stark tale with characters who are more caricature than authentic.<br /><br />Rating: Two-star (Mildly Recommended)

0545128285|3.0|Unlike the pleasure of curling up for days on end with a hefty Harry Potter book, J. K. Rowling's new book,  The Tales of Beedle the Bard, contains five stories and can be read in a single sitting before a pot of tea would get cold. The stories are playful and a pleasure to read, but the real bonus is the commentary on each story written by Albus Dumbledore. I especially enjoyed the mildly veiled references to the Beatrix Potter stories. Net proceeds from the sale of this book are being given to a charity, the Children's High Level Group, co-founded by Rowling to help make life better for vulnerable young people.<br /><br />Rating: Three-star (Recommended)

B000YIGNKE|1.0|If you were mightily impressed by the understated brilliance of the acting in the 1995 version of this film, which included memorable performances by Amanda Root, Fiona Shaw, and Sophie Thompson, then you will throw up your hands at the many missteps made in the 2007 production.    The camera-work is choppy and unrefined. The director and DP have obviously never understood the artistic value of arranging a figure meaningfully in a landscape.     I won't dissect the production by how derivative it is, as I feel that this must be obvious to anyone who watches this version and remembers the 1995 version of Persuasion, 1998 version of Mansfield Park, and 1996 version of Sense and Sensibility (all worthy productions). All I can say is that the director establishes his vain wish that he could have Patricia Rozema's talent.    So, the real review: The script, the costuming, the (mis)casting / acting, there's nothing redeemable about this version of Persuasion.    The script is laughable. First, entire speeches are lifted from their developmentally situated positions in the book (for example, the debate on the constancy of men and women occurs after all the action has given the novel characters fodder for reflection; here, pulled from the end of the story to the muddy middle) and placed with no discretion or context in the mouths of characters who could not possibly be reflective enough to speak them (as in the above example, the very characters whom these speeches reproach in the novel end up uttering their own condemnation). Don't assume that this is a brilliant stroke of irony worthy of The Mistress of Irony (Jane Austen) but somehow overlooked until reworked by the hack who cobbled together the shambles of this script. You'd be making a big mistake. Those characters who do keep their own important speeches are forced to deliver their lines without motivation or context. For example, during one pivotal scene, Miss Elliot excuses herself for not being good company, whichelicits an unwarranted and confusing speech by her cousin about how her accomplishments are not recognized by the world. Huh? How did we get from . . . to . . . ? The script is full of these talking-passed-each-other moments that make you want to throw rotten vegetables at the TV.    The acting is atrocious. Though, it hardly surprises one, considering the nonsensical script with which the actors had to work. Despite these difficulties, the lead actress portrays her character with a painful-to-watch clumsiness, gracelessness, and--excuse me for saying it--ickiness. This Anne Elliot just . . . makes you want to gag, she's THAT gross. It's difficult to see how her manner could possibly recommend her to three separate men and anyone with a discerning mind, especially as her script rarely gives her the opportunity to say anything that would (a) impress anyone or (b) even set her apart from the other female characters. The dumpy actress who plays Anne Elliot cannot even be allowed costumes that fit her to assist her transformation. They are all too short, unbecoming in color, and make her seem more like a countrywoman (Emma's Mrs. Martin, perhaps) than a baronet's plain daughter.     Likewise, Mary Musgrove is unusually grotesque in this production. The script writer and director must have believed hypochondria to be an insufficient caricature enabler. The actress plays Mary as if Mary Musgrove were Erma Prunesquallor (Fiona Shaw's excellently portrayed character in Gormenghast). In my more charitable moments, I grant this actress must be astounding in her portrayal of family resemblance. Mary Musgrove is even more disgusting than her icky sister.    Perhaps most lamentable, the people in charge of this production have simply written Persuasion off as an opportunity for women to marinate in the neglect, self-pity, self-effacement, and melodramatic frenzy of an Anne Elliot who has none of the refinements of taste, mind, or manner of the original.     Did I even read the same book that these people read?
0446615625|4.0|Enjoyed the book.  I enjoy books that make me want to continue reading even when I have something else to do.  This book was fun, not especially difficult to follow and very simple words.  The history lesson that each of Baldacci's books gives you is an extra.  It was fun to read.
B000BQ7BX2|5.0|I've been always curious, but reluctant to buy this set, partly due to the misleading criticism by the Japanese critic Kyo Mitsutoshi, a part of which I read before.  In his overly poetic commentary, he describes Bertini as a classicist who values beauty above all and whose interpretation is somewhat reserved, as opposed to the conductors like Bernstein, Solti and Tennstedt who placed much emphasis on contrasting emotional expression.    Having exhausted almost all great Mahler recordings, I finally decided to get this set just to quench my curiosity.  I can not disagree more after listening to it. There is nothing reserved or classical about Bertini's readings.  Take for example the outrageously bold and impassioned reading of Adagietto from 5th, which out do Tennnstedt's famous Royal Festival Hall live account or the overwhelmingly powerful treatment of the first movement of 3rd , which out do Bernstein.  In fact, fascination of Bertini lies in that he can not be classified in any category.  The conductor apparently possesses enormous reverence for Mahler's music and that comes across in every performance. You can not fully appreciate real richness and intricacy of Mahler's orchestration until you listen to these recordings. Bertini's Mahler cycle is an amazing journey of discoveries.      Symphony No.1 (Live in Tokyo, 1991)  A beautifully crafted performance which is near perfect and filled with many breath taking moments of beauty and inspiration. My favourite recording, alongside Kubelik's DG recording and Giulini's deeply felt account.    Symphony No.2 (1991, Köln)  Like Stokowski's monstrous Prom live recording, this towering performance can stand alone for its unparalleled power of expression and other worldly beauty. The way brass and percussion explode in the first movement is absolutely terrifying. Unlike Stokowski, Bertini achieves maximum impact of each outburst in all movements without much exaggeration, but by masterful control of tempi and ebb and flow of the music.  Both soprano and mezzo give intensely passionate yet noble performance of their part. The build-up to the climax is full of revelatory moments and nothing short of awe inspiring. The final apotheosis is overwhelmingly powerful with organ, chorus, and percussions playing prominent roles. First movement is on disc 1, separated from the rest.     Symphony No.3 (1985, Köln)  This is definitely the outstanding performance, not only in this set, but also among the likes of Abbado, Horenstein, Bernstein, Levine, Haitink and Kubelik.  First movement is extremely powerful and bold with almost apocalyptic edge and with pauses employed most effectively to create great sense of suspense.  String sound literally flowers in the second movement; exquisite playing by wind instruments and brass played with amazing boisterousness in the third movement.  Misterioso is played very slowly (10'50) with profound singing by contralto (annoyingly it is separated from the last two movements). Last movement is simply awe inspiring. The drum in the closing section has strong emphatic edge which adds to the grandeur of the finale. I've never come across performance of such depth and sublime beauty.    Symphony No.4 (1987, Köln)  Another revelatory performance, filled with moments of discovery and details you've never heard before. The conductor draws gorgeous string sound from the orchestra. The slow movement is deeply elegiac and masterfully controlled.  The last movement is wonderfully vivid and boisterous with Lucia Popp's ethereal singing finely balanced with the orchestra. Placing the last movement on other disc is unforgivable stupidity!    Symphony No.5 (1990, Köln)  This performance proves that it is nonsense to say Bertini's interpretation is reserved - in fact this is one of the most violent and intensely felt account of 5th I've ever known. Adagietto is outrageously boldly phrased and played with overwhelming passion. It is hard to imagine more powerful and moving account.  The last movement is simply sublime. Thankfully fit into one disc.    Symphony No.6 (1984, Köln)  This is not the best performance in the cycle, however there are many revelatory moments and admirable effects. The first movement is played superbly in masterfully judged tempo, neither too fast nor too slow, with plenty of driving force and powerful impact. Second movement is played in strangely slow tempo with lots of contrast and weight. The slow movement is beautifully played, but somehow fails to capture the inner drive and grandeur the great music deserves.  Percussions create most atmospheric Alpine scenes, the effect unlike any other conductors could realise before. Overall impact of the last movement is rather weak as the music suffers from too much slowing down in wrong places. The last movement on different disc.    Symphony No.7 (1990, Köln)  Under Bertini's baton the most elusive and grotesque of Mahler symphonies is transformed into a rich tapestry of orchestral colours and instrumental characterisation, and the music becomes more approachable. He draws magical sound from woodwinds, strings and mandolin. Fit in one disc.    Symphony No.8 (Live in Tokyo, 1991)  Another outstanding and splendid recording.  Part 1 is amazingly sumptuous with choir and soloists taking the centre stage, although it suffers from overly melodramatic singing by soloists, placed too close to microphone and even intrusive at times.  Part 2 is expansively paced throughout, and there are many awe inspiring moments, especially in the build up to the finale.  Very slowly paced final apotheosis is not the most overwhelming on record, but massive and glorious to conclude the epic journey. Fit into one disc.    Symphony No.9 (Live in Tokyo, 1991)  Another outstanding performance - words just fail to describe the sheer sumptuousness of the music making and magical beauty of sounds, not to mention the very profound and incandescent account of the last movement. Percussions seldom fail to create maximum impact throughout. 3rd and 4th movement on different disc.    Symphony No.10  (1991, Köln)  Another beautifully crafted performance with exquisite detail. It's a great shame, Bertini did not record Cooke's completed version!    Das Lied von der Erde (Live in Tokyo, 1991)   In this work, you can really appreciate Bertini's amazing ability to let music blossom freely in ever exquisite colours and nuances. Tenor, Ben Heppner, sings brilliantly with very pleasant, youthful sort of voice. Mezzo, Marjana Lipovsek, has just right sort of warm and deep voice, and her singing never intrudes on the music, while expressing its poetry with real feeling and understanding. Der Abschied is deeply moving. On one disc.      The amazing account of 2nd, 3rd, 9th alone makes this set a must-buy, but together with very impressive 1st, 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th and Das Lied, the price is just  ridiculous! Only downside is the odd way some of the symphonies are spread on two discs - I would rather pay £30 for more numbers of discs to fit all movements of each symphony either on one disc or distributed in musically reasonable order. The sound quality in every recording is incredibly realistic and broad. With decent speakers it's almost like sitting in a concert hall. You need a soundproof room to realise full capacity of the recordings.
B001DDBCV4|3.0|Love the TV show (well my wife does) and she said it just felt like filler in what should/could have been a better first movie for the series.  The Blu Ray disc quality it good though and the set offers some good special features...deleted scenes, extended movie cut interviews, etc.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|The third season of VM is as good as the first two (although you will notice a few changes in structure). The characters are as solid as ever, the stories are as intriguing as ever, the twists are as interesting as ever... and just when it's getting even better, the season ends and the show gets cancelled. I will never forgive the CW Network for that one!
B00006JL1Z|4.0|I'm glad to own this 2 disc album of fleetwood mac. They have various voices in any given songs. For instance, we have Stevie Nicks singing seven wonders and gypsy, Christine McVie singing songbird, and so on.     One of the big reasons why I got into Fleetwood Mac was the fact that over the years, I slowly became aware of the various voices and tones of the songs.     Although I'm pleased that many favorable songs are in this collection like don't stop, go your own way, little lies, skies the limit, and hold me. However, other songs like say you will, and peacekeeper are not included in this collection. But that's just me.     All in all, this collection is a timepiece and a must have for any Fleetwood Mac fan.
B000002MU3|3.0|Let's be honest here, 'Monster' isn't REM's best album. And it doesn't sound that much like anything they did before (or since), so it's probably not the best place to start for new or casual fans. But it's fair to say it is one of their most intriguing albums, simply because it's so different. 'Monster' incorporates influences from glam rock, hard rock, and 90's alternative rock, none of which you would normally associate with the classic REM sound. And the lyrics are more tongue-in-cheek than before, as Stipe satirises celebrity and rock culture. In all, it's a clear and deliberate change from the band's earlier work, particularly from the subdued, weighty 'Automatic For The People'.     It's a risky move, but about half the album really clicks, and the band demonstrate that they can rock pretty hard while still sounding distinctively like REM. Fans of Peter Buck, especially, will love this. After a decade of bright chords and shining arpeggios, he really gets to flex some rock muscle on 'Monster', turning in a bunch of meaty rock riffs and distorted power chords. The production really emphasises this by bringing Buck's guitar right to the front of the mix on nearly every song, giving the album's best songs a real kick and drive.    Opener 'What's the Frequency Kenneth', plus 'Strange Currencies' (which recalls 'Everybody Hurts') and the piano-driven 'Tongue' are the closest to the old-school REM sound, and are three of the best songs here. 'Bang And Blame' is a pretty good rock song and obvious single, and I also really like the upbeat groove of 'Star 69' and the Eastern-tinged closer `You'.     Some of the other tracks don't work so well, though, either because they emphasise style over substance, or they have interesting ideas that aren't executed as well as they could be. The guitar-heavy production (which renders Stipe's lyrics barely discernable at times) can sometimes mean that the tracks all blend together, with the less-interesting songs fading into the wash of distortion without really distinguishing themselves. Even allowing that \\"experimental\\" albums always have a few awkward mis-steps, 'Monster' just isn't as consistently strong as REM's other albums.    There's no doubting that 'Monster' is brave and bold, and contains a variety of new and refreshing ideas that work really well about half the time. And it's worth picking this up for those moments alone. But the album lacks the consistent brilliance of REM's best work, and what could have been the band's greatest album is merely a very \\"interesting\\" one.
B000HIVOI2|1.0|I've been a big fan of this movie since it came out. However, the Blu-ray version is a joke. A lot of portions of the Blu-ray are so grainy it looks like I'm watching a VHS tape. I can see why the Blu-ray disk is for $9.99
B000002LFU|5.0|REM's major label debut, Green was probably always going to be burdened with the 'sellout' tag. It's unfair, partly because REM had been moving toward the mainstream for several albumns, and partly because Green was their most diverse and interesting album to date. How ironic.....a 'sellout' that tries more things, takes more risks, and makes more detours than anything they've previously done. Sure doesn't sound like much of a sellout to me!    It's true there are a few more radio-friendly tracks, but it was on Green that REM really began expanding and diversifying their sound. They add in keyboards, mandolin, strings. They push further into pop, hard rock, political anthems, and introspective folk ballads. In many ways, Green is the best of both worlds- retaining enough quirky touches of the old REM while pushing the band into new sonic territory.    And it all works. The band sound equally comfortable on the reflective \\"The Wrong Child\\", the political \\"World Leader Pretend\\", and the bubblegum \\"Pop Song 89\\". Two very different songs; the slightly goofy \\"Stand\\" and the firey \\"Orange Crush\\" became hits, proving how flexible the REM sound had become. The mandolin-driven \\"You are the Everything\\" anticipates the sunny pop of Out of Time, and the driving \\"Turn You Inside Out\\" seems look ahead six years to Monster.      So don't buy in to any negative hype- Green is one of REM's best and most interesting albums, and further proof they could attract mainstream attention without compromising their integrity. Five stars.

B000002UW1|4.0|Although Green was REM's first album for WB, in many ways it's Document that sounds like a major-label debut. From the opening riffs of \\"Finest Worksong\\" it's clear this is much more direct- lyrically and musically- than anything they've done before. But this is no sell-out: Document is an angry, firey, political album. Michael Stipe had dabbled in social commentary before, but always in his usual enigmatic style. Here, titles like \\"Welcome to the Occupation\\" and \\"Exhuming McCarthy\\" leave us in no doubt where he's coming from. Even tracks that aren't explicitly political, like \\"One I Love\\" are fueled by passionate anger.     Musically, the album is closer to mainstream rock than the quirky jangle pop of previous albums. Peter Buck in particular nails memorable riffs for many songs...he even has a solo or two!! There is some diversity in the second half; I've always thought \\"Lightnin' Hopkins\\" and \\"King of Birds\\" would fit nicely on Fables of the Reconstruction.     The sheer directness of the album might come as a shock for fans who appreciate the arty side of REM's persona. And this is the one reason it doesn't quite get five stars from me. But it's a very solid album, proving REM could fit well in the mainstream, and paving the way for the pop success of Green and Out of Time.
0783225547|5.0|I don't need to write what it is about because the first review is perfect. It is a good movie & much better then the other volcano movie and I have seen both of them & I lived by the tar pits when I was a child. both are good but this one is the better of the two.
B0019X3ZZY|2.0|Once you get over the highly sadistic components of this film, I question its real artisitc value.  For example, I did not think it made good use of the sets and props.  The dialogue in English seem very stilted (that may be a result of the translation) and at times the audio (in the original Iralian) was missing altogether (problem with my copy?).  Bottom line, it achieves the purpose of exposing humanity at its worst but does not draw you in as I expected from Italian films I have seen before.
B000WC3A0S|1.0|how dare amazon ask me to review a product i never received - focus on credited my account back and dealing with idiots who sell products through you; the order which should have arrived 10 -14 days after ordering (which is unbelievable to begin with) never arrived.... re ordered it from Walmart and had it in 2 days...... my suggestion dont order through Amazon this is about the 4th time i had a bad experience with Amazon and the last; considering I only ordered through Amazon about 6 times - do the math order--from known stores much better experience...
B000003C4K|5.0|This is an awesome thrash album. Exodus should have Anthrax's place in the Big Four of Thrash. Songs sound a bit similar but they are all fast and have killer riffs so its ok.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|What a Beautiful Movie.. I rented it first...and despite being long...is very much worth it. I love it, and it is so sad.
B000LYFHOO|5.0|Lou Reed toned it down for the third Velvets album. In order to do that, he had to jettison John Cale, as Cale wanted to  delve further into the avant-garde leanings they had explored on the first two releases. Cale didn't want to record love songs or repeat subjects already handled by other rock and roll artists...he felt that was beneath what the VU was all about. And although it may have somewhat deprived we listeners of more journeys into the bizarre and dark, as on The Velvet Underground And Nico and White Light/White Heat, the quality did not drop on this album, in spite of Cale's departure. They aren't straight love songs, or repetitions of common subjects either, per se, but Reed's take on these subjects, which includes different twists on common images, as in Pale Blue Eyes, where it becomes apparent Reed's singing of an adulterous affair. The subject matter of Candy Says would have been right at home on either of the first two albums, as well as on Transformer. Some Kinda Love is classic VU, and What Goes On is a great rocker, but one that would have seemed out of place previously. Side two contains more songs that, on the surface, seem to be more mainstream, such as Beginning to See The Light and I'm Set Free, then lays The Murder Mystery on you...and the last song, After Hours, sung by Mo Tucker (!), while sweet on the surface, expresse a desire to hide from the world by way of alcohol.    All the original VU albums are different from one another, which is why you should have ALL 4...as well as the 1984 release \\"VU\\", which contains a song recorded with Cale still in the band (Stephanie Says) as well as others after he was gone. It seems to straddle the era between WL/WH and this record and, while not recorded as a piece, seems to flow like an album. Listen to Stephanie Says and you can hear how, even with Cale, they were headed in this direction.
B000000OMB|5.0|Sadly enough for many years I forgot about this album and did not listen to it.  I bought the vinyl and remember hearing all the hits on the radio and remember enjoying it very much playing it on my turntable.  I was 22 years old!  I was already a fan of Yes, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, etc.  But unlike bands like Yes that delivered a multitude of good releases over the years, Asia fell short.  So after being letdown by their subsequent releases, after a decade I forgot about the best one \\"Asia\\".  Thanks to MP3 I have rediscovered this great release.  Every song is a winner and this really rates right up there as one of the best prog albums of all time.  The songs are so well written it's just a shame this band couldnt have come up with more songs like this on later albums.  They could have been legendary!  It was only a lack of material that stopped them.  This album sounds like a Greatest Hits album, like the hit singles from a career full of hits.  They were just right on the mark at this time period with the great songs & production work along with soaring vocal delivery by John Wetton.  They did make some more decent albums and standout tracks.  But nothing compared to this first Asia album.  It was a classic rock album that stands the test of time.  It sounds as good today as it did 27 years ago!
B00005ABII|5.0|Who would think that a fan of 80's pop and alternative, once called \\"New Wave\\" and now \\"Retro,\\" would like Cake? I was hooked by \\"Never There\\" and out of curiosity searched youtube to find out who did this song--\\"Cake.\\" I learned more about the band and their music, and decided to purchase my first CAKE CD-PROLONGING THE MAGIC. I now have 3 of their CDs, and while I like them all, my favorite is this one. I highly recommend it.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|the lighting of the production sets the tone for a depressing setting...however, each character offers something to the different relationships of the story that made me feel good --- rich or poor, educated or not, privileged or deprived --- everyone strives for the good of others and not only of themselves. something we need to see more of these days because of the rampant greed and shameless disregard for virtues we should aim for. a very timely story for me to watch.
B001KVZ6FC|4.0|I've always had a fondness for Eastwood's direction and films; his latest, \\"GRAN TORINO\\" may not be his best directorial film assignment but it sure is a welcome addition to his directorial opus. This film is a melodramatic experience (well, Eastwood's performance keep it from becoming a full-blown one) and is a clever character study on racism, friendship and redemption. The film is pretty simple and that is the one element that made it work. Of course, Eastwood relies on his old-school tactics to generate a taut, gripping, and intense experience.<br /><br />Walter Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is a retired mechanic and who has been recently widowed. He tries to keep to himself, tends to his own property and fends off the selfish desires of his grandkids. He watches his old neighborhood and seems like the \\"new\\" generation of kids nowadays lack any respect whatsoever, and Walt falls into despair. He maintains some prejudice since his bleak days in the Korean war. Walt just minds his own business until he observes the violent predicament of a young Hmong man named Thao (Bee Vang) and he decides to intervene and drives off the gang members and Walt becomes recognized and respected in the Hmong community. He is repulsed by the traditions, but slowly he is won over through Homng cuisine and befriends Thao and his sister, Sue (Ahney Her). Now, Walter has become fond of this huge Asian family, but unfortunately, the Hmong gang situation is about to get much, much worst...and Walter is adamant on getting involved.<br /><br />\\"Gran Torino\\" is simple, the screenplay by Nick Schneke is a no-nonsense, no B.S. type of a deal and may be heavily dipped in Midwestern culture. The story is about an aging ex-military man who is so set in their ways, he finds solace in his own little world, folks like this tend to keep to themselves and they try to stay away from the melting pot that develops around them. Walter's state of nature is the good old-fashioned way of American life, whose life and beliefs may revolve around seemingly outdated values in this day and age. Sure, he does have his share of bigotry but I think it is just his comfort zone and a way of dealing with the things that he has seen. The story is all about respect and finding the means to clear one's conscience. Walter has lived his life and he has nothing to lose.<br /><br />Walt is one very intense individual and you can tell from the get-go that he has a major chip on his shoulder. There are very strong hints that he is not an easy person to get along with, and he has somewhat alienated himself from his family. Now, his health is slowly deteriorating and he still refuses to reach out. (why would he?) Quite ironic and not really surprising that he finds more in common with his next door Asian neighbors, who are from a very different ethnic background and old-school traditions. I think you can see that this is due to the fact that these Asian people have survived many hardships and they can understand him. His own family is basically the new type of generation, his children may have things too easy for them and his grandkids give the impression of a very irresponsible attitude.<br /><br />The film does revolve around its characters, their interactions and their habits--the characters make the story in \\"Gran Torino\\". The film's dialogue is very strong and much of it does focus on Walter and Thao's relationship who develop an odd friendship after Thao had attempted to steal Walt`s prized car; the 1972 \\"classic Gran Torino\\". You may say that Walter becomes Thao's father figure somehow. One may also say that the car represents Walt's personality--unchanging that had stood the test of time. I do love Ahney Her's character \\"Sue\\" as she proves to be the strong anchor between her family and Walt, she does draw out the goodness within this strong-willed ex-military man.<br /><br />Eastwood's direction doesn't go into overdrive into taking the limits of remorse, guilt and hate into account. Thedirection is kept very simple and it is what made it effective. I also commend the direction that while it does have a serious tone and it remembered to add subtle doses of humor. I really enjoyed the way Eastwood delivered his dialogue and you may say that he is the culmination of most of the characters he has played in the past--think an aged \\"Dirty Harry Callahan\\". His constant focus on his spitting and his quips about prejudices was humorous, and I think the direction managed to keep a clean execution throughout. The exchanges between Walt and his barber is made for pure fun, as well as Sue calling him \\"Wally\\".<br /><br />\\"GRAN TORINO\\" has been unofficially promoted as Eastwood's last starring role. The film is very good, and while it may not stand as his best directorial outing, (I think \\"Unforgiven\\" is still his best) Eastwood's acting portrayal is solid and his role seemed tailor-made for his personality. The direction is brilliantly simple and avoids quite a few melodramatic pitfalls, the climax is very heavy with a symbolic gesture and some audiences may indeed see it a little too polished for a film like this. The film is satisfying enough and I rather welcome Eastwood's return to this type of role. Eastwood's \\"Gran Torino\\" isn't too concerned with making a huge mark in his resume--and maybe this is the way he wanted it. Going out quietly, with a restrained but powerful impact.<br /><br />Highly Recommended! [4 ½ Stars]t is what made it effective.

B001HZ9ABM|4.0|I've been waiting for this reissue ever since the Bee Gees reissued their first three albums in a deluxe set. For some reason the early Bee Gees really connected with me as a teenager. I loved all these albums and it turns out I still do. I'm tempted to say, given my more \\"high brow\\" musical tastes, that my Bee Gees thing is a guilty pleasure, only thing is, I don't feel a bit guilty. I just love these songs, these arrangements, those voices. Odessa is the one where the Bee Gees stretch out. In the liner notes one writer likens it to the Beatles White Album, not that it has that kind of recognition, but that it's where the Bee Gees really stretch out, going in whatever direction their muse takes them. And the music is the better for it. Not much of a hit, but who cares, it's a very satisfying ride from beginning to end. And the 3rd disc with demos, alternate versions and such, is also a treat. Sometimes the songs are in unfinished stages, or in stripped down versions and you can hear what they were in their essence, and it's good. Also, I gained a whole new appreciation for what Maurice contributed to the Bee Gees - his versatility is striking, and his feel on piano and acoustic guitar is very, very good.<br /><br />Odessa is called a concept album but, like with Sergeant Peppers, if it is a concept album it is only in the loosest sense. Starting out adrift on an iceberg singing of lost love certainly captures the way life can feel sometimes, and many of the other songs remain in that vein. Marley Purt Drive is both humorous and real, Suddenly a very surprising sound musically and vocally from the Bee Gees. After Odessa the band lost me. Who could avoid their hugely successful disco period, and they were good at it, but it wasn't for me. These first four albums (well, not actually the first four, but the first four when they were big), wonderfully capped by Odessa, is for me the heart and soul of the Bee Gees. Fact is, and now I'm about to utter heresy, I like thisstuff as much or more than I like a lot of The Beatles' early work until they hit Revolver, a tremendous leap and the best album they ever made. So sue me, The Bee Gees made great songs and Odessa is a very, very fine album.
0312383320|1.0|This, and all other, \\"between the numbers\\" books are nothing but money-grubbing propositions for Ms. Evanovich.  The story lines in all of them read more like a smarmy romance novel crossed with a science fiction tale.  Stick to the books with a number in the title for the real thing.  Don't waste your money on these thin, over-priced, not-very-interesting books.
B001DPC52C|3.0|When bands make Live DVD's the worst thing the film crew can do is have one jump cut after another. This happened with the last Nightwish DVD and it's happened with WT now. The music is great but the fast jump cuts make it hard to watch. Part of seeing a live DVD is also being able to see the lighting effects they used for the show. A good example of a well filmed live show is Kamelot's One Cold Winter's Night the film crew did not go for the jump cuts and would show you the members and the lighting and ever thing else.     I think WT was a little cheated with the film crew and they could have done a better job filming it for the band and Orchestra after all it's not ever day you get to see a metal band and any Orchestra play together.
B00005QEO1|5.0|By the late 1980s, rock and roll was all about putting on a cutting-edge, exciting display of powerful guitar, drum, bass and vocals. By 1989, the third time back in the studio of the original lineup of Aerosmith (Steven Tyler- Vocals Keyboards and Harmonica, Joe Perry- Guitar, Brad Whitford- Guitar, Tom Hamilton- Bass, and Joey Kramer- Drums) proved to be the true charm for Aerosmith, and they cranked out a real rocker headed for a hall of fame.<br /><br />PUMP is the second peak of the band's career (after their commercial plunge in the early 1980's due to declining record sales and inner group turmoil) It builds upon their catchy music that brought new fans who enjoyed 1987's [[ASIN:B00005QEO0 Permanent Vacation]], and ties the classy new co-writing team of Desmond Child and Jim Vallance who helped out on several tracks on PUMP to Perry and Tyler's hard-cutting edge and sleazy, slick lyrics that earned Aerosmith immense popularity on their 1970's albums.<br /><br />Most of the tracks here are so well constructed that at a first glance, the casual listener won't really skip any tracks on the first go. There have been several radio singles to have come from this album, the slick \\"Love in an Elevator\\", the catchy \\"Janie's Got a Gun\\" (A Grammy Winner), the rocker \\"The Other Side\\", and my personal favorite, the closing ballad, \\"What It Takes\\".<br /><br />\\"Young Lust\\" opens as a hard hitting fast-paced rocker that will pretty much define the superiority of the record on its own. My favorite part is at the conclusion where Kramer goes on a 30-Second drumming spree that leads into the secondary rocker \\"F.I.N.E.\\". The Fun doesn't end there. If you're not at least grinning by now, then this isn't your record. \\"Monkey On My Back\\" is a bouncy number that feels ahead of its time. (It also has been featured in several car commercials). \\"My Girl\\", and \\"Don't Get Mad, Get Even\\" are both excellent tracks. \\"Voodoo Medicine Man\\" happens to be one of the most unique and interesting tracks on the CD but will definetly grow on any Aerosmith listener.<br /><br />Another interesting thing to note is that there are often bookmark songs and skits on this CD that separate songs, for added touches. These are definetly unique to this specific CD. The most impressive of these cuts is \\"Dulcimer Stomp\\" which plays immediately before \\"The Other Side\\" on Track 6.<br /><br />I would recommend PUMP as a CD for just about anybody. I have not found many CDs to equal its integrity or to match the impression it has left on me. If there are any fans of Late 1980's hard rock (G'N'R Fans would certainly enjoy this CD) or even hair fans (should they still exist), or if you come from the 90's and would like to know what a truly amazing 80's rock record is, look no further.<br /><br />Breakdown:<br />\\"Pump\\" showcases Aerosmith at their very best in the 1980's. The album compliments many artists who were growing in popularity in the late 80's and early 90's and stands well amongst them. The record has many lasting hits and is arguably the best album of Aerosmith's second coming. If you purchase any record from the later half of the band's career, this one will make a fine choice.<br /><br />Aerosmith: \\"Pump\\" (A)ill definetly grow on any Aerosmith listener.    Another interesting thing to note is that there are often bookmark songs and skits on this CD that separate songs, for added touches. These are definetly unique to this specific CD. The most impressive of these cuts is \\"Dulcimer Stomp\\" which plays immediately before \\"The Other Side\\" on Track 6.     I would recommend PUMP as a CD for just about anybody. I have not found many CDs to equal its integrity or to match the impression it has left on me. If there are any fans of Late 1980's hard rock (G'N'R Fans would certainly enjoy this CD) or even hair fans (should they still exist), or if you come from the 90's and would like to know what a truly amazing 80's rock record is, look no further.    Breakdown:  \\"Pump\\" showcases Aerosmith at their very best in the 1980's. The album compliments many artists who were growing in popularity in the late 80's and early 90's and stands well amongst them. The record has many lasting hits and is arguably the best album of Aerosmith's second coming. If you purchase any record from the later half of the band's career, this one will make a fine choice.

0307454894|5.0|Bernard Schlink makes intricate, personal observations that will take your breath away.  Although this book could be consumed in six hours, I stretched it over two days because I wanted to savor the experience.  It was thrilling to absorb such profound meaning from so few written words.  I love this author and am eager to read all of his other books.
B001P5HI4A|5.0|The general public probably can't imagine how long Barbra Streisand fans have eagerly awaited this DVD set, but from Barbra's   very personal and candid comments in it, she certainly knows and has more than satisfied this particular fan...and I haven't even finished listening to her absorbing feature-length film commentary!  It's difficult to know where to begin touting this marvelous new accomplishment, which bears Barbra's personal stamp from beginning to end.  Basically, Yentl's director, star, producer, and co-writer teaches us how she created the film.  Unlike other Streisand films on DVD, besides offering a shimmering remastered golden \\"print\\" of the film and full surround audio, this one is all about the process, Barbra's intriguing process.  Her vision, as portrayed on the screen, only is the product of a series of momentous small projects, which she recounts in new on-camera recollections and illustrates through the fascinating material in her archives.      Besides the delicious deleted scenes on disc 1, many of which are quite humorous and perhaps would have altered the tone of the film had they originally been included, disc 2 offers the unique opportunity to see Barbra rehearse the film's musical numbers (her \\"little videos\\") alongside Alan & Marilyn Bergman, Michel Legrand, Rusty Lemorande, and other friends and collaborators in their homes.  This footage is the highlight of disc 2, priceless and truly indicative of Barbra's high level of preparation prior to shooting her films.  Those familiar with the film will immediately envision the comparisons in their minds when viewing these rehearsal numbers, so, although nicely edited, the comparisons may be unnecessary.  Instead, I would have enjoyed seeing more raw rehearsal footage like \\"Tomorrow Night.\\"  There's a montage of Barbra's newly narrated 8 mm European location scouting film which further explores her fascinating creative process regarding the film's natural imagery.  \\"The Director's Reel\\" is afeaturette introduced by Barbra, which places us on the set when cameras continue rolling for her actors to maintain momentum and save time.  Some of the material on disc 2 was featured in bits and pieces on television for special reports and interview programs when Yentl premiered, but the vast majority has never been seen before.  One previously released song \\"The Moon and I\\" demo from Just For The Record (the 1991 box set) is accompanied for the first time by a beautiful storyboard sequence with a nude Yentl bathing in a mikvah.  Another previously unreleased gem is Barbra's demo of \\"Several Sins A Day,\\" also illustrated by a storyboard sequence, somewhat chaotic and haunting.  The plethora of special features goes on to include more than a hundred publicity photos, many rarely or never published, and an unusually funny and somewhat risqué featurette called \\"My Wonderful Cast and Crew,\\" which serves as sort of an alternate end credits sequence with a memorable conclusion you'll never forget.  Speaking of Barbra's crew, the DVD case insert reproduces one of Barbra's most cherished possessions - a copy of the June 1982 letter from her London crew defending her from detractors.      Indeed, this is the Yentl DVD we've been waiting for!  How many times can we see the movie?  More.  How much can we learn from Barbra Streisand about how she made the movie?  More.  What's wrong with wanting more?  After all, nothing's impossible!
0156034026|4.0|The Reluctant Fundamentalist was a gift from my sister's British in laws; are they trying to tell me something?  It's always interesting to get another perspective, and Hamid's isn't very flattering. He offers up two views of America.       The first is of our business culture, through the caricature of Underwood Samson.  US gets the best and brightest young adults and turns them into robots sent out to reduce everything to fundamentals, i.e. profit.  Type of business, employees' lives, even borders do not matter.  They will bow down only to the god of profit, to the point of denying their own countrymen their jobs.         The second view Hamid has of the US is through the character of Erica, a contraction of America.  She is effortlessly beautiful, born wealthy, easily commands attention, calls all the shots, knows everybody and everything, and is irresistable to everyone.  Only when we get up close and get to know her do we find her hopelessly screwed up.  She is living in the past, skating on past glories.  She cannot support herself.  She is sexually disfunctional, effectively ending her bloodline.  Her fate is unclear: does she die or simply disappear?         These perspectives are explained carefully and graciously to an American in Pakistan almost as a justification for the violence aimed at that same American at the end.  The book is unsettling.  It's almost better not knowing why were hated, especially if the reasons are largely out of the normal citizen's control.         It's hard to quantify why something is hated, but The Reluctant Fundamentalist tries to explain why the parts of the Muslim world hate the US to the point of wanting and trying to destroying our country.

B000WMEAKC|5.0|I first heard \\"Apologize\\" the Timbaland Mix on the radio. I had to find out more about this artist. I'm not the kind of person that just buys a single track, I like to have a whole CD. It is rare to find an artist these days that puts out an album that can be played from beginning to end without skipping a track.  This is one of those rare albums.  OneRepublic's unique sound and writing are great to hear. Ryan Tedder's voice is truly art by itself. This is a must have album if you like Keane and The Fray, (as I notice they are mentioned in the Amazon.com review.)

0316017922|4.0|My wife and I enjoyed \\"Outliers\\" for various reasons. She reads 99% fiction so Gladwell's book was a rare selection for us. She enjoyed the Asian math/rice fields chapter. As a former military pilot,  I found the Korean Airlines story fascinating and accurately portrayed. The final chapter, a look back at the author's Jamaican roots and \\"light\\" skin, provided perhaps an appropriate look at his journey to becoming a literary Outlier.
B00000G6PJ|3.0|I love progressive rock. I listen to Pink Floyd, Yes, King Crimson, Emerson Lake & Palmer, Frank Zappa, the list goes on and on. All of these bands were absolutely hated by the punk rock movement of the late 70's. Punk rock was the statement of hatred for the pretentious progressive rock bands, and punk rock managed to mostly kill off progressive rock within a few years.  With all of this history, I have held a dislike of punk rock. But after hearing Anarchy in the U.K., I decided I would give this album a try, though.   The album is good. It gives you a glimpse into the punk scene of England back in the late 70's. I know that punk rock in general is known for live performances than studio work, but the album fairs quite well in the studio. The best songs from the album are Holidays in the Sun, Anarchy in the U.K., and God Save the Queen. Seventeen and Submission are good, and the rest of the album is... basic (by basic, I mean that most of these songs seem to follow the same formula).    A quick warning, if you are slightly squeamish, do not listen to Bodies. Sid Vicious plays on it. I'm kidding, kidding. But really, it's a song about abortions, and its lyrics are quite grotesque.
B001HN6972|4.0|After an act of kindness, 36 year old Hannah Schmitz (Kate Winslet) begins a passionate but secret filled affair with 15 year old Michael Berg (David Cross). Hannah ends the relationship abruptly and contact is lost until 8 years later when Michael, now a law student, finds Hannah on trial for Nazi war crimes. Michael has information that could help Hannah avoid a longer jail sentence. But decides to not let this secret become known. Many years later an adult Michael (Ralph Fiennes) begins sending Hannah tapes of him reading great literary works as his reading to her was once an important aspect of their intimate relationship.    I much prefer films that have intelligence and complexity to the mind numbing shlock of far too many Hollywood movies. But I found \\"The Reader\\" subtle to the point that I left the cinema feeling more perplexed than enlightened. Obviously, this film is about the guilt felt by a former Nazi guard. But how does her illiteracy factor into her level of cupability and were Homer's \\"The Odyssey\\" and Anton Chekov's \\"The Lady With The Little Dog\\" referenced for specific reasons or just as examples of great literature? It's true that Michael could have saved Hannah time in prison by divulging to the court that she was illiterate and thus unable to have written the report that served as the most damning evidence against her. But beyond that there seemed to be many layers of meaning that the film was trying to get at but did not express clearly enough. Perhaps Bernard Schlink's book, on which it was based, goes into greater detail.    In any case, the result is that, why I did feel some sympathy for Hannah and could relate in certain aspects to Michael, I did not become emotionally involved enough with the characters for this to be a monumental cinematic expereince for me. I appreciate the movie's artistic ambitions. But, in the end, found something lacking in it's presentation.

0307454894|4.0|The Reader is a simple book with a simple story.  It manages to be both intriguing and interesting... yet very predicable at the same time.  It's predictability doesn't really hamper the book, but the emotions of whoever reads the book might be hampered slightly.<br /><br />Michael Berg, when he's fifteen, is stricken with Hepatitis.  When he's weak, he's helped by a mysterious woman named Hanna, who is twice his age.  She's a mysterious character with a very mysterious past, as well as her own secrets she wants to hide.  As time carries on, Michael and Hanna begin to have an affair.  Their relationship soon evolves from lust into something more romantic... and mysterious.  One thing that strikes Michael as odd is that Hanna insist on one thing: that he read to her.<br /><br />One day when he comes to visit her, however, she has just disappeared and has not left any hints as to where she has gone.  Michael, devastated, can do nothing more than move on with his life.  He eventually finds himself studying law in school, with an Instructor who insists on them viewing and analyzing a trial.  It is here, years later, when Michael sees Hanna again... on the stand.  He will now learn more about his former lover than he has ever known, and much more than he'd like to.  Only her secret can save her... but she's so ashamed of it that she considers it worse than murder.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the only real place where The Reader goes wrong is that \\"secret\\".  We're dropped many hints throughout the book.  And while the trial and story are compelling, some may not exactly like the idea of reading through so many pages just to find out she can't read, which is really not much of a secret through the book.  However, there's more after it which is very nice to read.  We get to learn more about Hanna's character and really see her develop.  This does turn out to be much more than just what she has to hide, and that helps it become a much better book.  It just feels a little anti-climatic.  But it still works.<br /><br />The characters are well developed and the language is, overall beautiful.  The Reader isn't a very long book, nor is it very difficult to read.  Many readers will probably be able to finish it in a single sitting.  At the very least it shouldn't keep you busy for much more than a week.<br /><br />It's a good book overall, but many will come to her big secret a little differently.  It brings about an interesting question as to whether self preservation is more important than shame, but many readers still might not come too kindly to this aspect of the novel.till works.

1563894696|5.0|The Long Halloween is by far the best of its series.  This is for many reasons.  One reason would be that the film noir, mafia idea works the best in this novel.  The style is really enriched and it blooms very nicely.  Mystery and suspense really play a big role this time around, and I was flipping through the book in no time at all.  ONE THING before I go any further.  Read this novel first.  DO NOT read Dark Victory before this one.  I made that mistake and I felt like I was reading a prequel this time around.  Don't ruin it for yourself.<br /><br />But anyway, Sale and Loeb really do a great job with our characters in this novel.  The Rogue's gallery was finely polished and Catwoman makes a much more desirable appearance.  Their writing really impressed me and you can see some of it squeeze into the films if you watch closely.<br /><br />The main reason, and my last reason, why the book delivers, is because of Harvey Dent's origin.  The story is enjoyably tragic and very well done.  I love a good origin story, and I received an amazing tale of Dent's world.  I loved every minute of it, and although The Dark Knight film had the best possible Batman elements, sometimes I wish I could see some of this origin come to life.  But I can't complain because the film and the novel are completely amazing by themselves.  I reccomend viewing both of them if you enjoy Batman.
0316017922|3.0|A fascinating look at people that are outside normal experience. It discusses those who are extraordinarily successful, and sometimes those who had the innate potential for greatness, but didn't get the right \\"breaks\\". Gladwell conjectures that \\"outlier\\" success is primarily due to two factors: 1) being fortunate enough to be born in the right place at the right time; and 2) hard, meaningful work. He suggests that there are many people who have the ability to be wildly successful (Bill Gates, world-class gymnasts, etc.) but were not given the opportunity to succeed. He describes facts such as how almost all the Canadian junior hockey system's great players are born in the first three months of the year; and how Asian's stereotypical prowess in mathematics is due to the structure of Asian language numbering systems as well as being products of thousands of years of wet-rice farming! Bottom line: Successful people do not achieve greatness despite their backgrounds (Horatio Alger's take) but BECAUSE of their backgrounds. I gave it three stars because some of the examples seem contrived and designed to prove his point, rather than an objective analysis. There are no counter-examples, and I'm sure there are many, which leads me to believe that the facts Gladwell didn't like, he simply ignored. Very interesting and thought-provoking book, nonetheless.

B0000004V2|5.0|They just don't quite make albums like this anymore. The melody's are so beautifully written and the lyrics accompany them so well that when listening to it you just get totally lost in the music. The Stone Roses self-titled debut effort in 1989 is one of the most incredible albums I have ever heard, and I hold music to a fairly high standard. These British musicians have such an amazing sense for smooth, pop-rock that the album gets better and better with every listen. I listen to a lot of hard-rock/alternative/grunge/punk and it is my first love, but I am starting to really love bands like this, that lay down a crystal-clear beautifully written sound that just sweeps you away. Amazing effort by the Stone Roses!
B001Q1QF2O|5.0|This sophomore album by Lily was worth the wait although it took so long. The album is just like her first album minus the heavy beats and songs that could probably pass as party anthems that don't have much meaning. I am glad to see Lily Allen back and I thought she was on the verge of being a sophomore slump or a one hit album wonder in the United States like one of my other favorite UK artist Craig David. I kinda wish this album had at least one more song like maybe a remixed version of one of her hit songs on the album, which did on her first album with the song Smile. The album just left me wanting more music or a couple more songs.
0439023483|5.0|Collins does an excellent job painting the characters, actions, and emotions to life. \\"The Hunger Games\\" kept me wondering what event would happen next, and Collins never failed to take me by surprise with her clever, twisted plots.

The contents within this book is absolutely breathtaking and even when I was finished, the story still haunted my mind, making me crave for more.
0312383320|2.0|1.  Diesel is not a very likeable character and he plays a major role in this book.    2.  Grandma Mazur only makes a brief appearance and is not really a part of the action.    3.  The Jersey Devil and some other fringe characters are just not funny.    4.  Three boyfriends for Stephanie are at least one too many.    5.  Bathroom humor is really not that funny.    6.  Munch is such a simple character--brilliant and predatory--and not very interesting.    7.  The bad guys are trying to......do what?  And who cares?    I invite you to add your own.  I hope that Janet Evanovich will return to what made her popular--snappy dialogue between entertaining characters like Lula, Grandma Mazur, and Ranger, and humor that finds the right balance between over-the-top and ridiculous.
0751529818|5.0|Our society does not value the wisdom of our elders as much as many other societies do.  After reading 'Tuesdays with Morrie', I think that you might question why we don't give as much credence and respect to those who have much to teach us and from whom we have much to learn.<br /><br />The 'memoir' is a sweet and poignant journal of a middle-aged man who re-connects with his favorite college professor, Morrie, who is now dying of ALS.  Every Tuesday, the former student and Morrie get together to talk. The professor shares the wisdom he has learned over the years with his younger friend.  The professor discusses how wisdom is gained from experience and from examining one's core values.  His younger friend has lost sight of his real priorities as he's struggled to put career, material acquisitions, and financial success first.<br /><br />What Morrie emphasizes is that love, listening, and making time for friends and community are what really count.  True happiness can never be found in material wealth.

B000EULJLU|5.0|I've been listening to rock and metal for 19 years now. I've seen the death of metal and the death of rock. Going through the rebirth of metal.    Then I heard Tool recently (15 days back) on Youtube. I was ashamed. How did I end up missing Tool?    I had (maybe) heard their name here and there, but never checked them out. \\"Tool albums dont sell everywhere, perhaps\\" - I thought, in an attempt to exonerate myself. But that hadn't prevented me from going after obscure death metal albums.    This is a great album. Dont listen to the overcritical Tool fans who are busy comparing this to the previous albums. How does it matter what the other albums are?    Take my unbiased advice and go for it. The most unbiased that there can be - from a music lover who accidentally stumbled onto Tool.
1416550518|5.0|Aha!  Don't get me wrong, I love potboilers, thrillers, mysteries, etc., but it was really a treat to read this book that is a throwback to an era where books actually told nuanced stories.  In addition to enjoying the story, I enjoyed Morton's considerable writing abilities, and admire that she never let the storyline falter to show off her talents as do many other writers and which, in her case, must have been a temptation.  An amazing accomplishment for a first-time author.  Or any other author.

B0019K06RM|5.0|If there is a more beautiful voice in the world of popular music, I do not know of it.<br /><br />The title tells the contents within: \\"All I Intended To Be\\" is a statement of celebration of attaining one's self (or the long process of creating one's self) through the vicissitudes of life.<br /><br />The thirteen songs in this collection all involve the themes of personal integrity (gained), the moral self (attained), and reflections on losses and hurts (sustained). I strongly disagree with with the lead reviewer from Amazon UK that there is anything maudlin about these songs. He's dead wrong. These songs are about the most important events in our lives--relationships lost, deaths observed, and wisdom achieved--and they reflect the spiritual growth and understanding we (hopefully) achieve as we travel this road, and we grow and mature.<br /><br />Five of the songs are written or co-written by Emmylou, including one about the saga of the brain-dead Florida woman, Terri Schiavo: \\"Sailing 'round the room\\", a celebration of death as a liberation of the travails of the body.<br /><br />The musicianship on this album is unwaveringly wonderful, and elegantly first rate. The vocal harmonies of Dolly Parton and the McGarrigle sisters blend beautifully with Emmylou, and are reason enough to buy this CD. A bit unsettling are the duets with the male singers on two of the songs: they feel a bit as if someone has cut in on you while dancing with your best girl and, to make matters worse, they then proceed to step all over her feet while you stand alone, wallflowered. However, these songs, too, are worthwhile and add variety to the mix.<br /><br />Buy this CD? Yes, do. It's wonderful.

Another Great Story Janet.  Thank YOU.
0316067601|5.0|This account is incredible.  I found it thoroughly enjoyable to read, first of all.  I loved the author's voice and feeling.  I couldn't put it down.  I was surprised to find myself laughing out loud at times at his candor and dialogue.  It was a very touching book to read...a very human glimpse into these incredible men.     I truly believe that everyone should read this book.  I cannot begin to express the heightened gratitude it has raised in me for what these guys are doing.  It is astonishing to read what they are willing to go through even to be able to do the job of protecting US!  I am so grateful Luttrell wrote this book, to help us all to understand better.  I know that I, for one, am incredibly more grateful.  I already was, but this has greatly intensified that gratitude.      I, for one, have absolutely no respect for a reviewer who cannot even finish a book before they review it.  Are we all in the second grade?  Have some decency and maturity, enough to finish this book before you review it.    I think the man is entitled to his opinions.  He has definitely earned them, in defense of the United States and its' citizens.  And all of those guys died, defending our rights and freedoms...even the right to be ignorant and critical of those who die defending you.      Definitely a must-read.
0316017922|4.0|I would class some sections of this book as interesting reading and others as valuable information to aid in understanding how culture, environment, and accidents of birth can shape a life.

0646418432|4.0|It's exciting to read the first published novel of the world's best selling author of all time.  After reading [[ASIN:1579126278 The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]], I decided to read all of the Hercule Poirot mysteries, and this is a natural beginning.  We meet the detective Poirot, a Belgian refugee in England, and his future traveling companion, Arthur Hastings.    The powerful matron of a wealthy family is poisoned in her sleep!  Whodunnit?    I felt the book started a wee bit slow (as always with the first in a series, no?), but once the poisoning happened, it was difficult to put down.  Perfect reading for a long flight to Brazil.    Highly recommended as travel reading (or whenever else you may need a diversion).  For the rest of my trip, I've brought [[ASIN:0425200450 Murder on the Orient Express]] and [[ASIN:0425129632 Hallowe'en Party]].  Poirot to the rescue!

While Laura is as great as ever, the songwriting is sub-par compared to what Pausini herself usually writes, and some of the production is a bit over-the-top. That being said, the album isn't at all bad. It's just not what I would have expected.    Pausini recorded this record after her Italian greatest hits album \\"E Ritorno da Te\\" and before mega-hit \\"Resta in Ascolto\\". At that time, Laura was best known for her adult contemporary ballads, a la Celine Dion in the mid-1990s. In that sense, this album somewhat fits in with what she was doing then. However, when viewed in the current context of Laura's repertoire, it fades compared to more recent work.    As others have mentioned, some songs are translations of previous hits. 'Every Day is a Monday', which was also recorded as 'Il Mio Sbaglio Piu Grande'/'Un Error de los Grandes' isn't nearly as entertaining as its foreign-language counterparts. 'It's Not Goodbye' was written by Pausini herself as 'In Assenza di Te'/'En Ausencia di Ti' - and it shows. The song is performed beautifully with emotion.    Along with 'It's Not Goodbye', other great tracks from the record are the piano/vocal reprise of 'Every Little Thing You Do', 'If That's Love', and 'Without You' - all of them are gentle, tender tunes that evoke strong emotion. And while 'I Need Love' and 'Surrender' are very upbeat, they're filled with the magic Laura has become famous for. Least favorite tracks? 'Do I Dare' and 'I Do to Be' definitely top the list, more for their sheer over-production than anything else. But don't let these two discourage you.     Overall, the album is worth a solid three stars. Some tracks are better off being skipped, but many of them are charming. A few stand out as true gems, and all of them contain great pronunciation by a woman who doesn't speak English as a first - oreven second - language. While \\"From the Inside\\" isn't what I would have expected from Laura Pausini, it's a decent album that brings a smile to my face.

B000V6BE6C|4.0|Avenged Sevenfold is definitely one of the most original and dynamic groups I have ever heard. This album contains an amazing level of musicianship any band or artist should appreciate. If you love music with incredible energy, loud guitars, pulsating drums, and powerful, yet smooth vocals, than this album is definitely for you. I would highly recommend.
0440237688|5.0|I am in my twenties and never read this when I was younger. I read it for a teacher preparation program. What a great book to introduce students to distopia. I would highly recommend it for both pleasure and study.
B001HZ9ABM|5.0|This is an outstanding reissue of a fantastic album.  Odessa never got a proper CD issue, poor mastering and lousy aesthetics.  Surely, this is one release that merits a deluxe treatment.  The original album just sparkles and amazes.  As much as I love the first three Bee Gees albums, this is their artistic arrival.  Stereo and mono versions, and a terrific third disc, Sketches of Odessa which is quite fun and contains some revelations, not to mention 2 decent outtakes.<br />The packaging is superb, from the velvet case, to the poster, booklet and CD sleeves, a class job from Rhino.<br />I did not single out any individual songs for praise, as the album works as a piece, or should I say \\"Master Peace!\\"
0452289963|5.0|If you think about the book, overall it's great however there might be smilar or same ideologies or religious/spiritual practices that have the same idea with Eckhart's new \\"terms\\".<br /><br />What makes \\"A New Earth\\" special is: I never heard the idea of \\"pain body\\" which totally shocked me. Because that was the thing I was trying to figure out.<br />Every time when I see people complaining, people around start to complain in a way much worse - which is no new.<br />And what they are saying is always \\"come on! what I lived is even worse then what you lived\\". Might not be admitted verbally, but I'm sure most of us feel more miserable compared to the peers.<br />I think that I'm-more-miserable-than-you-are thing  breaks the communication between people apart. This is certainly a cycle which is absolutely goes to nowhere. An endless complaint wind starts and makes us forget all the good memories and posessions that deserve appreciation.<br />Actually, I see no good in complaining.<br />And thank you Eckhart, I learnt how to stop myself when I start complaining. I know \\"feeding the pain-body\\" is the road to nowhere!<br /><br />Stop your pain-body people, you'll definetly see your joy-body feels much better ;)<br /><br />P.S: Thank you very much Bea Vanni for sending the book. That was a nice gift I still appreciate!
B0013D8LOK|5.0|great acting great music great casting great story this a true classic buy this movie you wont be sorry
0439023483|4.0|Just want others to know that I am 61 years old and really enjoyed the suspense the book offered.
0061706620|5.0|This book is awesome to have along side the Supernatural: book of monsters,spirits,Ghouls. It's a great book for any Supernatural fan of the show. This book is an excellent resourse guide as well as the other book, but the best part about this book is you get to here everything from the very begining in John Winchester's own voice. It comes down to every detail from the very begining of when the tragic events took place back in 1983. When the demon took his wife and tryed to kill his children and thats when all the weird stuff started happening. After you read this book, it will all make perfect sense. This book is a must have for anyone interesting in monsters,vampires, werewolves and the paranormal ect...
0553383663|5.0|This is a great and informative book that was fun to read. Its good because everything that they talk about is interesting and fun. It a great book if you want to learn about google, or just the early days of the internet. Interesting and fun.
031606792X|3.0|well it was an ok book. the first book was definately the best in the series. the last was probably the second best in my opinion.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|Even though the shipping was a little disappointing I was informed of delays and received my purchase in time and in great condition. Was not able to find it anywhere else so thank you for having it. Looking forward to making future purchases with you.
0312945973|1.0|&lt;Shudders>  It was horribe!  Not a single character was believable.  There were times when I felt sympathetic to Taita, the all-knowing, toot-his-own-horn slave, but those times were short-lived.  The flowery/snobbish language made me want to puke.  I don't think you could go more than two or three pages without the author saying \\"this very Egypt\\" or \\"our very Egypt\\".  It got old quick.  It may have been a good book if it was no more than 350 pages, but I couldn't finish.  I'm so glad I didn't buy it.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|So here I am again, finding a show long after cancelled (i did see Serenity in the Theatre, but had no idea it was made from a TV show)  I realized later on that Firefly was the original production and Serenity was the movie.    So this show was brief and wrongly cancelled, it was simply amazing, a great and original story, mixing the Cowboy, with the space quest. The character development is awesome, and no character is ONE thing, each has back stories and personalities that are not derived from one action or event.   The stories are great, the mix of action, drama, humor and suspense, are wonderful. So we are rewarded from FOX with ...not even a full season.....Thanks FOX, once again you screwed us all.    It seems like I find these shows too late, I came into Farscape after cancellation, and the same with Firefly, the thing is I barely knew either were ever on, and I watch a bunch of TV, I have to blame marketing for both....if you do not let people know what is on, your channels how are people supposed to tune it to watch?
B001ECQ6YW|5.0|A good animated movie that has plenty of action and no hidden agendas. Both adults and kids enjoyed this movie.
B000002JSN|5.0|I couldn't say enough good things about this release. If you are new to Zep, I would highly recommend picking this up as it has many of my favorites, \\"Ten Years Gone\\", \\"In the Light\\", \\"Wanton Song\\". They were known to be very experimental after their first few releses and Graffiti is stark example. I don't leave home without some kind of copy of it.
0385340990|5.0|This book is an absolute gem.  Should I be able to find others written in this easygoing, friendly manner, buying one per month MAY be enough.  The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society was an all too brief whiff of spring in an otherwise bleak Pennsylvania winter.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|We rented this and watched it with the whole family.  Then my daughter and I had to rent it again to watch the sing-along version when we had the house to ourselves.  We sang to every song and had a ball.  Who cares if there weren't professional singers!  It was a entertaining, quirky movie with ABBA songs.  What could be more fun than that.    We plan to buy the movie and watch it again and again and have more bonding time.
B001DJ7PR8|3.0|I used to be a huge fan of Woody Allen back in the Annie Hall days but that was a long time ago before he turned into a caricature of himself. I'd heard this was his best for years so I decided to give it a try.<br />It wasn't bad; lovely photography of Barcelona and four very attractive main characters providing ample eye candy. The plot is as simple as it is absurd. Vicky and Cristina come for two months to Barcelona and are propositioned by a handsome painter (Javie Bardem) who wants to sleep with them both. Cristina played by a Scarlett Johansson, is up for it but Vicky (Rebecca Hall), who is engaged to a boring American guy, is not. Nevertheless, after Christina comes down with a stomach complaint, it's Vicky who succumbs.<br />Later, Juan-Antonio's beautiful but disturbed ex-wife (Penelope Cruz) makes an appearance and a love triangle with Cristina develops. In the end, everyone emerges from the complications a little older but no wiser.<br />The problem I found is that every single character in the movie sounds and thinks like Woody Allen. Several of them even affect his nasal, self-satisfied yet anguished whine. This is a man of monumental ego who cannot imagine anyone else in the world but himself.<br />Ultimately, I found this movie mildly amusing but hugely pretentious. If that's damning it with faint praise, so be it.
B0013FDM7E|4.0|I have not read the novel, so the review of this movie stands on the cinema performance and story only, rather than if it is true to the novel. Will Smith continues to add depth and range to the characters he plays, and in this he is brilliant as an army scientist driven to find a cure for a virus that has mutated 500+ billion people. The loneliness reminded me of Castaway when Tom Hanks and \\"Wilson\\" became friends, as this man talks to mannequins and his dog, Sam, as he hunts during the day. When he finally meets another human, her words are \\"you're not very good with people anymore, are you?\\". There were times I was unsure of what was happening and the end puzzled me, but it was worth watching what might happen if the human condition changed and you alone could make the world right again.
B0019MLVEM|5.0|I saw this band on a \\"Live at Abbey Road\\" segment on the Sundance channel.  They are fantastic!  They performed \\"We Cry\\" and \\"A Man Who Won't Be Moved\\" and the songs just wouldn't get out of my brain.  I looked online and found some interviews and video's of this Irish Band and was hooked.  I love this CD and highly recommend it to anyone.
0060832819|5.0|I just discovered this author.  I loved this book.  Eyes are opened and lessons are learned.  Rules?  What rules?  Everything you learned and think is true and/or right may not be.  What a wonderful journey!
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|I never thought I would fall so deeply in love with a bit down spaceship like Serenity. JAJAJ. I feel privileged that I was able to find Serenity. Never thought to be called a Browncoat but now I would be honored to. If you have not seen the series you are missing out big time. I was one of those gorram people that did not expect much but now I stand happily corrected. Go buy the series and the movie! I think the dvd series is one of the most 5 star rated dvds on amazon if not the best. Its a series with a 8 grade in imdb and a B+ in yahoo movies and #5 on rotten tomatoes 50 best tv inspired movies. You wont just be entertained but you will feel like you found a new bunch of friends. If you liked the series and movie please recommend it to all your friends. Lets make a sequel possible. LOVE IS WHAT WILL KEEP SERENITY FLYING.
0553260111|5.0|Seriously...while reading the book the constant flow of things tinkled with interesting puzzle solving knowledge, the speed and rythem made it very entertaining and I felt my IQ is probably raised! One of the few books you don't want to put down at all even if you are getting late for work or dinner. Amazing how certain authors could do to their readers.    And then I went and saw the movie when it came out. Usually people say movies don't do justice to books. However, in this case I found movie to be as entertaining as the book though in its own way. The constant flow of thoughts from characters are of course missing but still the movie compensated it by keep all the scenes such that one could tell what might be going into the character's mind.    Overall, book and movies are both well done, though I understand this review is for the book alone : )
B000YAA68C|4.0|A high-strung young woman in love with her affable Irish husband realizes too late that she should have treasured her moments with him. His patient love reaches out beyond his untimely death to show her how to keep living, and to love again.
0060765380|4.0|I have been a JR fan for 10 years.  His Sigma series is by far the bets set of books I have ever read.  The Judas strain was a fantastic book.  Once again we are met with a fantastic group of enemy forces and the threat of a biological event that could destroy mankind.  I gave this one 4/5 because there were parts in the story that just lulled up and the villains in the book were almost annoying at times.      My biggest thumbs down was a scene where there is a phone call between Dr. Cummings and Painter Crowe where she is being forced to talk to Crowe to convince him she is safe, when in all actuality she is being held hostage.  So when Painter asks her if she is okay, she tries to drop a subtle hint, \\"You know how I get at that time of the month\\" and they chat some more and hangup.  Then Mr. Badguy says to Dr. Cummings I know what you were trying to do.  We have read your dossier and we know your cycle blah blah.  So basically she was trying to hint to Painter that she was not okay by telling him she was menstruating and he'd know it really wasn't that time of the month and he'd know something was truly wrong.  Okay this was too much of a stretch for me.  A)Women's cycles can never be counted on to be regular B) Most men don't want to know about their woman's cycle or even care about it C) Having a dossier include that type of information is just laughable.      Judas strain would have to be my least favorite of the sigma series, but it is still a fantastic read and I do highly recommend this book!
B001L5SXQG|5.0|This is definitely one of the best albums Bruce has released, it brought back Born to Run into a new generation. 5/5
B00004Y6NW|5.0|I was first exposed the this Dire Straits album in college (when is was actually out in vinyl).  I loved it then and I love it now.  The lyrics, along with the entire production of each song is just genius.
B0017CW5J4|4.0|This Blu-ray video is awesome. Both the image and audio are impressive. Almost like being ast the concert.
B0012QE4Q2|4.0|[[ASIN:B0012QE4Q2 The Other Boleyn Girl]]This movie may surprise you, if you have been watching the cable television series \\"The Tudors\\". It tells quite a different story of King Henry the VIII, and his wives. Eric Bana is very bland and uninteresting as the king, except at the moment when he turns his back on Mary Boleyn and his bastard son. Then, he finally shows some expression. Scarlet Johansson is excellent as Mary. Natalie Portman is great as Anne Boleyn, as equal to the task as Natalie Dormer on the series. I have to say the Jonathan Rhys Meyers makes a better Henry the VIII. The way the story plays out is interesting, and I will not spoil the ending. If you know the story of Henry the VIII, you know what happens to Anne Boleyn, anyway. It is a beautifully shot and costumed movie, and one worth watching.
B0001XAPZ6|4.0|Hayao Miyazaki's movies always has complex and interesting characters. His understanding of female characters in particular s multi faceted and complex. He greats the big bangs and noise, but he always interested ultimately how do people live in peace and grow as people.  This is why his moviesm are so different than others.
B001ASVXSE|5.0|Aún estoy disfrutando esta completísima colección de música de cámara y conciertos para violín del maestro David Oistrakh. Para todos los amantes de este solista esta antología es INDISPENSABLE. Puntos altos de esta caja: conciertos para violín de Khachaturian, Sibelius, Beethoven y Brahms. El sonido es más que satisfactorio considerando la antigüedad de algunas de las grabaciones, pero más importante es la calidad de la ejecución: extraordinaria. Sin duda Oistrakh es uno de los mejores exponentes en el arte de tocar el violín. Para mí, el mejor junto a Heifetz. Otro punto a considerar es la gran cantidad de discos de esta antología (¡17!) y su precio absolutamente conveniente. Es un deber tener esta colección de los trabajos de Oistrakh publicados por EMI. Entonces, a disfrutar...
B001ECQ75A|4.0|Animated films are right up my alley. I enjoy the camaraderie, spirit, and stick-to-itiveness that embody the characters the majority of the time. Bundle that with pitch perfect comedic timing and hijinks, it proves the recipe for a winner.    Po (Jack Black) is a giant panda who dreams of being the most \\"awesomely awesome\\" Kung-Fu master that ever walked the planet. Too bad for him he works in his father's (who happens to be a goose-classic) noodle shop. His heroes are the Furious Five: Mantis (Seth Rogen), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Viper (Lucy Liu), Crane (David Cross), and Tigress (Angelina Jolie). Their leader is Master Shifu (which is \\"master\\" in Chinese, so they're saying \\"master master\\" during the whole film, more laughter) and his master is Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim). The enemy of this motley crew is the leopard Tai Lung (Ian McShane), Shifu's adopted protégé.     In a twist of fate at the ceremony to name the Chosen One, Po literally falls into that role. Uncoordinated, forever hungry, and completely clueless to the intricacies of Kung-Fu, he manages to fit in with the gang except for Tigress and Shifu (a fall-out of my seat moment happened when Mantis was giving Po acupuncture and tweaked a facial nerve).     The ultimate showdown between Po and Tai Lung is fantastic. The action sequences (with \\"Matrix\\" slowdowns and stop-motion) were breathtaking (along with the accompanying backdrops). This is a great film, destined to join the hierarchy of great animated classics of the past. 4.5 stars!
B001ED7C58|5.0|This CD is amazing and will please just about any type of music fan. I hope that the follow-up movie can put out another fine soundtrack.  Good Luck topping this one!
0618918248|5.0|I am not going to make a full review because other readers have already made very good ones. Having been born a Catholic in a rather (at that time) backward European country (Spain) I had to fight my way out of religion, but it took no more than one year, when I was fifteen. In the last 46 years I have been an indifferent atheist. Also Spain has evolved into a much more liberal country where gays can get married and circumcision of inmigrant girls is strongly prosecuted. According to statistics about 31 % of people in Catalonia are non-believers and this increases to 50% if you only  count youngsters between 18 and 34 years old. Thus my indifference. I tended to think that choosing a religion was at the same level as choosing a political party or a soccer club to support. Nothing that can be discussed rationally, a matter of emotions. However, this book has awaken me a bit and I will become more belligerent from now on. When you have been educated in a certain faith you tend to think of others as more fanatical, but if you look at Christian and specially Catholic religion with new eyes you see it is also very fanatical.<br /><br />One think that, if I recall well, Dawkins does not dwell much on is the \\"miraculous\\" effect of confession. Isn't it another example of the absurdity of the rules of religion that one last minute \\"repentance\\" can bring Hitler into heaven and I can be condemned to ethernal hell for skipping one Sunday mass?  Yes, you will also become more belligerent after reading Dawkins's book. The best antidote of religion is science. Let us teach critical thinking and the scientific method in the schools.
B000YABIQ6|4.0|Sin duda es una serie hecha con suma seriedad, con personajes que se sienten reales y no simples maquetas. Más que capítulos individuales, Mad Men es un retrato de época con protagonistas complejos que viven verdaderos dramas individuales. Es un mundo competitivo (sobre todo el ámbito de la publicidad) en el que el éxito importa demasiado. En fin, es muy parecido a lo que sucede hoy día y quizás por eso el suceso que ha tenido esta serie. Para los que busquen capitulos unitarios con el esquema de presentación, desarrollo y descenlace, seguramente quedarán decepcionados. Mad Men se toma su tiempo en desarrollar sus múltiples tramas y no se ajusta al esquema tradicional de otras series. Por otra parte, es difícil encontrar un personaje que merezca la compasión del espectador, porque la serie opta por presentar las características más negativas de cada tipo humano. Asimismo, impresionante la cantidad de alcohol que beben todos los personajes y ni hablar de la cantidad de cigarrillos que se fuman por capítulo. Con Mad Men, tabacaleras y licores tienen publicidad gratis.    Perfectamente filmada y con una ambientación de época muy lograda, Mad Men es un aporte al género. El único punto en contra es que algunos capítulos exageran en mostrar los defectos de los personajes y poco en desarrollar la estructura dramática de la serie.
0375826726|4.0|I've read the previous two books of the Inheritance series and I find this was much superior in writing. It shows that the author put tremendous effort in researching this book.     The characters are very believable, and the dialogue between them is very well thought off and well written.    However, I did not find book 3 as exciting as the previous two. It contained more gory scenes with pretty gory details, but lacked in action. I really wanted to see more battles.    Book 3 reveals a lot of new secrets, such as the true identity of Eragon, and the hidden powers of the dragons.    I really enjoyed reading this book and the words flow easily. I guess now the agonizing thing is I'll have to wait for book 4!
B001HZ9ABM|5.0|My only previous reference to this album was \\"Melody Fair\\" and \\"First of May\\". As soon as I received my copy of this cd and listened to it, I was amazed. I immediately add it to my mp3. With this album the Bee Gees reached the pinacle of their 60's era. What came before was great (1st, Horizontal, Idea), but for Odessa I can't find the right adjective to describe it. It just incredible music, and they were still in their teens!    Unfortunately, this album went unnoticed by the vast majority of the public at the time. It's a shame because lots of these song could have been monstrous hits, and I am not exaggerating. 40 years later the public will have once again the chance to (re)discover this marvelous masterpeace. A must own. Highly recommended.
031606792X|5.0|Let me start with the fact that I read and I read a lot. Any genre, any year, any book. Yet, as with Harry Potter, I didn't want to give in to some sort of hype, just because it was a hype. Hence I ignored the Amazon bestseller's list for quite some time and read *around* the Twilight Saga.  But about a week ago, just starting my maternity leave and having nothing else to read I went to my local bookstore. Local has a different meaning as I live in Tokyo and most bookstores in the neighborhood only hold about 40 English titles in Fiction and I bought \\"Twilight\\" the first of the books, only to return to the bookstore about 5 hours later to buy the rest of the books up to Breaking Dawn.    Why? Because I couldn't stop, I was addicted, I wanted more. It was like opening a box of chocolates and not being able to stop eating. I read the whole series in 3 days. And then reread them again. And then went to the websites and read the unfinished copy of one of her books (Midnight Sun)-- yes I have never been known for my patience -- and reread all the books again to try and figure out what Edward was thinking in all of the conversations. I could not let go and even now I can't.    I am writing this while still being addicted, while my husband looks at me like I have slightly lost control of reality. While hoping that Stephenie will release all of the books once more from Edwards point of view, just to understand the world a bit better. I am writing this not just as a review to this book, but to the whole series.    I have read many of the comments of fans and while I understand the reasoning of people who don't understand some of the plot lines, to me they seem like how a real life sometimes goes as well: unexpected. Breaking Dawn ends in a way that makes everything perfect. There is still danger, there is still an unknown future and there is still so much that can be written about it. *SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER* Will Renesmee choose Jacob? We don't know this. She might see himlike her Jacob now, but isn't that the way we can look at cousin or bigger brother? Heck I know I did. Will the Volturi return? And what happens with that war? How will it be for Bella and Edward to have a daughter that will be the same ages as them.. unchanged? Imagine staying 18 forever and having a daughter that does the same? How will Bella be when her other family starts aging, her dad, her mother??   In short, I felt satisfied, I felt relieved that so many choices were made that I would make to if I was in Bella's shoes. I am 7 months at the moment and I would give my body, my life to this little NUDGER inside of me. I would try and stop anyone from inflicting any pain on the baby, but I would also understand it when there would be someone around to give her UNCONDITIONAL love... Jacob is no different than that image (I would probably want to strangle him as well). And well... Bella WAS prepared, she might have been one of the only ones in this world that WAS prepared for what she would have to suffer from. It was from Twilight, from her rare gift and from the way she already fit with Edward in that first look they gave each other a vampire.. just one that wasn't transformed yet. This was her destiny.    I am grateful to Stephenie Meyer for writing these books and also accepting the amount of negative reviews that she must have to go through. Anyone who has ever been criticized knows it is an unpleasant feeling and for her to have her work so hardly judged by (what I feel are unjustified \\"1\\") is just heartbreaking to me. There have rarely been 2 characters so alive for me as Bella and Edward have been for me. This review is meant for anyone who has friends and family out there that still haven't read this series. I have already ordered 5 copies as presents for several of my friends in this week and cannot wait to hear how they will be transformed and elated by reading this extraordinary love story.. one that I sincerely hope to hear more about from other perspectives!

B000XCZGV8|3.0|\\"Zodiac\\" had a couple of really good scare moments, but this movie is way too long and uneven in my opinion. Great performances all around especially by Jake Gyllenhal and Mark Ruffalo, good soundtrack, all come together in a slow-paced thriller that could have benefited from shortening. Overall, well worth at least renting.
045122499X|5.0|World Without End is as good as you would expect from such a gifted Author.  The story is full of triumph and tragedy, and the fortunes and misfortunes of fate.  It is a fast paced page turner that is hard to put down.  Don't let the length of the book scare you.  You will be reading the last page far too soon.

B000063DFQ|5.0|This is another one.... not sure how amazon found out I  have it, but since they  did... I love this cd, have ever since  I first bought it years ago.... 'Still life'  is probably one of my favorites of all time. I just hope they  start making music like this again one of these days. Definitely not for the faint of heart.
0060531053|5.0|Very complete and clear. It has taken me from my first simple homebrew, to now using grains and grain extract. Highly recomended
B00005JMXX|4.0|Action, adventure, quick thinking are all inclusive of this film starring Dennis Quaid, Because of the constant Burning of fossil fuels can only lead to one conclusion - weather gone ravenous.[[ASIN:B00005JMXX The Day After Tomorrow (Widescreen Edition)]]
B001DDBCUU|5.0|Even if you didn't follow the series this is a great movie! I actually bought the series AFTER I saw the movie in theaters. It really did make me laugh and make me cry! And perhaps every emotion in between. It's great for a night in with the girls, but my fiance didn't even mind watching it!
B001PPLIEQ|5.0|Continuing the pattern set with Casino Royale, the producers and director of Quantum of Solace have firmly established that this is not \\"the same old\\" James Bond. Thank god. The franchise had progressively gotten more and more stale with it's established routine of action sequences, beautiful women, and resolution in which Bond wins the day and saves the girl. Quibblers might not be happy with the fact that there is no complete resolution at the end - we still don't know much about Quantum or who's behind it - but this is similar to how Spectre was handled (albeit with far less suspense) in the earlier Bond films with Sean Connery. I didn't think they could possibly top Casino Royale; I stand corrected. Quantum is now my favorite of all of the Bond films, followed closely by Casino Royale and the best of the Connery/Moore flicks - Goldfinger, Dr. No and Live & Let Die.
B000IOM1YG|4.0|The third Alan Parsons Project album was kind of lost in the middle of his Sci-Fi progressive epic \\"I Robot\\" and the hits that started coming once he released \\"Eve.\\" It is one of the few APP albums to not notch a top 40 single. It's also the last of his truly old-school free-from FM Radio rock albums, playing heavily with the instrumentations and the concept. I'm so glad it has finally been remastered!<br /><br />For this album, it was the Pyramid Craze and the fascination with King Tut that informed the songs. The unconventional instrumentation of \\"In The Lap Of The Gods\\" was the last time Parsons would enter into that kind of symphonic lustre, and APP's trademark instrumental style makes two appearances with \\"Hyper Gamma Spaces\\" and \\"Voyager.\\" The terrific ballads drop in with \\"Shadow of a Lonely Man\\" and Colin Blunstone's well sung \\"The Eagle Will Rise Again.\\"<br /><br />The thematic leaning towards making monuments to yourself (\\"What Goes Up\\" and \\"You Can't Take it With You\\") make for intriguing, thoughtful songs, while the goofy \\"Pyramania\\" is the song that actually does fiddle around with the Pyramid theme (and may be the most humorous thing APP ever recorded) the most. But the main theme of the album, man's quest for immortality, is the over-riding purpose of the songs. Be it our desires and doubts toward be the biggest and most noticed (\\"If all things will fall, why build a miracle at all?\\") to our own refusal to acknowledge our folly (\\"The last thing of all that was on my mind was the close at the end of the show\\" from \\"Shadow of a Lonely Man\\"), this was the last Alan Parsons Project to really touch me emotionally. While future and more popular albums (\\"Eye in the Sky,\\" \\"Turn of a Friendly Card\\") are still good albums overall, they were more focused on a glossy and streamlined sound. \\"Pyramid\\" was a grandiose goodbye to the 70's, and still holds a special place in my CD collection.<br /><br />The bonus tracks are demos and guide collages, are are superfluous.
031606792X|5.0|When I first started this book, I was a little disappointed and unsure were or not it would live up to my very high expectations. I shouldn't have been so hasty to judge because this one was the best in the series hands down. Ms. Meyer is a wonderful story teller and writer. I almost wish the series hadn't ended because I could keep reading about Bella and Edward forever. The book gives you closure and leaves you panting for another chapter in the same breath. If you haven't read the Twilight series yet, you need to get all 4 books pronto and start.
B001LPWGE6|5.0|If you like the Bourne trilogy then the blu ray box set is a no brainer. For those who haven't seen them yet give it a try. This set comes highly reccomended. The Bourne movies are fast paced and action packed. The great thing is they remain original and set a new standard for action espionage films. Matt Damon is outstanding as the lead. The picture quality is great, 4/5 and the sound quality is show off material, 5/5. Must own!!!!
B000244FDW|5.0|This version usually comes out second with professional reviewers, but until I saw it, I didn't realize how really good it is. It is fairly faithful to the book, filmed on location, with well done period costumes and styling. The acting by in large may be just a tad too wooden, but not enough to detract from the timelessness of the story.    The casting in this version is spot on for many characters.  Particularly well cast are Elizabeth (though Keira Knightly is still my favorite Elizabeth), Mrs. Bennet, Lydia, Aunt and Uncle Gardner, Mr. Collins, Charlotte, and Lady Catherine. (The only reason I do not include Darcy is that everyone has their own Mr. Darcy and in my opinion there are as many Mr. Darcys as there are readers and/or viewers!)    Coming in at 265 minutes, this is a bit shorter than the Colin Firth [[ASIN:B00005MP58 Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E, 1996)]] production. It has some scenes deleted or greatly minimalized and some of the characters are not well developed.  However, overall, it is well done.    The central character in this version is definitely Elizabeth. Everything is shown from her exclusive viewpoint. It is not even easy to intuit the thinking and motivation of Darcy in particular, or other characters as well.       If you can have only one version of a tv presentation of P&P, I would say buy this one if you are more interested in seeing the Elizabeth as the guiding character but if you would like to see one where Darcy shares the spotlight, get the Colin Firth version.  The best choice:  GET BOTH!
B001JQTSG6|5.0|Raging Bull is an instant classic and is imo the best of the tandem of Scorsese and DeNiro's work. Now it's a must own blu ray. The picture quality is the best to be released for this film to this date and the sound quality is 4.5/5 stars. Hearing the score in HD is wondeful and this blu ray gives us a widescreen perspective. Some people may not like the man but you can't go wrong with watching this film in widescreen how it seems like it was meant to be. What an amazing emotional journey Raging Bull takes us through as we see all of Jake's demons as he tries to be the best of the best. A truly great charachter study of a controlling man struggling to reach his ideal. Joe Pesci is great as Jake's brother and Cathy Moriarty is beautiful. 5/5 and one of the top 15 films ever made. A true classic.
