B0064X7FVE|5.0|Fantastic weather channel. Keep e up to date on the weather. I am in a state which do get hurricanes and tarnados.
1781162646|5.0|Noone develops characters so quickly or enjoyably as Stephen King!  He evokes and easily-envisioned atmosphere, full of mystery, action, love, and loss. It's been awhile since I enjoyed one of King's books as thoroughly as this one and I highly recommend it!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|This movie was fun to watch. Action packed and with suspense. The cast was well chosen and the ending was great.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a dark story & the characters were not that likable but.....it hooks you fast & then you can't put it down!! Fast read!!! Loved it!
B000088E6D|3.0|I really expected a lot more,it is good but not great<br />Only one I have from this artist,will buy more?
B004SIP7QC|5.0|This has become one of my favorite Hollywoodized bioptics. Granted liberties are taken, however, the general tale remains true and the tender love story is beautifully crafted.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Love the alarm clock. I use it everyday and can depend on it waking me up. I recommend everyone to try it.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I have a pair of JVC HA-RX700 headphones, that have 50mm neodymium drivers in them, and my Iphone has a little trouble getting them very loud. I bought this thinking it would help it out some, and it worked about three times as well as I thought it would. I love the bass boost it has, and the battery life is execeptional. Worth every Penny.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|One thing I dislike is I just downloaded to Kindle Fire HD 7 and after several days it tells me it has an update and please install. After several installs and uninstalls and other options, I just downloaded and used as is. Frustrating to use resources and no resolve. I do like it however except for annoying reminder for update. Get an auto fix. Less grief!
B009FZHYKU|3.0|It feels they are just trying to get season over season just so they can make more money, because this is not like season 1 and 2 .... It takes 3 to 4 episodes to see something really happening...
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I love this game. I always used to play it on my laptop on a website. But,now that it's an app. I can play it on my kindle fire. For free !
B00DP3IESY|5.0|Much better that I thought it would be. Heard critics pan it but it looked too good to pass up. Great visuals and nice plot.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This App was great it really went with the slenderish theme and is the best game out there. Only one quick suggestion can you allow coloring in the game or in chapter 2 and please do 4-5 maps a game but no pressure ok thanks.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I have really enjoyed the first three books in the series and look forward to reading the next one to see what happens.  I feel like I know these families even though I'm not British.  Jeffrey Archer is a wonderful story teller.  His character development is excellent.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Me and my boys love this game. Not only are the minions the most adorable creatures ever, but the game is addictive.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like the size of the calculator which meets all my needs.  I even downloaded this app to my mother's Kindle because of the keyboard size and the simplicity of use.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Too glitch. takes too long to load.. crash and have to start all over again and like I said it takes too long for it to load, get boring fast
B00992CF6W|3.0|The game is awesome! No doubt about that, but I made a mistake by buying it from the app store, the updates come extremely late, it really sucks, I would say dont buy it from Amazon App store, buy from the play store is your not patient and want the updates when they come out
B0092C2X7U|5.0|Very fun. Beat all the levels and the game is not to hard or to easy.I don't see why there is so many bad reviews?
B00B10GYZ8|5.0|Having watched most of his movies, they did a fine job of portraying the couple behind the man.  Too bad it didn't play better in the theaters.  I guess you had to have to be old enough to have enjoyed his work.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|The dictionary is my favorite book.  I was elated to find this app.  I had one issue with this app which was immediately addressed and corrected.  I don't know what I would have done without this app because I use it constantly throughout the day.  It is simply the greatest thing going.  It's a valuable tool in my life.  I'm sure you'll find it invaluable as well.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The Good Wife has a very deceptive title. It really doesn't do the show justice. Everytime I want to stop and take a break from watching there is something in the last 5 minutes that gets me to watch another episode.
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|A extremley good game. I cant stop playing. Only problem is that it wont let me update or play without the update
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|The first few times, a novelty., but, after a short while of tapping away, you realize you are bored with it.
0385349947|5.0|Every woman should read it! Provides great perspective and was very motivating. It's making me rethink several things in both the business and personal aspects of my life.
B003L77G8I|5.0|I enjoy the banter among the forensic lab colleagues and the way they respect each other.  These writers are tops in my book.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|This book just secured my creative thoughts and I am very inspired. I loved it. I will read it several times more.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I love puzzles and trying to figure things out. I loved this game and i literally could not put down my kindle when i was playing it. I recommend it for anybody that likes brain teasers and fun puzzles.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Not bad for free, this is an addictive puzzle game even my 8yr old enjoyed, but limited playability with only 10 levels???
B007EECSFA|3.0|I love Kate Morton and have read all of her books. That being said I must say that her plot lines are starting to feel familiar. I found the book an entertaining read and if you haven't read any of her previous works I know you would enjoy it.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Note the weather and alarm clock apps are top shelf. Excellent visuals and useful features. Worth more than the paltry amount than they are charging.
B00BVMXBVG|5.0|I found that when I was watching this while it was on TV that I looked forward to this more than I was Doctor Who.  I decided that it teased the brain more and it kept me coming back each week to find out answers to my questions.
B0081336FO|5.0|Absolutely fantastic series.  Loved it!  Just wish there were more episodes!  And watching Free on Amazon Prime makes it even better!
B00571F26Y|5.0|lots to learn in this book.  The information is eye opening.  I am convinced that it will be worth a try to get control of my health issues.
B00A4EDAN6|5.0|Not a typical T&S album but still so amazing. :) i love it, it's a must have. Awesome to get the record, Cd and mp3 versions when purchased from amazon.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This little sharpener fits easily into my pocket, has a carbide and ceramic beveled sharpening tool and even a hone for serrated blades, it is simply awesome!
B005LAIH2M|5.0|A great fun time flick.  I don't know why it was so hated in reviews when it was in the theater.  It is not slated to be a cinematic classic, but a great movie all the same.
0312330537|5.0|one of the best novels i've ever read (and that's a ton!).. we can only hope for a sequel! FANTASTIC!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is very cute, fun and colorful. The rush concept goes hand in hand with the minions as well as the music. The best part is the gadgets, nice to see they included so many from the film. Very nice!!!
B00C3UUZVE|4.0|I love it but there should be more characters to get veggies for free. Other than that the app is great.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Best endless runner in my opinion, you can't argue with free and the ads aren't bad. I like that you slide to move rather than tilting like in temple run. The daily challenges keep me commingled back every day and challenging my friends keeps me playing.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|I've wanted to have this in an all in one box set.  I like the packaging and all of the extras that I didn't have with my old DVD versions of the movies.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I LOVED the series.  I watched all three seasons in two weeks, now can't wait for season 4 to begin.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I use it when I've forgotten to bring my Kindle along and I have extra time to read a book.
B0031RS2HC|1.0|A boys own story of violence and male ego. One of the worst books I have half read. Avoid this book if you like well written literature, interesting story lines or character development - it has none of them!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Awesome game. Love to play it and even my two year old is learning to play. Just wish you didn't have to buy extra chips.
B002T9H2ME|5.0|I was excited to see that this was on Blue-ray and loved to find that it was such a great price for Blue-Ray.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Very moving story.  A story of never ending love for a lost sibling.  A story set in the tragedy that is Afghanistan past and present.
B005G5PPGS|2.0|Was not for me!  Too many facts about Baseball it lost me.  Would be a great book for baseball buff.
B004X6PRO6|2.0|I CANNOT RELATE TO CHARACTERS.TO ME THIS IS A FATASAY NOVEL, ON THE LEVAL OF SCI FI. I BOUGHT IT BECAUSE  IT HAD WAON THE PULITZER.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|The best game I have got in a while. I have had it for a year and still play it.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|For some really stupid reason, I finally get this play.  This movie is terrific.  I loved it.  I saw the play in person but this movie made me understand and want to know more about the French July Revolution.
0443069522|5.0|Awesome book for students. Great pictures and explanations. Brief but deep. All my classmates use it for medical school, and it has been very useful.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I am currently watching Season 2 now and am  in love with this show!  Anyone who enjoyed Downton Abbey with enjoy this!
B00632HWOG|1.0|The old classic mail worked just fine.  It has now been over done by some idiot genious.  Since I can't get YAHOO MAIL CLASSIC.  I'll be dumping Yahoo.  I literally &#34;HATE&#34; the new yahoo!
B00005N6KG|1.0|I purchased this headphones from Pavillion Electronics via Amazon. The sound quality was terrible and was not expected from Sony. To make the matters worse, the seller did not want to cover the shipping for the return so I have to pay for the return shipping. Please don't buy anything which is not covered by Amazon return policy and I will never recommened this headphones; they don't even fit in your ear and hang lossely.<br />I wasted my money on return shipping.<br />I guess this product deserve less than 1 star. Very bad product. the sound quality and the looks of this headphones matches the one you can buy from wal-mart of some cheap store for $5 headphones. I still wonder why Sony manufactures this.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is a little fast-paced for my kids, but I sure love it! It is great to see the minions in action! The app itself is smooth and so far quirk free! :) I can't wait to get to the next level!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Its so entertaining and you can never get bored.I think I may be addicted!! my favorite thing about this app is that it has so many games all in one!!! FOR FREE! how could it get any better!! Haha it cant!
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|This is a movie I want to own.  Very interesting and beautifully done.  Cloud Atlas is definitely a movie I could watch many times without getting tired of it.  All of the actors involved did a first-rate job.  Amazing work.
B00AYJCEVK|5.0|Having not heard much of Darlene Zschech's work since Hillsong, I wasn't sure exactly what I was going to get, however I can truly say that this album is full of the authentic Spirit of God and has been a blessing to me. Definitely worth getting!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|i love this game because they put in two om noms and have other things like the chain in the first chapter that can only be cut with the blade. if you loved the other cut the ropes then you will love this one better. i have no idea why people are giving it terrible reviews. this is an addictive game and i suggest this to everyone and all ages but i do think younger people would enjoy this a little bit more. GET THIS GAME ITS AWESOME FOR EVERYONE!!!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think everybody should play this because it is another version of subway surf. I am also is addicted to this game this is why I want everybody to play this!
B008602KQI|4.0|I really enjoy this movie.  Wanted to go back to it before the next one came out.  Didn't feel a whole lot of chemistry between Peta and Katniss though.
038572179X|2.0|It's not to say that this was a bad novel, I just had higher expectations for it based on all the 5 star reviews I saw of it and the fact that it was on Time's 50 Greatest Novels of All Time list.  First off, it took forever to get going.  McEwan's descriptions are vivid, however they err on the side of being too lengthy and do nothing to propel the plot forward.  I kept reading to find out what Briony's \\"crime\\" was, only to be disappointed.  Also, was it supposed to be so obvious as to who the true rapist was?  I knew right away and kept thinking I was going to be wrong or was missing something.  The second part set in Dunkirk bored me although the descriptions were interesting from a historical perspective.  The third part, with the description of Briony as a wartime nurse was the most enjoyable of the book.  The last part seemed contrived, (why would someone be having a big shindig for a 77th birthday?) and fell flat (there never was any atonement by Briony for what she had done).  Overall, I wouldn't recommend this one, it's a long read that only leaves you feeling empty.
B005LAII44|5.0|We love anything with action at our house and this movie has plenty of it!  Bruce Willis and Dwayne Johnson in ONE movie!<br />That's a good time!
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|He never disappoints me.  Suspense, romance, sad, and happy. I couldn't put it down. I would recommend to everyone to read.
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|This is the third Hosseini book that I read and, like the first two, it did not disappoint. Some have said that a pattern was forming with his books but I was actually amused how this book seems to be interwoven with The Kite Runner. It may not be as moving as the first two, but it is heartwarming.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Amazing game. Must buy and I am hoping for more rooms.<br /> It's got everything you need in a suspenseful yet puzzling game. The music helps a lot
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I was on the fence about buying this, but then I heard you get 3 months of Netflix for new and existing customers - this made me buy it! I mean that would effectively make this an $11 unit plus tax on $35. But apparently google decided to pull the plug on that promotion. Well that was the thing that made this a no brainer, and since they got rid of that promotion, I will let other people be the beta testers.<br /><br />Besides, they say this thing works with chrome, but it doesn't appear to work with chrome for ios. At least I could find no confirmation that it works on chrome for ios.<br /><br /> Think I will buy a Android mini PC dongle from deal-extreme instead and pass on this thing...
B007IXWL2C|5.0|A must read to finish the trilogy. Would highly recommend this great book to any adult, this book contains mature content.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I go around and my friends tell me you should read wonder. I went to the bookstore and saw wonder I wasn't interested. My said we could buy a book on our kindle(finally) I bought wonder. My mom made me read it and by 20 percent I was hooked.<br /><br />  I was reading in the car, in the swing which just so you know is not like me.<br /><br />  R.J. Palacio hooked me big time.<br />  Wonder is such a good book and I recommend it to any  person at age ten. I liked how she wrote Wonder from different points of views. I didn't like the language. There were no really bad words just words I don't use.<br /><br />  I encourage you to read this WONDERful book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome, but I wish they would give me the update for elmacho's lab. Over all this game really good.
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|True to the Die Hard saga!  Fast pace, unexpected and intense action keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Like the previous Die Hard movies this will make you laugh as well as cheer for the good guy!  Had to watch it twice!
B005544TRQ|5.0|What more can I say trendy, spiffy, intriguing - I had to keep close captioning on so I didn't miss a word.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book may not be for everyone but trust me it is worth to read and find out. I was not into this book in the beginning chapters but by the end of the book I was already purchasing books 2 & 3.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|best game ever!!!!!  this game makes ya think but still super fun!!!  i hope to see many many more rooms!
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This was beautifully filmed and directed. The actors are amazing. Cudos go especially to the actor who portrayed Lucas. He was so believable that I had to remind myself that I was watching acting. Hard to watch at times because of the tragedy. But highly recommend.
B008673ZAQ|2.0|Very little development of characters. If you haven't read the other crossfire novels- no worries! Day summarizes the other two books in less than a chapter!
B00DC3DGSK|4.0|Blues singer-songwriter and guitarist legend Buddy Guy releases his double CD album titled 'Rhythm & Blues' (2 CDs, 21 songs). This is a great follow-up to his 2010 Grammy Award winning album 'Living Proof': it's an R 'n B style blues album with overall great compositions, wonderful guitar work as always as one would expect from one of the best blues guitarists of all time and an a-list of guest artists who enhance this CD.<br /><br />Disc 1 (11 tracks):this is my favourite disc of the 2 (I prefer these compositions, their song arrangements, guitar work and vocals). Stand-outs/gems/my favourites are \\"One Day Way\\" (wonderful melody and an incredible duet with country singer Keith Urban), \\"Justifyin'\\" (beautiful guitar work and melody), \\"What's Up With That Woman\\" (many men would sympathise with this well articulated non-stop unconsiderate spending by their women from time to time) and \\"What You Gonna Do About Me\\" (a great duet with blues singer Beth Hart better known for her collaborations with another blues maestro Joe Bonamassa). Not far off are the opening track \\"Best In Town\\" (great guitar work and saxophone combination), \\"I Go By Feel\\" (I love the melody), \\"Well I Done Got Over It\\", \\"The Devil's Daughter\\" (slow-tempo track), \\"Whiskey Ghost\\" (another slow-tempo track) and the jazzy \\"Rhythm Inner Groove\\". Okay track is the rocky \\"Messin' With The Kid\\" (featuring rock singer-songwriter Kid Rock).<br /><br />Disc 2 (10 tracks): overall sound of the disc is more rocky (blues rock) than Disc 1. Tracks \\"Too Damn Bad\\", \\"Never Gonna Change\\", \\"Blues Don't Care\\" (featuring blues maestro Gary Clark Jnr) & \\"Poison Ivy\\" have a 60s blues rock sound. The track \\"Evil Twin\\" features Aerosmith members Steven Tyler, Joe Perry and Brad Whitford.<br /><br />On overall, the 76 years old blues maestro Buddy Guy still has got it in this double CD release 'Rhythm & Blues'. A recommended CD listening.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I would 100% recommend this book to anyone, this is by far one of the best books Nicholas Sparks has written.
1250029465|5.0|I reviewed this book on Amazon UK after I read it last year.  Although the writing seems quite simple, the story will grab you, hold you, and make you gasp, laugh and cry.  As an English professor who reads industrial strength literature in several languages--this book can be read on different levels--the straightforward, feel-good level, the Dantesque level, and the level that encourages tremendous empathy for one's fellow human beings AND the animal friends we take so for granted.  Like stray dogs and cats that many people shoo away--and yet others feed and try to help, Mr. Bowen has lived like a stray.  When another stray calls forth that part of him that recognizes how much he is needed, he responds.  Some of us are lucky and don't need to live rough, fall onto very hard times and hit bottom to realize this, but some, like James Bowen need amazing grace--and in finding Bob, he has this in abundance. All we need is love and a little luck and understanding. After you finish this book (and wipe your eyes and blow your nose), you will want to find out how it all turned out, so go to Amazon UK and read the latest book The World According to Bob--and look forward to seeing James and Bob's story on the big screen one day.  Take a look at the YouTube videos of them taken by tourists who didn't even know they were witnessing a phenomenon. Emily Dickinson wrote that \\"hope is a thing with feathers that perches in the soul\\"--but in this case, hope is a cat with fur that perches on James Bowen's broad shoulders.
0785156593|5.0|This is the Greatest THANOS story ever told.  There are other Thanos VS ....  everyone stories, but this is the big one that realy put Thanos on the map for being the BADDEST villain in Marvel.  This is a must read for all you newbies to the Marvel movie craze.  But to get a persecptive you must also get Silver Surfer, rebirth of Thanos before you read this.  Its worth your time and money to read this excellant Jim Starlin work.
B007RQ6WCA|1.0|why drop box doesn't work seamlessly on the kindle is beyond me - going apple next time I purchase a device - this app is not useful at all
B00CDY6HW6|4.0|\\"We are very sorry, but the game can't check your license.  Please allow the network connection and restart the game.\\"<br /><br />The above is a message that has appeared at least twice on my device while my device was not connected to WiFi in the Amazon App Store free paid app of the day for July 29, 2013 which was Bunny Mania 2 HD from Crispy Software Development.  Had that message not appeared while using this app this game could have quite possibly earned a 5 star rating from me.<br /><br />I'll get back to my rating a bit later in this review.  But first I should mention that Bunny Mania 2 is a game similar to Lemmings where you must guide a bunch of bunnies through a course by digging holes, building bridges, and so on.  The game has nice graphics and the music while somewhat repetitive seems to fit the mood of the game well.<br /><br />What I like about this game is that it is similar to Open Sea! which I gave 5 stars in that there are new elements added to the game as you progress through different levels that keeps the game challenging and interesting.<br /><br />Now back to my reasons for giving this 4 stars instead of 5 stars.  I wanted to give this 4.5 stars since there were a few other minor issues besides the message above, but since I can't give half stars on an Amazon review and the other negatives were rather minor, I might have very well have rounded that rating up to 5 stars.  The other minor negatives are that the game seems slow at times (but there is a fast forward button to speed things up if you are getting somewhat impatient), the size in the App Storage part of the device is somewhat bigger than the norm at just over 45 megs, and that there is a minor bug that cuts off the bottom buttons when you go into the android menu at the bottom of a Kindle Fire, but it can be fixed by resetting the level you are on but it will cost you any progress on that level.<br /><br />But I have to deduct a whole star and give this only 4 stars instead of 5 stars since receiving a message like the one at the beginning of this review makes me suspicious that the app company is doing something they shouldn't be doing like invading your privacy by making a request like that one.<br /><br />So if I was rating the quality of the game itself, this would have been a 5 star rated game.  But because I try to include other factors such as ad placements, permissions, programming bugs, etc., I have to be fair and deduct a star for the above issues.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is an amazing book and is 100% worth the read, this author really knows how to keep her audience on their toes.
B000UX6THK|5.0|Well, it looks and sounds fantastic, I just wish there were commentaries.<br />Just as heady and lingering as it was in 1990, love that there are both versions of the pilot on it, and the extras were quite cool.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This is a great family movie.  Has an original storyline which is rare these days.  I would recommend this movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Omg i love this game so much! It's super fun and addictive! I love the vector battles! The costumes are awesome as well! Really entertaing and I highly reccomend it! :)
0345803485|2.0|This book is just disgusting. I usually like romance books but if youre not into bondage/ownership type stuff don't waste your time. First book that I've actually put down before I read the whole thing.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|I really liked the story line of this book but it wasn't as awesome as some of Nicholas Sparks other books in my opinion such as Safe Haven or The Last Song or The Notebook. But this book is still a must read!

0544002318|5.0|A fantastic read.  I was reluctant to read it at first because, while I am a long-distance runner, I'm a pretty average 5k, 10k, half-marathon, marathon kind of guy.  I had recently read Bill Rodgers' and Alberto Salazar's memoirs, and I was gripped by both their personal stories and their descriptions of some of their great marathon victories.  While I can't really relate to the mentality of an elite runner who is running to win a race, I have run marathons and can at least understand (and love) the event itself.  Ultra-marathons, on the other hand, are completely incomprehensible to me, so I figured that reading an ultra runner's account of his races wouldn't have the same level of interest for me.  On the contrary, Scott Jurek, though his humble and forthright account of the personal questions and little demons that drive him, made the event (and the people who run it) come alive for me.  It is, I think, a profoundly different mentality, but one that is not entirely alien to me.  His childhood, his relationship with his parents, his failing first marriage, his friendship with Dusty, his quest for a deeper meaning in life and in running - they are all part of the at times grueling, at times exhilirating experience of his life.  Finding the symmetry between his running and his living makes for exceptionally compelling reading.<br /><br />I was also very much moved by his quest to lead a natural life, through his running and through his eating.  I was a vegetarian for several years, then I slipped back into eating meat.  Reading Jurek's book made me go back to not eating meat, but more importantly, it helped make me much more conscious of the ethics of how and what we eat.  What and how we eat are not just things we do, it's who we are.  Scott Jurek makes that point in simple and profound ways in this book, but he always does it with humility.  He's not preaching, not proselytizing, not moralizing, just explaining how he has chosen to live his life and why.
B00B3L3RPA|4.0|I had to read this book for a school project and dreaded it but after the first chapter it was hard to pull away from the book. It's a must read.
B006O6F932|5.0|My daughter loves this school set.  It is great because it folds up and has a carry handle.  It also offers different opportunities for play as there are many rooms, front and back views as well.
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|This is a decent app and to those who are purchasing it as the free app of the day I would recommend it. As other reviewers have mentioned,  it takes only an hour to beat. Although the challenges have more steps, it is the same basic process - cover up parts you want to save and repaint the rest.<br /><br />It is pretty enjoyable for an hour but has no replay value.
B00CZAYNOC|1.0|Ill start out by saying im a huge FFDP fan and currently listen to and enjoy every album they produced before this one.<br />I was actually mad at how bad this album came out. I was real excited to hear they are releasing two albums this year. however, I guess they should have took the time to make a single album with good songs.<br /> I dont know how anyone can give this 5 stars but obviously, some people  are just die hard fans regardless of the sound. Fan or not, i tell it how it is.<br /><br />There is 14 songs 11 new songs and 3 remixes. Two of which were the worst songs ever to begin with. hardly a full album. Thanks guys.<br /><br />There is a couple decent songs, and some good melodies. After all, it is ffdp and the instrument sounds they usually produce are insane.<br />The lyrics were written by what sounds like an 8 year old that just learned how to curse. Ivans flow on so many of these songs is just bad. Im so upset with this album. Close to no catchy flows on this album.<br /><br />You, Burn MF, I am sin, dot your eyes, momma said knock you out and Diary of a deadman are just a disgrace to music. There is bands out there making awesome music and struggling to get an album put out, and ffdp puts out this half ass crap.<br /><br />I guess if you like when a lead singer repeats the word(s) \\"you\\" or \\" burn mf burn\\" 150 times in 3 minutes then you will like this.<br />Or how about a song were the lead singer literally talks all the way threw it (diary of a deadman) instead of actually using his talent.<br />were is the creativity? its a good instrumental too.. garbage song.<br />You guys went from making the best remix ever in \\"bad company\\" to remixing songs that were horrible in the 90s (momma said knock you out) and making them even worse today. whoever had that idea should be fired.<br /><br />The amazing guitar solos five finger always produced are not nearly as impressive as anything else they did in the past. Not to mention, they cut the time in half for each mid song guitar solo. In the past, even if the song wasnt that great, i would still listen to it just to hear 45 seconds of pure instrument madness. Not on this album, they are still good, but most of them are shorter than previous albums and some even come off as boring. It seems the reason they cut them off is so ivan can \\"talk\\" in the middle or just after the solo.<br /><br />Lift me up, anywhere but here, watch you bleed, the wrong side of heaven and the righteous side of hell and M.I.N.E (end this way)<br />are tolerable. Nothing that makes me want to listen to them over and over.<br />Anywhere but here or lift me up takes the best song on the album if i HAD to pick one.<br /><br />This is a disgrace, take your time and make a good album next time because now im sure the second volume of this is going to suck.<br />Rushed first grade lyrics, half ass solos (for five fingers skill) and nothing catchy make this album a bad seed.<br /><br />Maybe they should have took more time and listend to stone sours house of gold and bones part 1 & 2 that recently came out.<br />Classic double album with lots of attention to detail.<br />If you guys havent checked those out... stone sour fan or not.. there is no way to hate House of gold and bones 1 & 2.
B00422LESO|4.0|Pride and Prejudice is one of my all-time favorite books, and the Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle movie one of my favorite movies. I can totally understand this charcter's infatuation with Darcy/Firth, and disappointment in finding someone like him for herself. Cute premise, a retreat set up for ladies in the present to try to live, even for a short time, in Jane Austen's world. I enjoyed the book very much, and it's funny that I have just finished reading it when the movie made from it is just about to come out. I look forward to seeing how much the story is changed for the movie.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|Interesting movie with all of the repeated references &#34;here's looking at you kid&#34; in context. Characters were all pretty interesting.
0804115613|5.0|If you like the movie, you will LOVE the book! It is an easy read and wonderful! I really connected to the characters and it is very well written.  You will not be disappointed! WONDERFUL!
B00CC3KBAW|5.0|I am a big Amaranthe fan, and Elize Ryd really displays her true vocal talent in this Rock Opera. I bought this album for that reason, but very much enjoyed the male vocals and instrumental parts as well. There are some rocky spots with choruses and transitions(Such as in A World Without Us), but overall it is an excellent album. If you enjoy female-fronted metal, I suggest giving this a listen.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|My 4 1/2 year old loves it. It challenges him & keeps him entertained. Good fine motor skill development. The reload is a little slow & the prizes are hard to earn.
076781326X|5.0|Had the VHS version, glad to have the DVD .... Good Show ... Great cast,  I can now enjoy it over and over
0345803493|3.0|I did not read the book but Disappointed, I saved up my energy, changed my work shift because I thought I would be<br />having great sex every night :(<br />Unless you consider having sex 3 1/2 times within a month other than the full whole body act great?<br />There were times that my wife was so into the book that is all she wanted to do other than to assume the positions!<br />She said reading the book did not make her horny enough and not sure if she would be interested in watching to movie<br />but it would probably depend on who was in it.<br /><br />Maybe some other poor unfortunate sole will have better action than me :(!
B005FDXT32|5.0|Everyone knows this movie is excellent. My spouse and I live it. Glad we finally got it on blu-ray. Love it.
B00DC7NNAC|2.0|In 1966, I was 10 years old when I starred in a roller skating dance version of The Wizard of Oz as Dorothy we performed at one of the only Black rolling skating clubs in America (in Philadelphia, PA). Many decades later (and after The Wiz) I really loved the Broadway musical &#34;Wicked&#34; because it captured what I had come to understand about the story for more than 40 years: the enduring importance of women's relationships to each other and women's inherent power, both of the young and old.<br /><br />Changing the story to center it on rivalry between women for a man's attention is very, very uninteresting and oddly old fashioned.<br /><br />I liked the cinematography and always enjoy Rachel Weisz' performances no matter what.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love Subway Surfers and Despicable Me, so it's the perfect combo! It's so fun, and it flushes your battery down the toilet. I love it!
B00005KAQP|5.0|I replaced my VHS  version .... I love the adaptations of the Hymns, and, what a cast, it shows religion can be fun
B009WUAK2M|4.0|Good movie with a lot of laughs. A whole lot of guest appearances. Looking forward to the next one in the series.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|They had to can their lead singer to finally bring back the Queensryche of old.  New singer Todd LaTorre brings just enough of the old Tate sound to make this a blast from the past, while making it his own in the process.  New tracks like Vindication and Redemption remind me of the Empire days and covers of really old Ryche tracks like En Force and Prophecy are what we fans have been waiting years to hear.  I never thought I'd say this but I'm glad Tate is gone.  Bring on more of LaTorre's Queensryche!!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I have finished 2 of the Jack Reacher Books now, this one and One Shot.  Lee Child has created a great character and this was a perfect introductory novel for the character.  It had a lot of emphasis on detective work and not as much action as One Shot, which in some ways makes it better.  Pick it up and you will be done reading it in a no time at all!
B0087ZG7GQ|4.0|Cult favorite movie.  Under rated performances by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet.  Great Charlie Kaufman and Michael Gondry screenplay.  If you enjoy quirky romance movies, this is one for you.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I really enjoyed watching Homeland with my hubbie. The season finale was kind of crazy, but it does make you want to watch the next season.  Enjoy.
B000059HAI|5.0|Great movie, filmed by 2 directors one American and one Japanese. Each filmed their country side of the story. Very accurate.
0545265355|2.0|Product was as described and as requested but was damaged on arrival. Upon further inspection it appears as UPS damaged the box in shipping. Very little packing material used to secure the contents of the box. the box shows very minimal sings of corner dropping but the interior contents suffered significantly. This was for my girlfriend who is a book collector and it was very disappointing to open the books and have the case corner highly damaged, one book corner highly damaged and the middle book corner slightly damaged. I will be putting in a claim with UPS or requested a return or exchange if possible.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|This game is great but as soon as I started playing challenges just overwhelmed me. Once I turn a corner there's a vehicle right in front of me and I just don't have time to tilt my Kindle that quick. Even using the touch option control I can't move that quick. End of story, obstacles are too close.
B007N3206E|5.0|Very good movie.  Just a notch below Scorsese's classic gangster movies Goodfellas and the Departed.  Deniro and Pesci play characters that are very similar to their Goodfellas roles.  Great cinematography and soundtrack.  Very quotable.
B007PVHMCG|3.0|As described. Nice to play with but way too expensive. I'm glad I got this one but wouldn't buy similar one's unless the price came down.
B008Y6SLL2|3.0|No action , probably realistic. It was free with amazon prime. Movie paused a few times from the streaming , good picture quality.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Good version - first one I tried kept hanging, this one works smoothly. Too many ads, although can be skipped with one trap. Seem to disappear if you play a lot of games. Good app- best solitaire I have found.
1616550414|5.0|This book was very well detailed and has many pictures in it. It finally solved my wondering of how all of the games fit together in the series, as well as some other things. The book is very good quality in terms of the cover and the pages feeling almost like one of my yearbooks from high school. For the amount I paid for it I'm very pleased considering it was<br />$15 more at Barnes and Noble.
B00DAXXO98|5.0|House of Cards reminds me of the parable of a nursery rhyme: When he's good, he's very very good. And when he's bad he's even better! This is one of the best series I've ever watched. For news and political junkies, it's addictive.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey is the perfect wheeling-dealing congressman and Robin Wright is amazing as the political partner who understands what she signed up for.<br /><br />The glory, power, and nitty gritty of &#34;inside Washington&#34; makes for great television and leaves one hoping that our real elected officials are not behaving like this.
B008JEJPXM|4.0|As other reviewers have noted, Crocs sizing is off. I purchased these and a pair of the &#34;classic&#34; uni-sex Crocs for my wife and found both to be uniform in size and about a full size larger than the size number indicates. BUT these Crocs are lightweight and cling to the foot. Unlike off brand clogs we've owned these aren't slippery to the foot so while they are roomy they don't ride funny on the foot or cause irritation. The other brand of clogs shrank, especially when exposed to summer sunlight so it's possible these do the same and would account the generous sizing. The design of the sport clog is attractive and the extra sole support adds to the overall comfort. We chose the bright pink and found that the color is as vivid in real life as it was in the picture on the Amazon listing.
B000QI2ZWW|4.0|This is an adorable children's movie. Very funny and endearing characters and story line. There is also a very positive message about acceptance and taking care of the environment.
B000ID37SQ|3.0|I rented Scarface as research to accompany upcoming Breaking Bad season.  Helpful for some references.  Overall, movie was okay.  Slow at some parts in the beginning, but all the gore they talk about at the end.
B008Q09K2U|5.0|If you've read other Nelson DeMille &#34;John Corey&#34; novels then this one is at least as good as the others...they're all great!  It's also nice to see Corey's wife Kate in get in the mix of it all!!
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Ok,  so I should just convert the to decimal equivalent and use a standard calculator, but school was a long time ago.  EZ to use and you can convert the answer if need be.  Don't tell Mr. Silva.  Hey..at least I'm not counting on my fingers to get the answer.
0470901071|5.0|I had worked in networking for a couple years before I decided to get my CCNA. I briefly tried the Cisco Press books and although they had a lot of information, I think this one was much better. The objectives are clearly stated before each chapter and it is such an easy read. This is the only book I used to study and I easily passed.<br /><br />Everyone has their own method to study for exams so I'll tell you mine. I casually read through the book once. Then I read through it again paying particular attention to topics I didn't understand and went through the provided labs to solidify what I had read. Finally, I made my own flash cards with specific facts about protocols that I simply couldn't remember by simply reading through the material.<br /><br />Overall I thought the test was easy. My one recommendation would be to make sure you are good at subnetting. If not, practice until you are. There is no point in studying the rest until you are 100 percent.
B000FVRACK|5.0|It is a fantastic DVD of Rubinstein.  Who doesn't want to see him playing at his best?  Great DVD.  Highly recommended!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|My hubby and I love this series! Bought it for his birthday and the little stinker watched it without me!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is amazing. I think that even if we don't go through the same thing Charlie did we can all relate to some of the things he says. I will reread the book and watch the movie again and again. Recommends for everyone.
B009ZQP42E|5.0|This was a very funny movie and at the same time touching that the son so strongly wanted to continue the father's legacy. And the actor who played Lola did an exquisitely perfect job with the character. Wonderful, just wonderful! I recommend this highly.
B004UID2LC|3.0|After the update it started messing up a lot and most times my gallery wouldnt load...then i would delete it and i would be ok. I only download it if my fav youtuber posts a new video
B0064GKEXC|5.0|I have enjoyed every minute of it.  I don't care about technicalities.  i just love to see him playing and I lo ve learning more about his personality and character.  What a great pianist!
B0030T1NAO|5.0|Great Copy and still was Great Copy and still watch it today. Looking for more classic TV flicks from this era. The Film is well preserved.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Use your own music if you want, even a different selection for different times or days.  Set it up to whatever days and times you want and never worry if your alarm is set again if you like.  So many ways to customize this app that you will wonder how you ever suffered through standard jarring alarm clocks.
B00CL1SR7O|5.0|This is a great CD. Just as good as the first two, if not better. The songs are great and Big Time Rush is great.
0385493800|4.0|Enjoyed this story.  Wasn't expecting it to take me to the jungles of South America.  One of the better Grisham books.
0156711427|3.0|An acceptable used book. The pages are bent and the cover is worn. The cover is not the same as the picture, but that's okay.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|In both this novel and in 2001, Clarke describes a unique vision of the next leap in human evolution. Clarke's vision is not one of advancing biology or artificial mechanics, but one in which the human race no longer needs any kind of material vessel. As with much meaningful advancement, the transition is disorienting and painful. This vision left me with mixed emotions. What would the transition to the Overmind be like for the the young? What would having to stand by and watch a leap you cannot take part in do to you? Should the Overlords really envy us? Definitely a novel I will revisit.
B0013N7AD8|5.0|Impressed how quickly it arrived and how consistenly i was updated on the progress of my delivery. The package came in perfect condition, overall the box does feel kinda cheap but quality of the movies look great, loved how each blue ray has its own unique cover and how all of em perfectly fit in the box (considering ive seen some packages where the movies are just stuffed in the box)<br />Despite the cheap feel of the package everything else is great
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|upbeat and happy - modern - very unique - humorous - could be a future cult hit - for every girl at heart
B009Y6231U|5.0|You're units are not so obsolete as to not be able to learn new skills, an in Soldier... it's about learning to grow beyond your training.  Very exciting.
B004L0NGEC|5.0|I have used this app for quite some time and I love it! You can store and fix all your pics.
B005ZI2X4I|5.0|SNOW ALLIGATORS is a cute story for young children. Complete with pictures, this story will entertain children at bedtime or anytime!
B009WUAK2M|3.0|The action scenes were good, but the remainder of the movie was a bit flat.  Insufficient story development.  Jet Li departs very early.  But the action, effects and choreography were decent.
B000SEI230|3.0|A walk to Remember  was a bit boring, especially after reading some of Nicholas Sparks books which were filled with excitement and a desire to find out what was going to happen next..
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|This game is fun and creative, however it has many things locked and in order to unlock them you have to pay a over priced amount of money. It does have enough to keep you entertained for a while but then the fun is over and you have to pay. I would recommend getting this game if you don't get bored easily and you don't mind spending that much money.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love the show, can not wait for season 4 to start to see what happens to all the characters. January can't come too soon.
B004SKIPXW|5.0|Full of action and special effects.  If you like Nicolas Cage as I do this is a must have movie.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|This movie is very funny. It also shows you the pregnancy happens to everyone differently, but at the end you always deliver a blessing.
B0080SZ0V8|3.0|Directional puzzles do not respond quickly enough to complete. Otherwise, I enjoyed the challenge and diversity.<br />Some puzzles in other games become monotonous, so. this is refreshing.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|A must read for historical context and a greater understanding of the processes through which philosophy and belief become codified, communicated and marketed to the masses.
B007704HO6|5.0|If you're a pet lover, this is a must-read book.  Not only is it a lovely story about how two lost souls found each other, but it's an enlightening snapshot of what it's like to live on the streets.  More importantly, it invites the reader to think twice about treating the homeless as invisible, especially ones like James who accept help and work to improve their lives.  It would be appropriate for teenagers as a cautionary tale, as it describes James' days on heroin and how quickly he descended into homelessness.  It's not at all a downer though - in fact, the reader finishes the book with faith in humanity restored and proof that it's possible to turn desperate situations around completely.  I'm a bit of a Bob & James groupie since I've read the book - James is terrific to watch in interviews, and I'm really looking forward to the sequel release in the US.
B009NY43NY|4.0|This book does a nice job of ending the Sookie Stackhouse series. Sure it doesn't go above and beyond in terms of plot twists etc. but what do you expect at this point? I think the ending is predictable and you'd be a fool not to have guessed how it will end. If you have read the whole series up to this point then I don't see what all the fuss is about. Just enjoy the book!
B0083P1QUM|3.0|It's another Patricia Cornewell  Scarpetta novel. Isn't it time to bring in some new players. These folks have been there do it to many times. The most thrilling part was in the next to last chapter and it wasn't a cliff hanger.
B0099G4Y26|5.0|Other albums seem to sound much the same.  This one has a wider range allowing Pink to show her vocal skills.  It's not mind blowing but one of her best albums.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Recommended by a friend!  The cover story of the book did not even begin to describe what happens in this book and I wasn't even sure I wanted to read it.  A very touching and interesting story!  Hard to put down and an ending that was definitely not predictable.
B001XVD2Z0|5.0|One of the best plots in movie history.  Your mind gets continuously blown as the story unfolds.  Too bad the sequels weren't quite as good.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|As with ALL of John Grisham's books, this was AN AWESOME read! I read it in two days because I couldn't' wait to see how the plot evolved.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|When you stream media to this device Google calls the process Chromecasting. You can Chromecast from a Chrome browser by installing the Chromecast extenstion available for free on google site. I found the instruction very easy to follow and the device was installed in a couple of minutes.<br /><br />Chromecasting from my personal Iphone4s and my work phone Samsung Galaxy S4 was easy and quick. The video stream was uninterrupted and just plain smooth. I did try streaming unsupported sites such as hulu from several laptops in my home. I found when streaming these unsupported sites the streaming flows through your computer as opposed to Netflix which streams directly to the ChromeCast HDMI player. This means of the four laptops I tested from only our homes newest computer an HP Envy 15t running Windows 8 with an Intel Core I7 processor and 12gb of ram was able to stream video smoothly the rest of our older computers had varying degrees of success. So as expected the older the computer the worst the video stream but I want to reiterate this is not a problem on supported sites such as Netflix.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Format is bad and it freezes up a lot.  I would definitely not recommend this app.  This is a work in progress program.
159463176X|3.0|Khaled Hosseini is without question a master storyteller, and some of the stories in this novel rank right up there with his best.  Not surprisingly, these are the stories set in Afghanistan: stories of Roshi, Nabi, Timur and Idris, and especially Adel and his baba.  Other individual stories are also compelling, especially those set in California (which he obviously knows well), but as a whole, the book is too episodic to &#34;work.&#34;  The information about many other parts of the world tends to be superficial, the kind of information that one could gather as a very observant tourist.  Compared with 'The Kite Runner' and especially with 'A Thousand Splendid Suns,' which is a brilliant novel, this current one is a bit disappointing.
B009E3EY38|5.0|I wasn't a big Zeppelin fan growing up but the music in this set is great. Now I understand what all the fuss was about.
B004G0SJU8|5.0|This is a great movie.  It doesn't have the classic ending as most of the love movies.<br />Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan did an excellent performance
B006AZZPCM|4.0|This app does more than play YouTube videos.  It makes you forget about the old YouTube player that you have come to know and love.  Download this app as it does everything you loved about the original YouTube app and more!  I definitely recommend this program.<br /><br />Yug
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Super smart dialog with a great chemistry among the cast. Lots of twists and turns that keep you guessing. I would recommend this show to everyone.
B008X9Z4I8|3.0|This is an economical case.  The picture gives the illusion of it having an outside pocket but it doesn't.  It also doesn't unzip completely.  In other words, you can not unzip it completely and still use you Kindle while in the case.  It is merely a carrying/protective case for your Kindle when not in use.  For that purpose, it is sufficient; however, i wanted a case with which I wouldn't have to take the Kindle completely out to use.
B0086700CM|1.0|I saw many of my friend  playing this game and though seems fun I'll get it. Nope after a good 5 minutes o  playing and another 25 minutes of me bashing my head against the wall. I removed the app from my device an  hopefully from my memory.
B000FVQLQQ|5.0|Great actors. Heartbreaking story. Don't know if it's the production or the actors, or both, that carries you along into the reality of the unreality! Even after the movie is over there's an eerie feeling of wondering if what you &#34;saw&#34; was real or unreal!! The mind is a beautiful scarey thing!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is very addictive and thought producing when you think you have the angle....you don't....I really enjoy this great game
B0015UKX7E|4.0|Tripped over this when I was looking for bday presents for wife. She is a big fan and was very surprised.
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|Yesterday's app of the day was a game like this. It was a puzzle game. Like yesterday's app most puzzle games become  a guessing game in which you cross your fingers and hope you got it right. I am happy to say this Is not case. The game is simple make a white ball into the picture on the box. It gets harder and Harder. The one thing that mad this get 4 stars monster  of 5 is th  plungers I can't figure out what plunger does what to the object. I do say though get the app is worth your time and 99&cent;
0061801313|5.0|me and my 13 years cant put them down its like a race to get to the end. I just wanna know who did it
B006OAB2XO|4.0|All her current popular hits are on here, except for Vanessa, which is on another album. Overall, a decent purchase. Good for many times a listen.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|love the taunting and playing of this game.The characters are great and I love the Star Wars expansion as well.
B007PTJOV0|1.0|Leo's world is a game that tried to mimic Mario. Thee most known Nintendo game ever and you failed. Do you why? Well it's CAUSE YOU TRIED TO MIMIC MARIO!!! It's not even a close replica. People who love and at  loyal to Nintendo do not by this game. I will never place this game. It would take some  major changes to get me to try to play this game.
B0090SI582|5.0|A superhero movie that isn't setting up a franchise or deeply invested in continuing it is rare nowadays. The Wolverine, a mostly stand-alone film with a slow enough pace to feel like a solid film, is a nice throwback to those quaint days of yore, when times weren't so tough that movie studios felt pressured into creating a billion-dollar industry out of every film they created.<br /><br />The Wolverine takes its title character, the most popular X-Man, and puts him in Tokyo, Japan for a story-line that starts in Nagasaki, 1945, when the immortal Logan saves a Japanese soldier from the atomic bomb. The man offers to repay Logan in the present by taking away his immortality. Then the elderly soldier's son, hired archer, granddaughter, the granddaughter's adopted sister, and the granddaughter's fiance all turn out to have a part to play, and all fight Wolverine at some point. The plot is naturally over-complicated, but it's still fun, with good action scenes and locations. The stakes are solid: since it's a story with almost entirely new characters, any of them can die. Most of them do.<br /><br />One of the main villains, the Viper, is a woman with snake-like mutant abilities such as breathing poison and shedding her skin. Her motivations weren't very clear: she's working for the grandfather, but there isn't much of an explanation for why and how he found her specifically. Wolverine's loss of immortality is also a little suspect, as he still retains the ability to shrug off multiple bullet and stab wounds. Sure, it's because his power was only `suppressed' and it's plausible that the Viper's knowledge of biology was needed to help the grandfather's ailing health, but those are explanations designed to prop up the real reason, which is that both plot decisions lend to better action scenes.<br /><br />The tone of the film is dark, but humorously so, with Hugh Jackman giving his character the same sardonic, tough-guy attitude that is just like the comic book version ofWolverine. His character is still a lot of fun to watch, and the supporting characters, which include Rila Fukushima as Yukio, the female ninja who insists on acting as Wolverine's bodyguard.<br /><br />The film's credits scene is the most ridiculous, sequel-hooky one I've ever seen: Professor X and Magneto both make an appearance, despite barely being referenced in the entire film. I saw The Wolverine with a friend who had never seen any of the other five X-Man films before this one, and he was utterly confused to see Gandalf and Jean-Luc Picard show up. For those in the know, however, it just sets up the next film. It's very out of place in this film, but since it doesn't show up til the end, it doesn't ruin anything.<br /><br />The Wolverine is a fun movie, if you want a superhero film that is a little different from the rest of them. The director brings his own ideas to the film, much like Shane Black did with Iron Man 3. Hopefully, Marvel's films and Fox's X-Men films will continue to allow their directors to go in different directions with superheroes in the future, too. We need the variety.
0061733199|5.0|I've only gotten through a couple hundred pages or so... I can't believe how detailed this book is! I can't wait to read more!<br /><br />Definitely would love to meet this guy and learn first hand!
B001Q94TQA|5.0|This was a great purchase.  It came in sealed package and in record time.  We had seen the play in NY and loved it and wanted to catch the movie as well.  It was different, but terrific just the same.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book wants you to read the third. It is very well written and holds your interest, not one boring page!
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|Warm Bodies mashes up three different genres, or four, depending on how you count them. The Zombie Apocalypse, the Romantic Comedy, and Shakespeare are all combined, with Paranormal Romance as a fourth genre, if you didn't find that obvious from the fact that a zombie apocalypse and a romantic comedy have been shoehorned into a Romeo and Juliet story, presumably so that any seventh graders will feel that their English course had some worth after all. The ending is an important aspect to considers, so, spoilers to follow.<br />The ending is entirely different. Good ol' R&J both die, alone with half the cast, according to Bill Shakespeare's original script. This time around, not only do neither the zombie guy nor the human gal die a horrible permanent death,  but the zombie actually recovers from his zombification. It's a Hollywood ending as the happy couple and everyone that you may have pitied at any point in the film lives happily ever after.<br /><br />This modification of the story allows the entire film it's strongest element: theme of the healing power of human connection. Originally, the zombies are disconnected -- they seldom touch, they have shrunken zombie pupils, they eat brains in order to experience humanity once again for a few moments. The ones who completely give up hope peel off their faces and become 'bonies,\\" which are even worse, tougher zombies.<br /><br />The zombies' hearts start back up, symbolically spurred by the love connection between our two heroes, which proves that zombies can still connect without needing to eat brains. In the end, the zombies are redeemed, and they are connected once more. And, as a quick scenes towards the beginning points out, the whole zombie situation can be compared to the smart-phone-absorbed generation's lack of connection.<br /><br />This symbolism is great and all, but it runs alongside the plot, rather than constituting it or at least dovetailing with it. The actual plot is just driven by a few attacks fromthe bonies, which propel everyone to a final climax that never feels as fulfilling as the themes of the film. It would have been a better film if they had ignored the traditional Hollywood need for cardboard monsters in a zombie film, and relied both on the reveals of the importance of connection and on a little more satire of the teenage mindset (One particularly good line is something similar to \\"does anyone else feel the same?\\" A self-obsessed and wrong yet universal thought becomes a much more legitimate one when taken from a teenager's mind and stuck into a zombie's.<br />Ultimately, it's a fun concept, but the film could have been better. It's just of the cutesy, quaint variety. Nice acting from the zombie lead and his best zombie friend, though. It looks like they enjoyed it.
B004UID2LC|4.0|Was able to view and download videos. Would be better if also able to rate and comment. Overall though it works well and is an excellent product for a free appear.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I couldn't wait to watch each video! Excellent interesting story and plot. Really kept me wanting to watch more of the series.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I would have given it 5 stars but there is only 10 levels on the kindle.  This game  kept me busy for the last week wish there were more levels! Off to find other games like this!
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Cant beat the price on this ! this is a great gift or even for yourself ! I was very happy with the shipping time, price and quality!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It works like it should but when yr using another app, there's no pop ups that tell you you got a message, making it impossible to multitask without having to go back and check it every few minutes and interior what yr doing. UPDATE NEEDED
B004SKQAJI|3.0|The performance was good, but... the music was too loud,  you could'nt hear the dancers tap  as well as you could on Celtic Tiger or Feet of Flames.  Fair at best on this one .
B00127RAJY|4.0|It really works if you follow it. The highest level is harder than the others. SHe is a great trainer.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|My son and I like the game, but we don't like how long it takes to reload for another game.
B001ANSSDC|2.0|I'm very confused how anyone could enjoy this book! The style of writing was very adolescent, which I understand was partly to convey the main character's character, however it was soooooo annoying!<br /><br />If you've seen the movie, don't bother picking up this book to enjoy a deeper version of the movie (like a book/movie combo usually goes). They are drastically different!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie after reading the book, I think I'm anxious to get started on the second book now!  Jennifer Lawrence is such a great actress.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great game. will keep you entertained for a long time. the horses are beautiful and the graphics are well done.
B00DGNOMB6|5.0|Maggie Smith is absolutely wonderful as always.  The cast in this movie is like Who's Who of the English film and stage for the past fifty years or more.  The movie is fun and entertaining - its a hoot!
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Like all Bond films, there was never a lack of action. Far fetched as it is. Trust me, we have been to Istanbul and you can barely walk in the Spice Market or Grand Bazaar without bumping into someone or risk being taken for your wallet, so riding a motorcycle in and through it is impossible. Underlying story is well written. And of course, Adele's singing and the title song are teh BOMB!! I think Daniel Craig is probably, other than Sean Connery, the best actor ever to portray 007.
B005N09L5C|1.0|Sound quality very bad and story was not at all interesting or plausible for us. Very dull movie so turned in off midway through. .
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|I absolutely adore this movie. My younger brother who is a theater major came to visit during his Spring Break and we watched this with my little one. Her uncle was teary eyed by the end and I loved every minute of it. It is such a feel good movie that makes you reflect back on the essence of childhood.
B004SIPAJG|5.0|I have already burned out my VHS copy; hopefully the DVD version will last my lifetime! So many favourite scenes, I don't want to give it away.
B00CRS5HII|5.0|Was already a big Darius Rucker fan. His newest music has not disappointed.  Great music.  Listen to it all the time.
B00CB4ET0K|1.0|Must have wifi on to play properly game gets stuck at the store were they want money to upgrade guns
B0067R0APK|4.0|It's has more information available than the free version of AccuWeather. I'm still working may way through it. I travel by auto frequently and use this app to keep me abreast of any problem driving conditions.
B00DAMO7MM|5.0|Liked the combination of Mr tweedy and mavis. I remember the staples singers. Papa staples did a good job of training Mavis
B00992CF6W|5.0|Purchased for my kids, ages 6 & 9.  They are totally addicted and play it all the time.  They love that they can get into each other's worlds.
B00CP4RZIO|5.0|I'm currently still listening to this album for the first time around, and I can tell they went back to their Resurrection days, which is a very good thing.  They seem to be mixing some elements of every era, and right now I\\"m hearing even \\"Pass Out of Existence\\" touches.  I have to admit, I felt they kind of went astray with The Infection and got a little softer than normal, but so far, this album is making up for that.  The wait has no been disappointing and has been very well worth it so far.  This is definitely a power house album, and will kick your ears' ass!!  So far, I have loved every track on this album.  This album is just beyond incredible!!
B002QKZLZ6|4.0|While on the go on a plane, bus, train, etc. this carry case provides solid and dependable protection for your Voyager Pro/Pro+ headset while it is not in use.
B000NH7SZ0|1.0|the workmate that ordered this was obviously not paying enough attention.. but was a waste of time and $, though not something I can blame on the seller
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Just when you think they've shown all the twists and turns in the storyline, there's another episode that leaves you craving more.
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|To say the least, Five Finger Death Punch are on top of the world and are taking the metal world by storm!!  Ivan Moody had a lot of personal struggle through this one and was almost booted from the band.  But despite inner issues, EVERY track on this album is addicting to listen to.  It tripped me up on the track listing as three songs are done twice, but then I realized, the first ones were done by the band alone, the second set featured other artists.  FFDP just gets better and better with each album they make, and it's going to be quite tough to top this one. But it seems they will have no problem producing at least a few more masterpieces.  I doubt FFDP is going anywhere, any time soon!!  If you're a hard rock fan and a FFDP, this album is totally required to get!!
B008J05EL8|5.0|OfficeSuite Font Package downladed easily and was user friendly.  It is  easy to navigate around ans well as use olove it!
193700788X|4.0|I absolutely LOVED this series and had trouble putting the books down as each new one came out, however, I could put this one down.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book, but it was not as fabulous as her others.
B009RH973I|5.0|I love this lightweight case - looks wonderful and isn't too bulky.  Openings for charger, headphones, etc.  Love the pink!
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|I must admit after the FIRST time listening to it I hated. However, I just finished the whole album the second time and I must admit this album is pretty good. To me its on point with Late Registration in my opinion.  This is album is on Outkast Love below/speakerboxx level. Just listen and you will see.
B00D6B4PUG|5.0|eTab for Gmail (Kindle Tablet Edition) was easy to download and works perfectly on my kindle fire.  I had no problems with the installation
B008476HBM|5.0|Great service! Fast Shipping! The item arrived as promised and without delay. I will order again the future for sure!
B005MMZ63C|5.0|Enjoyed renting this classic and finding out why critics rave about it.  It's certainly an impressive movie.  I highly recommend seeing it.
B0070UFMOW|2.0|I've liked Fiio for quite some time, particularly their E7, but unfortunately, this particular headphone amp is not a good one. The biggest problem is that it has issues with properly locking on to incoming sample rates. It claims to have a proper lock, but listening reveals quite a bit of harmonic distortion, which is quite annoying (it gives a &#34;harsh&#34; sound to treble among other things). This happens on both USB and S/PDIF inputs. If you fiddle around with our source (like the sample rate settings in Windows) you can sometimes get it to clear up, but you shouldn't have to. The DAC should just work.<br /><br />A lesser, but still annoying, problem is that it STINKS when you take it out of the box. It smells strongly like methane, or other petroleum product. The box, the case, the unit itself, all smell very, very strongly. It takes a few days for it to dissipate, and the cloth carrying case required a wash before it was ok. Whatever manufacturing facility they are using, it is getting contaminants on the amp and its packaging.<br /><br />So do yourself a favor and give this one a miss. Fiio missed the mark hard here.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|was better when the weather came before points for this and junk about that. less intuative my local Tv channel app is better.
B00BHMF578|5.0|This is a great movie!  It's refreshing to see a movie that positively reflects an actual historical event instead of constant rehashing of the same, tired fiction.  The movie was well done, and very realistic.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Thai game gas it all. Unlockables, minions, i recomend thai game. It rules man in San it RULES TOTALLY. I LOVE THIS GAME TILL I DIE.
B000LXQVA4|5.0|We got this for our baby boy almost two months ago- he was getting so \\"kicky\\" all the time, that it was hard to hold on to him. This Jumperoo has been an absolute blessing! He LOVES it! I have the best photographs and video of him bouncing like crazy and giggling in it! The toys all seem to engage him well, the construction was easy, and the item seems to be very well made. It has had daily use for nearly two months, and I haven't witnessed any negative wear and tear. I do pull out the cloth chair several times a week to wash through the laundry, and again - no wear and tear at all. Highly recommend!
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|this is not a career book, advice book for women who want to advance their career etc etc this is just a book one reads to have a few laughs and it does just that. i really like Tina Fey. watched her movie too &#34;Admission&#34; and I liked her in that too
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The start video is fun, be prepared for multiple downloads. Very cute and has cool gadgets. The character and maps are great
B001BKG9RQ|5.0|The music was great the sound was super the shipping was fast and I would recommend this item to a friend.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I think minion rush is a awesome game to play better then temple run any day.I love despicable me and I am happy they came out with a game.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|unbelievable how bad the writing is. i think the book should be re-written by an actual writer.  nothing more to say
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|If you loved Fifty Shades and thought nothing you ever read again could top it, think again. This Crossfire Series is even more AMAZING then Fifty Shades of Grey.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I wish I could rate the movie 5 stars and this version of it zero. HD? I don't THINK so. It's not even close. It's worse than any standard definition DVD I own by a LOT. The quality is pathetic. The HD Glee episodes are really HD. I'm not sure why none of th movies I've started are truly in HD. I had to stop the movie, since the quality was so terrible.
1423136802|5.0|this series was soooo great im sad it's over but I will read again... Highly Recommended if you are ready for an adventure
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Handy to have when waiting for and appointment. Twelve more words needed to finish. Twelve more words needed to finish.
1572815108|5.0|I liked so much of this deck! Great print quality, good prints. Great Product! Hope learn fast read tarot cards using this deck!
B0080SZ0V8|3.0|Used on Kindle Fire HD 8.9&quot; the game is a mix of various puzzles, which needed to be solved to progress. I've attempted to get past level 3 Voodoo three times and the pins won't register properly on the right foot of the voodoo doll, regardless where, or in what order, I poke it! I restarted the enter game twice and although that changed the required pin positions, the right foot was still included and not working. Grr...<br />Fortunately, I got this game when it was app of the day, because I would be really perturbed if I had paid for it. Couldn't find answers for my dilemma on the Big Fish forums, and I didn't care enough to register an account in order to seek assistance.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|This is a great movie. Great cast, great chemistry, and lots of fun. Full of great action scenes as well as humor.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great game I love it great for passing time could be useful if you are bored often

B00ABLJ5NQ|5.0|I preordered &#34;Ocean...&#34; Shortly after having re-read American Gods, and then did my best to wait until it was vacation time to read it. It was a hard thing to put it done when I started, but thankfully it is a book I know I'll read many times in the years to come - can hardly wait for jr to be old enough to understand and enjoy it as well.<br /><br />It is by far my favorite Gaiman book, and the best &#34;modern&#34; fairy tale I've read or heard (Podcastle!) - it feels so magically real, the characters are believable and true to themselves, giving more than just archetypes and cut outs. The story plays out with a few twists, and especially the last two chapters give more than enough &#34;brainfood&#34; to keep you thinking about the book for the hours and days after putting it down.<br /><br />THE book for summer 2013.
B00AEFY66U|5.0|I had just been to see the 2013 version of the Great Gatsby and wanted to compare it to the older version.  Both were good but really liked this older version.
B002MG2ATY|4.0|He's on the grassy knoll, he's on the grassy knoll. I've loved this movie since it was released. Just a great historical movie.
0861714911|5.0|A perfect introduction for Buddhist studies! Found in Amazon at a very good price and received it before expected. Definitely a good purchase!
B004SBQGHS|4.0|My son got me this game originally, and I wasn't quite sure what to think of it, but after playing it for a while, it has become quite addicting.  Gotta have some fun for the old guys too!
B006S01GH2|5.0|Amelie, is a really sweet movie about a somewhat odd girl, who finds her true equal. Even though it's in French and has subtitles I got so into the movie to realize it.Good flick, i have watched it several times throughout the years, but in HD the color is even more amazing.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I loved this movie and have watched it over and over! It is so funny and quickly became one of my favorite movies!
B00006879E|5.0|As it wasn't for me, I do not feel comfortable to review it. To be true, I never heard it, bought for my brother...
B001BTG3OQ|4.0|This flash unit has amazing capabilities, but for the price I am a little disappointed with how fast it overheats when used in an environment that requires rapid captures.  It has a wonderful recycle time but that is negated by the fact that when used this way you will have to shut it down to cool off.
140006922X|3.0|I was excited to buy the book, the introduction and forward were very good, after that it went down hill and did not meet my hopes or expectations. On the positive side it had excellent foot notes which I enjoyed and followed up on investigating the sources.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I waited so long to read this book because it got so hyped up I figured it would never live up to it, but it was great! Literally the only thing wrong with this book is I couldn't put it down and didn't get enough sleep during the week I read it!
B005EVVESM|5.0|As it wasn't for me, I do not feel comfortable to review it. To be true, I never heard it, bought for my brother...
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This has been a been plus for my Kindle Fire it is working much faster again...Really Happy in Pa. and it was free.
B00622B3MY|5.0|I ordered the digital copy of this to watch on my kindle for my daughter.  It was a lifesaver to have on the airplane!
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|Perfect game to challenge yourselves while building brain power. This game is also great for those who like puzzles like suduko.  Fabulous game!
B000P2A256|5.0|As it wasn't for me, I do not feel comfortable to review it. To be true, I never heard it, bought for my brother...
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Wow! Gideon CROSS can take me over his knee anytime! Sylvia Day did an outstanding job with developing the plot and characters of this book!
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Definitely a good app, but it needs more guns, specifically the BAR M1918A2 and Mp-40. It also seems like the creators forgot the Pacific field of operations. There aren't any Japanese weapons at all. Some other good weapons to include would be the Bren, Panzerfaust, Sten, Lee-Enfield No.4,  and the M9A1 Bazooka. Still worth getting though, and worth the money.
B00CDT41RY|1.0|GRATUITOUS VIOLANCE.  THE DIRECTOR SHOULD GROW UP AND ALSO STOP ALL<br />THE BS HOLLYWOOD POLITICAL AGENDA.  I WOULD RATHER WATCH A GROWN UP<br />FILM.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is a great app and fun to play at all aged. The part I had trouble with was that it is not the most up to date version. I download the same game from Google Play Store and that version had more features and less bugs than this one.<br /><br />If you have the Google store available, I suggest getting it from there. It is still free and by the same publisher.<br /><br />One con of the game is, as many have complained, that initially it takes a long time to load. This only happens at the beginning when it first runs and then never again.<br /><br />Its like temple run for minions except more complex gameplay.
B00846REIS|5.0|My friends and I were reading the Fifty Shades SERIES and were thrilled to find a novel similar.  I am definitely a submissive of Mr. Cross! Great read.
B00BD62X14|5.0|dont speak a word of french, but love french music.  great cd with romantic and peppy songs, both.  try it, you'll like it !
B00CXX8KTA|5.0|This was really surprising to me. The band sounded tight and they have a vocalist that has a close to Lynott voice. Some might not like it because of that, but I really enjoyed listening to this whole recording. The bottom line is that if you like old school Thin Lizzy, you might want to check this out.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Totally addicted to this show! Love how they have their own issues but they still have a bond with each other.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|I would recommend this movie to an romantic personality.  the transition from the past to the present with James Garner and  Miss Rowlands was very well done.
B0099G3I96|3.0|I own all but one No Doubt album (greatest hits).  I've been a fan since Tragic Kingdom first hit.  Return of Saturn and Rock Steady saw a change in the band's style but were both still really good.  That hasn't necessarily carried over to Push And Shove.  I look for up tempo songs and this album seems to be lacking in that.  I can't even tell you what all the tracks are.  Over the years I've been able to sing along with every song on No Doubt's various albums.  The same can not be said of Push And Shove.<br /><br />So, it's good and all but not great.
159463176X|5.0|Well written.  Fits what is going on in the US and the world.  I plan on recommending it to my students to read.  Very educational.

B0094K1PW4|5.0|I watched this movie with my wife.  It was a great experience.  The suspense and sudden popups of the &#34;creature&#34; constantly made her jump and reach out for me.  Very good story all around.
B00CDXOXB4|5.0|Wonderful movie.  It had a great theme, and it made me cry.  I love to watch it with my family.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun and so friggin addictive! I literally play it every night before I go to bed.
B008Y1YFNU|5.0|Heard one track form this album and decided to take a chance on it.  The entire album is high-quality front to back. I was very impressed with the emotion and musicality on display. I love heavy melodic rock and this did not disappoint!
B005SHTXN0|5.0|My wife and I had never seen this movie.  Considering we actually live in Cincinnati this was hard to believe.  During our free Prime trial we finally checked this out since it was free.  It was a great character-driven story.  We both enjoyed the conversion of Cruise's character from a grade a price to a loving brother.  The stranger that was Raymond was and will always be his friend, the Rain Man.
B00CFA222M|5.0|I have always loved the fairys. I will put it up for my grandson. The color was great, and the giants were gross..Everything a little boy will love.

B00B4W8AIW|5.0|Heard one track form this album and decided to take a chance on it.  Not normally into screaming bands, but they balance that very well with heavy melodic moments that make the screaming make sense. I was very impressed with the raw emotion that I felt when I listened to it.I definitely like this lead singer better!
B00847KFDS|5.0|love love love john Fogerty and love this cd even more. All of the artists singing with him are great. thank you

B0052VUNHC|5.0|If you like quick romance novels, this book is for you.  This was a good quick read.  I enjoyed it.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I purchased this item the day it came out at 4 pm CST. My Chromecast just came in the mail today and I cannot find my free 3 months of Netflix code. Since I ordered this item before the deadline listed above I can't understand why my order didn't contain the Netflix code. If anyone can help me in solving this mystery I would be very appreciative.
B007FG9LIE|2.0|`Something isn't right.' -Blake Crouch, Pines.<br /><br />There are some novels that require a modicum of restraint on the part of the reviewer when it comes to critiquing them so as to avoid ruining an audience's enjoyment. For example, it's difficult to sum up Ken Kesey's brilliant `One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest' without hinting at that novel's denouement. The same is true for films such as Adrian Lynne's stylistic but flawed adaptation of Bruce Joel Ruben's screenplay for `Jacob's Ladder',  Shyamalan's `Sixth Sense' and even Alex Proyas' labyrinthine `Dark City', all of  which are dangerously prone to neat, mortifyingly brutal summations for lazy reviewers that can do nothing but detract from the works as a whole for the unaware viewer or reader.<br /><br />This is of course a review of a work of literature and I'm aware that in the opening paragraph I've listed more than a couple of examples of cinema fare to underscore a point of view but it's an observation that I feel is valid and one I'll return to later for entirely different reasons.<br /><br />Crouch begins his novel with a couple of quotes, one of which is from Joseph Heller's `Catch 22′ which sets up the tone, preparing the reader for the `suspicious' nature of what is to follow. The protagonist in Crouch's `Pines' is portrayed at the outset as a man very much out of sorts. He can't remember his name, has no id, no wallet on him and hasn't a clue as to how he has awoken, injured, next to a river in broad daylight . The opening works quickly to give you a sense of the character's confusion while neatly describing the town he finds himself in; Wayward Pines. Crouch writes of the place `...at most a mile across, and it sat in the middle of an amphitheater of stone, enclosed by cliff walls rising several thousand feet on every side and composed of red-banded rock.'.  As we follow our mystery surrogate through the small idyllic setting of the community with its `Victorian' housing it becomes increasinglyclear that, to some extent Crouch's `everyman' has something in common with a certain Frank L. Baum created  adventurer; one who similarly found herself baffled and persecuted by her unfamiliar surroundings.<br /><br />The brisk pace of the book is broken up by flashbacks of our hero, who, it appears remembers being caught up in a particularly harrowing episode during an offensive attack by U.S. Forces on an Al Qaeda group in Iraq. As our intrepid stranger slowly uncovers the truth about his own identity and his creepily realized surroundings- the area appears to have been designed as a disturbingly faithful homage to a Norman Rockwell-style milieu - Crouch sets about crafting a series of increasingly horrifying and disorienting events that propel the reader to the revelatory finish.<br /><br />While Crouch's book sports a bracing narrative, it's hamstrung by plot devices that are all too familiar to those with even a cursory knowledge of  the source ideas he's evidently enamoured of.  And this is where this review comes - almost - full circle. Some of the text reads very much like an embellished screenplay and suitably enough many of the ideas Crouch is playing with here have much more to do with his adoration of  the visual pop-culture medium than the literary; in particular television and film.<br /><br />However, it's Blake Crouch's coda that proves to be the novel's saving grace, though his conclusion is one that is mitigated somewhat by the preceding chapters with his reliance on intermittently threadbare prose, confused character motivation and repetitive diction. The instances of characters repeating variances of `something is wrong' or the writer describing our hero in various stages of `rage' do little but take the reader `out' of the book and become, frankly, annoying. There's a particularly poor internal monologue by our protagonist admonishing himself as he attempts to outrun an angry mob; `You're squandering your cushion of distance'  that is unintentionally hilarious and serves only to disrupt the tension.<br /><br />Overall a diverting tale, but one it could be argued would have benefited greatly from a little more outside editorial control. It's a work by an author who perhaps has allowed himself to over-indulge in a concept beholden to him at the expense of a much leaner and perhaps more disturbing read.<br /><br />Written by James Keen from Horror Novel Reviews.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|Great book. The way it's laid out keeps you constantly interested and engaged. Very good book. Guess I have to see the movie now.
B00005NB8K|5.0|Frequently I have wanted to take a trip down memory lane and this movie of the Doors filled the bill.  The sights, the scenes, the jargon, the music..... all bring me back to my youth...nostalgia time!
B003Y5RLR8|4.0|This compilation of various tour stops, including all the pro-Elvis commercialism and the incredible loyalty of long-time fans of the star, and the in-between concert interaction among Elvis and his Memphis crew is a once-in-a-lifetime cinematic peek behind the scenes of the larger-than-life legend, showing him in his full range of human emotions--nervous, scared with stage-fright, boisterous, etc.  It's such an intense viewing treat, you only wish the film quality and camera work was better--but still, a treat worth sampling just to be behind the scenes with Elvis on tour!!
B009WUAK2M|1.0|I like action pics but after the first 15 minutes there couldn't have been anyine LEFT to kill..so I stopped watching!  Simply awful sequel!
B0056CUZRA|5.0|What a great read. I absolutely love Follett...totally engaging, the scenes are set so well, the characters so well described. I really enjoyed this book.
B007MDB71O|5.0|This film met and exceeded my expectations in every way.  Although not a pure descendant of the books, the storyline, world creation and cinematography, and characters are very representative of the original stories. The main characters are engaging and easy on the eyes. The movie definitely captures the combination of action, suspense and romance and elevates the film to epic proportions.  I would recommend this movie for family viewing as the violence is not graphic and serves the story.  Hopefully, enough people can stir Disney to make a sequel to this great movie; and market it properly.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Gabriel Macht is amazing in this series. And I've been a Gina Torres fan since her Firefly days. Stories are wonderful.
B00993I6D2|1.0|I was struglging getting into the book and i now know I will not be finishing it... Sorry not for me I need a faster paced book
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Really well written, keep me intrigued right till the end. The characters were interesting, and kept me interested to find the conclusion of the tangled web....
B0095P33IW|4.0|This was a fun movie to watch at home; a little bit of humor mixed with a fair bit of action.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This novel is based on true events that took place in Americn history. It is written from the point of view of the memories of an old woman. I couldn't put it down, and I'm not an avid reader.
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|The Disney people always make magic and fantasy go hand-in-hand for family entertainment. However I am concerned over the high prices for 3-D discs and see No reason to MAKE  customers buy 4 separate discs to run up the cost of everything for ONE title. Price points need to change to continue all can afford their favorite movie in 3-D!
B001RJTFP4|4.0|Delivered on time in good condition. Everytime it would come on television I made a point of watching, but unless it came on a premium cable channel, which it rarely does, I had to put up with commercials and cuts. It was a good price, so I decided to add it to my movie collection.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I like my little pony because it is a simulation game and has ponies like Applejack.<br />I also like stopping nightmare moon! I can't wait for a new one to come out. I am saving up for Splitfire!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|It took me a while to get into DA. But after season 1 I was hooked! Sad to know I won't get Mary and Mathew again tho'. Hope she finds love in season 4.
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|I have read this book twice. Has a lot of useful information for anyone in the business world. From a lowly graphic designer to a CEO, you need to read this book.
B007BGQFTQ|5.0|These books immediately got and held my attention. I am wary of books featuring vampires and werewolves, but these books were fresh and completely entertaining. I'd recommend them to anyone who'd like an enchanting, romantic,  thrilling, steampunk-esque adventure!
B0026IUXO2|5.0|Amazing story of Queen Elizabeth's rise to power in spite of all the obstacles she faced in securing her throne and the stability of her realm.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|That was an awesome adventure. Cannot wait to experience more levels. I kept a pen and paper handy. I got really excited when the door would open. Very good job. Hats off to the world bees.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Could not put the book down!  Nothing like the movie.  Loved the different perspectives.  Wish they made the movie more like the book
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I'm only on level 5 and I'm in love with it really enjoying it so far it can be hard but its fun to figure<br />out
B003Y059EK|3.0|This movie is nothing like the original Wizard of Oz movie.  I've never read the Wizard of Oz books, but I've heard that Return to Oz (this movie) is much closer to the books than even the original movie.  That's why I say this movie may be good for the fans of the book/s. This movie is dark and a bit freaky.  I can't recall a whole lot of happy, joyous feeling while watching it.
B005JJCMN0|4.0|Kind of difficult to understand. Would have to watch a few more times to try to get the meaning of it.
B0089LOG02|5.0|So much more. This is a fabulous book about pain, joy, loss, and recovery. Rooted in pain, this book elevates the reader to a loving world where we all, really, are one. I highly recommend this book.
B005PK56TA|5.0|I just finished the season and am waiting on the edge of my seat for season 2 to be added to Prime Instant Video.  The show is so addicting, you'll have a hard time watching just one episode at a time.  Great acting, too.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I've always thought that Silk was a little clunky and it frustrated me that there was no official YouTube app like real android and ios. I've tried the other free YouTube apps and never really liked them much. This you can use as a regular YouTube player, with the download button off to the side and ready when you need it. I prefer also to use Mobo player as my downloaded video player, as you can sort and do all kinds of stuff with the downloaded videos from this app.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|I had heard that this was a good movie so I decided to rent it. It is not what I expected. Not sure whois  the most dysfunctional person in the movie. Kinda reminded me of the Redskins and Steelers fans that I know.
B0085OEA9U|4.0|I found the acting to be superb, the story line somewhat different, an unexpected ending. Certainly a good use of my time to watch it.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Fascinating book. A must read for all those who want Business and IT to have a functional marriage. We have been hearing a lot about the dysfunctional marriage between IT and Business. This is a book that all IT executives and key business leaders must read. Enjoyed reading this book every bit. Planning to buy a print edition to gift to some of my team members.<br /><br />Awesome and easy reading.
B005LAII44|5.0|NOW THE ONLY REASON I ACTUALLY ENJOYED THIS MOVIE WAS BECAUSE OF BRUCE WILLIS AND DWAYNE JOHNSON WORKING TOGETHER FOR THE FIRST TIME. IF IT WAS NOT FOR BRUCE PLAYING THE ROLE OF RETIRED GENERAL JOE AND DWAYNE JOHNSON AS ROADBLOCK, LEADER OF THE JOES, THIS WOULD ONLY BE JUST SOME PLAIN ACTION FLICK. TRUTH IS THAT WHENEVER REAL ACTION HEROES ENTER THE SCENE THE STORY BECOMES MORE WORTHWHILE AND REALLY INTENSE TO WATCH. DOESN'T MATTER IF BRUCE HAD A CAMEO ROLE, AT LEAST HIS PERFORMANCE GOT THE BEST OF HIM AND HE FILLED THOSE LITTLE GAPS WITH EXHILARATING BLOW-OUT ACTION ALONGSIDE DWAYNE JOHNSON OF COURSE.<br /><br />THESE GUYS KNOW HOW TO RETALIATE!!!
B0049VVE7Y|5.0|Walking Dead quickly became one of my favorite shows. Its truly AMAZING!!!!! I can't wait for Season 4. I'm even reading the books now and buying the McFarlane Toys.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I read it when it first came out. When I moved, I misplaced it, so when I wanted to re read it, I got the kindle version. I'm slowly moving  my library to my kindle. The book is all too believable based onits format. You feel like the events actually happened
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I really enjoy trying to figure out the  best way to draw these lines.  It's entertaining.  It is really challenging when you get to the levels of more boxes and more colors.
B00D6B4PUG|5.0|This really is what I was looking for as far as Gmail goes.  Just like my computer not some chopped up phone version.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|loved this movie - don't how how we missed it but glad we finally saw it - looking forward to the sequel in the theater!
B0062LU85S|5.0|I loved this movie and the DVD and packaging was made well. Great overall product especially for the big Twilight fans.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love the huge buttons and simplicity of this app. Gets the job done and user friendly. I recommend it to anyone.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Fun game nice graphics and the interface is descent. Challenges are not too hard to begin with. Over all worth playing.
B008Q00BOQ|4.0|Tom makes a great IMF agent. Great franchise. Story line is very good.  Needs a cast of permanent co stars, IMF team members not just Luther.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Fun game. It seems to be well thought out and easy to play. I hope the plot gets more interesting as the game goes on.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|This is by far the best service I have received .. The movie was in my hands within days and the quality was new . I would recommend this to any Harry Potter fan needing this movie .<br />Thank You<br />John
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What a wonderful series!  enjoyed it very much and looking forward to next season! Sometimes its nice seeing how others live!
B00571F26Y|3.0|I bought it, read it, saw the guy on Oz, and my conclusion is he's a snake oil quack.<br /><br />Most of what he says is patently untrue!<br />Like Oz he wants to be rich and famous and like Oz will lie,say anything and it's snake oil all the way!!!!!<br /><br />The only real low carb plan worth doing or even discussing is Adkins.<br />His plan works and he tells you why...and he's honest.<br /><br />This book in not only a waste of time but it is an insult to human intelligence!!!!!
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|well I have to say its ok but it will get really boring after about 3 min. so unless your really interested in boredom don't get this app!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|SUCH AN AMAZING BOOK....JUST AMAZING!!!! Going to read them all again!!! I highly recommend this book to everyone way better story line then twilight
B003H6KRIE|5.0|Love this set. It's a very nice addition to our blueray collection. Couldn't be happier with the Bourne series. Thanks again Amazon : )
034553154X|5.0|My new calendar came in great condition! I love the anime for A Song of Ice and Fire. I will purchase the 2014 edition too!
B009NQZVKG|4.0|I liked the fusion of mystery and future into one book. The author was very knowledgeable about both subject areas and blended his story well.
B0012QVJXS|5.0|Cheesy graphics in comparison of what we have today but it had great story with solid acting. I saw it when it originally came out and was impressed that it could still capture my kid's attention even with a long run time.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|If you can appreciate the art of natural dialogue and quirky &#34;romance&#34; then you'd love this movie as much as I did.<br /><br />Before Sunrise, the prequel, is just as awesome and lengthy in random topic conversations. But Before Sunset was so much more real and mature. The main characters have grown up and don't talk about the same naive, idealistic conversations. When they run into each other they REALLY cherish every moment and the spark is instantly rekindled.<br /><br />The ending is so pure and well-just watch it, okay?
B005K17RU0|1.0|This used to be my favorite weather app. After newest update it is now unuseable. Look for a different app now, this one does not work! 0 stars!
0385341008|5.0|As a former bookstore owner, I've poured through many Book Club selections over the years, but this book has been the hands-down favorite of all my book club buddies.  The story is grounded in History that we all THOUGHT we knew, and it reveals things we NEVER knew.  The format of using letters to reveal the story is similar to 84 Charing Cross Road-- some may find that distracting, but I liked it.  The heart-warming story in the book is mirrored in the heart-tugging story of the authors and how the book came to be published.  A GREAT choice for Book Club Lovers.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I couldn't put it down! Nor can I get it out of my mind now. I want to turn back to page one and start all over again. Indescribable is the only way to describe it. A fabulous story!
B004UID2LC|5.0|It's works perfectly, sure it glitches sometimes but big deal...every app does. I can find any song/video I'm looking for. It's easy to use and every thing's right there. It's the best app to download all the latest songs or videos to your tablet. It works great for my kindle fire HD.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Written from point of view of a well educated and experienced neurosurgeon who formally believed NDE's were just caused from brain unconsciousness. After his own NDE he now has full faith in God.
0061537969|5.0|This book was a gift I received from an old friend and fellow animal & book lover.  I could NOT put it down, once I started reading.  I LOVE the device of telling a story from the animal's point of view. So many books about animal heroes are cloying and/or manipulative-- Not this one--  If you don't lose your heart to Enzo, check with a Cardiologist!  You will NEVER look at your pet in the same way after reading this book-- You may never look at LIFE the same way, either!  ENZO RULES!!
B0024DF9MU|5.0|I love this story! I could watch it a hundred times. Jennifer Goodwin is so cute and loveable! It is hard to imagine that I could find someone if someone that cute and nice struggles :)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is way better than temple run one and temple run too. Recommend this to any who likes games like this. Fun way to kill time too.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The best book I have ever read. I could not keep my eyes off of it. I loved it so much!
B00D7JGL36|5.0|OMG this album is AWESOME!! It's old time country written and previously recorded by Merle and Buck, redone by two of the very best, Vince Gill and Paul Franklin! Old timers will LOVE this new album and the younger generation can sure learn TRUE COUNTRY by getting this album! It just came out today and I'm already hooked! You won't be sorry!
B009NQZVKG|5.0|As usual, great adventure, history, science and lots of action. I love all the Sigma Force Novels, hope more are coming out soon.
B00867GJYK|5.0|Just keep swimming .. oh lordy this is one of my fave disney movies once again when they come to visit . we have an array of funny good clean movies
B005IQZB14|5.0|I loved it from beginning to end.  This poor young girl wants a family so badly and she copes despite all her aborted efforts but her mother's death has long term devastating effects on her, her marriage and her feelings of low self esteem.  The adventure she embarks on is momentous, her efforts are heroic and her determination is unfailing.  She basically rebuilds herself literally one step at a time over the course of 1100+ miles.  The book was truly inspiring.
B00D41AJ7G|2.0|This game is ridiculously easy. Only 2-3 levels made me stop and think. It is done and over with in less than a day. The concept is great but why $0.99?  I'm grateful I got it during the free app of the day because I'd never pay a dime for something this simple and short played.
B00B3EJ292|5.0|i really like this movie even though it was not in english but was captioned in english ...you still got the story line...it kept you in an emtional story rollercoaster...you were up then you went down...but i sincerely liked the movie...i know it won or was nominated for  a reward from the movie  industry...not sure what  award was given i am not up on that ...i just know i like this movie a lot.
B00DIFARQ6|1.0|I had a wireless connection and program did not even download. Tried to redownload and I was told that I had it. Ended up deleting and forgetting about it.
B004TI1WME|5.0|Comes in handy. Used for a math class, when I lost my calculator and need something more than what the phone came with.
1423140591|5.0|This series continues to please.  I really enjoyed the expansion of The Lost Hero.  I'm now looking for the next follow-up..
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|Found this to be way more gory than I expected. Overall found the movie ok. Wouldn't watch again, but don't regret the time I spent watching.
B005LAIII0|5.0|I read the book and loved it and had high hopes for the film. This exceeded my expectations. the cinematography was outstanding and they kept to the story in the book quite well.  Great story, great movie. I highly recommend!
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Good game, my son loves it! It's simple and easy to play. He is six, and plays it all the time.
1423113462|5.0|This new series pleased me so much, I purchased each of the following as soon as I found them.  Thanks Amazon for having these in your catalog.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved playing this game! It was addicting, I couldn't stop playing till I had gone through all the levels. I want more!
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Finally a story about a strong, confident young woman who is not depending on a prince on a white charger.  Merida is a young woman coming of age and it addresses those Mother/daugter conflicts in a good way.  It also highlights the love of family and how it can conquer problems.  My 13 year old, 8 year old and 4 year old girls loved it (and so did I). Nice to see a young lass who grows to a good young woman
B000F8O35U|5.0|For a hard to find movie about to go back into the Disney Vault got it at a reasonable price, movie is great.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|One of the best law drama , no intense court room , entertaining and not hard to follow ,  second to the good wife
B005LAIGN2|5.0|I glad I found it at a very good price because I'm getting my monies worth and more thank you very much
B0094K1PW4|4.0|I can sum up the movie by saying Goonies meets Transformers. I enjoyed both of those movies and I enjoyed this movie too.
B009KKLQKO|5.0|I love this Beach Boys Live in Concert: 50th Anniversary<br /><br />I like everyone of the songs that this Beach Boys Live in Concert: 50th Anniversary DVD
B007Y36K46|5.0|Och ohem och tay wyees... Barsoom!!!<br />Make it happen, Awesome movie...<br />Just too bad that this movie was not been properly promoted,<br />Its a great movie that deserve a sequel of the original castings.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Way better writing than the Grey series. More realistic even though it's just a fantasy. This damaged man finally opens up his heart and soul to this woman.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Just one click on the icon, I have a real calculator at hand. Simple functions but easy to use daily.
B00DP3IESY|5.0|I like anything with Morgan Freeman and this doesn't disappoint ! Plenty of action and looks & sounds fabulous on 1080HD with Dolby surround!
0446572985|3.0|This was my second book by David Baldacci.  Although this book was generally a decent read, I was annoyed (if that is the proper word) at how the plot twists were so contrived.  Defections and corruption at every level of government (talking here about non-elected officials).  I am a fan of Lee Child / Jack Reacher type of writing but with this Innocent book, each profound plot twist is more hokey than the ones before it.  As a line from a favorite movie of mine says, \\"Are you sure you're not making this up as you go along?\\"
B00DHNB5CY|4.0|They did a great job of giving the original movie nods throughout, while not being married to it's storyline. It's still wonderfully campy, but the story, effects, and acting are contemporary.<br /><br />Small Warning: My wife stopped watching it because of the blood and gore.
B00B4FU6KE|3.0|I liked the way this book was put together, starting in the middle of the story.  The theme of animal cruelty is an important one in our society and perhaps some readers will be moved to action by reading this interesting fiction.  This title was chosen for my book club.  We had a spirited and interesting discussion.
B00D78J7SI|4.0|I'm a big fan of the Bodom that was. I really enjoyed listening to releases like Hatebreeder, Follow the Reaper, and Hate Crew Deathroll. However, once Are You Dead Yet? came around, the music wasn't drawing me in like it used to, it just didn't seem right. Blooddrunk seemed like an improvement over Are You Dead Yet?, however it still didn't seem like Bodom. I skipped the next album, and still have not listened to it entirely, but from what I've heard it was not that great.<br /><br />Now we have Halo of Blood. This release is much more &#34;Bodomy&#34; than the previous three, even though it's a bit short and less polished. I wouldn't say that Bodom is going back to their old sound, but it definitely seems like they are taking a step in the right direction given that they went back to their original producer which haven't used since Hate Crew Deathroll.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this album and liked all of the songs. I feel that any fan of the band should purchase this album and show their support.
B005GIS23I|3.0|I really enjoyed this -- lighthearted, sweet, insubstantial and that's OK. Lot's of references and &#34;line-checks&#34; to classic sci-fi fare, and totally captures the essence of comicon and those who participate: love. Love for the genre, for those who create it and those who share it.  I really enjoy Pegg and Frost -- and of course an alien would sound like Seth Rogan.  Why not?
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Hi all, I just got my ChromeCast and hook it up via the provided USB power cable. I have an older TV where the HDMI does not have the power need, so I have to use the USB. I plugged it into my Kill-a-Watt and it only uses 1.8W when streaming content! .02 amps, very little power is needed to run this dongle. I did notice that it runs VERY hot, might get some heat off the TV but its pretty hot.<br /><br />I have not been able to really get the youtube playlist feature to work yet, and when bouncing around from iphone, ipad to computer it does not really play nice yet. I might need to reboot everything and try again tomorrow.<br /><br />I wish the device shipped with more apps that supported it, maybe google should of held off the launch and just show off the SDK to get devs on board. Oh well, its a really cool piece of hardware that has TONS of potential, its just up to Devs to make this a killer \\"set top box\\"
B0035JRVR8|5.0|This is a timeless classic - a movie done well enough that the cast and the story are not outdone by the splendor of Rome.  Peck was right in asking that Hepburn be billed along side him.  Hers was a stunning, star-making performance.  Under-appreciated is the performance of Eddie Albert as the sidekick photographer whose antics, expression and pathos balanced the love story.
B0090XLDM2|5.0|The Matrix was an awesome movie when it was released. Although the visual effects may be a bit dated, I still think that is an awesome movie to this day. It provides a nice blend of action, story, cinematography, and special effects. The Blu-Ray does the movie justice making this the definitive way to watch it, until a more advanced medium is released.<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of the other movies in the trilogy, so I can't advise buying those in Blu-Ray format.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|My son is an angry bird freak and loves rio.  He also has a liking for the movie Rio so that helps.  We love all the angry bird games.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Block off a day or two because you will accomplish nothing until you finish every last page! Everything a woman-in-peril suspense novel should be!
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I chose this rating because this game is very colorful & it keeps me entertained. there is nothing that I dislike about this game I also like the idea that this game is on The Kindle Tablet & that  I can take it with me wherever I go. I would highly recommend it to my family & friends.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|If you enjoyed the first movie you'll really enjoy this one. At my age I love watching the stars I've grown old with still in action flicks...
B008X9Z3UC|5.0|This case will fit a Kindle Fire HD 7 quite well. When the Kindle Fire is in the case, it is very snug and protects the tablet well. Gave this to my neighbor as a gift as she has a Kindle and she loves this case. It is easy to fit into her purse or backpack to take with her on the go.<br />Since she does not use a stand or case on her Kindle, it fits so well into this case/sleeve just as it is.<br /><br />Belkin is great quality! Highly recommend this case.
B00005QDW5|4.0|David Gilmore and Syd Barrott are the greatest team.  Rest in peace Syd.  Wish you could have had more peace on earth, but that was also the root of your genius.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a fun app for the whole family, from 6 yrs to 40 yrs. There is a wide variety of things to do to keep you entertained.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|just got the unit delivered by mail, ordered it in  the first few hours after it went live from the company website. got a code emailed for the netflix offer to me in a separate  email as promised. hooked it up to the spare input on my Samsung tv. first tried to hook it up via desktop, not possible if the desktop is on a wired network, it has to be wireless. fired up my trusty win 8 Lenovo touch and then the set up was a breeze. disconnected the unit and hooked it up to an empty slot on my receiver. worked like a charm. tried the native Netflix and you-tube apps and they both work, so does Pandora if pulled up in the chrome browser. in fact it does mirror the browser, remember it pulls everything directly from the web so it might actually be faster than your laptop. it does transmit everything in hi-def onto the screen and 5.1 Dolby audio, tested it with a feed of frozen planet from you tube. that's all for now
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This was terrific reading and a real story...  not some made-up fiction about good guys vs bad guys..  Wars are tragic and I don't doubt that if the old men would do the fighting, there wouldn't be anymore wars.  I admire real heroes no matter what their country is that they are defending...  This was a great story and I recommend it to anyone who has not had the opportunity to discover it.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Silver Linings is an engaging look at the struggle to overcome one form of mental illness - obsession. Intricately scripted with great insight and very well portrayed by Bradley Cooper.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|the first floor was a little challenging.  By the time I was at the second floor, I was ready to give up.  (yes, i'm an inpatient person).  However, my BF loved it and has a lot more patience than I do.
B00BLCHZC2|4.0|The story was a bit lacking. You might satiat your game of thrones appetite while waiting for another season, but the epic storytelling doesn't compare to some of the great tv shows out there now.
B004HWYTP4|3.0|HOWEVER, I WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH MY SOUND RECEPTION, DON'T KNOW WHY BUT THE SOUND WAS WAY TOO MUCH BASE.  ENJOYED THE MOVIE AND RECOMMEND IT. A LOT OF STARS PERFORM IN THEIR GREAT STYLE.
B005544TRQ|5.0|addictive show, can't wait to watch the next one, well worth your time!  enjoy and watch! Looking forward to more episodes
B005USZML4|4.0|Very goooooooood like a chicken baby cakes. I loved it so much i pooped out little babys.<br />Three more words
B009LGO88E|5.0|Item is as described.<br />No problem whatsoever and it works perfectly with my American 3DS XL.<br />I liked it a lot.
B007MDB71O|5.0|This long awaited movie was not advertised correctly! But we saw it several times and purchased it!! As fans of Edgar Rice Burroughs for 40 yrs, it was great to see the interpretation in this show.  We are so looking forward to the sequels to come!!!! Yes, invest in the sequels and properly advertise and they will be financially successful!!
B009LQKHIO|2.0|This book had a good plot but poor execution. I literally had to force myself to finish it. The male lead was just too clingy and pushy for me to like. The female lead was okay, but was kind of frustrating.
B004VYYA2K|5.0|BOUGHT THIS FOR A  TWO YEAR OLD GRANDAUGHTER SHE LOVED LIT AND GOT MANY HOURS OF ENJOYMENT OU OF IT.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|I chose this to see how close to  the movie it was and I thought it was well done. I would recommend it to others.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Does the planet have to be in danger?  Does the story have to stretch continents, embrace seven races, and fill every syllable with the sense of certain doom?  Nope.  This story is about a gifted boy, placed in a bad situation, that struggles against his own limitations and those that are set upon him.  He makes his own enemies, and faces them down.  This is a story like those we love to tell each other, and if it has a splash of magic, and hint of fantasy, and takes place in a nearly historical milieu, then so much the better.  Kudos to Patrick.  Now finish the story!
B008Y6QZ56|5.0|Absolutely loved this movie! Great story and acting. It was so moving that it had me crying. I recommended this movie to family and friends.
1419701533|5.0|BOUGHT THEM FOR A SEVEN YEAR OLD GRAND SON.HE REALLY ENJOYED IT AND HAD READ THEM ALL WITHIN A WEEK
B002ECQB46|4.0|I found this movie to be very entertaining, although I had seen it in theaters I still felt the thrill as if I were seeing it for the very first time.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is fun and addicting it is easy to play n you can get daily chips but u can also buy things if u spend more then they give but the best way to do it is add friends that play
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This author is smart and funny on all the shows he has been on. The book is scholarly. Smart. Full of facts that we don't know and it puts Jesus in a perspective we should all have. A driven man - a zealot indeed.
B0010T56J0|5.0|Geoffrey Rush completely rocks this memorable part!  The entire movie is and beautifully acted, directed, and written.  Based on an inspirational story, this movie is truly timeless.  We laughed. We cried. We loved it!
B00CDY6HW6|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!!! Bunny Mania 2 HD is a great learning game for both kids and adults, and it isn't boring like some learning or thinking games can be.... this is a very good game and I recommend it to everyone reading this! I got this app when it was the FREE APP OF THE DAY, but this app would definitely still be worth paying for to download. It may be kind of confusing at first but you will soon get the hang of it! :) :) :) :) :) :)
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We don't often agree on shows in our house but this one was a must-watch for all.  Just the best.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|Okay ... when I had cable, I fixed it so my remote would NOT land on MTV.  I was sick of the creeps from New Jersey and the trashy pregnant teens or anyone turning 16.  This show was available for Free on Amazon Prime.  Who doesn't remember the awkward high school teenage years?  (I see you ... raise your hand)<br /><br />The very first show had the star female lead giving it up to the popular high school jock.  Awkward.  Eeuww.  It was a little creepy seeing the actor doing a pretty good job of being, let's say ... &#34;high schoolish&#34; -- eeuw.  BUT all that teenage activity comes with serious things to ponder for those in the teen group and the story ends with good angst-filled messages of being true to yourself, standing firm, and maybe not giving it up so easily.<br /><br />For the rest of us sophisticated, suave and not awkward adults -- you will enjoy the kooky and loveable adults on this show.  Hard to believe we've got a Mouseketeer from the Cristina/Britney/Justin era playing a mom to a teenager.  The high school counselor is a wacky, loveable, character.  The teen girl lead has a hunky, adoring and adorable dad.<br /><br />I was surprised that I loved the show -- it is on MTV.<br /><br />Cute, show.  I hope they don't mess it up in the new season!<br /><br />Do you have Amazon Prime?  Stop reading this and watch Awkward!
B000ICXQF6|4.0|No matter how many other movies Brad Pitt makes, I will always consider his portrayal of the cockeyed lunatic in this film to be his best. Awesome!
B007TK77QE|2.0|In my entire reading \\"career\\" there have been only two books that i have left unfinished. The Casual Vacancy is the third.<br />Boring, tedious, uninteresting... juts unbelievably irksome. A book by the richest living author cannot be so boring and unreadable. I tried to finish it; postponed, get back to the book, threw it away, returned again. Then I had had enough. This book was unfinishable.<br />I give it 2 stars only because I have saved the 1 star for a book called \\"50 shades of Disgust.\\" Just can't rate that book and Joanne Rowling's book similarly.
B006LSZECO|5.0|took me some time for it to sink in -  like other reviewers, wasn't sure of the ending -  but came to see it was the only one possible.  well written, engrossing.  heard Reese Witherspooon will produce it, with Ben Affleck as the husband.  Should be a heck of a film.
B00354YA4U|4.0|Exceptionally concise use of language. Cleverly controlled development of plot. Unfortunate in one way that the overall feeling I came away with was one of sadness.
B003PTP4S6|5.0|I never get tired of this CD and have given it to lots friends who have also loved it. Ennio and Yo-yo Ma-- a perfect combination.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|The person who gave me this must be hating me. i never suspected that. She seemed so friendly and nice, but then why'd she want me to kill myself? This book almost drove me to hysterics. I was either laughing like crazy, or screaming at the pages filled with absolute nonsense.<br />This author cannot write. The author does not know how to write. Every unnecessary detail is talked about, but anything important is never discussed, because the author of this book is NOT a WRITER.<br />What was with those emails? Are you \\"beep\\" kidding me? Are you an idiot? Retarded, maybe?<br /><br />Whom is this book written for? Who is the target audience? Certainly not anyone with brains.<br />How can any woman like this and call that psychopath a nice guy? You have to be an idiot to like a sociopath character. And don't get me started on that abusive relationship. I can't believe so many readers cannot tell BDSM (which is consensual) from abuse (emotional, physical) and stalking.<br /><br />If this book belonged to me, it would go straight to toilet. Would be more useful there.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|I LOVED reading the first in the series of King and Maxwell!  The two of them really come alive from these pages.  Enjoy your reading!
B00CATSONE|5.0|The Beyerdynamic Tesla T1 is a stunning piece of engineering and Nikola Telsa was a stunning piece of God's creation and this is his story, impressive.
B001P3SA8U|5.0|Nicely done historical peek at a time gone by in the music world, when new sounds were being created every day.  The artists had a way of putting their innermost feelings to music, in a very powerful way.  Some very enduring genres were created at Chess.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Fantastic mouse, works great, nice and smooth, buttons all feel good, and the mouse is just comfortable, very well built.
B000WOXVJQ|5.0|This is a great collection of radio versions, original accoustics, familiar, and newly heard.  A great addition to our collection!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|It had been about fourteen years since I played magic and this game, is helping me the learn all of the new rules. I also like the speed at this game plays seems great for beginners
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My daughter loves this movie and I enjoyed it too once I figured out what was going on. I was confused at first as to who Despicable Me was. I know - but when your 76, things like this can be a bit confusing.
B00DYOOGYK|1.0|Um mm i have 4g wifi with no one but me connected to it but it stays at :Downloading: 0.00mb of 1.300 mb. Gameloft you suck
B006LRUVUA|5.0|I have been using this app for over a year and have absolutely no complaints about it.  I can remotely access a computer (mine or someone  elses) and it is like I am at that computer.  I have done video conferences, had meetings, etc.  Did I say it was free for personal use?.  There are some part of the program that are unavailable or have limited functionality in the free version, but what you can do is awesome.  I highly recommend this software.
0375413405|5.0|Bought for a gift for son's girl frient who speaks fluent French and loves to cook. Thought she could try recipies like Julie/ Julia the movie. I think it is a good staple for a good cook.
B0012HF5NC|5.0|I like the rah rah impossible scenarios of this movie. Just the right mix of fun, bizarre superman/woman situations, and &#34;Hello - I'm back!&#34;
B00CL68BK2|5.0|We liked everything about this movie. Bradley Cooper was perfect for the role and Jennifer is fantastic. Also, we appreciated the manner in which this movie addressed mental disorders. Robert De Nero gave his usual outstanding performance.
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|This album is completely awesome. I just autoripped it and am loving it. It has lots of power and will keep you on your feet. I  honestly think that this is there best album yet. And in case you didn't guess, every song is explicit, in fact the entire album shows up as explicit on amazon mp3. So yeah don't listen to this with your younger children. I give this album 5/5 for pure and complete awesomeness.
B00DVKU1VO|5.0|We got the first season just to check it out. SO worth it!!!  Highly recommend if you like dragons, and witches, and sexy scenes.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|There easier to use sight there sight with better maps there are sights that are faster there are sights that are not as clutered
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This was like &#34;A Wrinkle in Time&#34; for grownups!  Magical and engrossing take on the nature of reality.  A bit dark, but I couldn't put it down until I finished.  Enjoy!
B007ZI06FE|5.0|Yes, Bec McMaster has single-handedly converted me to this genre.  I'll now read anything I can find, but her books are simply the best.  There's danger, drama, hot sex, anguish and a great VIctorian London atmosphere.  You really can't go wrong.  Just try and put it down!
1490313370|5.0|Have you ever heard of an author offering to refund every penny you spent on their book if you can prove you read it? That's exactly what James Altucher offers to do and I find that not only remarkable, but also a good indicator of the character of the author. Altucher does a nice job of coming back to the same four principle life-enhancing actions we can all take, but that few seem to faithfully follow. I, for one, was glad he kept coming back to those same four principles from different angles throughout the book...I readily admit that I really didn't fully embrace them in the beginning.<br /><br />It will take me some time to adjust to doing something each day for my physical body, my emotional body, my mental body, and my spiritual body, but I have a strong feeling that Altucher has that advice right on target, and that my life will absolutely improve as I do so. Thank you, Jim, for offering me encouragement to change and simple, practical ways to start the process. I'm excited to see where this new journey takes me!
140006922X|5.0|Excellent read! An educated leveled minded depiction of a great man who influenced millions in his teachings. Thanks to Fox News' narrow minded and amateur interview bringing this to light, many more will read this then would have otherwise. Who knows maybe Fox News has also lost a few viewers in the process.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love it...and wish there were more like it.  I sometimes have to get clues but amazes me how many puzzles they can fit into a box.
B007MDB71O|5.0|This movie is awesome. It wasn't promoted well, and negative comments appeared before movie was even released encouraging you not to see it. Buy John Carter watch it again and again. When is the sequel Disney? You goofed up on this one.  We are all waiting.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This book made me aware of how little I knew about life in modern day North Korea, and about the reasons they despise Americans as they do.  My history was lacking on this one, but I learned from it.
B0054SMID0|5.0|Well written story, great acting.  I really enjoyed this one, held my interest to the very end.  I hated to see it end.
1468179993|4.0|This book is direct and to the point in its breakdown and examples of the qualities of the best of short-format talks. Most intriguing was the chapter on what should be included in your introduction. It offers very practical advice and is worth the read.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Awesome show!  Riveting to watch.  Love the characters and interactions.  Find myself wanting to watch episodes back to back.  A must see.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|Scarey to know it is reality based, not a novel of fiction like the one I read previously.  A must read for those who question our society.
B008JFURII|5.0|as a stand alone, but even better if you know the back story! Every one in the theater I was in thoroughly enjoyed this second installment.  There were lots of great laughs, action sequences, and the cast was stellar - as usual! I enjoyed the first, and the second stood up to that and more! Can't wait to add this to my collection!
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I have to agree with some of the others who have reviewed this app.  The new app is not so great.  I would like the old app back.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is really fun because it will take more than one sitting to beat it. And, the in app purchasing is pretty cheap too if you don't like to wait.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A good way to spend several hours,if you're looking to veg out on the sofa.  Fire up the popcorn and sit back.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game for all! Kids and adults of all ages sill enjoy this game. :) I definitely recommend! It is worth it!
140006922X|5.0|I admit that i didnt pick this up til the Fox interview.  Dr Aslan, you own Laura Green or whatever that reporter's name is a big bouquet of flowers and a case of nice wine (not the trader joes stuff either) BECAUSE despite what a good book you've written, few people outside of religion /div departments were going to probably go read it.  Now thanks to Fox News,many people were outraged, and have read your work and know its gooD. Poor Laura, well, we can only hope that the educational system that failed her will not hold her back from taking the shame, and using it to motivate her to read more than a teleprompter.<br /><br />In any case good show, thanks for standing up for scholarly argument, reason, empiricism, peer review and critical thinking EVERYWHERE!  WE APPLAUD YOU!
B0026KX6TY|4.0|Remember seeing this years ago.  It was worth another view. Interesting insight into how parents can take a child's gift and become so consumed in the gift that they lose sight of the child.
B000Q6GURU|5.0|Totally awesome movie and music. Samuel Jackson and Christina Ricci Rock!! The blues tunes shake your soul, mind and heart. Loved it.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|I had to be able to see what I am shooting while diving. On dry land, I can use my I-Phone to see what the camera is aimed at.
1781162646|4.0|I haven't read a Stephen King in a long time and this was a good one.  Well written, fun plot and overall just an easy summer read.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|LeCarre is seriously upset by the deviousness of Blair's &#34;New Labor&#34;, and Bush Administration -- indeed others, for all we know--as they outsource duties to private &#34;security&#34; firms that are more properly done by state military or intelligence agencies, which have some accountability.  The plot centers around a particularly bad such firm, run by a facile smart-mouth called Crispin, but staffed by thugs from South Africa etc.  A going-nowhere Foreign Office gent is brought in by his Minister (who's been thoroughly suborned by Crispin's company and his silent partner, a born-again heiress from South Carolina) to &#34;oversee&#34; a rendition of a supposed Arab terrorist from Gibraltar; the FO guy is to be backed by a squad of British marines who've been taken off the rolls of their regiment (and therefore out of military discipline) for this black operation.  How it goes terribly wrong, and what the consequences are for tender consciences three years on, is the drama of the plot -- how to blow this abuse of power wide open without getting killed or silenced.  Thoughtful, chilling, full of LeCarre's usual sophisticated knowledge of government operations.
B007QA3AH2|5.0|I watch this movie every year.  If you grew up watching the original Star Trek you will get this.  It is still good every time see it.
B000002LCI|5.0|The vender totally rocked this order. Three days before Christmas I ordered and it was on the door step on Christmas Eve. Thank you so much!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Helps the reader understand the modern history of Afganistan and the surrounding countries and relief organisations now and in the recent past.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is great if you always wanted a horse or just love them. with this app it feels like you actually own a horse.
B005CAATXG|5.0|The name of the Album says it all about this but in a good way, as this sounds as good or better than the band \\"Scripted it\\" most likely.<br />If you have seen them live you know exactly what you are getting since this is the first album they play the whole thing but not in the cd order which is a good thing being that I like the order they play them live more.<br /><br />When it comes to the Live versions to CD its pretty close but obviously impossible to recreate the songs in full as they need a touring Guitarist/Keyboardist live who can play both...<br />as there were moments where two guitars were needed but only have one. Also the keyboard playing in background while extra guitar is not needed would be nice to see live.. otherwise they sound better than I thought they would be Live. Her vocals are rather close to the album & the band puts on a pretty good show.<br /><br />If you are into Paramore but like me wish Paramore were better live... than go see Icon For Hire live. The sad thing about Paramore live is not the singing,Drums,or even bass... it's the two guitarists need to be more accurate live considering most the guitar is average or good at times but not to hard or overly impressive yet they both always suck live... I think Williams is more accurate constantly live but Icon as a band sound better live to me.<br /><br />Anyways if you want the more Rock version of Paramore get this album which to me is Alt Rock. Hope the next Album is as good or better since this Album is great from start to finish just about without many flaws. Hopefully they will get a little heavier leads/mini solos that last like 10 seconds...since I think thats the only way they can improve & would match pretty well to have a little more lead guitar & put them even more further appart from the Paramore comparrisions but if not even another album similair to this would be well worth the listen. Hope I helped somewhat...
0765325950|5.0|Well done. I felt pulled and abused right along with the characters in the story. Many pages dedicated to get the reader to understand the despair and futility felt by all of those in the cast, small and large. A fitting end.
B008RZF1UO|5.0|Great Product. I loved this CD, the new singer is pretty good, I won't complain about him. I highly enjoy listening to this CD. Would highly recommend to others.
B00DULWFZE|4.0|The Backstreet Boys have always been a group who stress vocals over popularity. Even though there first three albums sold millions and set record, the group has never strayed away from becoming different. They have produced songs that are vocally excellent. There new album \\"In A World Like This,\\" is the group's 20th anniversary album. Yes, they've been around that long. This new album has all the creativity of their previous albums, with new twists on certain songs. Also Kevin Richardson is back with the band after a six year hiatus. He is very apparent in many of the major vocals as well, a departure from earlier albums when he had more backup and bass parts. Below is a rating for each of the songs on the album:<br /><br />1) In A World Like This: The first single, named after the album, is a solid pop hit, with great vocals from all five members. The song was written by Max Martin, who has worked on their earlier albums from the 90s. The song even has a 90s/early 2000's sound to it, but that's not bad at all. However, the song may not do so well on radio because of that. Still, it's a great song that deserves attention: 9.5/10<br /><br />2) Permanent Stain: Permanent Stain was a promotional single that was put online in May. It has a upbeat tempo to it, but doesn't sound as crisp as \\"In A World Like This.\\" I like the verses of the song, but the chorus sounds a little unorganized. Overall, it is a listenable pop song but the band has better songs on this album and on other albums: 7/10<br /><br />3) Breathe: Breathe is a slow, pop rock song that features major vocals from Kevin and AJ. It has sort of an 80s slow rock vibe to it, and that makes it sound unique to today's music. The vocals and instrumentals on the song match well. Overall, a good song from the group: 8.5/10.<br /><br />4) Madeleine: One of the few acoustic songs on the album, Madeleine is a good effort to create something different from what the group is used to producing. The vocals from Nick and AJare very good and the instrumental part of the song matches the vocals well enough. However, it's not their best song ever, but it is good for this album considering a lot of the decisions were made by the band themselves. Overall, a good song but not the best on the album: 7/10<br /><br />5) Show Em' What You're Made Of: This pop rock song has a One Republic sound to it, which actually works very well with the Backstreet Boys. On previous albums, such as \\"Unbreakable\\" and \\"Never Gone,\\" there were several songs that tested this type of sound. When the band does a song like this I enjoy listening to it. All of the group members have a solo in the song, with AJ, Kevin, and Nick singing the major parts. I hear that this song is their second single, so maybe it will do well on the charts: 10/10<br /><br />6) Make Believe: This song has a similar sound to \\"Show Em' What You're Made Of,\\" but the composition is different. Make Believe is also the longest song on the album (4:46). Overall, the song has a strong instrumental to it, which makes it very listenable. Also, the vocals of each member sound top notch, especially the parts where AJ says \\"We can only Make Believe.\\" I like this song and it's one of the best songs on this album: 9.5/10<br /><br />7) Try: Another acoustical song, Try is sang primarily by AJ. AJ has always had a soulful voice and that makes his vocals one of the most unique of the band members. Overall vocally, he does an excellent job singing this song and the backup from the other members is good too: 8/10.<br /><br />8) Trust Me: Trust Me is another soulful song from the band. Each member has a vocal part on this song and the instruments that go along with the vocals match up perfectly. Towards the end, the song becomes more catchy with the addition of a saxophone. The song has a very Jason Mraz sound to it. I could see this song on the radio: 9/10<br /><br />9) Love Somebody: Out of all the songs on the album, this song gets the closest to soundinglike something off \\"This is Us.\\" The beat of Love Somebody has a hip hop vibe to it. However, the lyrics of the song could have been written better. One part of the song says \\"You're the reason cavemen drew on the wall;\\" that's a bit cheesy. Overall, the song is still a good pop song and could possibly do well on current radio. Not their best, not their worst: 7/10<br /><br />10) One Phone Call: One Phone Call is another song very similar to \\"Show Em' What You're Made Of\\" and \\"Make Believe.\\" Overall, the song is a solid pop rock hit with a good instrumental to back up the vocals. The metaphor used in the lyrics is creative, and the vocals are top notch. Along with the other two similar songs, One Phone Call is works well on this album: 9/10.<br /><br />11) Feels Like Home: This song is a similar song to Pitbull's \\"International Love,\\" but it's not a rap/sing song.  It's a song about how the band has been to various places around the world. It's also most likely a song to thank fans around the world for supporting them. The lyrics are a bit generic , but the strong pop rock instrumentals of the song are excellent. I like it and the song is very listenable. 9/10<br /><br />12) Soldier: The last main song on the album, Soldier is another pop rock ballad, driven with a piano like a lot of the songs on this album and their previous albums. I like piano rock ballads and this one is no exception. The vocals of all the boys are very strong and the composition of the song is excellently put together. A great way to finish the main songs on the album: 10/10<br /><br />BONUS SONGS<br />1) Into Your Arms: This bonus song has a similar sound to \\"Permanent Stain.\\" Like that song, this song has a good verse, but not the best chorus. If the chorus's of both those songs were improved, they would be on par with the best songs on the album. Overall a decent uptempo song, but the Backstreet boys have other better uptempo songs: 7.5/10<br /><br />2) Light On: Light On is another uptempobonus song, but I find I like this song better than Into Your Arms. It actually should have been part of the main songs, since it sounds like it could be a hit on the radio. It sounds eerily similar to \\" Love Somebody\\" from Maroon 5, which is a quality song: 8.5/10<br /><br />3) Hot Hot Hot: This song has a reggae vibe to it. The Backstreet Boys have made a reggae type song before (One in A Million). Over the course of the song, a mix of hip hop and soul comprise of the instrumentals. Like \\"Light On,\\" this bonus song could be a radio hit: 8/10.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: On a whole, the Backstreet Boys have produced and created a solid pop/rock album with the addition of new genres like soul. Each song has a distinctive sound to it. If you listen to every album from \\"Backstreet's Back, to this newest album, you'll notice a subtle and maturing change to a record selling band.<br />OVERALL RATING: 4.25/5
B003ZYU3TG|5.0|What a storyteller! I like the silent Chaplin best, without his political preaching. What a great film...brilliant comedy!  I use it in acting class.
B0080SZ0V8|2.0|Downloaded this game to my Kindle Fire.  Got stuck in the first section.  The game never gave you a tutorial or instructions on how to play it and I couldn't go back to look for instructions, etc.  Removed from my Kindle Fire!
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Great Product. Always a good movie to watch, we've had noissues with it. Would highly recommend to others. Funny movie.

B00406O7YK|3.0|This is a silly movie, and Barbra is SO miscast. Bring on Carol Channing, the greatest Dolly of all! But a great long note at the end of the first part!!! You go, Streisand...
B005HSL626|2.0|I played Fruit Ninja on my brother-in-law's Kindle back in June 2013, so when I saw that it was offered again, I downloaded the game to my Kindle Fire.  The download was fine, the game is fun, however, I DO NOT like the constant COMMERCIAL interruptions and then they \\"kick\\" me out of the game.  I ended up removing the game from my Kindle because of this!

B008JGSM6G|3.0|Flow Free  - Free Game.  Downloaded it to my Kindle Fire.  The game is fun and makes you really think!  However, there are &#34;glitches&#34; in the game that kicks you out of it.  Removed it from my Kindle Fire!
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|I listened to Daft Punk as a kid because their music videos were drawn in anime style and I really liked that. Get Lucky is an great song for Daft Punk to step back on the scene, but from the samples of the CD that I listened to, I don't think I'd buy it. I expect Daft Punk to make awesome rave/electronica songs, and most of the CD has a... stuck in the 80s/90s feel. Not that there's anything wrong with that, it just doesn't appeal to me.
B00CA3C1N4|5.0|Classic gameplay without in-your-face social media and complete set of multiplayer capabilities. A must have for RTS lovers. Simple enough for everyone to enjoy.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is wonderful it is fun as soon as you turn it on you think what a cool game you must download it
B005LAII4E|5.0|Just received the movie.  Will watch this weekend with 4 other guess.  Will let you know how  they like the movie.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, Mogran Freeman, Hellen Mirren, and Mary Louise Parker are at their comic book best. Action figures, entertainers, great delivery of lines, fun action and a good rollicking time!
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|Movie was pure gore nothing more.  Story line was lame and everything else about it was corny.  Was  definitely disappointed but went into this movie with low expectations.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|This was a pretty good book.  Was really expecting it to be the last one of this series.  But looks like the waiting game is on again.
B000FCKPHG|5.0|Great self improvement book and very applicable to schools.  This needs to be part of every schools curriculum, what a difference it would make.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I'm stuck already, I didn't get far but I never do with this type of game.  I think after a certain time period a clue would be in order.
B00873GRU4|3.0|You might get more involved with the characters than I did.  If so, the setting and idea are well crafted enough to make this a good read.  Sadly I just didn't care enough about what happened to the main players to really enjoy it.
B002ZG97EC|3.0|I had recently watched &#34;Despicable Me 2&#34; at the theatre and thoroughly enjoyed it. The minions were hilarious! Having never seen &#34;Despicable Me,&#34; I ordered it on Blu-ray and was waiting anxiously for it to arrive. Well, it arrived quickly, however, I was extremely disappointed in it. The minions, who were the hit of the film in the recent one, had very little to say in the 1st film.
B00C04H2VO|2.0|The product is too small and so cheap that the figures aren't attached to the bases so they will stay on the bases and stand up.<br />I wasted my money on this product.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|Nice graphics, but way too slow for me.  I suppose it would be adequate for children, I'd have to let them try it.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|One of the best series! They couldn't have picked a better Hannibal than Mads. He makes me say \\"Anthony Hopkins, who?\\" Highly recommended. Will suck you in more with each episode.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Thrilling, keeps you on the edge of your seat, and totally entertaining! I love Suits, and I can't believe I didn't begin watching it sooner.  I highly recommend it to anyone who's looking for some action and comedy!
0553381695|5.0|The author does a good job of keeping several plots going at once....hard to put down!  I like this type of saga set in the days of kings, dragons and magic
B0007MWZEK|4.0|My sis and Mom have one, and I've admired it from afar.  I was a little disappointed in the lead time, but the company says I ended up with a better model for the same price.  It works well on my tile floor, I intend to use it as a broom-it is not meant to be a vacuum.  It works well so far.
B00AHJL7BK|3.0|It's a fun game to play.  However, it never tells you that you've won.  The player has to notice when all the red numbers have turned to green.  Not convenient.
B005544TRQ|5.0|My wife and I are addicted to Suits. Just when you think the worst of a scumbag lawyer, these characters show they truly do have character. This show will have a lot of success for years. Absolutely love this show.
B0060MYM3S|2.0|This season follows the second book...  There was so much in the book and I was glad to see that the dvd of the 2nd season didn't skip anything.  Makes me eager to read book 3 and can hardly wait for the 3rd season dvd
B004GUSG4M|4.0|I enjoyed a lot this book. A lor of details that make you imagine all the scenes.  Easy to read for a non native english speaker. I recommend it.
0780020693|5.0|Fellini's boyhood-memories masterpiece assumes a light and compassionate tone that makes you glad to be alive, brave enough to express yourself, and grateful for being human.  We are strange and unique creatures - each of us.  Federico leaves dreamscape film-making to enchant us with a dreams-can't-touch-this-stuff homage to living and connecting in the &#34;real&#34; world!
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|Suits reminded me of Scandal, in an obtuses sort of way. Beautiful black Women and some strange bad ass white boys
B000JMKQX0|2.0|So maybe I made the mistake of seeing the movie first (which I enjoyed) and then reading the book. At least I understand why it was so hard, and took so long, to get the movie made. The book's episodic character kept me from empathizing with any single character, including the narrator. In writing we talk a lot about &#34;show, don't tell,&#34; and WWZ did a lot of the opposite. Faulkner can get away with that. Not many of the rest of us, alas.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|exellent series continues with more twists and turns characters get fleshed out a bit more although the shift of focus can be a bit extreme at times.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|A great read for young people and adults alike, combining a classic children's horror feel with more grown-up themes of loss, regret and hope in a unique, compelling story.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I know we must be tolerent. But I like that structure they Had. Back in the days of Downton Abbey, there were duckets, francs, dollars everywhere. Even with the influx of Cash from Matthew, Downton Abbey still had to become Fiscally responsible. It has been a slow march to the mess we are into today.., All the way to my home state of ILLINOIS with its Pension crisis
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS GAME. IT IS FOR ANYONE WHO LOVES PUZZLE GAMES. IT IS ONE OF ONLY A COUPLE THAT I SEE A NEED TO HAVE ON MY PHONE AND TABLET. I COULD PLAY AGAIN AND AGAIN.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Alot of fun!!! Just as described. Me and my son both enjoy it immensely, especially for a free game. Thanks Amazon.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|A refreshing break from the CGI and fantasy driven epics of today's genre. Not that I don't like those kind of movies but they're used to be far more story driven, cinematic productions that emphasized the acting and overall tale, not just scene after scene of flash, crash and gore.
B00BQ1D7X4|4.0|Okay, okay... this isn't the same AIC that floored the music world with \\"Dirt\\" and \\"Sap\\" back in the 90s. Layne Staley is no longer with us and those albums, along with the self-titled album (sometimes called \\"Three-Legged Dog\\") were uniquely his. Layne put his stamp on the early AIC. Cantrell is the leader of this group these days and their last effort (Black Gives Way To Blue) was solid. The same holds true for their latest \\"The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here.\\"<br /><br />First off, I always like to comment on the packaging of a product for those of you who are still into actually purchasing a physical CD rather than just an MP3 download. The cover art is hidden by the red jewel case, but when you take the sleeve out of the case itself, the overlapping dinosaur scull reveals a character that looks similar to Satan. There are a few more of these throughout the sleeve with different types of bones. Nothing fancy, but it works.<br /><br />When you throw the CD into your stereo, you will know you're listening to AIC. They just have that distinct grungy guitar that is unmistakable. For those of us who are now in our thirties, this is the type of music we grew up with for the most part. It's nice to hear that little has changed even when Cantrell put a new \\"stamp\\" on the band after Layne's passing. If you're a purist, you'll probably find this album boring, maybe a little on the anemic or slow side and certainly a little repetitive. All of the past three albums have been a little bit like that. However, that doesn't make them uninteresting... that makes them unique.<br /><br />I found the tracks \\"Hollow,\\" the first single \\"Stone\\" and \\"Choke\\" to be solid tracks and my favorite was \\"Phantom Limb.\\" This song reminds me a lot of a song like \\"A Looking In View\\" from BGWTB... a lengthy track with a repetitive though catchy hook and simple yet clear lyrics, tapping out at just over the 7-minute mark.<br /><br />I'm not one to tell people what they should think of an album... everyone is going to have their own opinion about what they hear. I also don't like to tell people to only listen to certain tracks, though like everyone else, I have favorites. I do think that fans of AIC should keep an open mind and remember that this is 2013, not 1993, and sounds change over the years. Even then, you'll still know this is AIC and I hope that you give it a chance. The first listen-through might be a little rough depending on your expectations for the album, but a second time through will make you appreciate the great musicianship. 4/5 stars.
B00BVYKWJI|5.0|ONCE AGAIN THIS WAS AMAZING SERIES. I COULD NOT WAIT TO GET TO THE NEXT EPISODE. NOW I MUST WAIT FOR THE SEASON 3 TO COME TO INSTANT VIDEO OR BUY IT IN AUGUST ON  DVD. WHICH ONE??
B007MJT1K2|4.0|Good for kids if they are old enough to make it through the sort of slow beginning. After that, it is action packed and all the kids were enthralled.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Just watched all of Season 1 and 2. Half way through season 3..Awesome show..Can't wait for season 4 to start in Jan.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Very fun. You will enjoy it. So many games. Never freezes up. Best game&quot;s&quot; ever! You will never get bored.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I liked it, didn't love it. I haven't seen the movie but I think I will now. Worth the cost for sure.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Like all of Khaleo Hosseini's books, it is well written and compelling.  I have enjoyed every word of this novel and will share it with my friends.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I love hidden objects games. I especially like this one because it makes you think about your next guess. Some of the hidden objects games are so predictable. This one isn't.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|fun but takes a long time to load when on the road.I recommend it to anyone who wants to buy Temple Run 2.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Great book, I love the point of view and where the story takes you. I loved it. A great read but keep the tissue close by.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Didn't like this book at all. Lots of split reviews from my friends. I had never read any books by this author, so I decided to give it a try. Nothing really happened until about 150 pages in. I won't read any more books by this author.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Interesting game has many different strategies. Helps pass the time. Would recommend to anyone.  Needs more puzzles and more rooms to find things in.
B007MDB71O|5.0|The film was good entertainment and I enjoyed it both at the cinema and at home with friends. Should have had a subtitle to attract more people though. Would love to see John Carter 2 :D
1400031362|3.0|VERY Hard to believe that Mma Makutsi with only  secretarial training could suddenly acquire all the skills needed to administrate three very diverse businesses!
B005544TRQ|3.0|I like the show.  The main characters and plot is pretty interesting.  It is not the more unique of shows and to tell you the truth much of the story and shows twists and turns are pretty predicable.  I will finish the first season, but this show doesn't rank in the same league as Mad Men, Breaking Bad or Game of Thrones.
B000B3MIZG|5.0|I rate  a movie as I see it.<br />I recommend it to all ages. nothing R about this film.  Good family entertainment.
B0007P3582|5.0|Great cd and would recommend it to anyone that likes rap music also the price was great as well thanks
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Found this one evening while surfing the TV for something to watch - was just great.  Can't wait till Red 2 is release.  Liked so much ordered this for my daughter
1451695195|3.0|easy to read, gives one food for thought. Its a story about his personal near death experience which I found interesting.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|This rating is what it deserved - no question needed<br />Tips are always welcome and also guidelines.  Am completely satisfied
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Too many characters to keep track of.  The flow of the story was sometimes difficult to follow. I enjoyed it, but it was not one of my favorites.
1433502410|5.0|Love this book - needed a Study Bible and this is just great.  Has helped me with my Sunday School lessons and makes it a lot easier for me to understand the Bible
B001I10ABE|5.0|Was surprised that this album was a four-disc, 45 RPM set. Don't see that very often in albums. I was expecting a two-disc 33 RPM set. The sound is great, and if you luck out and get a clean, unscratched copy of this, you'll revel in the wonderful, analogue sound of vinyl. The 45 RPM speed was excellent for this, too, as fidelity is higher with the 45 RPM speed. This is a fun album and a safe choice for any metal, heavy/hard rock fan, if you've never gotten into Metallica. (Unfortunately, the last album Metallica made that was really any good). I look forward to buying some of their older stuff on Amazon.
B0010AN7Z4|5.0|extremely excellent in their profession.  Would recommend to all young and vulnerable ladies (young women)  Women are gullible and men are eager.
B0031RS64G|5.0|Utterly re-readable feast of characters and intrigue in a world of mystery and chaos,a must for fans of fantasy or otherwise.
B00DSOG0QS|5.0|I loved this book, it was a awesome read. The book is so good, that I read it in one day. I could not stop reading.<br />I loved the story. The story was full of action and the twists and turns left me wanting more.The plot was extraordinary, one of the best detective novels I have ever read. The characters were well thought and were captivating from the beginning of the book to the end. The family dynamic in the book was very, very interesting.<br />Overall, this is a very entertaining book. I look forward to book 2.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Don't be fooled- it's not as easy as it seems during the tutorial.  Another &quot;just one more try&quot;  game that I can't stop playing.
B00D3XAA4M|4.0|This book has enough to whet the appetite of anyone who wants to travel across Europe... for some people it offers adventures; for others it suggests beautiful views; it even has recommendations for those who do food tourism.  Is it enough to plan an entire trip?  Definitely not.  But it´s fun to read and get you thinking about future trips!
0062082353|5.0|A book that shames Jesse Ventura and sets the bar for modern snipers.<br /><br />We lost Chris to young and this book will help you remeber a real American HERO!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I enjoyed the story over all, but it was difficult to follow at times.  There were too many unnecessary characters.  I felt like he was digressing in several chapters.
B004UFEJVW|5.0|Love this movie, sweet, sentimental, funny.  The characters are great...I could tell you all about them if you have time.....Squirrel!!!
B005USZYDU|5.0|This book is great for any kid ages nine to eighteen! I strongly recommend it. The suspense is amazing, and i love the way John Grisham writes.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|The movie was not all bad, the acting wasn't super and I found myself wishing they stuck more to the book.
B002VHI8J0|4.0|Loved the structure of the book, especially how it mirrors from the middle to resolution. First and last journals a little slow moving for me but bearable. Loved the futuristic section.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Absolutely loved this movie! Definitely worth the purchase. This is Sci-Fi at its finest. Everything came together in this great film; story, actors, special effects. I don't know that any other company could have made a such a fun and memorable movie. Can't wait for a sequel!<br />Wouldn't it be neat to have a Barsoom at Disney World/ EPCOT?
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I'll be reading this one again. It's reminiscent of the work of Ray Bradbury. A good story, well told, highly recommended.
0743581490|3.0|I didn't realize this was the short version. Still a good book, but not nearly as compelling as the complete novel
B00BI73CVI|5.0|I enjoyed the movie. It was a nice way to spend a day with the mother in law and nieces.
B00AKYRCNY|5.0|Great app for the little ones to keep them entertained. Easy to do for my 2 YO and kids are rewarded at the end with applause and bubbles which he loves to pop. Totally recommend!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I will not attempt to sound like a professional critic whatsoever... in fact: far from it.<br />Even though it sometimes reminds me of soap opera, which I have never liked, there are far more times when this show is simply outstanding.  The performances of such creative scripts is just fun to watch.  And the photography is incredible as well.<br />If you're someone who is considering giving this show a chance, I highly recommend it.  I started with Season 1, Episode 1, just to see what the hoopla was about.  I've completed Season 3 and want more.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|It was good to finally get to the end of this series.  The final book lived up to the rest of the books with action to the very end
0345529057|5.0|The set of books came in excellent condition and arrived on time. The print is easy to read. The size of the book is comfortable to hold.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Loved this season as much as the two before it. Downton Abbey is a great show filled with many twists and turns!
B000YADE04|5.0|A favorite that's makes you laugh, silly humor and a good clean movie for a family that can be seen by all!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Really great book. Very engaging, I would recommend it. Just the imagination it took to reason all this out was very impressive.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Acting was well done with good casting. Movie would not be recommended to general audience for its harsh content and visual violence. Liked factual content that fit that time and era. Recommended to a specific viewer.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I did not see this when it was on TV. I agree it is a cross between X files and twilight zone.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|I've been looking for this type of game for awhile. Great rpg,the only draw back is having to buy diamonds.
B005544V6A|5.0|Excellent writing, paired with superb casting, stylish wardrobe and electric settings -- All you need is greed, avarice, some version of legal challenge and the unexpected twists and turns of romantic subtexts. This show has it all. The smattering of strong language is unnecessary but is only sprinkled for effect in otherwise fast-paced, plot advancing context. There is not one wasted nuance, gesture, emotion or revelation in this outstanding drama.<br /><br />The characters are well-defined but not fully revealed; complex but understandable, even relatable in their human underpinnings, still a bit unpredictable, driven part by character and part by plot -- Cerebral entertainment with the right dash of sexual tension, arcane legal solutions and jockeying-for-power maneuvers that constantly upend the apple cart.<br /><br />Could this be the next 'House' with hubris?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game suggested by my friend. I need to watch despicable me movie! Eventhough number 2 of this movie is out now I never watch the first yet! Gotta remind myself to watch this movie
B005LAIH2M|5.0|Great movie with alot of  gore and action.  I like the looks of the different witches.  Good twist on the Hansel and Gretel fairytale.

B001GQACGO|5.0|Great album. I recommend for anyone that likes Beyonce and wants another classic Beyonce album. Some good singles on here as well as a few great songs you haven't heard on the radio.
B001N1DPDE|4.0|I love the drop point feature of this knife and how sharp it tends to stay. I use it during hiking trips into the Appalachian mountains. Before buying the knife I did as much research as I could and found that everyone was having the same issues with the knife. The knife is really big, it tends to rust if not taken cared of, and the sheath is shameful in comparison to the knife. All that being said, I do use this knife whenever I go hiking. The size of the knife can get exhausting when being used and carried but the advantage is that it will replace a hatchet in terms of use and still facilitate the advantages of being a knife. The girth and weight of the knife means that it will go through anything; firewood, brush, dangerous animals if the need arises. The last trip I took, the skies opened up and we were rained on in the middle of the hike, after a few hours I checked on my knife at the base camp and saw that it had a good deal of rust on the blade, easily dealt with with a sharpening stone. The absolute worst part is the sheath. Very unbalanced when unlocked at the handle and its not light either.  I gave this knife four stars because even with all of the negative properties, I trust this as my primary and backup when I am experimenting with other options. It is always with me for short or long trips. I feel very safe with it and will say that it is the best knife for adventurous camper and for the price.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|With all the mentions of Kaleb in the previous books, I knew Ms. Singh was going to write a phenomenal story for Kaleb.  I was not disappointed, this story was so intense and Sahara and Kaleb are truly two sides of the same beautiful coin.  Another well done job, and I cannot wait until the story continues in 2014.
B009NY43NY|5.0|The books are so different than the T show. I am actually really glad that is the case because I can always go back and re-read the books and enjoy the crazy life of a telepathic waitress and her adventures. I have loved the series from beginning to end. I am sorry there will be no more Sookie books but I am hoping Ms. Harris has other paranormal books up her sleeves....
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I enjoyed this series when it first came out and am enjoying it just as much now.  It is nice to watch something that isn't at all based on current events and problems.  A good escape!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This cord works great for connecting my kindle to my larger screen hd tv. I can watch movies from kindle prime and they play wonderfully with no pausing or breakup during playback.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is so powerful. I think the ending is the best part. Anyone  who reads this will like it.
B00CL68QVQ|2.0|Chick flick, chick flick, chick flick, chick flick! I do not think I need to say more, but I need three more words.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really love this game. Its really fun, I believe its a great for children under the age of 13
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Loved the recent film version, and even though this is a 1,000 page epic, I am glad I put it on my reading list.
B004FN1T3A|5.0|Excellent method to revolutionize birth. The book is very easy to read, practical and comes with a CD with relaxations and visualizations.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|THE BEST GAME, THE MOST FUN, KEEPS YOU AT THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT, PULLING YOUR HAIR AND GRITTING YOUR TEETH.
B00A0SLTCU|5.0|I think Total Recall is a decent movie and should have done a lot better at the box office.Total Recall was a victim of a botched marketing campaign which cost the movie several million dollars in ticket sells.
B00BLF9FOK|4.0|Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.<br /><br />Now that's what I'm talking about! It's been quite some time since we've seen Schwarzenegger in a lead role, but he comes back hard with his latest action flick, The Last Stand. I can't say that I've ever been a Schwarzenegger enthusiast by any means, but I understand his significance in the film industry so I've never been able to write him off completely. To be honest, I only watched The Last Stand out of sheer curiosity, but damn did I have fun. Achieving the perfect balance of action and comedy, The Last Stand manages to not only be enjoyable, but it kept me engaged the entire time.<br /><br />You follow Sheriff Ray Owens (Schwarzenegger), a former officer for the LAPD. After performing a job that went terribly wrong, Owens resigned from the department only to settle in Sommerton Junction, Arizona. A small little town that sees very little action, most crimes in the town are petty and forgettable, but that's about to change very soon. Owens receives word that international drug lord Gabriel Cortez (Eduardo Noriega) has escaped from the clutches of the FBI in Las Vegas and is headed toward Sommerton. After meeting some suspicious truckers and finding the local farmer dead, he has a gut feeling that everything is connected. So he groups up his band of misfits -- Deputy Sarah Torrence (Jaimie Alexander), Deputy Mike Figuerola (Luis Guzman), former Marine Frank Martinez (Rodrigo Santoro), and local whack-job Lewis Dinkum (Johnny Knoxville) -- to stop Cortez and his gang and bring him to justice.<br /><br />Some may argue that the story is merely there as an outline for the action, but I think that does a disservice to the writers and the performers. Yes, there's explosions, firefights, and the like, but there's more to the story than that. To me, it was more about a man finding peace within his past. Letting go of what was and enjoying what is. From the get-go you can tell that Owens is a troubled character, but until about half-way through you don't know why. Then once you hear his story you understand and it all makes sense. Not only that, but you begin to feel for him because you can see the pain he feels both emotionally and physically as the story plays out. It was really quite surprising how real everything felt.<br /><br />Still, if blood and guts aren't your thing then it would be best to avoid this. While The Last Stand may not be an over-the-top gore-fest, they weren't afraid to let their imagination's fly in the final action sequences. It should be noted that most of this is done for comedic effect and I was actually surprised at how much I laughed while watching this. There was a point within the final half-hour where I began to cry because I was laughing so hard. Even when I called out a sequence beforehand it was still hysterical because I was still laughing from something that happened a few seconds prior. I always enjoy a good story that doesn't take itself too seriously and The Last Stand definitely falls into that category.<br /><br />As I said, it's been awhile since we've seen Arnold take the lead, but it seemed like this role was made for him. Maybe it's his years of experience or just his ability to get into character, but I can't picture anyone else playing the troubled Sheriff Owens. He gives off this very confident vibe the entire time which helps make the role feel comfortable and less stiff. It's this comfortability that becomes the driving force for the whole movie, in my opinion. Whether it's Arnold's performance as Owens or Forest Whitaker's performance as Agent John Bannister, the viewer can be at ease because no actor feels out of place. Even the minor roles like Sarah and Lewis felt perfect and it's almost insane how spot-on the casting was across the board. It's obvious that Knoxville was there more for comedic effect, but I find it hard to complain when the role was so perfect.<br /><br />Finally, the film's score, composed by Korean composer Mowg, was excellent. While there wasn't a lot of compositions scattered throughout the scenes, the ones that were there felt right at home. Most of them had this very Western-y kind of vibe which suited the film perfectly. I personally enjoyed these pieces more than the some of the high-energy compositions found during the chase scenes and such, but that's mostly because they seemed a bit more creative in comparison.<br /><br />Overall Score: 8/10 - I don't say this too often, but what I really enjoyed about The Last Stand was that it was fun. Pure, simple fun that wasn't brought down by a nonsensical story. It has heart and drive, but it was also able to give you some nice firefights and a handful of laugh-out-loud moments. The end result is definitely better than I anticipated going in. If you had your eye on this I would recommend giving it a shot. It may not be groundbreaking, but, like I said, it's fun and it has a really solid cast.
B000001FSU|5.0|I love metal, I like most kinds of music but old school metal is my favorite.  I like Slayer, Metallica, Iron Maiden, Motorhead, Ozzy, Megadeth, Pantera, Judas Priest...the older the better is my preference in this genere, and Anthrax have earned their place among the greats.  They have 4 \\"must have\\" albums, Among the Living, Spreading the Disease, Persistance of Time, and this one...
B009EHDU7U|5.0|This was the best accidental read I have ever made. So bend over laughing funny and intelligently written. I think it sets a standard that other writers should aspire to. I adored the humour and the authors ability to continually loop in old storylines...right when it was required. Read this book NOW
B005EYP8PO|5.0|Achtung Baby was my first U2 ablum, loved it and listened to it all the time.  Now with the deluxe version I love it even more with the additional songs and remixes.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|After watching Blake Shelton for the first time on The Voice I decided to buy this CD.  I really like it.  I have never been a country western music fan, but this has changed my opinion on Country Music.  It is a lot of fun to listen to and is easy on the ears.
B000001FFR|5.0|I have much respect for Anthrax, these guys know how to rock and this album proves it.  Persistence of Time, Among the Living, State of Euphoria, and this, your metal collection isn't complete without them...
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is so stinkin' cute. It is super fun and not to mention free. Many happy hours have been passed on this game.<br />Only downside is quite a few of the missions at the beginning are social network based
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this game and I like how I can create my own town and do all that kind of stuff
140006922X|5.0|Good scholarly book, a great autobiography. And many sources backing up what is said. I recommend the book to anybody that wants to learn more about Jesus.
B005LAJ1HW|5.0|Prohibition era drama with plenty of action, an excellent plot, top shelf acting...and a fair dose of T&A if you're into that sort of thing.  Overall, A+, the people that wrote and produced, directed, acted, ALL should be up for awards
B001LF4IA6|3.0|I stayed away from this record for quite some time because of the negative feedback it initially received. Ever since its release most Bruce fans I've talked to hold this record in pretty low regard and even the Working on a Dream Tour had few of these songs featured night after night, making it seem as though Springsteen himself knew he had misfired with this one. Call me strange but I'm one of those who tends to like the records that others hate, so I figured this couldn't be as bad as some were claiming. Even Bruce's weaker albums (Human Touch, The Ghost of Tom Joad) have a few knockouts that keep me coming back. Often Bruce is at least able to maintain a good average in terms of songs and solid recordings so this should have been at least decent. In short: it kind of is and it kind of isn't.<br /><br />I have to give Bruce credit for going in full-on pop mode on this one. That's a shift that often alienates people but Springsteen seems to be long past the point of caring about hits and critical acclaim. That works in his favor and frees him to pursue whatever fancy may be on his mind; on the other hand it doesn't always lend itself to self-editing. What works here is pretty solid. \\"My Lucky Day\\" sounds like the kind of pop song Springsteen can write in his sleep but it's still fun and catchy enough that you don't really mind. \\"The Last Carnival\\" and bonus track \\"The Wrestler\\" manage to stand out because they contain the emotion and careful attention needed to make them effective. \\"Outlaw Pete\\" is an ambitious opener, an eight minute romp that returns Springsteen to his storyteller roots and interesting instrumental flourishes. I like it more now than I did at first but it tends to drag on just a bit too long and loses steam after about five minutes. \\"Good Eye\\" succeeds in coming up with something interesting and its old-school blues sound uses Bruce's distorted vocals to its advantage. It's entirely unique to the album and has some grit that many of the other tracks are missing. There are glimmers of a good album here but unfortunately it never quite materializes.<br /><br />The title track is decent but feels lifeless and uninspired, like Springsteen just threw it together and recorded it in one take. \\"Life Itself\\" and \\"This Life\\" are passable but feel rushed and devoid of any real energy. \\"What Love Can Do\\" shows some promise but passes by unremarkably; \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" is interesting but never really builds into anything memorable. \\"Kingdom of Days\\" and \\"Surprise, Surprise\\" are pure pop but manage to resonate with me on a basic level. They may be acquired tastes but in the right mood I can listen to them with ease. Perhaps nothing on the record feels so awkward as \\"Queen of the Supermarket\\", a tune so cheesy and overdone that it's almost laughable. The problem is that it takes itself too seriously and would have benefitted from a more quirky, fun arrangement. The sentiment behind the song may be sweet but Bruce's delivery and the multilayered production, not to mention some extremely cliche and corny lyrics, make it come off more like a parody than a testament to the beauty of hard-working cashiers. This one should have been relegated to a b-side.<br /><br />The songs may not be the strongest set he's ever penned but they're hampered even further by flat production, leaving the band wallowing in a blurry mess of sound that fails to stand out or lend any sonic punch to these tunes. Bruce's voice sounds flat and distant, almost as if he's off singing in another room, sounding bored and unattached to most of these songs. There's a lack of energy throughout much of this record that lends credence to the idea that's it's a rushed and unpolished effort that should have either been shelved or been reworked into something more concrete. It has a few keepers and it's nice to see him attempt some joy in his writing; the problem is that it never comes together as a whole. Instead of telling a great story it feels disconnected and tired. Some of these tunes are almost apathetic and feel like Bruce is on autopilot. Many of them are lacking the emotional resonance that they so desperately need in order to be effective. Lyrically they feel predictable and unimaginative, devoid of the usual depth and mystery that Bruce is typically known for. It seems clear that he wanted this release to coincide with Obama's inauguration but in the process he sacrificed some quality for timeliness.<br /><br />I'll admit this record has grown on me slightly over time but I have to agree with the fans who had reservations about this one. It may just be his worst album to date and one where a few good songs aren't enough to hold up the weaker ones. Springsteen may have been working a dream but he would have been better served delivering a finished one.d and tired. Some of these tunes are almost apathetic and feel like Bruce is on autopilot.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really like this app, it is addicting and it just keeps rolling along. Not to hard for the kids
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|My grandson gave the book to me for my birthday with a high  recommendation. Having served in the Navy back in the 50's I  have a strong feeling for the Seals and this story of Adam Brown makes me so proud of our young men and women serving our great nation  today under very difficult circumstances. May God bless them as they continue the good fight. This book has inspired me to be a better man in my Christian Life and my appreciation of the USA
B0089K7DGW|5.0|Prohibition era drama with plenty of action, an excellent plot, top shelf acting...and a fair dose of T&A if you're into that sort of thing.  Overall, A+, the people that wrote and produced, directed, acted, ALL should be up for awards
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I would have given this a 4.5 -- I loved the creativity and character development. Very fun to read. Not (happily) what I expected as a &#34;Stephen King&#34; novel--no horror outright. Just the malevolent and creepy uneasiness of 'things' that perhaps become animate. The authors words are, &#34;The past is obdurate&#34;.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I like this app. The rewards are nice and add up pretty quickly. The only down side I see is that the radar ,is too small and it is hard to tell where the cities are. Other than that, it is a nice app.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|What a fabulous story. Sometimes it is hard to remember that Enzo is a DOG, not a person. The imagery about racing, Seattle, the insights from the dog.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|Really fun and challenging, but not so hard that it becomes frustrating. Like the scenery and rooms. Cozy feeling and mysterious at the same time.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I can't stop playing this game even though I've got to a stage where I'm waiting hours for something to happen
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Simply put this was a fantastic book.  It's not an edge-of-your-seat thriller or a book on war tactics.  The zombie ickyness is kept low.  This is more about the survivors and their psyche now that most of the trama is done.  I will read this book again and again for years to come.
B001ILFUDM|5.0|What can I say Pinocchio is a classic and this combo is worth the money and time, I would recommend for all ages!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone that wants to make it easy to use your kindle. It is as it is advertised.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Never thought I would really get into this series but I am totally hooked. Love/hate relationship with Mary & love the staff :)
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I found it fascinating to see how things were done it that era.  I love the grandmothers dry whit and can not wait to see what happens in Season 4.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The old weather channel app was wonderful. This one drains my battery and is confusing. I will be deleting it as soon as I can find another weather app.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Phillip has done well for himself, his family, and his community.  Your season of American Idol was the best!  Keep up the good work!
1603580557|5.0|I am new to system thinking and this book is a great book. The language is easy to follow, and the content is very thought-provoking. The system level view offers brand new insights into many chronic problems.
B0064QNS62|4.0|If you liked Marv in his first game you'll love this one even more. More challenges, more treasures, what's not to love.
B009YN2M7S|4.0|In true Nicholas Sparks fashion, this book is bittersweet. It shows how love can develop into hate over time. It also shows that by not sharing your demons with the one you love you risk others perceiving something about you.  I enjoyed the book though disagreed with some aspects.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Another terrific book by Khaled Hosseini.  I find his writing touching and his books full of humanity.  Very much worth the read.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Wonderfully written. You cannot put the book down. What often looks calm on the surface of human emotional life can be horridly twisted at depth. Bravo JKR!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|It truly takes your breath away. your on the edge of your seat and you want to put it down but its truly impossible to do because  its to amazing. It's a MUST read.
B005UD1D62|5.0|I just love that Lauren decided to carry on the LA candy series.  I couldn't put this down.  Was so happy to find she wrote a series
B006LSZECO|2.0|I bought this book hoping it would be a great read based on the reviews and the fact that it was on the best sellers list.  Forget it.  Not worth the money.  Wait until it's in the 3.99 or less category...you might not feel so cheated then.  The closure of the book?  Well, there was no closure.  It was like the author hit a writer's block and said \\"I think I'll stop here.\\"  Ridiculous waste of time.
B004S9AK3G|5.0|A novel of great integrity. A story of  real historical, cultural and social interest. This is the context of love, struggles, ambition within a changing world of society and church. It is told in a way that grips, holds and truly engages. I read it about a year ago and on a second reading found it fresh and exciting yet again.<br />Thanks Ken<br /><br />Jim CLEARY
B009VSW15Y|5.0|I my HD camera it take nice pictures, The only thing is that it is hard to take pictures of other people .I took a picture of myself<br />and it was very good. I do Like it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I particularly like being able to play games that have a known winning potential such as choosing a deal that can be won.
B000W94FIW|3.0|typical paulo cohelo's writing style.inspiring, motivating and captivating.<br />but very deep and philosophicaly plot line. way too much for a normal person's mind to grasp.<br />very short novel and events were unfolding at very high pace which the readers were unable to get the depth of the story.<br />some thoughts were crisp and short and refused to offer deeper meaning leaving to the readers to interpret partially.<br /><br />But definitely offers a great insight into deeper meaning of love and connects religion with love.
1781162646|5.0|I am a lifelong fan of SK so I will admit to being biased.  But, I loved this book.  He is SUCH a good story teller.  This novel has more of a nostalgic tone, much like Stand by Me (The Body as it is also known) and not the creep out factor of many of his other tales.  That being said, Devon's &#34;coming of age&#34; story keeps you hooked. If you are looking for a fun summer read, I would highly recommend it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is so easy to use and it does what it says!  Google comes out with another great product for such a low price.  I got this and my new nexus 7 at the same time and have enjoyed streaming Netflix, Youtube and Google play music to my TV seamlessly.  Also chromebook works flawlessly while streamline to the TV (viewing photo slide, internet pages, ect).  Great product!
B005QYKD4I|3.0|Not a bad movie... for the third installment.  Like most sequels, it loses some of what made the original so good.
0061992860|2.0|Not sure why this book is so highly regarded, the majority of the information is obsolete and inaccurate.  Beside the section on edible plants I did not find much usuable information in this book.  Most of it seems to be geared towards surviving if your plane crashed down in the arctic- seriously there is advice about how and where to club seals.  Almost every section of the book warns you to &#34;stay with the wreck as long as possible&#34;.  I am just guessing that this is not the type of survival info most people are after but maybe I am wrong.  I thought the shelter building section was pretty bad and most of the technics were not usable in North America, we do not have banana leaves in great abundance to weave a roof for a shelter.  There was also a lack of follow through in much of the guidance, a lot of important detail was missing making it hard to really comprehend  some of the technics.  This book was mildly entertaining but not the book you want in your bug out bag, at least not the only one.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Completely unexpected to love this series.. Gave it a shot anyways, and now I'm hooked! Highly recommended for both males & females..
B008P1EWIM|2.0|Weather Live is a overall, decent app. Although the layout is quite interesting, it falls short in terms of accuracy. Half the time, not only does it predict the weather inaccurately, it also messes up the current conditions! This is unacceptable for a paid app. Not only, look at the permissions. It wants to access your running tasks. I have yet to see a place in this app where it needs to know what apps you're running.<br />Pros<br />Neat layout<br />Cons<br />Inaccurate predictions<br />Data-mining permissions
B003Z2LAAO|3.0|Thought this might have been a little newer..<br />Thought it was a little slow and drug on in places...<br />Seemed to have a sort of political agenda rather than being about the canyon
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I could play this game all night...if only there were more rooms. I am looking forward to updates with additional rooms.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love it! Can't wait to progress in the game! Love the interactive features! Mini games are fun. Don't like having to buy gems and coins but they can be earned over time.
B003WE9TU8|4.0|An unexpected pleasure to read. Not focused on the gore or dwelling on the zombies, this novel explored the global political ramifications of an unknown pathogen ravaging the population. As such, it was insightful, honest and very disturbing.
B00DU74U74|3.0|I liked the book better and I know everyone says that but they left a LOT of stuff out but they still did a good job
B0037QM8YA|5.0|Though the storyline is not a pleasant one. I appreciated its raw realism. The acting by all the cast was excellent!
B0015DROBO|5.0|This book took a little while to develop the characters, but then it was a page turner!!! There were lots of plot twists, and it was really well-written!
B004KPX4W2|5.0|It was a fun and entertaining movie.  Can't complain for the price I paid for rental.  HD on PS3 was very nice too.
B006O5XYWG|5.0|The movie came quicker than expected.<br />This movie is awesome and so mush better than it original predecessors.<br />The graphics and audio content are amazing.<br />I recommend it to anyone
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I'm reading this book and I'm loving every chapter more and more. I love fantasy novels and lately I wasn't feeling move by any book. Best sellers turned into movies were interesting and made me think twice but this made me crazy and alive!<br />I recommend this book and the movie. They are different but they give the same delicious flavor to reading.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I've only used it for one 15 mile trip so far but it delivers power to both my gps and my samsung epic 4g with no problem.  I needed something that would cut down on the clutter of cables as everything is mounted on the handlebar of my motorcycle.  This fits the bill nicely.  Phone charged from 34% to 47% in the 20 minute commute to work this morning while listening to music via bluetooth all the way.
B00DHNBPA6|5.0|I was a big fan of the first two Evil Dead movies. Like everybody else I was apprehensive about a new movie blaspheming and ruining the franchise, but I was very pleasantly surprised. There are numerous nods to the original throughout this movie that are fun for fans (original car, 'flying' camera shots through the woods etc). This one has a more serious, scary tone and style than Evil Dead 2 or Army of Darkness and is very frightening in its own right. It does retain the over-the-top gore and frantic feel of the originals. This remake keeps ratcheting up the tension until the very end, and (spoiler) even manages to make badass use of the original Homelite chainsaw. A worthy remake for sure, and one I'll watch over and over.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|This game is fun if you are patient. The prices for coin stuff is high,  but you can earn them easily if you are not in a rush. some things need to be fixed. For example, in training,  you can't actually wat h your horse because you need to pay attention to the running bar at the bottom of the screen.<br />Overall, though, it is a good game with good graphics.  The best part is that it doesn't eat my battery life like some games do!<br /><br />[Edited] I demoted this down a star because around level 10 ads start showing up in the middle of the game. They take you out of the game and after you x out of them it takes a long time to take you back to the game. Really annoying! Stalls game play and ruins the whole feel of the game.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I had to read it for school so that was perfect.It was a great book and I think other children will love it too!:)
B004GYY714|5.0|If you love fishing you need to get this  Tuneln radio.  every Sat. and Sunday there are fishing Boat reports out of San Diego Ca.<br /> very happy you can get a station from over 250 miles away it is a very clear station  you get most of the radio stations you love TuneIn Radio]] and its FREE from Amazon
B003G4W49C|5.0|This will set you up for a totally different mind set. With the movie on the way, it is a must to read NOW.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Amazing and addicting game! Downloaded it on my kindle and my phone! I can't stop playing it! My five year old son loves it too

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is my favorite book.  It's a beautifully written,  one of a kind love story that will stay with you forever .
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|fun and funny. kids whistle along with the minions. great entertainment for quick relief from boredom when just sitting and waiting.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so amazing I love it. It is so realistic and it is an amazing way to pass the time
B005S9EJ14|5.0|SUPERB ACTING BY MY FAVORITE STARS!  BEAUTIFUL STORY!  COLORFUL SCENERY!  THE BEST COSTUMING<br />I'VE SEEN IN ANY RECENT MOVIE  I LOVED THE CARE TAKEN WITH THE ELDER ADULTS  AND THE TENDER WAY<br />THE &#34;GAY&#34; STORY UNFOLDED
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This book reminds you to never give up. To look upon the stars and believe of all the directions you can go in life. Life is a beautiful gift and as we make our journey we will fall and rise again. \\"The obstacle is the path\\" Zen proverb. And the story of this shepherd shows you life brings you happiness as long as you are patient and kind. Love this book.
B003PBB4ME|1.0|Video motion is still very rough.  Video Camera will need a viewing window that can pivot so you can be able to view what is being recorded.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I love theses book they just make my mind go boom and my imagination goes crazy sometimes. I really do love it
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Wow this game is awesome you should play it my brother recommend this to me and now I'm doing the same to you
B009XIXVU6|4.0|A family that is intertwined with others in this Afgan community.  Story is told from several different characters view going backward and forward in time. Enjoyable read.
B002SGYPS2|4.0|Funny movie.  Great acting by Carrey.  Good for young teen.  Fun to discuss after viewing.  Looking for more movies like this one.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Good movie...never able to predict what is happening. Loved it!would recommend this for any SciFi lover.  Cannot wait for 3 to come out!
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|As your zombie moves go, this was quite cheeky, entertaining and droll! Nick Hoult and his fellow zombie, Rob Courdry, are very funny. If any of you saw ADVENTURELAND -- a really superb movie, go rent it!! -- and liked it, you'll likely go for this as well. A similar off-beat sensibility.
1442359919|4.0|Joyland was an interesting story.  I have read many of Stephen King's books and found it different in that it was more of a mystery than  many of his novels which contain  a lot of death and violence.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|No matter how many times they are destroyed , you know that they are coming back bigger and even worst then before .
B008R14YBK|5.0|She was very excited and pleased with this CD.  She loves everything Disney!  Also likes to sing and dance to these CD's.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Bought this as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter and of course she was very pleased as she had seen the movie in a theater.
B007K3JFUQ|4.0|Takes the old stories and gives them a new action packed look . Still smart and deductive but with physical action the old ones didn't have .
B009LQKHIO|5.0|What a wonderful book, could not put it down.  I would highly recommend this book to your readers.  Could not believe it was a free book!
B009WUAK2M|3.0|Action was fun to see but storyline was blah and of even their cheesy lines you expect to hear were poorly placed.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This Is A FREE App That Everyone Should Try If Enjoy Playing Bingo. A VERY FUN GAME! And Addicting. Hope Everyone Downloads This App If They Choose Too. Have A Nice Day. I Still Enjoy The Game But I Am Unable To Update This App.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|It was fun seeing all the old guys do this and parady their old characters and roles.  Very predictable plot, but who cares.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|The action was cool and so was the story but they just both seemed lacking. This could have had more depth and extended to maybe a short series. But as a movie it feels like a lot of little bits of info thrown together to make a movie.
0316223239|5.0|This wonderful book answers the questions we have after the 'happy endings' when rescue of kidnapping victims takes place. What is it like to try to raise a child in solitary confinement since birth? And how does a mother cope with what follows? A well-conceived and beautifully written book. I highly recommend it.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Love the action and the storyline. The funny touches were refectory placed as well. We watch this over and over all the time.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|But I just bought the book so that Reza Aslan can get more money off of riling up stupid, reactionary \\"Christians\\" who are mad that we don't live in a theocracy.  I will read it out of spite, probably not enjoy it all that much given how little interest I have in any version of Jesus that doesn't ride a dinosaur and play a Flying V or hunt vampires, but I will remind myself that I put money in the pocket of a man who is making millions of sub-literate tools sputter and possibly (hopefully!) stroke out into an early grave with their delicious, delicious outrage.<br /><br />Hail Satan!
B008XKSW7M|4.0|I loved the different angles on pregnancy and what relationships go thru. Even though the movie was light hearted it showed the true ups and downs that people go thru.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Best. Book. Ever. It even had me crying at one point. I could read this over and over again, I highly recommend it
140006922X|5.0|Aslan brings and interesting and informative perspective, giving insight into what is, presumably, a well-known and much discussed topic. Well done.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This book is a very difficult read for me. The main character never feels sorry for himself, yet he lives an unimaginably miserable life of pain and suffering. One day I will reread this book, but not soon. Love, sacrifice and the will to live are told here for everyone to experience. May I never suffer the way these characters did.
B00CDXOXB4|5.0|Love, love, love this movie. Promoted as a love story (I had not read the book), so I didn't know it was a thriller too. Defintely recommend.
1423140591|5.0|very good story line keeps you totally envolved in the books. and makes you eager to read the next one.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|best program on the telly  great cast and story .costumes are so historic. waiting for it to return in sept
0307477479|4.0|Well - that was interesting! It definitely bordered on bizarre at times and I started out feeling like she was trying to hard to be creative or out there, but I had to kind of let that go b/c even the weirdness really was good! It was definitely &#34;real&#34; literature and a nice un-break from all of my dumb summer reading!<br /><br />Each section reads a bit like a short story, which at first annoyed me b/c I'm not a huge fan of short stories, but again, I was won over b/c they (it) were (was) good! Damn it! The characters from all of the stories/chapters are connected. They seemed less connected at the beginning, but I thought she did a good job of using the sections/stories to weave the characters together more fully by the end. And while it wasn't the most emotional, or emotionally satisfying, book ever (i.e., it is no &#34;The Help&#34; or something like that - it as at least as much about the structure and style as the story), I thought she did a good job of not compromising emotion for intellectualism. I still was interested in, and somewhat impacted by, the characters.<br /><br />This book was pretty much the opposite of a &#34;good, old-fashioned story&#34; (which is what I call books like &#34;The Help&#34; - I keep using that one as an example b/c most people have read it, and it's a great version of that type of book!). However, it was a very good, MODERN-&#34;fashioned&#34; story!<br /><br />Looking forward to discussing this in book club - I think everyone will have strong reactions to the way it was structured, etc.
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|With the sequel getting ready to be released I wanted to check this movie out.  I'm glad I did, it has a perfect combonation of action, comedy, story and a perfect cast.  You rarely come across a movie with these elements and they actually pull it off, in this case it's perfection.  If you have not had the chance to see this movie, there is no better time, with the great price from Amazon and the second movie right around the corner, this is a must see movie.
B000JQV68A|1.0|Wow. This was extremely disappointing. I read this to finish off Fitzgerald - I read Gatsby in high school (of course), This Side of Paradise during college, which I LOVED - I read it on my own and it's a coming of age story and I read it at the perfect time. I read Tender is the Night sometime after that (grad school?) and didn't love it, but it was alright, and I've been meaning to get to this last one for awhile. It was, unfortunately, by far the worst.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I'm not really a headphone connoisseur, but these have been great so far.  They stretch all the way around my room, so I can listen to music in bed and game and such.
B00881VLCE|1.0|It was too hard to put all of the pieces together and get them out of the row of pieces. I got so frustrated that I deleted it the same day I bought it. I would not recommend it at all.
0307887448|5.0|Customer service was great on this book.  But that's not what I want to talk about. This book. Oh. my. gosh. This book. I have had my eye on this book for awhile now, just never had the chance to pick it up until someone gave me a giftcard for Amazon. This was THE FIRST book I thought of. And boy, when I say buying this book was one of the best choices I've ever made, I am not kidding. This book was great! Crammed full of so many referances to books, tv shows and old games, this book have me on the edge of my seat. I couldn't put it down. Definitely worth it.
B001EC0OMM|5.0|No one can beat Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart as lead actors.  Kate Hepburn and the young woman that played the photographer were also wonderful. What a treat!
0439023513|5.0|I am a huge fan of The Hunger Games. The movie, not so much. But the books are just great. Great characters, great plot. Really gets you thinking.
B004PR71JC|5.0|Great music, the kids love all of the songs, unfortunately ask to listen to this twice a day. Great soundtrack anyway!
0439023491|5.0|I am a huge fan of The Hunger Games. The movie, not so much. But the books are just great. Great characters, great plot. Really gets you thinking.

B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|When you get killed you will throw your device across the room. It is the scariest game I have ever played in my life.
B0083B3KOQ|5.0|Converts files as advertised and was quick about the task. Not something I need everyday but when I do I'm confident this product will just work.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love this book can't wait for the movies to come out as well.  Very intriguing couldn't put it down.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|If you the open-minded, you'll love this book. If you are prejudiced, you'll hate this book. I am glad to see a non-Jew, non-Christian write about the historical Jess as well as the Jess-the-Christ scheme -- this author is a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />Well worth the price. A good read. I recommend.
B005UEGLJ0|5.0|Great Album!!!! I would highly recommend this album to all Fuzion fans. The cover is a little chessy but the music makes up for it.
B001NHNG64|4.0|I just found the author last week. I've read all the Patterson, Parker, brad Thorn and was looking for something as good.<br />The character &#34;Reacher&#34; is a very good read. He has so much back history and intelligence. He usually out thinks the bad guys and turns the tables on them most of the time. I can say with no problem that Lee Child is a very good writer
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I've seen this movie few times but when i saw it again on 3D version at home it blew my mind again amazing picture in full screen just like in the theaters’ must have it as a demo on how good 3D movies are!
B000W177GM|2.0|I have the vinyl version of this album and it's much fuller than this MP3 knockoff. Whole bass and brass lines have been dropped (for example, in \\"Bringing It Back). This isn't worth the price, and it isn't true to the work of a great musician.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|This was a really funny and truthful movie! Some men could learn a lot from watching this!! Totally enjoyable and entertaining movie!! Highly recommend it!!
B005USZYDU|5.0|I am very satisfied with this book. The perfect book for my summer reading book report! It was intense and suspenseful,I felt as if I was actually in the book! The end was a perfect wrap up to the tale. If you like suspense and intense emotion, then this is your book!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Addictive and fun.  Great way to use your brain.  Can not wait to get additional levels. I love the game.
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|Still remains one of the best mob movies ever made. If you liked the Sopranos you will love this'<br />See how long it takes to place the actor common to both
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game really makes you search and think. Great for passing the time! Wish I had found this one sooner
B008IBPMZG|5.0|I am addicted to Downton Abbey.  It's the best written / acted series on TV.  You won't be disappointed by watching this series.
B005544TRQ|5.0|My wife and I were riveted from the very first episode. Amazing show and all the characters are great and well developed.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Agree with others who have enjoyed this game. Worth the cost and time. Want more of the same. Keep it up, creators.
B006RZFACU|5.0|Great for kids I read it to my child and he loved  especially the birthday part otherwise it was good
B005544V6A|5.0|So SUITS is a terrific show with lots of fun acting (the character Donna, especially), good stories, and very attractive people.  I also adore Gina Torres; she basically can do no wrong.  I own the DVD, but was a work so I used the Amazon streaming, which worked great, though we do have a good wifi connection.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|One of the few movies that I've ever given a perfect 10/10 score, and this bundle features more CD's than you'll ever want to be played on virtually any platform you ever want.
B0058VW36U|4.0|My 5 year old loves it. The game is challenging and helps develope great hand eye quordination. We are glad we bought it.
0515149489|5.0|I really enjoyed the storyline. Roberts does a good job of adding interesting info into her novels, you learn about the topic.
B0060AY6FO|2.0|The overall premise of the novel is clear from the title, death comes to Pemberley. On the eve of a long planned ball, Elizabeth's sister Lydia arrives unexpectedly, and uninvited, shrieking of gunshots in the woods, and her husband and his friend missing. Darcy and Colonel Fitzwilliam leave to investigate, discovering Wickham standing over his friends body, crying that \\"It is all my fault.\\" After this somewhat interesting beginning, the book very quickly loses steam. The majority of the book the characters rehash the beginning over and over. First Darcy and Fitzwilliam discuss their opinions of the startling circumstances. Then they repeat them to the constable. Then they repeat the story at an inquest. And then everyone repeats it at the trial of Mr. Wickham. There are no twists or turns to these retellings. No surprises or revelations as one might expect in a mystery novel. No one is searching for an alternative murderer. The story feels very dull and stuffy. Probably worst of all, Darcy and Elizabeth rarely speak to each other, or spend much time in each other's company. I'm sure most people who decide to read \\"Death Comes to Pemberley\\" do so because they are fans of Pride and Prejudice. To have but the barest hint of affection and love between such beloved characters seems like a huge oversight.<br /><br />Overall I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, neither as a murder mystery, nor to fans of Pride and Prejudice.
B00AEFY66U|5.0|Awesome movie...the actors and action were SO much more realistic and believable.  I guess in the new age of computer animation and creating entire scenes against the green screen is what folks want now..  I DON'T
B0079XPUOW|5.0|An absolute must read for sci-fi fans. The concept is wonderful and well executed, and had me laughing out loud on the couch. If you ever enjoyed a Star Trek series, do yourself the favor of reading this.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|We can never have too many Heros in our lives. Very well done. Love the special effects. A very nice movie.
B004EPYZSU|5.0|Great action pacted movie with great graphics and packed with a star studded cast. The kind of movie you can watch over and over.
1878424319|5.0|This was an eye-opener. I recommend to anyone looking for guidance in setting themselves up for success. It really helps you self-reflect and understand the process of life and why we are here.
B0019LZV4E|4.0|I love this movie<br />It's always had an appeal to me<br />So I am inclined to sing it's praises but I would argue that the reason I like it, is that, it is good. While the plot is simple(and this is the weakness of the movie), it is powerful and speaks, however superficially, to larger themes in life.<br />Artistically and cinematically, the story is beautifully portrayed from the beginning credits to Sweeney Todd setting foot in London and the moment carries throughout the film.<br />Though there's subtle dark comedy in the film it's ultimately a tragedy.<br />And the story does speak to something in life and says something about life and the world. It says something beyond just telling a story.<br />The characterization is good as well. The character of Ms. Lovett is perfectly realized and there's some complexity there beneath the surface.<br />The visual stylism and the great use of color grading throughout the film really contribute to this films greatness. The songs are well written and sung well. Though it's not operatic or virtuously technical, there is something truly emotive about Johnny Depp's singing and he handle's keeping it technically sound just fine.<br />A great enjoyable movie for the darkly inclined.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Have read the entire series and loved it. My husband and dad and brother also give it a thumbs up. We read mostly science fiction fantasy, and this book is one of my favorites!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|The script in this program is excellent.  The dialogue is fast, so it keeps you on your feet.  Expect the unexpected just as in the corporate world.  Well casted, each is equally strong in their role.
B0025WX2YW|5.0|Loved every minute, well maybe not the executions but amazing costume drama with great actors! Jonathon Rhys Meyers is perfect!
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I love all the Quell games... challenging puzzles hat grow and teach you through gameplay, love the atmosphere that these are set in.  I love these!
B008PEXCBM|4.0|My 13 year old surprised me when he asked to rent this.  As he is a seasoned zombie hunter and MW3 addict it was great to see that he could appreciate the story and not get hung up on the dancing and over-acting...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is good for  people who luv horses.Also this app could be for little kids playing the mini games and learning wildlife
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I already have a smart TV, and PS3. I prefer to use PS3 for Youtube because my smart TV apps for Youtube is laggy. Netflix app on my TV is flawless.<br /><br />At $35 I didn't think it was worth it. But with Netflix deal, it would cost me only $11. I already have Netflix, so it is not like I am adding a new service.<br /><br />I received it yesterday. I spent at least an hour trying to set it up. The problem was not easy to diagnose. Chromecast's help said that I probably have Ip/Client Isolation enabled. I logged into FIOS modem, but didn't see any setting that remotely resembled IP/Client Isolation. After a while I found the answer online. I had to disable IGMP Proxy under advanced settings. After disabling it, it just worked.<br /><br />I was able to use my old old cellphone HTC Evo and Chromebook. Watching Youtube was better experience, especially searching for the videos. Another use was browsing Facebook photos. In past, we would usually connect our laptop to TV and then browse to photos folder and start a slideshow. But now can just open our Chromebook (which is always on our coffee table) and start Facebook or Flickr.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone without smart TV/PS3/360/other streaming devices and perhaps also for displaying personal photos when friends and family comes over.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|A lovely story  that is ageless.  The  format  of different  perspectives  worked  very well.  I would recommend it  on all required  reading  lists.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Missed it in the movie theaters and it really did not disappoint. Great story and acting. Pretty amazing that it's a true story. So fortunate for all involved to have met and become a family.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Best bond flick ever. I don't like Bond movies but this totally rejuvenated the franchise. Daniel Greg is hot and the women are in control for the most part
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have played this for years on my computer and I am now enjoying it on my Kindle! Thank you.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I picked up the series knowing the movie was coming out. I was hooked! Read all 5 books in two weeks. Can't wait for book six to come out next year.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app . . . it has so many nice options. I enjoy comparing different versions and how quickly I can look up verses.
B000FC1AGG|4.0|Very cute story.  Fun and light reading to help you get away from any stress in life.  I recommend it
B0097C8XL0|4.0|I have enjoyed this fun, mindless game until just recently when the game started freezing up on me. As long as I switch to another penguin I can usually resume play, but it is annoying.
B00005UWMX|1.0|This movie would not play on my DVD.  Is it because it came from overseas?  I'd really like to get my money back.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|A wonderful insight into change in relationships and development of belief in self. Takes the reader along the journey of self discovery.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|This movie is awesome, the actors are great, the script is awesome, overall there is nothing bad to say about it.
034580404X|5.0|very good good printing good material over all worth it very nice i love it still reading and reading thank you!
B006Q2LTRO|2.0|This was terrible! I don't know what I expected but I really did not like this! Would not order again!
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|I was expecting it to be funnier.  Was only really funny a couple of times.  Otherwise it was kind of sad.  I don't think I've ever heard o many F words in one movie before, especially coming from the children.  That left a bad taste in my mouth.  Being someone who is married and 40 years old, I could only relate to a couple of things.  I loved the actors, just not the writing so much.  I wouldn't recommend it.
B007N85POS|5.0|I  LOVE  the.  Adorable twist they put on it!  I love all the angry birds and my only complaint is that the Star Wars edition is very very EXPENSIVE  3  dollars for a game I might not even like hmmm. The others are free !!!  I don't see what makes the Star Wars edition so special that it has to be that expensive!!!!
0307394549|4.0|To be honest, I've only made like two recipes from this book.  But, they were delicious.  I think I just like looking at all the pictures.  If you like a cookbook with pictures, this is a great one.
B00CFA222M|3.0|very average but a good family movie. don't watch to late you might start counting sheep. 1 sheep 2 sheep 3 sheep 4 sheep!
B007GE2H3G|5.0|enjoyed this animated movie. I read the adventures of Tintin in the comic books when I was young.<br />The animation was gorgeous.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Everything he does is beautiful.  Wish he did more concerts in the US.  I have all his recordings and will continue to purchase each new one.
B001B6PBBK|5.0|murphy is adorable...romantic, chick flick.  Do your self a favor and watch this movie.  RIP Brittany.  Only the good die young.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|The Hobbit movie is an engaging film (mostly), but does not deliver the story as well as I'd hoped.  The amusing bits are there as the Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, tries to navigate the new world of adventuring, but the drama of the dwarves plight is a bit too heavily told, as if we, the audience, wouldn't quite catch on to the sadness of the Dwarves plight unless it's dropped upon us like an anvil.  The foreshadowing of the Lord of the Rings is a bit heavy too, though Ian McKellen shows all the coming sorrow of Middle Earth in one beautiful facial expression.  While not what I'd hoped for, The Hobbit is still a film well worth watching, and I look forward to seeing the next installment when it arrives.
B004TMPJP6|4.0|This program allows developing multiple lists and tracking notes. subtasks are available but I haven't used that feature yet. I have no real complaints.
B006LXQID8|4.0|Amelie is a quirky, fun film that is charming from beginning to end.  Amelie is an introverted young French girl that feels for the down-trodden and sad of her world and sets out (by way of experiment) to do something about it.  The narration keeps the action moving and the quirky characters are a delight.  Even when Tautou looks straight into the camera and makes a statement to the audience, you are not jarred, but it's more as if you have become a conspirator to the action.  As a parting gift the film leaves with you, for a short time, the memory of its gracious and biting charm.
0345529057|5.0|Excellent price for the first four books in this incredible series! Received delivery ahead of schedule and have been hooked since page one.
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|Kanye West has done it again! Its crazy how talented this man is. Get ready for a wild ride with this one though. Its a jungle full of thorns and boobie traps, but for some reason you enjoy every minute of it
B008MM9630|5.0|I believe this game is the best farm building game ever its just a little better than the game 'farm frenzy'.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|Awesome game... love to play this game all the time... Even my kids know how to play this game.. There exited to play..
0792839749|5.0|Wonderful movie for the whole family to watch together. Good wholesome viewing with a lovely moral for everyone to learn.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|I am using this on my sailboat with the Polar Navy charting program and find the combination to be very useful.  For less than $100. you can have a great chart plotter package right on your laptop.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|Wonderful movie for the whole family to watch together. Good wholesome viewing with a lovely moral for everyone to learn.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Although very poignant and painful at times. the 3rd season does not disappoint!  Maggie is simply a nickname for magnificent!
031236198X|5.0|A great book for any organization.  My entire management team read it and it has changed the way we view challenges in our business.
B000OXHRRC|5.0|Russell Crowe acts with childlike humor in this surprising, pleasant movie.  No pain, no violence, just entertainment.<br />Visually beautiful scenery and sets.
B000K8EQ5W|5.0|I love romantic movies and this was very good.  It wasn't explainable but it had all the emotions of two people who grow to love each other.  I'll actually rent it again.  And Bullock and Reeves are outstanding together - as always.
B003ES61EE|3.0|This is a standard lens cleaning pen system. I bought it because it was less expensive than its counterparts (e.g. Nikon), but I found the cap to the pad fell off very easily just sitting in my bag.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I didn't think id like this game but man is it ever fun to play. Its challenging and fun for all age groups,my 4yr old to my 22yr old love to play. If you like subway surfers,temple run,or any game like it you will enjoy collecting bananas riding unicorn and beating the boss's. The only thing that would make the game better is if  you collected more coins.
B000SGSU58|4.0|As usual Connelly made harry Bosch real.  Enjoy the suspence of the book.  Keeps you guess throuht out the book.
B006VFLIYK|3.0|not enough violence if that is why you  read the Reacher books. not a bad book just not what I expected.
B004VFK5LO|5.0|This movie has it all: sensational crimes, infamous serial killers, an incredible cast, and a smart screenplay that showcases them all. I see Copycat as a genre classic. Not often do we see Siqourney Weaver as the vulnerable female. Holly Hunter compliments her beautifully in a quirky but solid performance. Its just a good watch if you like crime drama, suspense, and just a touch of &#34;soft horror&#34;.
140006922X|4.0|Having read the library copy I've ordered my own for future reference.  It's a reasonable addition to any library on the history of religion, and well written enough to be an enjoyable read as well (often not the case with works from academics, sadly).
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My four year old son loves this app; I got hooked on it as well!  I have never had a problem with My Horse.  It needs more competitions because we have won all of them; but still fun.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|I really enjoyed the older, simpler version better. This was fun and imaginative and would probably be enjoyed by a younger crowd. As a post-social security eligibility player, I was a bit daunted!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|As the title says it started out kind of slow and I had a little trouble getting into it  But sticking it out was well worth the ride.  A great summer read.<br />My rating of 4 reflects my personal opinion of the ending. Hopefully she set it up for a sequel.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is just a wonderful series!  The actors are wonderful, the story engaging and the history enlightening. I really enjoy the ability to watch episode after episode on my Kindle, easily keeping up with the storyline.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I used to play this game on  &quot;coolmath.com&quot;  and l loved the game. Now it's finally here! The game is challenging, fun and the game is a great time passer.
B007PVHMCG|3.0|I bought this for my son since he is a huge minecraft fan.  We were both disappointed at the size of the box and overall build.  Not worth $35
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its not that fun. but its free. wouldn't pay money for this game. its like subway surfers. it takes forever to load. going to be deleting it now
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|My 6 year old nephew loves it!  I even enjoy playing it.  It is very engaging and the graphics are awesome.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|This is as much of a Sci Fi movie as it gets as it is set in the future but there are no phasers to stun people with officially.  I heard this movie was good before I ever saw it and agree with those early ratings.  There are people dressed in funny clothes and they act a little weird but the story line is good as well as the acting.  It is worth the time spent to watch.
B0037A4ILC|5.0|The quality of Northface was worth obtaining and adding to the DVD library.  It held my attention.  The ending was totally a conclusion that completed the story line.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|When I first looked at this app I thought it was ridiculous...connecting the dots, really?  But it was a featured app and had a good rating so I decided to check it out, sure that I would last about ten minutes before I was bored out of my mind.  Several hours and 90 levels later I discovered that it was not only enjoyable but I'm quite good at it!  I really can't explain it...I don't know why it's so much fun...but there it is.  The subtle watery sounds make the untimed games quite relaxing.  You probably won't believe it until you try it yourself!
B009KG7EMC|4.0|Expendables 2 is an action-oriented DVD.  The story line is somewhat far-fetched.  It is a typical Stallone movie - lots of gun play.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I like how you make money when off the game. Best building game I have ever played. Keep up the great work.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|This DVD set is an excellent introduction to the whole saga.  Certain events in the DVD/story line were completely unexpected.  Excellent quality DVD.  Great addition to my DVD library.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Very great graphics! Intriguing story line. Nice being able to zoom, when hunting for objects. Overall, a very fun time wasting game.
B004EPYZSU|4.0|I don't often admit it but the extended version (2:20/140 minutes)is the better version. There are too many holes in the story of the theatrical version. It was too short. Storylines were lost. Too many producers and directors are worried that they will let a story run too long and it will drag out. I can understand the concerns of the studio. It was mixing genres: western and science fiction. There was undoubtedly some concern that the film would be a dud. Why increase the chances with the long version? Unfortunately the long version was the complete film and worth four stars. The problem is finding the extended version. Right now it's available on Blu-Ray but I use DVDs. So I watch it on cable. When they sell a long version as a DVD I'll buy it. Hollywood must stop the worry about a film's time and ask itself a simple question. Does the film tell the complete story?
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I feel like the last person in the world to read this book. I saw the movie for the first time a few days ago and thought the book might be worth a perusal. It was a quick read and I enjoyed it (as much as one can, given the subject  matter). Looking forward to the next installment.
0452295548|5.0|My mother gave me this book after my grandmother had a stroke and I didn't get to read it right away. Then my mother-in law had a stroke and I found it very encouraging and even bought her a copy. She really does read but read through the entire book and was very inspired by Jill's story. It is a great, inspirational read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|What a great game. The thought prevoking puzzles are terrific. The graphics weren't bad considering I played the game on my Kindle Fire. And yes there were a couple of times I had to go to a \\"games hint\\" to get some help.<br />I would love more games like this.
B0080SW3CC|1.0|The book is very brittle.  If I had to guess it is as old as the copy right date (1937).  Terrible, terrible, terrible!
1594746036|2.0|I enjoyed the photographs in the book far more than the actual story the book told.  This one will definitely go into my 'donate box'.
B000FBJAOG|5.0|Surprisingly, quite a bit more disturbing than his other zombie narrative: World War Z<br /><br />Reads just like the title indicates - a &#34;How to&#34;
0307476073|5.0|Almost everyone can relate to the idea that life is a journey, but not everyone is so gifted with the use of language that they can render their journey, or any portion of it, with such eloquence and courage as Cheryl Strayed. This is a memoir that makes the genre worth reading. It is a story that can be life altering in the way that one person's life, and the experience they've had when it is arduous and difficult and fraught with obstacles, not the least of which are one's own flaws, can go beyond the words written on the page, as beautiful and eloquent as they are, and reach into another person's soul, there to ignite a similar fire, a similar will to be brave, to persist. The story Cheryl tells is vivid and compelling and raw in its truth, and that is the beauty of it. Throughout her narrative, there are moments that are breathtaking and other moments that are heartbreaking, and some that are simply so comic, you laugh aloud, but throughout, the sense of her will and her determination, her honesty and bravery ring through every syllable just as these very same qualities, despite the missteps, must be the ones that brought her through the difficult times and places in her life. This is a memoir that will stay with you. It is at once a treasure to mine and an inspiration to hold onto.
B004HX0P2Y|5.0|My wife & I really enjoyed this movie and the pacing of the story. Highly recommended for those who love a good thriller with lots of dry wit thrown in.
B007WFR0QS|3.0|.... this might be the sort of thing you like.  Her voice started to annoy me after a while, but that's just me.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|It was as 'Tasty' as the first season and more.  It is great to see the characters grow.<br />I can't wait to see Season 3
B008K9SG9K|5.0|The whole album is really great, but most of the songs are brighter and more dancy-poppy than the famous &#34;Radioactive&#34;.
037582913X|5.0|Furry old Grover repeats first in a soft voice, then louder, and louder--<br />  &#34;please don't turn the page.&#34;  With curiosity and energy , your child<br />  won't be able to resist--he will want to turn the pages himself!<br />  Stone's classic book is a winner for the child in us all.<br /><br />  Valjoan M. Myers
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Again, I find that I have missed so many very well written series.  This one, although not for everyone, does appeal to me.  It is sy-fy without being ridiculous.  I especially love the actor who plays George.  If you had missed this series, do yourself a favor and at least give it a try!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Wow, this thing is amazing! And with 3 months of Netflix (promotion is over), the Chromecast is a steal at $35! It does more than I thought it would and even projects a tab from Chrome directly on to the TV (and updates real-time <- the question that we all want answered?). Honestly, there's no reason to buy a Smart TV now (it's all a gimmick anyway) so save yourself a couple hundred bucks with this dongle!<br /><br />The only thing I regret from this purchase is buying it through the Google Play store and not on here since I could have utilized my prime shipping... I really hope that we'll be able to cast directly from our smart phones in the future!
B005544TRQ|5.0|I love this series and I'm so glad now that I don't have TV that I can go back on Amazon Prime and watch all the wonderful series that I missed on cable.  This is very well written and acted and I am now part way through the second season.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|I can't say enough great things about this book. From beginning to end, it is filled with such powerful information in an easy to read format.<br /><br />10 stars if I could!
B004ZRV3AU|3.0|It does what its supposed to but it is not as steady as I was expecting  , I was applying to much pressure and main rod bent alittle .
B000JMKRKC|4.0|3-1/2 Stars<br />It would have been a 4 star book if it hadn't drug on too slowly at times. But overall a good read...... a little fairy-tale like. A little creepy and a little mystery.... just enough to keep you reading!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids love this game as does my husband.  It keeps the entertained when we need .  Would recommend for purchase.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Who doesn't love minions?<br /><br />Who doesn't love minions chasing banana's?<br />I found myself playing this for hours quite easily and it has passed hands throughout the family.
B0016PM722|5.0|This is grate it is actually better than I expected... I did messed up and got the non removable blade lightsaber nevertheless is great! Is the first piece to a sword collection that I want to get!
B009O2XY12|3.0|Shouldn't make you use a set amount of turns before a time limit is put into effect and you can no longer play until you get past that limit
B00DP3IGJ6|2.0|One of Tom Cruise's worst performances ever. I love Morgan Freeman, if his part would have been better and longer he might have helped the movie. All and all a really poor movie.
B004UNX1LS|4.0|It is much better than Youtube when I am looking for videos by specific people and the quality seems to be much better
B008JFURII|5.0|Saw the movie recently and I intend to order the DVD.<br /><br />This film is funny, witty, has action galore and tons of star power in an ensemble cast.<br /><br />The relationship between Frank and Sarah was handled beautifully, Marvin is still bat-crap crazy, but lovable and Victoria chews up the scenery with the best of them.  Throw in a kick ass assassin, mad scientist and worldwide exotic locations and you have the perfect formula for non-stop entertainment.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  If you liked Red, you'll love Red 2.  Nuff said, I'm ordering my copy now.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This book is a great read. Follett does a great job giving all the different points of view. He doesn't really take a side either. Unlike our history books this war isn't told by the winners. The story looks at the war from the perspective of both sides. He does a great job with his characters as well. He has you rooting for the romantic relationships of Walter and Maud as well as Gus and Rosa. From part 2 on I just could not and did not want to put this book down. It was a fascinating read. I would recommend it for any history buffs out there such as myself. I am looking forward to reading book 2 of this trilogy.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It provided entertainment for my kids, when we were on our family vacation.  the animation and sound is very good, the only problem that encountered was the program was slow loading at times.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|Great homage to comics/mega monster movies/manga and anime culture. Great execution to a not so original concept.Campy acting which was not only appropriate but necessary for the whole \\"b-movie\\" effect. Don't get me wrong but its \\"b\\" feel was not indicative of the films excellence, production wise  as well as primo special effects was more than evident as you cheer on the yeagers as they beat the crap out of the monsters from hell. I'm surely going to cheer on the pilots as I watch my blue ray copy!!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I'd like to think that I am fairly good at puzzles, but this keeps me entertained for quite literally hours. Definitely a great way to stay sharp!
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|But this was pretty funny!  I wouldn't buy it to own but as a rental it was good.  I love to stream!
B0044WSF5M|4.0|A sleeper hit that barely got made, this film impressed my kids who were born long after 1962, proving that its theme of self discovery and the pain of growing up does not get old. I hadn't seen it in many years, so I enjoyed it on a different level, but just as much. The low budget is apparent at times, but this is Lucas as a storyteller, not a SFX wizard, and the HD version with Dolby sound looks and sounds great. As a small bonus, you get two short scenes restored that were cut from the original theatrical release.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I liked the romance and the storyline and enjoyed reading the book.  It could have used a little more pizzazz, but overall it was readable and likeable.
B009QW7MQS|4.0|Brosnan's second outing as 007 isn't as impressive as his debut in Goldeneye, but it's an enjoyable action film with very high technical standards. It is somewhat lacking in 'Bond style' mostly because the supporting cast, while effective, is not a very interesting group. The film does have some memorable scenes, notably the always enjoyable Q sequence with the late Desmond Llewelyn, who would appear in only once more in the series. Younger fans of the recent Bond films, like my teenage son, will enjoy the Brosnan films more than the Connery and Moore classics because those once dazzling efforts now look sadly dated.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I Love, love, love Bruno Mars and I loved every song on the CD. Would highly recomment it to friends.
B001QC9PSO|3.0|Perfect entertainment for boys between 4 and about 8 which I thought held up pretty well. I had not seen it since watching it with my son almost ten years ago and I still found it pleasantly watchable for a kids' movie.
B000LVAQDE|3.0|I remember watching the &#34;First Blood&#34; many years ago, while living in the Soviet Union. I did not understand at that time how American people treated Vietnam Veterans. The movie in my opinion did not fully develop characters, diluting the story by demonstrations of fire power.
B000I62JAK|3.0|There's a lot to like in this Stiller outing which avoids the comedic overkill that plagues his other films. This one is witty far more often that it's gross, which is refreshing in a comedy these days. It's aimed at a much younger audience than me (male, age 50), so I'm sure that my kids would give it a fourth star.
1554072840|1.0|I previewed this book before I read it to my child. I decided it is going back when I got the page where the little girl is \\"moon-ing\\" and you see the hole in her butt. I really don't feel like young toddlers need a complete anatomy lesson to potty train. That's not the kind behavior I'd like my child to learn.<br /><br />I agree with other reviewers that the text is clunky and long. My kid would be turning the page before I got half way through. and... who says \\"I, Prudence's mother\\" repeatedly?
0446547638|2.0|Sorry, just not his best work. Very predictable and definitely not a \\"feel good\\" story. Gets pretty dark about half way through and I almost put it down. Sparks spends considerable time trying to develop characters Ted and Abee, but this could have been done much quicker. A long read...
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I like it. You don't HAVE to pay for currency like you do in most games these days. Its fun for a farm type game.
B007REABAG|5.0|This is a great box set. It does miss bonus tracks but for the price I got it, the collection is worth it considering it contains all the best releases in the bands career. If you get the \\"Sex America Box\\" then you really get those bonus tracks this one misses. The EP \\"Found All The Parts\\" which I have on vinyl is here as well as some albums being released on CD, exclusive to this box set. I highly recommend getting this set. Seen them quite a few times and having these instead of looking for my vinyl now is a real treat. So short and sweet, get this one, you won't regret it if your a Cheap Trick fan.<br />Check out my website sometime @ \\"JudeMac Forever\\" where there is something for everyone.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Absolutely amazing series of books. First time since I read enders game that I was absolutely immersed in a book. You know to the point where your living it. not reading it.
B0098460O4|5.0|Excellent quality and Amazon delivery is prompt and well packaged as usual.<br />Ever since we saw these two on Britiains Got Talent we loved their singing.<br />A wonderful sound experience!
B002WY65W4|5.0|One of my favorite movies that I can watch anytime. Great quality Blu Ray and some of the funniest stuff I've ever seen.
B000062XFG|5.0|For a used item it is is excellent condition and delivery time was great. I like the focus on Data.<br />Looking forward to buying the rest of the seasons when I can afford to :)
B00129H7VS|5.0|Bought this as a birthday gift for my husband. We've watched the series several times on regular dvd and tv, but the Blu-ray is amazing. The quality of the picture is so much better and the option to have the additional commentary from the actual soldiers that the series was based on made it that much more moving. I highly recommend this product.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|I love the song, I've loved you for a thousand years.  I am not into the Twilight series at all, but love this song so much.  I can listen to it over and over, I never get tired of it.  The CD came very fast, and in excellent condition.  So happy to have it.  Thank you!
B008ALA6DW|1.0|I don't see anything wrong with the connector, but it no longer works and I have verified that the ethernet line and both computer work.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I feel so smart when I escape a floor! I escaped all 10! Can't wait for more! Hope it will be soon.
B007O3QC8K|4.0|There are many recordings extant of Bruckner's &#34;unfinished' 9th.  I am reminded of a comment made by Johannes Brahms of the &#34;Unfinished&#34; 8th symphony of Franz Schubert.  I am paraphrasing here, but essentially the 2 movements that were published made it a fine piece of music by itself.  The same could be said for the completed 3 movements of Bruckner's Ninth.  I have always enjoyed the quiet leave-taking end of the 3rd movement in contrast to the  thunderous endings of his other symphonies.  It has a farewell quality to it reminiscent of Mahler's 9th (also composed in the key of D minor).  Until an acquaintance told me of this recording and the publication of the 4th movement based on Bruckner's sketches, I was unaware that any effort was being made to research it, let alone score it. Sir Simon is a good interpreter of Bruckner, but I have heard better interpretations of the traditional 3 movement work (Barenboim, Giulini and von Karajan come to mind).  Yet, it was a pleasure to hear the Berlin Philharmonic take up the recently published 4th movement.  It is a more traditional ending comparable to his other symphonies.  It provides a sense of triumph over the darkness of the first two movements and the mysticism of the third.  It is noted in the accompanying notes that some bars that Bruckner had sketched were eliminated--although it's not made clear why.  If a professional musical scholar is attempting to recreate such an intricate piece as a late-Romantic Bruckner symphony, then adherence to Bruckner's scoring composition would seem to be in order.  But, then again, perhaps it made for a better flowing piece of music.  The sound quality is not up to EMI's standards.  When EMI recorded von Karajan and the BPO during the 1970's and 1980's, the lion's share of the recordings were done in the Christus Kirche, a Lutheran chapel on the outskirts of Berlin.  This facility had much better acoustics than the Berlin Philharmonie.  The sound  is too distant with no noticeable bounce--something that characterized von Karajan's recordings with DG. A packaging note:  the shipper placed a tape over the front top which when peeled off, also dislodged and broke the front cover portion that anchored it the bottom cover.no noticeable bounce--something that characterized von Karajan's recordings with DG.

B00DGKQF2S|5.0|The pedigrees of these musician's are without question. Billy Sheehan. I discovered on Eat Em And Smile from David Lee Roth. Then followed on thru Mr. Big and other projects. Ritchie, thru Poison's Native Tongue, and his records with Mr. Big. Mike Portnoy, thru Dream Theater and the rocking Omerta from Adrenaline Mob. These three players gel perfectly in The Winery Dogs. Ritchie is an awesome singer as well as guitar player. Billy Sheehan on bass is, well, Billy Sheehan. This is some of Mike's most mainstream drumming. I don't say that as a negative. He plays and sounds great. I am unable to pick a favorite track as there is no filler at all on this release. Blues rock at it's finest. If I were to compare to any of the any above groups, I would have to compare them to Mr. Big. This is not a metal or progressive rock release. As I have stated this is electric blues rock. If given any airplay this would be a platinum seller definitely. I HIGHLY recommend this release. Go for it, you will not be disappointed!
B000E5KUK6|3.0|This movie is ok in it own right but its just not the same as the original. It does have its moments though. It is a good evenings entertainment. Not much re- watchability. An interesting piece of trivia: One of the more recent japanese godzilla movies (I think it's final wars) has godzilla fighting many monsters. One of them looks just like the american godzilla- and the japanese godzilla basically swats him like a fly. Are they maybe making a joke about how much better thier godzilla is than ours? If they are then in this case they are right.
034580709X|3.0|I am a dedicated Jo Nesbo/Harry Hole fan but other than learning more about how Harry got his reputation and how to correctly pronounce his name (too late; I've been doing it wrong through too many books!) the story line was a bit jumpy with too many characters that didn't add that much to the story line and too many red herrings.  The author has definitely improved in later books so don't get turned off by this rating if you haven't read any of Nesbo's later books.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Gillian Flynn did it to me again! I stayed up late hours unable to put this book down! It was thrilling and exciting with just the right twost
0062255657|5.0|Okay, that's a lie. I have a few. The book wasn't very long, but then it really wasn't meant to be. The Ocean at the End of the Lane is an extremely quick read, but in that quick read there is a lot of substance. I finished the book in less than a day and put everything else I was reading on hold for about a week to think about what I had just read.<br /><br />Very little descriptive information is given about the main character, but he's still extremely easy to empathize with, and you still manage to get a feeling of knowing the character well. The villain has moments where she is cartoonishly evil, but then there are moments where she is a much more real form of evil (although the main character is largely oblivious to that kind.)<br /><br />All in all, it's probably the best Neil Gaiman book that I've read, it certainly had me thinking about it the longest.
B000EXDS5M|5.0|It is a movie you could watch over and over again. Plenty of action and  plenty of laughs. Two great actors
B006LR0XLM|5.0|I use this product on my rooted Nook Glowlight.. This product helps me with getting past the restrictions put on the system by B&N
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|A great movie to round up the Die Hard movies really action packed and dry humour completely riveting and enjoyable
B002GYI9C4|5.0|The first time I started to read Mistborn: The Final Empire I read about a page or two and stopped and decided to come back to it later. The opening paragraphs introduce a harsh world full of suffering and oppression where ash falls from the sky like snow. But what follows is one of the most fascinating and enjoyable fantasy books I can remember reading.<br /><br />The magic system stands out the most -- the magic in Mistborn is meticulously detailed, with distinct rules, abilities, and limitations clearly explained. Certain aspects are almost scientific in nature (Newton's Third Law -- \\"For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction\\" -- came to mind), making it very fun to follow along as the main character learns to use her abilities. More importantly, all of this detail isn't just world-building for the sake of world-building; the magic system itself is crucial to the plot of the series.<br /><br />Some complain about Sanderson's characters, but I found the main characters here quite compelling, as was the story itself. The book provides a surprising amount of closure to the plot considering there are two more books to follow, and I could easily see rereading this book even without rereading the rest of the series.
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|Have not purchased  or watched a Tom Cruise movie for a long time but did enjoy this one it kept you interested and was action packed storyline was good.
140006922X|3.0|Perhaps Jesus was a Jewish Zealot,unlikely.<br />Perhaps his philosophy was beyond the material world -possible<br />Perhaps the Temple hierarchy feared his rhetoric-Possible'<br />Perhaps the upper tiers feared his preaching would unhinge their accommodation with Rome.-possible<br />Perhaps the Messiah mantra rocked the boat and risked a lot of positions-Likely.<br />Perhaps it was not a good time to challenge Roman power,-definitely.<br />Perhaps the Romans to placate the Jewish authorities removed a thorn in their sandals-?<br />Jerusalem at Passover was a hot bed of religious mania.<br />Pilate had to move from his cushy Palace by the SEa(AHHHH) to Hot and dusty Jerusalem to maintain order.<br />So he did what was necessary to do it.<br />We can never know.We were not there and the historic materials are extremely limited.<br />Not really much new in this book,<br />Jesus is more fable than fact.<br />Interpretations and conjecture certainly do sell books!!!!
034580404X|5.0|Ordered this set for my girlfriend. It arrived earlier than stated and was exactly as stated, she was thrilled. Thanks.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|I learned more about the real story afterwards and though some liberties were taken with the casting, as a movie alone this works. Great performances by Naomi Watts and the kid who plays the oldest son.
B005VPRET4|5.0|This took my daughter a long time to build but it made her happy and it made me happy so it's a good toy...
B0050DIWFC|2.0|I purchased this book because of all the high ratings it received and was completely disapointed.  The writing is fair but the story took forever to tell and was boring at times.  Sorry to say I did not like this book at all.
B005PK57NU|3.0|Dull. Same old stuff, little character growth, nothing to hold the viewer to the screen. TV is the media of the masses, if looking for entertainment, reading a book is more satisfying. Or, try The Killing and Falling Skies, both of which are excellent.
B002NN5F7A|5.0|Words to live by listen to Alec Baldwin it's true for sales and from what life wants from you.  Good father who cares go be with your kids.  Wanna work here close!  So true so true
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|I really liked the movie and the special effects were great!  What I did not like was the portrayal of the Hulk's human form...Banner.  I think they could have gotten a better fitting actor, not a better actor, but a better fit for the part.  I still try to hold them to the original, Bill Bixby.  Just cannot be touched.
B00D7NWTSI|1.0|They need to change the title of Iron man 3,to Tony Stark having a bad day!  If you like movies without creative writing, this could be the movie for you.  The movie ending was copied from at least three other recent super hero movies.  If you are a die hard Iron man fan, and want to see a bad ass Iron man kicking the bad guys butts then do not waste your money!!  Iron man is one of my favorite super hero's, but I would not purchase this movie If I found it in the 5 dollar bin at a department store.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|One of the best movies out there for Christians to watch with the family. I t would be nice to have one for Mothers also. Alex Kendrick is a great flim maker. Love all his movies.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|This is easily one of the best movies made in the past 10 years. Anyone that hasn't seen it, should.
B004SDEP38|2.0|Haven't been able to fully use this as the interface for creating documents etc., is very confusing. Need more time to evaluate but would really rather have Microsoft version.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Very easy read. It kept me interested. I read it because I wanted to read it before I saw the movie. The book was cute and quirky.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Can't go wrong with Avatar. Go 3D, 2D BD or DVD, movie is spectacular. I would highly recommend this to anyone.
B0010SKUYM|4.0|A little generic, but solid and fun.  Good enough to make you want to read the next book.  I'd recommend it.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Excellent book ,as you expect a Baldacci book to be.  Full of twists and turns to keep<br />You guessing and impossible to put down.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My husband and I had not watched Downton Abbey when it first came out, but after two seasons of friends telling us, &#34;You have to watch it!&#34; we used Amazon's system to download it to watch.<br /><br />It is definitely addictive. We have almost caught up.<br /><br />We have followed the development of the characters and find the 'period' (historical) very fascinating as we enjoy that era. It is well-written.<br /><br />We do have to 'retrain' our ears to the accents if we have been away from it for a while.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|Thanks for a great app. This wakes me up every day. Being a busy mom, I am easily reminded of important things during the day with my alarm. To wake my kid up at night takes just a start button with my timer. Very satisfied with this app.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It was written so well, Emma Chase is a wonderful author. I laughed til I had tears in my eyes - hilarious! Loved the male POV so very well done. Kate was a wonderful heroine, my favorite type of heroine super smart, beautiful, strong and ambitious. It was a fantastic read - an ABSOLUTE MUST READ!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|My husband bought this item following the Google event.  I thought he was crazy.  And he usually is, as techgeek.  The item arrived today and he was able to get it all to work, effortlessly, in 5 minutes and I was able to stream all of my YouTube subscriptions without fail.  We don't have a Roku box or SmartTV, but this works really well, and subtracting the 3 free months of free Netflix, is a great value at only $11.  My husband is crazy, crazy smart, I'd say.
B0081336FO|5.0|Season 2 is great and leaves us with more questions about Sherlock, Dr. Watson, and Moriarty! I can't wait for Season 3 this fall!!
B002GKQ5MY|5.0|The L Word was a really great series. The finale was disappointing, but nonetheless, it all was still worth it.
0143113100|5.0|Fantastic book. Well written. Seamless integration between stories and empirical data. If you dig the brain and its awesomeness then give them your money already! Loved it!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I really enjoyed this book it was great I thought it was awesome blah blah blah and other boring junk like that  and your face
B0046B3QTG|2.0|This is an eclectic piecemeal of adult, teenage, tweener, child, and toddler appeal, that ends up appealing to no one.  Some nice music, great technical stuff, but content and story line are downers.  Especially for the very young, the movie could be quite scary.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|it is by far the best dragon game ever!!!!! you can breed you dragons hatch them enter them in competition's and you can name them by clicking on your dragons name and change you will love it if you were smart you would dragon vale
B000HKYBXA|5.0|This is a wonderful version of one of Shakespeare's plays. I look forward to comparing this to other productions with my students.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|As an introvert and as the grandfather of a few introverts I found it very insightful. My daughter is now reading it.
159463176X|5.0|It's official now. Khaled Hosseini IS one of my favorite authors. My expectations were high, and his third novel did not fail to deliver. Lacking the writer's capacity for language, it is indeed difficult to put in words how enchanting this novel is.<br /><br />The book is divided into nine chapters, each told by a different person in a different style. They are basically standalone histories, yet interconnected through family ties and/or location. Each of them is set at a different point in time, spanning from the 1940s to the present. Some take place in Afghanistan, some in France, Greece, and California. The changing point of view and disrupted chronology creates a disjointed feel at first, but with each subsequent chapter the overall picture becomes clearer and bigger.<br /><br />The focal point is the separation of two Afghan siblings. On a more general level, the book explores human relationships as such. The characters are so expertly drawn that they not only seem as if they were flesh and bone but as if you actually knew them in person. Through understanding the driving forces of their actions, you cannot but sympathize with them.<br /><br />The elaborate structure of this novel combined with its authentic feel prove Mr. Hosseini a master of his art.  As an accurate observer of humanity, he offers stories that engage the reader from the very first moment. And, more importantly, even after you finish, the words will echo.
B00BPA6XUK|4.0|I bought this album after watching the movie, so I was more impressed with the visuals and images from the screen than the music score. Being a movie soundtrack, it does not differ from any other soundtrack in its essence; a lot of tracks that are soft sounding so you have to crank up the volume of your car stereo to compensate for the road noise. In my opinion, this should be an album for your home stereo, either to be enjoyed at night or with your favorite headphones. Why not five stars? Because even though the album is well recorded and sounds terrific, it is not for every day use.  You have to be in the proper mood to go through the whole album in one hearing session.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|I have to say that i am pleased with getting this game although the first time it got it said that it was delivered but nowhere to be found so thank god amazon understood my situation and shipped a replacement so i could be able to enjoy this game. Anybody that is a long term metal gear fan will be pleased with this collection especially when you cant beat the price to have all the classics in this package :)
B0031Y9DCS|4.0|Generally a Viet Nam book is from the view point of the ground pounders or fighter jocks. This gives a fresh view of what it feels like to be so exposed and at the mercy of fate.
B005544TRQ|5.0|The relationship between all the characters is awesome. There's just naturally such an amazing chemistry, I love watching this show!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I grabbed one of these so I could stream Google Music to my receiver.  I was not expecting much but was impressed by the audio and video quality, simple setup, and ease of use.  Oh, yeah, and the price :-)
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Well done to all the cast and crew. I love this show and would watch it over and over again.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Have recommended this book to others. Sheryl gives a very compelling to read account of her life & her attempts to benefit others- all good traits of a leader & a fine mentor.
B00181MHQU|5.0|I love this movie, and even though I've seen it several times, I still cry every time I watch it.
B001HN6922|5.0|I gave this as a gift and he loved it. We watch this movie all the time. It is nice finding popular movies for an affordable price.
B00BD2DRHW|2.0|I got this as a free app of the day for my Kindle Fire 7&#34;.  It was relatively amusing and has several challenges per level that allow you complete the level in a few different ways.  However I reached a point in the game where it started to crash constantly.  I simply could not enter a particular level without it suddenly crashing out.  So my gameplay stopped dead in its tracks.  If it wasn't for that I likely would give the game more stars.  But, my lasting impression is going to be that it crashes unexpectedly and so I've stopped playing the game.
B003H9M1Q2|5.0|I like being able to find classic movies for a good price. I now own movies that I didn't even own on VHS. It is really cool!
B000RLHDUM|5.0|Wonderful modern remake of the classic. Entertaining, lovely eye candy, and sheer pleasure is one way to describe this viewing.
B0084IHVGG|5.0|I have been able to rebuild my Disney movie collection. Aristocats was hard to find and for such a good price.
B00D6B4PUG|5.0|I really love it.<br />Have a hard time keeping it out of my daughters hands. Very easy to use and set up.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|This movie is a classic. I absolutly love it. And I was able to find an older edition that was more affordable.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|fun game app to use. love doing any sudoku and this one seems to work quite well and easy to do
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|My interest in this series made it impossible to put this book down. However in a way I didn't want to finish it. I didn't want the story to end.<br />This story in general turned from enticing to incredible. It only gets that much more interesting as you read. Though I would NEVER recommend this series to children or even young teens, it was quite captivating. There are quite few disturbing occurrences that blindsided me entirely. It was amazing to me how deep and sorrowful Suzanne Collins made this story. I will never forget it. And maybe someday I will read it all over again.
1401937519|5.0|Reading this book puts one's life or how we live our lives in perspective. It is a prime example of low self-esteem as we progress  through life based on other's opinions and social conditioning, both of which deprive us of ourselves.  We all need to get a *LIFE*<br />Thanks Anita
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Great finish to a great story that I've read for years. I only wish Mr.  Jordan himself could have seen the end with us.
B00632HWOG|5.0|This is the best thing for my Kindle. This app makes it very helpful and it is fun. I use this all the time .
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game but I do wish all the gems were nit as pricey as they are but other then that best game ever add me as a friend I am KONIKOWNER or KONIKowner idk know which one is which
B000I62JAK|5.0|This is a cameo filled classic, still probably the hardest I've ever laughed at a filmed. Have watched way too many times and can't wait till the next excuse to do so again
B007MDB71O|5.0|I had never heard of John Carter of Mars before I stumbled across the movie trailer. Intrigued, I checked it out further and saw this movie in the theater. It was great! There is so much to this story that it must be viewed more than once to really appreciate it. I thought all the acting was  believable, the back story helped put it all in context and the photography and effects were well-done, helping to tell the story, not overshadowing the story.<br />As this movie came out on the one hundredth anniversary of the publishing of the first book, one realizes that our other favorite movies like Star Wars and Avatar borrowed heavily from Edgar Rice Bourrough's wonderful imagination. It's too bad some think this is just a copy of previous movies when the reverse is true. It took one hundred years for film technology to catch up to ERB's vivid creations of worlds and people to finally make a believable film.<br />After viewing this movie, I started reading the original books and am now looking forward to more John Carter sequels as there are 11 books in the series.
B001H1SVO8|2.0|Any movie in Prime Instant Video have subtitles. That is inaccessible and very sad for people with disabilities, for example.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Really didn't get a chance to play it. Locked up the Kindle. Had to shut it down and leave it off over night just to get the Kindle to work at all!!! Uninstalled and tried it again.....SAME THING!!  We are done with this App. Grandkids disappointed!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think that minion rush is a a very good game for kids to play. It also trains your brain that's why I like this so much.
B000FBFN1U|1.0|Book 1 was challenging to learn about all the characters and how some relate but it kept my rapt attention and I couldn't wait to go on to the second in the series.  Not as enamored with book two but went on to book three etc.  And by this book i was skimming most of it.  And left completely unsatisfied at the end but THIS time I'm not purchasing any more and am sorry i went as far as I did.  The books become a litany of names and descriptions of people and places but there is no closure on anything ... it's a combination of incredibly detailed description to be used for TV series or film with multiple sequels plus an enormous tree of characters run amuck.  What a rip off.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Awesome, magical bravo paulo .It took me to a magical journey. This book could really make you a better person ,and put a smile  on ,bring the child back I totally love it!
B000FC1HBY|4.0|Not as engaging as book one but still kept me engaged.  Went on to Book three and hope it's better.
B00D41AJ7G|3.0|This game is a nice change up from the types of games I have been playing and seeing.<br />It does have me stumped. When you get to the blue and white ball, I have not been able to figure out how to activate and use the putty blade.<br />Is there any help available???  More tutorial for basic use of the tools would be nice.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Sorry watched so many episodes do not remember which ones these are, will miss it.  I need to watch the series every so often.,
B0041KKYBK|5.0|This documentary gives you an up close warts and all look at how our Government really works...The days when to govern meant to do what was best for the people have long since passed. Of the people, By the people and For the people could not ring anymore untrue now than ever. Washington and Big Business and now Wall Street have shown us all how they are in bed together. The only thing that matters to any of them is how much they can make at our expense. The United States Government is open to the highest bidder and that is proven everyday with the Lobbying that goes on in Washington D.C.<br />  This documentary will show you how our government has lied to us...How it has manipulated us into a false sense of security. And what makes it even worse is what happened to us in 2008 is only a prelude to what is coming down the pike next. We are headed right back to that big clift again except this time we will fall further than ever. The Banks and Wall Street have Carte Blanche to do to us what they want.
B008ROGQAE|2.0|It has dawned on me how low this movie was.  The idea / story line was a great idea, but so poorly done
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|OMG THIS GAME IS AMAZING. IT TAKES YOU RIGHT INTO THE LITTLE MINIONS LIFE SUPER COOL . I love everything about this game
B009WUAK2M|4.0|It was entertaining and worth watching. Good sequel that didn't disappoint. I would suggest to anyone to watch it purely for the entertainment factor. Hey, its Hollywood!
B0050AV5MW|4.0|Very close to the HBO series! Easy and addictive read with plenty of action. Strongly recommended for anyone who enjoys fantasy adventure.
B00CA3C1N4|4.0|This game is fun to play when you are bored and actually poses a challenge. I'm not the best gamer out there so it is probably more challenging for me than others but this is one of those games that you can wrap your brain around but still get beat by the computer once in a while.
159463176X|3.0|It was okay but not as good, definitely not as memorable, as his previous novels.  A Thousand Splendid Suns is one of my favorite all time novels.
B005DD7H50|5.0|Finally, a Sci-Fi flick with not only great acting and an magnificent script...but an original plot! And, Cooper is great as always.
159463176X|5.0|best book of the year so far. I loved every word. The characterizations and interactions among<br />the characters<br />are powerful and emotional.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Was blessed that this Bible was so easy to use. Still getting used to it and I'm sure there will be more joy ahead.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I loved this little book - read it while recuperating.  It took me out of my misery and into a wonderful world.  I could have spent a lot more time there.  Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys a good story, well told, with characters you come to know and care about.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Hi I'm Danielle I'm 7 years old and I love the book it's funny weird and you can't stop reading
B004KPX4W2|4.0|Woo hoo, very amusing, plenty of shooting, and the old guys aren't improbably boffing  impossibly beautiful, grand daughter age, chicks.
B00CA3C1N4|2.0|Maybe not impossible but seemed to be more work than it was worth. Looked intersting but playing it was not..at least not for me. I deleted it from my Kindle.
B002VRGCKW|5.0|Excellent pianism. I am sure that if Bach were alive he would have preferred these interpretations rather than the dry ones from the harpsichord or the ones that are on piano that just sound wooden. Okay, disagree if you wish, but first and foremost, it is music, not a typewriter.<br />Pollini plays with brilliance and with style. The sound is sumptuous.<br />I wanted a piano recording of these and I am happy I decided on this one.
B006R4H5FG|5.0|absolutely fabulous and revolutionnary material for the presenter. this material has changed the way i do presentations from now on,
B009WUBERW|5.0|Honestly how could you go wrong with that cast!!!<br />I loved the first one and the 2nd in my opinion was even better and I can't wait to see if there will be a third.
B003G4W49C|3.0|The author isn't the greatest person I've read but it's a good story and flow.  He doesn't give hardly any description of the environments, which makes it a little hard to visualize the scene but the conversation back and forth are well written.  It's good but nowhere close to the hype this book has received over the years, and wasn't a page turner.  I'd read part of it and not read it again for another couple of weeks.  It just couldn't grab me, like many other books I've read have.
B0083SBMBM|4.0|Probably doesn't include all the little quips that were deleted, but the extra information was interesting.  Looking forward to the next one.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Wonderful show. Great for the family and stunning scenery! It's my go to series when it is gloomy outside and I need some cheering up!
B000002ADT|4.0|I never really knew any jazz artists as I was pretty interested in the genre, so I bought this album used and I am not disappointed. Unfortunately there are only like 6 songs, but each of them are fairly long and are great to listen to. I would recommend this album maybe used as the original price plus shipping costs more.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I bought this based on the glowing reviews, expecting to be disappointed. I have never had luck with mobile chargers - they either broke after a short time or were too weak to perform. I was pleased to be proved wrong! This performs exactly as described and blows away any other charger I've used. My Android device charges in a fraction of the time the standard charger takes. iPad2 charges with no problem at all.
B00000295Y|4.0|My first rap album and I am not disappointed. It has some very good songs and some that are meh, but the songs that really stand out are pretty good.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|Still reading it - but I'm watching Ken Burns. Civil war documentary and have a very informed POV. I'm still reading but very much enjoying  Especially, the other players - especially Seward
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|I am so glad I bought this DVD.  Now I can watch one of my most favored TV programs whenever I wish.
B00867GJYK|5.0|finally this movie came out on blu-ray!  and the quality is even better than i remember in the theaters.  still good after having watched it a dozen times.
B003TSEEDY|2.0|I'm not a big fan of this book. I'm about half way through and it's going really slow. I don't like some of the inappropriateness in it. It is from a guy's perspective which is harder to relate to when you're a girl. Hopefully it will get better the last half.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is pretty cute. You have to buy things if you want to do the task quicker but you can just wait longer between them and pay nothing. For a free game I think its pretty good.
B00005K3OT|3.0|While the movie had its moments, unfortunately this movie will end up as a one time watch movie for me.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Great game for all ages. Just wish didn't require real money for the goals or so much do unlocking doom world. Otherwise my kids love helping me take Carr of the village and other villages especially finding scrat
B008JFUO36|4.0|Good amount of action and the story had a fair amount of twists and intrigue.  Will watch this again when released.
B006X5L6VS|5.0|Put this on my phone mostly for my granddaughter while we travel. Have had lots of fun with this! We both are learning all the constellations, planets and stars. Highly recommend this app! Looking forward to tracking Santa, too!
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|This is a very good film. Very entertaining. This movie will not disappoint if you like superhero flicks.  Even worth seeing more than once.
B001NA6096|3.0|Generally this is an upbeat movie and it is sort of quirky in a good way.  However, having just two characters for the better part of the movie was a bit limiting.  It seems like a nice movie for a group younger than in their 60s.
B001FD5KJM|5.0|This is a very good film. Very entertaining. This movie is excellent because of the relationships between characters as that adds to the story.
B00AEFYBGU|4.0|It is strange, that when i first saw this movie, it seemed like it lasted forever.  Now watching it, it flew by so fast, actually thought i miss a few scenes.  I didn't, it was just straight to the point.  What i did notice is that, she really did slide over to the other side.  And, why does Woody buy those stupie hippos for one million dollars, duh, stupid or what?  He just put them back in the poor house, they are poor and scared, again.  Even though that is not what is portrayed in the movie. All in all, it is a good movie, though.
0345803493|5.0|I love this book, and its was the cheapest book and I got it just in a few days so I didn't have to wait long.
B000FCK65W|5.0|The story is simple.  The characters were strong. It was a pleasure to sit down and read this book.  It truly is a classic.
0345803485|5.0|the 2nd book was great I love reading this series.  it was cheaper than any store I seen. I loved it.
B004UPAIDK|4.0|This movie is awesomely campy and gory like the first one - maybe even a bit more so. I enjoyed the first movie in all of its B movie madness, and I laughed out loud during this one, too. Evil Dead fans will again dig Bruce Campbell as Ash, and this movie wraps up by setting the stage for the third movie in the original trilogy - \\"Army of Darkness\\".
0345803507|5.0|I have read the first two books and now I wanted to read the third. Its also cheaper here than a store. and I also got it in the date it said it would arrive,
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|great game for any age to play.You can play it on your Kindle or I-phone at the park while the kids play
1936719010|5.0|Pressfield is a great author and also a good teacher. If you haven't seen his website, I highly recommend it.
0385349947|3.0|'Lean In' is a contradiction from the very third word used by Sheryl in the book..'pregnant'. Her cover design of her face itself is sexist what she is writing against all about. A man 'leader' would not have done that. Otherwise, good book, must for all readers specially women if they have patience. Surprisingly, I have yet to see any top seller having so much repetion of the ideas and words thruout till the last page. Though the writer has been advised by her highly educated talented friends on draft, structure but nobody ever pointed out to her that shortcoming. (She has projected her husband Dave as henpecked,sorry)[[ASIN:0385349947 Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead]]
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun game, like subway surfers, but this time you play as minions. Fun tracts, bosses, and new stages. You even get to pick your characters costume.
B0084I2PEO|5.0|Very appropriate for this time in our lives.  It gives a whole different perspective of life in another land.  I felt it was something that we should all be aware of so we can value our way of life here in America, and that we guard our freedoms.  Very good story.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I've read this so many times, and I love it every time! This is the best books I've ever read.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|I cannot remember ever being more satisfied with a music purchase.  Leonard Cohen's voice just keeps getting better and better with time.  I highly recommend &#34;Live In London&#34;.....it's well-worth the money, and then some.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Does not load easily. When it does, the game is fragmented and when not fragmented, boring. Four more words required.
B00007KWHG|5.0|I won't rate the artists or the music.  It goes without sayin'.  Know what I mean?  The quality of the recording is excellent.  If you love Frankie and the 4 Seasons, BUY THIS CD!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Once I figured out how to use it things work great. It seems you need to run the search and then hit the button again to bring it up on the browser.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game and every time my family and friend  play  on my kindle fire hd they play this  for hours.not only is it a good game but a kid friendly one too.
B00CDT41RY|1.0|Only had a 48 hour window and it took longer than the rental time to get the movie downloaded.  Just blew my money.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Great for kids of all ages - even for the workplace. Quick read - life lessons in easy to understand story.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We did not know about Downton Abby series until dining with some friends.  Went on line and watched all of the shows up to this fall.
B000006IUQ|5.0|This movie ranks number one with me, it was interesting from beginning to end and kept me entertained. It had just the right amount of suspense and action. I have seen thss movie several times and always enjoy it. Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin did a superb performance.
0060899190|5.0|If you've ever been to the website, and you love reading to other people's secrets, then you'll love this in book form. It's definitely a book I'll hold onto to show my kids. The art is beautiful, from people who don't declare themselves artists. It's cathartic, it's funny, it's heartbreaking, and sometimes shocking. I haven't been to the website in some time, but I still love what Frank Warren did and the legacy he'll leave behind with his website and books.
B00C2FFJFM|4.0|\\"Stars Dance\\" is Selena Gomez's debut solo album. It was released shortly after Selena's 21st birthday, so it's her first attempt at a more `mature' sound.  The themes are still lighthearted and wholesome. But Selena is more `straightforward' here. She's telling guys to `come and get it' rather than `I'll put you in a love song, baby'.<br /><br />From start to finish, the album keeps a celebratory, upbeat vibe. There are no slow songs; only the closing song is mid-tempo.  Every song fuses pop with edgy club beats, whether it is house, techno, or dubstep.  Some incorporate world beat textures, from Indian to Latin. The music here fits in at clubs or Radio Disney.<br /><br />So Selena doesn't have the pipes that Demi Lovato has. But it doesn't matter.  Selena can carry a good club-pop tune.  The majority of tunes here are good or great.  There's strong production, catchy lyrics, and Selena has good energy.<br /><br />\\"Birthday\\", \\"Slow Down\\", \\"Stars Dance\\", \\"Come and Get It\\", and \\"Save The Day\\" are the strongest tracks. \\"Birthday\\" has a `let's party' vibe.  \\"Stars Dance\\" has a 'let's feel-good' vibe. \\"Save The Day\\" has an irresistible Latin beat.  Unless you're living under a rock, you've heard the pop-dubstep-Bollywood \\"Come and Get It\\".<br /><br />The album's weakest point was \\"Like A Champion\\".  It was a mediocre attempt at replicating an early Rihanna dancehall-pop sound.  \\"Write Your Name\\" and \\"Love Will Remember\\" suffer from substandard lyrics and boring production.<br /><br />(4 out of 5 stars)<br /><br />--Isa R Bufano (07.29.2013)
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Good script, excellent special effects.  Casting was the best. Look forward to the next Avengers.  Will definitely be watching this one over and over.
B001XUH69Y|4.0|I had seen this many years ago but it was so well done you had to see more and not miss any of the things that were happening in the room.
B007N6NGYG|5.0|I enjoys game that keep my mind working. And This game definately will make you think a bit. It is a fun game
B00B89WXYS|5.0|Great album from an amazingly talented new group.  I'm impressed with the album for quality of songs and selection.  I will be following this group. My favorite is &#34;Counting Stars&#34;, but love many other selections on the cd as well.  Of course this was all accomplished at a great price!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It's very anticipating, surprising, and exciting. The only thing I didn't like about this book was the cliff hanger ending!!! I can't wait for the next book!
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|I saw the documentary on cable and had to have the DVD.  Love the Eagles and love these DVDs.  It tells the history of the band from each band member from the beginning, through the break ups and getting back together.  Enjoyed seeing the live footage of the band before we had internet.  Any Eagles fan would treasure this collection.  I purchased a second one for a friend.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Nicholas Sparks does so well in weaving you into his stories.<br />He has done it again.<br />Read it and enjoy.
B00DU74U74|4.0|I enjoyed this move very much if you are into Sci Fi and adventure then you will like watching this one.
B005M5OSBK|5.0|What fun!  I loved this album.  Makes you want to dance even if you can't dance. Just exactly what you'd expect from this fabulous group.  Saw them live recently in Chicago. They're fantastic!  Buy this album.  You won't be disappointed.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Each episode tied closely to the last. Story line keeps you coming back to find out who will be next.
B009WUBERW|5.0|Enjoyed it; the action heroes are all from my era of action films as a kid.  Especially enjoyed the Chuck Norris appearance.  Could have done without Arnold, however.  As a conservative and Californian, it's hard to see him in any post governor roles and not associate his politics with him.  Horrible Republican.
B0026QC0TA|5.0|This is the second time I've seen it and it was like watching it brand new as it had been years ago that I first saw it. A Great movie and great cast! Love Matt Damon and Danny DeVito.
B000SEFCD8|5.0|This book really drives home the point that dogs are not small, furry human children.  They are a different species with a different history and psychology than their owners.  While that may be obvious, there are ways you can build upon that difference that will help you understand why your dog behaves the way it does and will help you to communicate and build an even better bond with your dog.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great game  awesome graphics but it is Little easy  hope sequel is harder but it was free.<br />Will download more of these types of games
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun and challenging game.  I am enjoying getting to the next floor by figuring out the theieces to each of the puzzles
B006LSZECO|5.0|Completely awesome.  Don't hesitate to buy this book.  I liked her Sharp Objects, but this was really terrific.  Completely unpredictable.
B00D6QU6RW|4.0|I don't have Unbreakable but This is Us was a real disappointment.<br />Aside from some autotuning/electronic-type sounds in the music (seriously, artists need to stop doing this crap it's annoying) for In a World Like This, the album was definitely better than TiU. I want to give it 3.5 stars. I'm rounding it to 4 because I like it enough to keep listening to it. It doesn't give me a headache like TiU.<br /><br />1. In a World Like This: I loved this when I first heard it a few weeks ago, and I still love it. It's clean, it's what I'd expect from adult BSB.<br /><br />2. Permanent Stain: Some of the parts are a bit awkward. In the beginning; the words don't match the lyrics very well.<br /><br />3. Breathe: The very beginning of this song sounded odd. I thought I'd hate it. But it's a very sweet melody and I truly enjoyed it.<br /><br />4. Madeleine: I hate songs of people's names. But the tune made this catchy, and island-like. I'm not too sure how I feel about it but I don't hate it.<br /><br />5 Show 'Em (What You're Made of): This sounds like a slower tune of \\"My Confession\\" on Nick's solo album. It's not the best, but I think it's one of the better ones.<br /><br />6. Make Believe: The lyrics aren't bad but the music has too much tinkering done to it. I feel \\"meh\\" about it.<br /><br />7. Try: Unlike a previous reviewer, I didn't like this! From the start I was thinking \\"what the heck is this?!\\" And then it sounded like NYSNC. Bah!<br /><br />8. Trust Me: This is the opposite - the music is catchy but I feel like the lyrics and the song in general is 'just okay.'<br /><br />9. Love Somebody: I like the song, but I'm not feeling the techno/autotune stuff.<br /><br />10. One Phone Call: This didn't impress me at all. It started out bad, the music wasn't great and the lyrics were only so-so.<br /><br />11. Feels Like Home: Again, aside from some of the music, I enjoyed this! I couldn't stop laughing.<br /><br />12. Soldier: If this song was facebook, I'd \\"like\\" it. This is what I'd consider \\"real\\" BSB. The lyrics and the music drew me in.. This is what I'd consider \\"real\\" BSB. The lyrics and the music drew me in.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|It's a pretty good murder mystery as far as they go.  I read it for a book club because we had really enjoyed her Gone Girl prior to this.  It was worthy.  A little predictable toward the end, but overall a good read.
B001P06GX4|5.0|Everyone loves this game.  For 2 players I followed another reviewers suggestion of making lines 2 blocks in so the board is smaller.  For 3 players, make lines 1 block in around the board.  I used a thin  permanent magic marker.  The game is a challenge for everyone.  Your children can even beat you.
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|The most wonderful fiction book of all time, in my opinion.  I've read it twice and will certainly read it again.  I had not seen the movies when I read it.  It just captivated me.  So stinking fantastic!
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I really enjoyed each and every show.  I never caught this show on TV and so this made it very convenient.  Don't start watching if you're planning to go to sleep soon.  You'll find it hard to  stop watching.  Didn't want it to end.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is. It my usual type of book to read, but heard about it on a tv program. Decided to take a chance on this. Truly an amazing story. I have recommended it to my friends.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I started the book with high hopes.... by the middle it was moving so slowly that I didn't want to pick it up.  I did, however, enjoy the ending.
B0036S4B6M|2.0|Didn't everyone really go to high school with Piper Kerman? She is just the stereotypical, little, mean-girl, blonde, who was born with a silver spoon in her mouth. She makes an absolutely abysmal life choice, that she shrugs off as happening due to her being bored and adventurous, even though life has given her every advantage, and after 11 years finds herself dropped into the middle of the cesspool that is the American prison system. Piper weathers this storm by cleverly befriending the ethnically diverse group of unfortunate inmates that she discovers are as heartbreakingly vulnerable to being befriended by the homecoming queen with the acid tongue and entitled attitude as the poor homely and uncool girls in any high school in the country would be.<br /><br />Piper is a shameless narcissist. While she is receiving more visitors, mail and commissary money than she knows what to do with from her uber supportive and financially well-off family and friends and benefitting from the best legal defense money can buy, she regales the reader with tales of the poor, UGLY, uneducated, inmates that occupy Danbury Federal Prison in Connecticut. These poor woman have suffered from lack of decent legal representation and Lord knows what other horrors in their lives and Piper congratulates herself ad nauseam for being kind to them...which in reality, is really all that she can do to survive in her new environment.<br /><br />I have had this on my TBR list for a long time and decided to finally read it when I heard about the series available on Netflix. I found myself alternating between being disgusted at the vapid Kerman and being just bored and disinterested in the narrative. If you want to read something really compelling about being a woman dealing with being incarcerated, I recommend Wally Lamb's \\"Couldn't Keep it to Myself\\". It is a wonderful compilation of stories written by students that he taught in a creative writing class that he volunteered to teach in a women's prison in New York. It is a fabulous book, about these women's lives and how they coped with their inmate experiences, told in their own fascinating words. \\"Orange is the New Black\\" is about Piper Kerman...and she is not all that compelling.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|You are having fun then you run out of energy and then you just kind of lose interest and then quit
B007Z9RS22|4.0|Interesting movie, the ending was almost predictable, though and sad.  Keanu Reeves is getting better as a actor the older he gets.<br /><br />Jean
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|I wish I could download the whole game so that the kids did not need wi fi to play it.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|We enjoyed all of the characters, the story and the wonderful interactions between the Marigold Hotel guests.  Highly recommend this movie.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|It's a pretty typical hidden object game, where you get to move on once you find every item.  The only frustrating part is not really knowing what you're searching for.....but that saved it from one star for me.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|its a great game with strategy and escape sliw thank you for playing this game amazon very much I mean it
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I am a student of Lincoln -- this book was of mega help to me to understand more of this great man.  It should be part of every high school history class.
B001CDZZI6|5.0|I like this book because it works like a journal. It's straight forward, like a reference book.<br />As a Coach I understand the importance of Strengths and Potential people have, which they can use to move forward when they are stuck.<br />The strengths finder provides food for reflection and is a great resource for learning and development.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book was the most literal approach to a zombie apocalypse that I have read. Awesome short stories put together this very well written book.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This little app allows me to have fun with textures, colors, and even different construction paper. Though the app looks to be geared towards children, I can see myself creating a nice composition with this program. Great for planning out other pieces.
B004R10N6O|1.0|Poor story line<br />Poor Acting<br />Bad attempt at cheap laughs<br /><br />Don't waste your time or money on this one just because Harrison Ford is in it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I just love this book. It's a wonderful ending. I wish it would continue though, it was hard to stop reading.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Whether you're 5 or 50, this game is fun for everyone. My kids play it on their Kindle Fire and even my 6 year old can make the sharp turns without falling off the end of the earth. Their scores keep going up and up.  They are very competitive about it!
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|twice now no response when app is selected.  first time l removed it  from my device then reloaded it. of course I lost my score and had to start over.  have reported the problem each time but received no response.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Bought this for my son,and I'm pretty sure I play it more than he does.A great way to pass the time.Very amusing.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I watched this on a recommendation from a friend and was blown away. Great characters and strong story lines. After one episode you will be hooked.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Yes the game is fun but my kindle keeps crashing from it. It needs updating because I can't even play it anymore. Other than that this game is very fun.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Blu-ray / DVD + Digital Copy for $13  What more can you say. Cheaper than going to see at the theater.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|I bought my girl friend this CD along with another for her birthdate. When I placed the order the price was right, but the arrival date was after her b-day. Times are ruff, so I couldn't pay for the fast shipping, but you all will be happy to hear it made it well before the time.
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|Blu-ray / DVD + Digital Copy for $12  What more can you say. Cheaper than going to see at the theater.

B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Good story...and I love all the characters!! The movie is very entertaining! and the whole family can watch it...but it could be scary for &#34;little ones&#34;.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|grandchildren love the game. i guess it gives them rewards as they go. why to go its hard to keep 10 years old interested
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|This is a great strategy game for all ages with multiple levels. Many choices and strategies to win each level create an  addictive game.
B009H5IS1W|4.0|I love this show it is honest to the interactions between people who work together a long time.  Looking both for complete understanding offered nowhere else.and for enough space to be allowed to be the human individuals they need to be in order to find the strength to do the job and still live outside of it.
B0037NVM1I|5.0|I can watch this over and over.  Great movie! That says it all, but I need six more words.  Bye!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|You can really hear sounds that you can't with other phones. Great midrange and very clean bass with no muddiness. Definitely a studio headphone.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Anna and John Bates are my favorites.  They killed off the best characters, which killed me!  But I'll be back for season 4.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This is, by far, my favorite Zombie novel. I loved the way it was written and the fact that it had a hopeful ending, unlike most other zombie novels.<br /><br />If you saw the movie with Brad Pitt, be prepared, this book has two things in common with the movie: zombies and the title.<br /><br />Hank Arnold (MVP)
B003O86FMW|4.0|The writing is stronger than the 1st book, even if the plot twists are a bit more obvious to anyone having read Hunger Games. Still, it is wonderful to see the development of the main characters and to wait breathlessly to see if their fates are what you have predicted to yourself. A super-satisfying read for everyone over the age of 11 or 12. On to the final piece of the trilogy.
B0001I55SS|4.0|The Black Hole Bowling Score: 262.5 of 300<br /><br />What, did you just give this campy movie from the end of the 70s a HUGE score??  Why yes, yes I did :]  For those of you not in the know I am an avid movie watcher with a LOT of time on my hands.  Using modern technology and a subtle mixture of both quasi and pseudo-science I have developed a formula for scoring movies totally unique to this business we call show.  It both quantifies the movie watching experience and has totally nothing to do with bowling.  It is, in itself, a thing of beauty.  A middle of the road movie would score 108, while a movie that was very much liked might hit a 192.  The Black Hole broke 200 and that makes it a true gem.  Here's why I scored it so high...<br /><br />The Black Hole - we own the DVD (Hey Disney - where is the Blu Ray, come on now)<br /><br />What's it about?<br />Group of space explorers in matching PJs \\"bump into\\" the great monster of the Big Dark Cold - a Black Hole, a long lost ship, the U.S.S. Cygnus, and her genius and possibly insane captain - Dr. Hans Reinhardt.  The back of the DVD cover says, \\"A story of robots and humanoids.  Of human genius and madness.  And a spectacular descent into nature's ultimate mystery - THE BLACK HOLE\\"  Oooh, chilling.  Of course the second biggest mystery (natural or otherwise) is how to figure out tax law but that would be another movie entirely.<br /><br />Ok, I get it - there are a few things we need to clear up right off the bat.  The special effects were a little wobbly at times.  I understand.  You can see the wires on the \\"zero-gravity\\" scenes aboard the Palomino and later when everything that could go wrong had gone wrong.  I also understand that the Cylons on the original BSG looked more believable than S.T.A.R. and his red-toned robot buddies (and BSG was a TV show... A TV SHOW).  I could spend hours standing here defending the special effects integrity of this movie but instead I will handle it this way:  Dude, this system uses a quasi/pseudo-scientific approach and if MODERN SCIENCE has taught us anything, literally anything at all, its this - you simply ignore any imperial data which contradicts your theory.  (pst, off camera I am totally willing to admit that you shouldn't have seen wires and cables holding people and props up - even back in '79.  Some of the special effects just didn't hold up, some didn't work to begin with but that doesn't mean that all of them were bad - some were/are wonderful!)<br /><br />With that bit of nastiness out of the way, I loved this movie.  The exterior shots of the ships, the suspenseful story, the descent into madness (not to mention other scarier things) all captured my imagination and were just fun to watch.  In a world awash in outer space tomfoolery (Star Wars, Star Trek on the big screen; Battlestar Galactica and Buck Rogers on the small) Moms and Dads were racing their young Gen-Xers to anything and everything with a star field in it.  While watching this film today I was still caught up in the thrill of seeing The Black Hole - this isn't just your standard issue Industrial Light and Magic computer generated effect - Disney did all of their own work on this film and it still looks both beautiful and horrifying.  The story holds its own with plenty of twist and turns.  The music can only be described as epic (even by today's standards).  The acting was well done.  The good-guy robots are cute aaaand intelligent (Vincent has a perfect quip for every situation).  Ok movie dude, would my over-electronically-stimulated kids dig it?  I would guess the 8-10 year old bracket would enjoy it.  Snarky teens wouldn't get passed the spots where the effects let us down (plus there are no emo supernaturals - unless you consider the similarities between emo teen vampires and universe consuming black holes... hmmm).  Beyond that 30 and 40 something nerds are a shoe-in to love it.<br /><br />What you'll love:<br />-  It's truly operatic... twists, turns, surprises, and some not so surprises and all done with Disney Magic<br />-  The special effects - the black hole, the matte work, the laser fights, the miniatures (which look anything but miniature on screen)... the meteorite (pst, meteorites are space debris that strike the earth, these would have been technically asteroids) destruction<br />-  It provides a playful and nostalgic romp thru nerdy Gen-X childhoods<br /><br />What you'll hate<br />-  Those pesky wires and other visible (but shouldn't be) tools of the trade<br />-  It's a late 1970s outer space drama but has a 1950s feel (hey, maybe you like that sort of thing, it was retro before retro was cool)<br />-  Some of the storylines are downright scary and not suitable for young family members<br /><br />Hey, if you have a question about this review, feel free to leave a comment and I will try to answer promptly.

1439127727|3.0|The New York times described this book correctly... \\"In what reads like the longest Time cover article ever written, Ms. Gibbs and Mr. Duffy create a sequence of baton-passing presidential relationships, offer a precis to characterize each neatly, and then cherry-pick the evidence to support the presidents' various involvements. I have to agree.  Both authors, Time editors, can write well.  This book is entertaining even if it is of limited informational value.  Most readers will have read much of the information before in the literally hundreds of biographies, memoirs, articles, op-eds etc that have been printed previously about these subjects.  I learned a few new things.  Many of the facts I learned were at the time of their occurrence classified.  Still this book which spans 530 pages plus a 100 page bibliography could have related these kernels in a 20 page article. Additionally, the book lacks footnotes so the reader cannot fact check these episodes easily.  A scholarly book must be able to be fact checked.  This book cannot be  without burdensome research.  So it is a pop-history book and as such it should at least be brief.  Further, the authors treat each subject no matter how odious his conduct with kid gloves.  They are very charitable in their descriptions of foibles.  As far as original sources go, the authors point to personal interviews with some of the more recent subjects, but they clearly conduct these interviews gingerly.  They do not probe.  It is as if they wanted to maintain their access to current and past presidents by earning a reputation as an easy interviewer who is not overly critical.  This is where they should have at least asked more critical questions.  Spoiler alert:  I learned the following which was new information for me:  Nixon derailed the Vietnam peace process in which Johnson was engaged to increase his actual and electoral votes.  Johnson was really on the cusp of a peace process when he obtained the South Vietnamese President's consent to attend a meeting with the Viet Cong.  However, Nixon through back channels urged the leader to hold off claiming he would get a better deal with a new administration assuming Nixon won the office. Johnson was aware of the betrayal but kept the information classified.  Many thousands of American boys and Vietnamese citizens died so Nixon could assure his win.  For that treasonous act, Nixon should have gone to prison.  Instead he became president.<br />When Bush 41 was engaged in obtaining the agreement of all  the gulf states at the U.N. to sanction U.S. action on behalf of Kuwait, Carter was happily pleading with all of them to deny approval of the mission.  This too was treason.  No private citizen can negotiate foreign policy on behalf of the U.S. unless explicitly asked by the president or his agents.  Bush 41 was livid and rightly so.  Carter was a wild card especially when it came to rogue nations like Korea.  Much of  the subsequent presidents' interaction with him was designed to clip his wings. Again I would have liked to read the source material on these incidents, but doing so would have been too burdensome.<br />Both Nixon's Watergate debacle and Clinton's sex and perjury scandals were dealt with very kindly, gingerly  in fact.  The fact that Bush 43 was denied admittance to the University of Texas School of law even though his father was head of the CIA, a rich oilman, and a previously elected congressman was  not mentioned.  His father's successes did not buy Bush 43 admission ,because he didn't have the grades and test scores.  As a result he attended Harvard Business School and had a hate on for Trial Lawyers associations his whole life.  He failed at every business he tried until his father helped him buy a piece of the Texas Rangers with family  money.  Even though he was general manager, the agreement with the other owners and the condition upon which he was sold the shares was that he would have no executive decision making powers.He was to be a mascot and PR person only. Nor did Bush 43 receive a hearty welcome home to Dallas.  Nevertheless, the authors tell us none of this easily ferreted out information on Bush 43. Bush 43's attempt to fund faith based initiatives with Federal monies was a clear violation of our 1st amendment.  Even though his view on this aspect of his presidency was lofty, it demonstrated a fundamental lack of understanding of the constitution which he swore to uphold. The authors don't criticize this conduct.They merely state that it occurred. The authors clearly want to get the reputation that they are interviewers who should be given access to current and future presidents and other leaders.<br />Had this book been titled: The Institution of the Presidency from Hoover to Obama and the interactions of past and current presidents, few people would have purchased the book.  However, that is indeed what it is about.  There is no \\"club.\\" There were no \\"club\\"meetings and no \\"club\\" minutes.  Some of these \\"meetings\\" took place no more often that twice in a year either by phone or in person if that. These authors scrounged up every tiny interaction, every nuance, every wink and nod between them and drummed up a 641 page book about them.  Surely, they were paid by the word.  People who like to read history/political books will like this. I would not have read this had my book club not chosen it and I suspect some of the other members would not have either.  I suspect most will not read all of it and many will only read 1/4th of it.  So don't believe the rave reviews listed here.  Read the New York times review online for a more accurate review.<br />We also know that the Presidents care about how history portrays them.  I suspect that Bush 43 will go down as one of the worst presidents in history.  Eisenhower will be deemed a mediocre president. Kennedy will be thought of as mediocre but with promise.  Johnson will be deemed the best president for civil rights and history will judge him to be one of the better presidents.  Both Nixon and Clinton in spite of their personal flaws will be judged to have been good presidents with Clinton judged to have been one of the better presidents.  Luckily, our system of checks and balances only permits the president to have one lasting legacy that could really hurt us.  He can appoint federal judges for life.  Currently we are stuck with Dubya's choices of Scalia, Thomas and Roberts.  They are all regressive choices.  Obama has said that Thomas is not qualified to sit on the Supreme court.  There are many who agree with him but who fear speaking out will cause them to be labeled a \\"racist.\\"

B009MO5960|4.0|Did not recieve ultraviolet code - looks like the outer cover was taken off and the UV code was removed
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I totally enjoyed Hosseini's previous books and knew I would enjoy this one.  He puts a new perspective into each one while holding true to the original concept.  This one took place in not only Afganistan, but also in Greece, France, and San Francisco.  This added new elements to his book.
B002KGEORM|5.0|This show is one you can't stop watching! Action packed. Full of drama. Never a dull moment.  You will watch the entire season in one night
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This was a very enlightening book.  Our book club loved it.  We learned so much about the actual meaning of each flower.
B001ANYDAO|1.0|Interesting but nothing special really. I would not recommend buying it. Starts off good and just goes downhill and gets a little depressing when it delves into airline crashes for a while.
B00DP3IESY|2.0|Two good actors who failed. Bad script with stolen ideas. I felt like I was watching clips from good SF movies strung together in a poor manner. M Freeman didn't seem to be even trying to act and Tom Cruise was pretty useless. The plot was bad and the actors worked at it's level. It was a waste of time.
B00CS9987W|5.0|Great movie! Great limited edition.  This is a masterpiece movie by one of the greatest movie makers.  Buy it, watch it, enjoy it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Five year old grandson says, &#34;Best game ever!&#34;. We enjoy playing it together when he visits which is quite often since he lives next door.
