B00000FCBC|3.0|I'm not a fan of covers albuns...usually the real versions are WAY WAY better than the covers...well, the covers album by SLAYER is GREAT....but this remake of GARAGE INC is really only for fans...i like some songs, but if you like METALLICA, you really should stick with their masterpieces like RIDE THE LIGHTNING or MASTER OF PUPPETS...actually, i really like the new one DEATH MAGNETIC, which i highly recommend to the METALLICA lovers!!!!!
B001152TL6|5.0|This movie is very suspensful and creepy! It's a little bit old but it's still a masterpiece!<br />I reccomend you buy it
B001FBSMF8|1.0|When i listen a few minutes of this, i totally lose my faith on ALL that i supposed to believe...I understand Pearl Jam becaming a folk band, but i will never understand why Cornell produce this abomination with rap and pop melodies...Cornell is one of my music icons, and i always will love his old classics like LOUD LOVE and OUTSHINED, but this is a shame...
B001AQT11M|5.0|I love this movie so im sure ill enjoy it.I havent actully recived the movie yet but it will be great.
B004YKB52O|1.0|that´s so unfair...while great rock bands breaks for drug problems or the loss of one menber, this nulity simple plan go on...it´s unbeliavable!! this is childish even for a child...seems like they play on tiny plastic guitars, because the guitar sound of simple plan is total sissy with a total lack of creativity or originality...all the songs sounds exactly the same, and all the songs are totally EMO!!!!STAY AWAY FROM THIS IMBECILITY, KIDS!!!!
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|The DVD arrived in excellent shape, a bit earlier than I expected it. All good. I had previously viewed the movie on television and enjoyed it immensely, which generated the interest to own it. It was brand-new and arrived in the factory wrapper. Thank you, Amazon, for your prompt, quality service.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|First of all, I'm a huge Harry Potter fan. If you simply want all of the movies minus any extras then this is the collection for you. I pre-ordered this and it arrived at my doorstep the day it was released in stores. I've had no problem with quality of any of the 8 films included in this set.
B000VBP382|1.0|I got the two discs....BUT it's missing the soundtrack cd and the booklet. Worse part is, I can't even return it because it's already opened. BOOOO. Do not buy!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|It is unbelievable to me that so many people found this book hot! Since when is physical abuse hot.  Since when is controlling a person, demeaning a person, and stalking a person hot.  On top of the subject matter the book isn't even written well.  I bought this book because of all the hype. I guess you can sell anything if you generate enough talk.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|The series is awesome and definitely worth every penny.  I recommend anyone buy the series, you won't regret it.  The books are also a great buy and if you like the series you will like the books more.
B004I744AS|5.0|use this app several times a week. sometimes just check out the daily info or play hangman. love it! couldn't believe it was free!
B004V5QWU2|5.0|Don't bother with the lite version, pay for the full version.  If you like any type of relaxation sounds or white noise, this is the app for you!  There are a slew of sounds, from nature sounds to environmental sounds like fans, to white noises. There are even several variations of sounds; for example, there are at least 3 beach sounds, from gentle waves to crashing rolling waves.  You can layer 3 sounds and set different volumes for each, and save your settings.  The lite version has fewer sounds. At the time of writing this review, the app is at a discounted price of $0.75 but it's worth every penny at full price.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Hi All,<br /><br />Firstly I never write reviews!<br /><br />I just wanted to log on to mention that this book is well worth the price! Usually I am not a fan of short stories (single book) however 'Wool' omnibus [[ASIN:B0071XO8RA Wool Omnibus Edition (Wool 1 - 5)]] was especially entertaining the whole way through.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Jono
B007KLEHUQ|3.0|Are you thinking to yourself \\"I've already got the other 2004 DVD, why do I need this one\\"? Well, apart from the tracklisting the performances are very different. After having watched the \\"Finally...The First Farewell Tour\\" DVD for the last seven years I didn't think there was anything more to see from this tour. BOY WAS I WRONG! The stage is much mor stripped down, and the venue has a whole different vibe to it. Disc one is the performance from 2004, and unfortunately it's not without it's flawes. First of all the audio is alittle muddy throughout, and the bass is too high up in the mix for the whole concert. Sometimes a backing vocal gets turned up too late so you can hear voices fading up instead of being right there when you know they're supposed to be, and the drum sound is somewhat flat throughout the concert as well. As far as the picture quality goes, I thought it was alittle dark throughout, and once in a while the camera edit wasn't quite right. BTW I'm refering to the DVD not the Blue-Ray. The second disc is Phil's appearance at Montreux in 1996 with his Bigband. For those of you who haven't seen Phil in this context, all I can say is this is why he's considered to be one of the greatest drummers in the history of modern pop music. The arangements of some of his solo hits, as well as some of Genesis's classic songs have to be heard to be believed! Disc two is really the reason you need to add this DVD to your colection ASAP! Disc one isn't perfect, but it is still worth having for the hard core Phil Collins fan. Disc two is the hidden gem in this 2-DVD set. I hope this review has been somewhat helpful to you. Thanks for reading.
0802473156|5.0|This is going sound like this is an exaggeration but I assure you it is not.  Every man and woman should be required to read this book and pass an exam prior to receiving a marriage license.  We do it for a driver's license yet we allow people to crash their marriages by the thousands each year. This is an excellent book.
B005L38QK2|5.0|First off let me say that this is my first mouse that was made for gaming so i was kinda worried about how the extra buttons would change how it feels. So I was truly shocked to find that it didn't feel any different to me at all. The button placement is such that I can use it regularly without having to worry about it at all.<br /><br />As for setting the macros and the settings of the Mouse with the downloadable Steel Series Engine it was so Simple.<br /><br />So Overall I find it to be Excellent!
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|this game is very fun and attictung! The only problem is that the colors cost a lot of coins.Other than that; its awesome!!
1400069289|5.0|My friend bought me this for my birthday and I can't thank her enough. I believe that taking this message to heart can truly change a person's life. I'm going to have to reread it because it's pretty deep and reading it one time isn't enough. I'll probably end up buying the kindle version and pass the hardcover to a friend. I have a lot of bad habits I hope I can replace with better ones. I like this book a lot.
B007SSDS24|1.0|I want a refund. Another prime example of hollywood ripping us off. Then again this too is just another propaganda based flick to prepare us for the false flag invasion they are planning for the population via \\"Project Blue Beam\\"!
B007V2UGPE|1.0|the game is broken. do not D/L or spen a $ on this. it will just stop working at some point. and all the money you spent is gone.
B004EPYZUS|4.0|\\"Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol\\" is  a lot more fun than \\"Mission Impossible III\\"s wobbly camera and humorless script. Over-the-top action flicks shouldn't take themselves so seriously. This one hits the right balance between suspense and levity. IMF super-agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is incarcerated in Russia for reasons that are unclear -even to the team who springs him. After agents Jane Carter (Paula Patton) and technical specialist Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) free Hunt, the trio is joined by defense analyst William Brandt (Jeremy Renner). Their mission is to infiltrate the Kremlin in search of the identity of a rogue Swedish nuclear strategist now believed to be a terrorist code-named \\"Cobalt\\" (Michael Nyqvist). But the team is in for a big surprise that causes the US to disavow IMF and the Russians to hunt them down, led by security agent Anatoly Sidorov (Vladamir Mashkov).<br /><br />In today's intimately interconnected world, it's difficult to find palpably exotic locations. \\"Ghost Protocol\\" takes us to Mumbai and Dubai, where Ethan Hunt performs death-defying stunts hanging from the famous Khalifa Tower. He crawls up the world's tallest building in the world using sticky gloves -which is kind of funny. And it's meant to be. The filmmakers often poke fun at the ridiculously high-tech equipment that the IMF team uses, as it tends to malfunction or simply be impractical. I was annoyed by Agent Dunn's persistent attempts at humor, but the film does some good-natured mocking of itself. It reminds me of an early James Bond film in its high-tech gadgetry and mad genius supervillain. Dunn is a kind of goofy version of Q. I did not particularly like the IMF team, but Tom Cruise brings an all-American charisma to his role, and the action gets the adrenaline pumping.
B000005J56|5.0|This is simply great. I used to play this in the car all the time--until I somehow lost it. So now I have one again, thanks to Amazon.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|i like this app a lot..... some people say you cant get out of it without shutting it down but thats not the only way,<br />go to STUFF and then go to OPTIONS and then you should be able to go HOME
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|this app was horrible! everytime I open it,  it closes and shuts down!! don't buy it! worst app in the world!! not worth it!
B00006WKSZ|1.0|Overrated only buy if you are a fan of this band and I ? the 5 star reviews about this album?
0307931803|4.0|This is a great book to read to toddlers.  Fox in Socks is a masterpiece of linguistic fun.<br /><br />However, this printing is not the whole book.  The storyline conflict between Knox and the Fox has been removed, as have many other small pieces, e.g. \\"If sir, you sir, choose to chew sir, with the goo goose, chew sir, do sir!\\"  (I read the full version to my older children a lot!)<br /><br />Having said that, the pages are cardboard, so toddlers can't accidentally rip them, and there won't be any toddler concern about why Knox is mad at the Fox.<br /><br />So, for toddlers, pick this up now, and get the \\"full\\" version when they're a bit older.
B006UG90RM|4.0|Must make one point first...  Love Van Halen no matter if DLR or Sammy is singing. ( hell even liked the VH3 material too... Gary just wasn't a great fit ).  I have been a fan since playing the 8-track of Van Halen(1978).  People (myself included once upon a time) need to set aside the Roth vs. Hagar crap and really just get into the jams.<br /><br />As for the this album my expectations were not really high what with all the health issues and bickering going on in recent years.  Shocker.... the record/cd is really pretty damn good.  Fun, rocking, serious and not so serious.  Eddie's playing is back where it should be.  Is it as good as say 1984/For unlawfull carnal knowledge?  No, but it is really a very good rock album.  Good from front to back.<br /><br />Now from my soap box.  My wish is that all in the \\"Van Halen\\" camp can come to grips with the past, present and future.  Everyone has an ego and expectation but there comes a time in everyone's life when things that at one time seemed so large and oppressive just aren't that big of a deal anymore.  You accept yourself and others for who they are and what they are.  \\"Van Halen\\" music should move beyond this idea of a competition between what era's songs/lyrics/solos/vocals are and were better.....  It is all some of the best rock music that has ever been produced in history of rock.  My hope is that when everyone's mental state is ready for it we will see the best from everyone involved... it is all just to good to let it fade away.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a great ap if you like a variety of games. Have only been playing a couple of days so far so good!
B0063IH60K|5.0|very fun a great game!and it was free. it fills the downtimr while you wait for the Kids. and appointments (
B002BWP49C|5.0|I have really enjoyed watching this AND all the features.  I just wish they had also included all the deleted scenes.  I suspect that when ALL five movies are released, they will come out with \\"new\\" sets that include that stuff as a way to get more money.  That's kind of sad and greedy, if true.
B0073LWEXK|3.0|I have loved adventure games since the TRS80 days of Pyramid 2000 (yes, I'm old) and although the look has \\"improved\\" adventure games are still basically the same - a good one is fun for everybody; kids and adults as well.  While Grisly Manor is slightly less frustrating, this game is along those same lines and well worth it.  One of my kids (6 years old) will play this with me for, literally, hours until I just can't stand it.  Anyone with kids will tell you that holding the attention of a 6 year old boy is no easy feat and speaks to the quality and fun you'll find in this simple adventure game.  Having said that, he definitely enjoys the puzzles in the game much more than the object find portions.  Fun and worth while.  We'll probably buy more by this developer.
B005OJTVMK|3.0|The Verve Tab Folio is an attractive case, but I was slightly disappointed.  The construction seems fine and I love the way it looks, but I was hoping for something more substantial.  It is very thin and I realize that can be an advantage.  I was hoping it could also double as a wallet and it can't.  There is a small half pocket on the left inside that my be able to hold a credit card or two, but I wouldn't risk it.  It's slim design makes it easy to fit in purse or bag and it hardly adds any weight to your device (I have the Kindle Touch).  If you are hoping to use this case in lieu of a wallet, this isn't for you.  If you simply want a cover to protect your device you may be pleased with this product.  It does leave three of the outside edges exposed.  The device will not be completely encased and if you toss it in a purse filled with other items, small objects may find their way inside (loose change, bottom of the purse debris, etc.).<br /><br />I believe had I searched further I could have found something more suited for my needs for the price I paid for this one.  It was an impulse purchase so I can only blame myself.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Great for on the go and keeping up with the pastor during Bible Study. Wish there were more downloadable versions (NIV, AMP). Sometimes force closes. Love the reading plans.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I never read Fantasy books, and rarely even read fiction.  A friend of mine suggested I give \\"Game of Thrones\\" a try while traveling, and after downloading it to my KindleFire, I couldn't put it down.  I am now halfway through the second book in the \\"Song of Ice & Fire\\" series, and am very excited to digest the rest of George R.R. Martin's books.<br /><br />I think the important part in Fantasy writing is doing it in such a way that the reader forgets it's Fantasy.  I always assumed the genre was one for weak writers with over-strong imaginations, using fantastic situations to duck around ill-conceived plots and poor writing skills.  I still think this is largely the case, but if so, George R.R. Martin is certainly a strong exception.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I watched this movie in the theater. I was blown away-great casting, wonderful special effects, and an amazing love story. For 2 hours, I was transported and totally absorbed in the movie. For the life of me, can't understand why it did so poorly in the US. But, I understand it has really done well internationally. I'm buying this DVD because its one of those rare movies that I could watch over and over.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book kept me reading from the very first page to the last. I even had my husband read this book. It has enhanced our love life. It is really a super book. The adventure and love story kept us constantly reading and not wanting to put the book down. We did not want to do anything else. We hope to see more books from this author.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I wish they would fix the game I was makeing some worms in one building and landing something wale in a bother building and the time last night was 10:00 and 1;00 know it shows it wont be done till 145:86 the game has a blocs in it fix it please
B004A8ZWWO|3.0|It is good to see the likes of Eddie Murphy, Ben Stiller and Matthew Broderick together in a comedy. For that reason alone, it was worth the viewing, but there are several reasons Tower Heist just didn't work. One of these is the lack of chemistry between the characters. The dialogue and character interaction was simply unimaginative and predictable. Eddie Murphy is back to his quick talking, bad boy ways, but this routine was more tiresome than funny or nostalgic. Ben Stiller is playing one of his typical roles, but really brings nothing new to the film. And Matthew Broderick seems a little out of his element. It's too bad the script couldn't have been a little more inventive.  Also, the plot alternates between being ridiculous and very predictable. It is watchable? Yes, but you can pretty much guess what is going to happen. There wasn't much of a payoff at the end, either.<br /><br />The film was entertaining at points, but seemed long, longer than its running time. It tends to drag with some unnecessary scenes that add nothing to the film. Tower Heist proves that you can't just throw a bunch of big names in Hollywood together, give them a script, and expect results. Tower Heist is the sort of comedy you watch just to kill off some time and be entertained without expecting too much.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this game rocks, it is safe and a great drawing teacher.  you can play with your friends from their email<br />facebook or even just their username. it rocks!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Its a lot of fun building new habitats for all the animal families and watching their families grow. Enjoy all the fun.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|When this movie first came out I didn't bother to see it.  It just seemed like some kind of stupid cartoon movie not worth too much attention.  But tonight it aired on cable TV so I thought I'd check it out of a couple of minutes.  After only a short time I was hooked on it and watched the entire movie.  It was truely great  and unlike anything I had ever seen.  The alien planet world was beautiful and amazing to see. I will probably buy this movie and watch it without comercial interruption.
B007V2UGPE|1.0|I can no longer papyri because the game is \\"frozen\\" at the start menu. The Play Game button no longer works. Fun game, wish I could keep playing...
0785162348|5.0|Having collected all of the previous Marvel Movie art books this one most definitely keeps up the great consistency. However, I do think the \\"art of Thor Book\\" is still the best. This book does a great job showing off the amazing character renderings and explanations for the designs but also weaves in some of the marketing art and design for this film and previous movies as well (Film posters, promo art, merchandise design and so on). Not only does this book serve as an art and design book but it also catches the reader up to speed on the Marvel Cinematic Universe Movie franchise even including a fold-out timeline so you even know the order of when certain events occurred in relation to all the films.<br /><br />The only thing about this book is that it seems to skimp a bit on art for the alien race: The Chitauri. Some of the best work in the book are the designs for these creatures...I wish they would have given us a bit more. I love the renderings for the character \\"The Other\\"....very creepy! I also wished they would have had some sketches of \\"The Mystery Villain\\" from the mid credits scene (I don't want to spoil the surprise for anybody who hasn't seen the film).<br /><br />If you have any of the previous art of Marvel books and enjoy them, there is no reason you shouldn't love this book. Like the others, this book comes in a high quality sturdy slipcase. The design and quality of the book is really nice, although I wish the pages were a little thicker. All this stuff is pretty nit picky. If you love the design and art of movies or Marvel movies you will love this book!
0767836286|5.0|the product was nicely packed -- thanks, and it came on time... what else can I say? good job, keep up the good work.
0345803493|5.0|I was actually pleasantly surprised by the second book. Its probably because I got used to and started accepting all the stupid annoying stuff from the first book \\"Oh my!\\", \\"inner goddess\\", \\"mumbling, muttering, blushing, flushing, lip-biting\\". i thought the emails were refreshing as they were in the first book.<br />I actually liked the way Christian's character accepts the changes (although I know in reality no one really changes).. but its nice to dream that they can. I'm a sucker for love... so I liked the marriage proposal, the way she said yes and the way he officially proposed.<br /><br />Things i didn't like... i know hes a hot shot businessman, but really... do we need to listen to his side of business conversations? They don't even make sense. And they don't add to the story. He's jealous of Taylor... Why??!!<br />Whats with the Kate Kavanaugh Inquisition... really?? Who is Kate... her outer goddess??<br />Too much sex... he wants it normal... suddenly she wants to cross over to the dark side. I don't understand that. I understand wanting to experiment, but seriously.. its only been 2 weeks... who moves that fast? Couldn't some time have passed before she wanted to get into the BDSM lifestyle?<br /><br />I have ordered the last book. I guess I'm not the kind of person that can stop reading in the middle of a trilogy :)
B0059XTUVI|5.0|I was surprised! The shipping was bubble wrapped and arrived early. I was happy with this purchase. The movie arrived in great condition and the purchase was everything I expected and more.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|I was so glad to see that this was FINALLY available for my Fire, but I am already getting bored with it! I was considering upgrading to the paid version but why do that when I keep seeing the same words over and over! It truly is lame compared to all the hype and build up.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I read a lot, but there are only some books that catch my attention soooo much from the first chapter that I can't put them down & this was one of them.  I started reading it while on vacation and managed to finish it within 2 days without a problem.  Excellently written and beautifully told.  I highly recommend it to anyone that likes reading books where there is a certain realistic characteristic.
B002QRWJA4|4.0|MY 17 YO DAUGHTER WANTED THIS MOVIE SO I BOUGHT IT FOT HER AND SHE WATCHES IT ALL THE TIME. SHE LOVES IT..
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|The core of the Avengers for the longest time was Captain America (the leader; the heart of the team), Iron Man (the technologist and financier; the brains of the team), and Thor (the raw power; the muscle of the team).  All other roster invites or additions (including the Hulk, who only played prominent in the original comics for a very short time) added something additional to the onion (including flavor) but the main three were indispensable.  So as Marvel's \\"The Avengers\\" bows to kick off a franchise, how does it do and does it live up to its characters?  We'll see.  (ALERT: some SPOILERS below)<br /><br />The great: simply put this movie overall is a fantastically fun time at the theaters (and is worth the 3-D change).  Whedon and company have done a very good job with balancing the screen time, presence, shortcomings and hero statures of all the characters (save for Nick Fury).  All of our heroes are ultimately portrayed in satisfying ways.  And the movie is flat-out funny at times.  I mean genuine laugh-out-loud funny moments.  Whedon knows what this is (a superhero movie with larger than life comic book characters) and he plays to types, not against, and does not try to dramatize the proceedings.  He knows the core of the characters (save for, perhaps, Nick Fury) and lets them have their day.  Steve Rogers, despite having only recently been thawed out and coming from a World at war with itself, still calls out people for what they are, most notably Tony Stark.  Stark, too, responds to \\"the old man's\\" ideals and is elevated by this by the end of the movie while ever maintaining his sharp tongue and acerbic wit.  Mark Ruffalo does a great job as Bruce Banner and imbues him with tragedy and dignity.<br /><br />The good: Tom Hiddleston as Loki has some nice moments of treachery and makes for a very good villain.  He gets close and personal to all of the characters and is able to sow seeds of dissension that bear fruit.  Watching our heros break down and fight against each other, especially Thor and Iron Man smacking each other around, get the fanboy juices going.  Scenes with the Hulk are fairly brief but all are also fairly inspired and an end scene with the Hulk facing off against Loki's rantings about how superior he is only to be cut short by the Hulk thrashing him back and forth into the floor whilst holding him by the foot are hilarious (well placed humor).  Scarlett Johansson does a bang-up job as the Black Widow and teaches Loki a thing or two about trickery.  Yo really cheer for this scarred character in this movie.  Hawkeye being taken over by and fighting for Loki was an unexpected treat (Clint Barton, a.k.a. Hawkeye, is one of my personal favorite characters from the original Avengers and I loved it when they set him up as team leader of the off-shoot West Coast Avengers; for those in the know in the movie his character is modeled after the Hawkeye from the Ultimates' universe).  Also, the 3-D and other technical effects of the film are all very good, very polished.<br /><br />The okay: speaking of the effects, though they are well-done, they will not blow you away.  Very little about this movie will make you go \\"wow, I've never seen that before\\".  That's okay because (A) every movie simply can't do this or live up to this standard and (B) that's not what this movie is about.  I only discuss this as so many people are always looking for \\"the next big thing\\" or expecting something new that will straighten their socks.  This is especially true of the bland aliens and the invasion plot; they are a MacGuffin, a simple contrivance with the purpose of fulfilling the real purpose of the film: bringing a band of disparate heroes together and uniting them.  Also, while the movie shows us that Captain America has become the leader of the team, it doesn't show this in nearly as strong or clear a way as it could.  Some people might like the subtlety of the approach they took; I wish they would have been more heavy-handed in showing his compatriots showing their deference and respect toward him (yes, even the snarky Stark).  But I will freely admit that this is a personal criticism.  And while having the team convene to finally put an end to Loki's threats, all standing around practically over him, showing a united front and fulfilling Tony Stark's earlier prophecy, for me it would have been more satisfying to have Captain A or even Black Widow or Hawkeye put him down for the count using some form of trickery paired with force.  But, again, that's just my thoughts and preference.  I am a fanboy myself after all...<br /><br />The bad: they miss the mark with Fury.  Samuel L. Jackson can chew scenery like no other and Nick Fury in the pages can do this too.  They have him by somewhat of a sop in this movie, always behind the scenes playing the chess game and making the necessary moves, always slick but also neutered to a certain extent too.  I understand that he is modeled also after the Ultimates' Fury but that guy was bada** as well as slick.  You loved to hate him.  Here, he doesn't inspire.  And he doesn't threaten.  Missed opportunity.  Suprisingly, the movie starts off slow and takes some time to hit a stride.<br /><br />The ugly: paying more than it will cost to pick up a Blu-ray of this movie for two people to see it in the theater.  But I am gonna see it again!<br /><br />My final thoughts are that Iron Man and Thor were better movies than The Avengers but that The Avengers succeeds at doing what it set out to do: bringing together the greatest superhero team that the world has ever known (this side of the DC universe), all the while keeping a smile on your face.  4.5 stars.n showing his compatriots showing their deference and respect toward him (yes, even the snarky Stark).

B004O3YGMC|5.0|I was using Orb for a long time, but they didn't have it for the fire tablet. Thanks to cnet I found out about this app. This works just as good as Orb, if not better. Now I have access to all my computer files, and my movie data base. So I can watch all the movies I want, no matter what format they are. I also like the fact that it will blank out the computer screen, @ home, while I use this app on my tablet. Great app. No problems. So far

B0068FYZIO|5.0|I am connected to Oskar. He saved one of my relatives by entering the man's name on the list of his employees, using the last name Schindler. The film is accurate. The acting is uniformly superb . I still had 120 relatives who died in the Holocaust.Not all of them were in Poland.
B0052VUNHC|3.0|It's a great story line but there is a big problem. The book is written in the past tense. It's very difficult to read because of that. This is a big mistake that others have mentioned in the reviews. I am really surprised that the author hasn't made the change. It also needs more work on describing the scene. The reader is left wondering how one action transitions to another. It reads more like a movie script - all dialog.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I finished reading Mockingjay this morning. Hated to see the trilogy end. This is not just for young adults, \\"older\\" adults love it too. My grown daughter recommended these books to me. I read the first two on my Kindle and Mockingjay I borrowed from the library. All three books are fast paced and a great story. Did Mockingjay end the way I wanted? Yes and no. Did I love it anyway? Absolutely! If you haven't read The Hunger Games trilogy, then you need to start now.

I suppose I could skip around and read the naughty parts, but as far as reading the whole way through? No. And I cannot even entertain the thought of buying the other 2. Don't waste your money.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I actually really enjoy this game. I have just a few problems with it. (1) No matter what I do, I can't seem to add friends, which makes completing a goal later in the game pretty impossible (or, at the very least, very difficult and slow going) . (2) When I was closing in on level 25, I took all my pieces and put them into my inventory to design my village better, this caused me to lose four of my more expensive families. (3) Why aren't we able to sell anything thing in this game?  If I could sell my excess decorations,  I'd be so much happier with this.<br /><br />Overall I like the game, despite the small annoyances here and there.  If I had paid for the game, I'd probably be disappointed, and maybe even angry with the minor glitches, but for a free game, I enjoy it. :)
1587613379|5.0|Being non-monogamous can be challenging; learning how things work, and how to handle the challenges this lifestyle brings.  This book is like going to a therapist and taking a college course combined.  I learned SO much.  There are many chapters covering all the different problems that can come up.  Being in a LTR or married, and adding others to the mix.  Jealousy, how to argue. How to make your spouse feel secure while having an open relationship.  How to open a relationship in the first place.  They never make it sound easy... and it's not.  Lots of human emotions must be dealt with to do this ethically.  But by the time you finish this book, you'll feel far better equipped to handle non-monogamy in a loving, ethical, and fulfilling way for everyone involved.  I highly recommend it.  And grab a highlighter before you crack the cover, because there are lots of passages you'll want to be able to return to.  Honestly, this book changed my life.  I feel smarter and more equipped to handle more than one sexual partner now.  Go for it.
0307593312|5.0|In IQ84 two 30-year-olds from Tokyo -- Masami Aumame and Tengo Kanawa -- stumble into an alternative universe where \\"logic is illogical.\\" In order to survive, they must figure out the rules of this new world and outwit some of the cagiest villains imaginable. The story abounds with some of Murakami's most creative characters, some of them fully fleshed out who appear on only a single page. I would be hard pressed to name a more fascinating character than Fuka-Eri, a beautiful, enigmatic 17-year-old who has written a sensational bestseller that kicks off the plot.<br /><br />Once again, Murakami alternates between two plots, as he did in Hardboiled and the End of the World, which inevitably merge. Both strands of the plot are absolutely compelling, and you find yourself turning pages as quickly as possible as you race back and forth between the two stories. Murakami skillfully leaves a cliffhanger at the end of each chapter, forcing you to think about and anticipate what you've just read as you breathlessly forge ahead in the present chapter. In a sense, you're off balance the whole time, but, ironically, balance is one of the main themes of the novel -- how to obtain it and how to keep it under the most extreme circumstances.<br /><br />Some have complained that at 930 pages this novel is too long, but for me it is too short as are all of Murakami's novels. I never want them to end. In this one, Murakami foregoes his usual, sometimes nameless, first person narrator and opts for third person so that he can trace the lives of the two protagonists. The novel, especially the ending, is not as postmodern as previous efforts, but it can hardly be called conventional. I suspect some readers might find the strangeness of the plot and some of the characters somewhat challenging, but for me, these elements heightened the experience. Like Hardboiled, The Windup Bird Chronicle, and Kafka on the Shore, IQ84 is my favorite Murakami novel. Now that I've read all of his novels, my only option is to reread them, at least until the next one emerges.only option is to reread them, at least until the next one emerges.

B005HJWWW8|4.0|I purchased this device in order to boost the output of my Samsung Galaxy Nexus in my car (I use a Bluetooth gateway).  The sound quality is great, in fact it does a better job than the OEM amplifier in my car, so I rely on the FiiO for the bass management now.  I highly recommend this device to anyone looking to boost the volume/bass without distorting the sound.<br /><br />The only minor issue I have with this device is that it doesn't turn on once you apply power, UNLESS the battery is charged.  If the battery runs out, it also forgets the volume/bass settings, so you will have to reconfigure it.  Not a BIG deal, but since I have this hidden in the console of my car, it is rather annoying.<br /><br />It looks like the battery will hold the charge for a while, but not sure yet if it will survive sitting there for a few days (will update this review once I have more data).

0345803485|3.0|You know what? I can't believe these books are as popular as they are being that they are so poorly written however, the Author did a great job on the characters enough to keep you interested. I am just about to read the third book and while I was reading the first book, it occurred to me that, this is nothing but a S & M romance novel. It's a romance novel S & M style or that was the carrot that dragged you perverted people in :)<br /><br />I hope to God that if E. L. James publishes another book that she ONE, stop repeating the same phrases over and over and over ad nauseum because these are some of the words I NEVER...NEVER, what to ever read again...<br /><br />Oh my<br />Ana, you're so wet<br />Oh Ana<br />Oh Ana I want you<br />Ana do you know what you do to me<br />MY INNER GODDESS-really?<br />He's so freaking hot<br />I can't believe he's mine<br /><br />Just get creative. Take a writing class. Read a Beatrice Small book or a Jude Deveraux romance novel because they, do sex scenes and plot right. Even Anne Rice wrote one of the best S & M books around and they didn't get near as much press as this poorly written tome. I can't believe no one edited this book and if they did, they should be fired. Who allows the same sex scene words to appear three page after the last one? The one highlight of book two would be the email banter THAT...was brilliant. Too bad the whole book wasn't done like those emails.<br /><br />Also, if these are Americans, there's a lot of language that we don't use and all I could hear was a British accent. If the characters are going to be American then don't make them sound British. I'm all for new writers and I hope that she takes some of that money and takes a creative writing class because OH...my.<br /><br />AND P.S. Ana is not some perfect woman that she can look down her nose at Christian all day long. All she does is fight with him and not know when danger in all up in her face that, was annoying to read. Now, if you'll excuse me...I have an erotic book to write seeing as though, it's that easy.
B000002JSJ|5.0|I have just bought Presence again after numerous years, I loved it. I loved Jimmy Page's guitar work and Presence is 100 per cent guitar. One has to listen Presence and I mean really listen, in order to truly appreciate the subtlety. The best way to listen to the album is in a quiet room with a nice red or a fine scotch.<br /><br />Guitar Greats:  Whilst I enjoyed all the songs of Presence, I especially liked For Your Life and listened to it repeatedly. It is now one of my favorite Zeppelin numbers. The two standout tracks are - Achilles Last Stand and Nobody's Fault But Mine. Check out the latter on the 2003 DVD - Led Zeppelin - and the live footage from Knebworth is breathtaking.  Once again, when I first purchased the Led Zeppelin DVD with live concert footage I watched the second disk repeatedly, especially the songs Achilles Last Stand and Nobody's Fault But Mine from their Knebworth performance.<br /><br />Criticism<br />I have read articles that alleging that Zeppelin themselves were not happy with Presence and hence -<br />Achilles Last Stand and Nobody's Fault But Mine - were the only two songs they included in their live set in 1977.  Led Zeppelin's live sets have mostly leant to the poor side. In fact, if Robert Plant had not injured his leg, Zeppelin in 1976, the band should have played For Your Life and the excellent rockabilly number,  Candy Store Rock from Presence, in their '77 live sets.  Instead Zeppelin opted for a lengthy acoustic set to rest Plant's leg.<br /><br />Presence - is not an easy album to listen to (hence the dramatic drop off in sales at the time) and it is the album that separates the pretentious fans - those only into Whole Lotta Love, Black Dog, Rock and Roll - from the fans who truly appreciate the bands sophistication. It is the latter fans that can appreciate the tracks on Presence. I was impressed with Page's work both as guitarist and producer on Presence. Pay attention to the rhythm especially the bass and drums on for YourLife, Hots on For Nowhere and Tea for One. Furthermore, I have never been a fan of Since I've Been Loving You and I blelieve that Tea for One leaves it for dead. Why did Page perservere with Since I've Been Loving You insted of the fresher, superior Tea for One remains a mystery.<br /><br /> Presence is Zeppelin's darkest album and the lyrics capture the momentum the band was caught up in at the time.  Many allege that the events that surrounded the making of Presence are far more interesting the album itself. Some of these events include Plant's recuperation from a horrific car accident, the band not touring and at that time escalating drug problems in regards to John Bonham, Peter Grant and Jimmy Page.<br />NOTE:  Three years later .... Page's problem is so prominent that whilst being physically present his musical input was limited and there were no guitar riffs on In Through the Out Door. Not a bad effort really for Zeppelin's last real studio effort and I happy to say that it is all guitar.<br /><br />Last Real Album<br />Friends I know consider it Led Zeppelin's last real album as all the band members were alive and functioning. Plant on a 2009 interview admits that he enjoyed participating on In Through the Out Door, but aks out loud what we have all assumed since 1979 and that is \\"was it a Led Zeppelin album?'  The answer is the same one that Depeche Mode's front man Gave Gahan gave in regards to their album, Exciter which was, quote \\"we felt like we were a cover band covering our own material.\\"  Plant makes the same inference in regards to In Through the Out Door.<br /><br />Please, please listen to Presence and I meant really listen in order to hear what a hidden gem it truly is.

B007Z9RAX4|1.0|this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, I wish I could get a refund, it's incredibly boring, & you notice that gina isn't sexy, she's actually unattractive, but in the trailer they showed you the clips where she looks her best...but throughout the movie she looks butch, & back to the movie it is very slow/methodical from start to finish...
B007HO392S|2.0|although Carrie has an AMAZING voice and can sing ANYTHING I was not impressed by this album at all. It is not a bad album and it is good but it is far from being country.  Her first album was the best and from that point it's just gone down from that point. She's a pop artist not country....
0345803485|4.0|I'm not into D/S S&M at all, so reading this had me nervous at first.  While everyone is ripping the author's writing style apart, remember that the book is supposed to be by a 22 year old girl who has NO sexual past.  The story behind all the semi annoying sex is easy to relate to for a first time love affair.  The confusion of emotions, the ups and downs, that is all very real.  I will admit, there is a bit too much sex, but it didn't bother me the way I thought.  And I love that the girl tries new things, and does not to hide her distaste and disgust for certain behaviors.  So it's not nearly as erotic as some other books, but it's perfect for us soccer moms!  It's just a book, so don't get so emotional about it!  Give it a chance and try to relate.  That's all we're supposed to do!

B006ZT47O0|4.0|[EDIT 9/17/2016:  I've had to add a note to the end of this 2012 review, as my appreciation for this band has greatly eroded in the intervening 4 years.  &#60;3.5 stars.]<br /><br />I like to ask the rhetorical question, &#34;what is this good for?&#34;, my answer to which usually has to do with whether the music in question is smokin' or drinking music, in any amount of flowery language.  That approach is not effective here.  Requiem for the Indifferent is genuinely uplifting, passionate music that nearly commands you to meditate on a more positive world.  The band does not adopt an offensive form of evangelism, though you might pick up a whiff of Limburger from time to time.  Epica exist in a universe composed of consciousness and meaning, and skew towards nondenominational pantheism. That makes it easy for the listener to adopt the band as personal champions for good and truth in the universe, and overlook the occasional intrusion of a political sound bite.<br /><br />When we are graced by a good mood, which for all we know is a boon from some mysterious patron deity, it is easy to perceive happiness in others, to notice beneficial coincidences, even to wonder if perhaps there is some wave that, like the ambling protagonist of Black Sabbath's &#34;The Wizard&#34;, eases life for everyone it touches. This projection onto the world and others is so natural a reaction that it forms the basis of astrology.<br /><br />Science would quantify such a wave, but the mere fact that human happiness and morality resists quantification does not make it a figment of our imagination. In fact, most of the &#34;forces&#34; held sacrosanct by science are utterly invisible and mystical-- like gravity, for example. Science just takes gravity as a given.  It reasons that consciousness should have status as a fundamental force too, seems as how it is the only thing we have TRUE empirical proof of, and considering how the scientific method has performed terribly when it comes to revealing the origin of consciousness.<br /><br />It is then that the paladins of Requiem for the Indifferent ride in, clad in futuristic-looking, articulated plate armor, swords held high, the enchanting Simone Simons at the lead, her voice a scintillating ray that suffuses everything it strikes with energy that may not be quantifiable, but nonetheless has dramatic effects.  Suddenly there are serendipitous meetings on the street; synergistic breakthroughs in the sciences; gridlocked group decision makers abruptly come to cooperate, artistic epiphanies occur.  All sums that are greater than their parts, and that can only occur when everyone is operating on a higher frequency at once, as this band does on Requiem.<br /><br />Undoubtedly the problem with modern society is that it is not geared to capitalize on such beneficial cosmic waves, and this is why Epica are your personal good guys.  Interestingly, throughout the last decade we have seen a proliferation of non-Chaotic Evil, not-so-Satanic metal bands, so I suppose you could just as easily side with the hard-headed, monotheistic Lawful Good of Killswitch Engage and their ilk.  But the point is that nowadays you have choices.<br /><br />Of course, no amount of righteousness would be of note if the music was not just as good.  Reading some of the negative reviews here, you might get the impression that Epica have went the hyperactive, schizoid, and overproduced route of latter-era Dimmu Borgir or Cradle of Filth. That is not the case. There are time changes, which keep the music interesting and progressive, but it's not like heavy-handed synths and guitars are swordfighting through every second of every song over both clean singing and screeching. The songs here allow themselves plenty of room to breath.  As with Design Your Universe, this album is so catchy it is unbelievable.  &#34;Storm the Sorrow&#34; gets stuck in my head a lot, but &#34;Delirium&#34; is a close contender for most memorable song.  All the epic bombast is there; the choirs, the orchestra, but Simons has so many vocal hooks that you never lose sight of the focal point of this band, and the songs rarely feel disjointed.  More sprightly than the old-school beauty and the beast doom bands, this can also be digested in a single sitting.<br /><br />While Simons is clearly the lead singer, the death metal vocals of Jansen are f'in awesome. I love this band for not bowing to pressure from the &#34;clean singing&#34; lobby but rather integrate as many extreme vocal parts as ever. Seriously, that represents taking a stand for metal. It also honors this band's roots in the beauty and the beast branch of the old metal Yggdrasil.  As other people have pointed out to the haters, this is METAL you fools, not pop rock.<br /><br />[*EDIT* 9/17/2016:  You know, I am genuinely sorry if anyone took offense to that last statement.  In the four and a half years since I wrote this review (it was originally posted on May 4, 2012), I have come to the conclusion that the dueling-vocals thing here is *not* really any better than the cheeseball mix of clean and harsh vocals in metalcore a la Killswitch Engage, or in over-the-top absurdist black metal a la Emperor and Dimmu Borgir.  In retrospect, I think the only band that can really pull off this type of &#34;gothic metal&#34; is Sirenia, who wield the strength of Morten's compositional brilliance and his magisterial death metal voice.  Of course, now that band is screwed too, having lost (fired?!) the irreplaceable Ailyn.  In the case of Epica, even dispensing with the death metal vocals will not prevent the jarring loss of focus that occurs when a band throws together so many ideas that just don't make sense.<br /><br />On the internet, to reverse your position is a sign of weakness.  But this is Amazon, not some troll forum, so I am willing to display how my musical taste continues to evolve, and admit and owe up when a mistake is made.  This is at best a 3.5 star album, and it only deserves that many stars because of the songcraft.

0553801473|1.0|A few months ago when I started this series I was sure this set would be something I wanted on my bookshelves.  Game of Thrones was definitely a five star book in my opinion, but the books have been slowly deteriorating, A Feast for the Crows was decent, but A Dance with Dragons has been such a slow read.<br /><br />There are too many points of view, I feel detached from most of the characters because there are so many, I am also a little paranoid to get too attached to any character, I feel like the author could kill them off at any moment.<br /><br />Okay, now I just want to rant.  I thought all of Westeros would have had to come together by now to battle the Others or Whites or whatever the boogeyman in the north is. Is that going to be the eventual progression?  Honestly I think that with how slow the author has become about putting the books out he will be dead before anything interesting actually happens.  I mean, how many years did it take to put out this book, like 5.  I just don't want to invest more time if the next book is going to come out in another 5 years and NOTHING will happen!<br /><br />Did anyone else feel like George must have been hungry or eating himself as he wrote this, there seemed to be a lot of discussion about food in this book.

B000FCKC4M|5.0|I am on my 2nd time reading this marvelous book.  I have loved Mr. Coelho's books since the first one I read, \\"The Alchemist\\" and have several others.  They are like old friends, and I go back and re-read them.  Some I got from the library, some I have purchased, and now I am getting some old friends and some new for my tablet.  Coelho's books aren't really novels in the traditional sense, at least to me.  He is a marvelous \\"storyteller\\" and, as with any good story teller, he leads you into, through and around the twists and turns of the story, spilling out pearls of wisdom or giving a situation a different perspective; hence my comment about \\"thought provoking.\\"  Too, his stories contain moral dilemmas presented to the reader, with the reader being allowed to determine or wonder what he/she might do if faced with the same or a similar dilemma.  I would highly recommend this book, particularly to anyone who is in a relationship (or ever been or wants to be) with someone who has a strong, but perhaps not obvious, spiritual bent.  It does let us draw our own conclusion as to whether what sends the seeker in this story on a quest for one dear to him and the change in his perception as he rises, and sometimes slips, in attempting to fulfill his truth.  And now that I've discovered his daily blog, my day isn't complete without reading it - not too long but just the lift I need for my spirits.  I've not done justice to the book and others have described it better, but I couldn't go by without rating it and recommending it.  Serious stuff, but not heavy!  Some have said rather autobiographical; if so, I say great, he's just telling it like it is.  I see no arrogance at all; conversely a successful man with humility enough to know there's more to life and love than \\"success.\\"

It's a shame it wasn't more embraced by American audiences (I won't get into a diatribe about our tastes in movies).  This film is a great way to escape into another world for 2-1/2 hours.

B007549W62|1.0|I will say \\"The Divide\\" wastes absolutely no time in getting started. Without any opening credits we see a mushroom cloud forming over the NYC skyline and an apartment building's residents making a mad dash to a bunker in the basement.<br /><br />And that is about the only positive thing I can say for the film. The following 2 hours is just mind numbingly dull as we watch the survivors of the initial blast yell, fight and in general be mean to each other. That's it, that is the whole story. 9 people argue and torture each other over food, over sex, over...well just about over anything and everything.<br /><br />Apparently a nuclear armageddon turns most males into drunken bully frat boys, while most women sit around and stare at things. \\"The Divide\\" takes a promising cast and wastes them. You'll hate all of the characters, none have any redeeming value, and at the end of the film you ask yourself \\"Do I really want any of these people to survive?\\"<br /><br />Not sure what they were going for with \\"The Divide\\" but it really accomplishes nothing.

B0071T5PN0|2.0|Seems like the good ol' boys have been through the ringer too many times.  There is nothing left.  I couldn't wait for the band to get back together and it is really disappointing now.  Nothing like 'Me Wise Magic' which was just OK.<br /><br />The lyrics are just horrible.  Roth stumbles through with no enthusiasm at all and there is nothing new to see here.  Put words on a page and let's go tour with it.<br /><br />Eddie's guitar is good; at least you can tell it's Eddie playing.  At this point, I don't expect wild and fast but something more crafty would be good (drilling pickups on Poundcake!).  Alex has always been a decent drummer and without Michael Anthony it is not the same.  Wolfgang does have some talent though so there is a silver lining.<br /><br />I really felt ripped off with this purchase.  I struggled through the CD and put it on the shelf.

B003NHR79Y|5.0|Juliet, Naked is written from the perspectives of a 30-something woman named Annie and an aging musician, Tucker Crowe.  Their stories are about love (romantic and familial) and regret.<br /><br />Annie, who lives with her long-time boyfriend Duncan, finds herself unhappy in her relationship and her job and is in therapy.  Duncan has devoted years of his life to studying the works of the mysterious Tucker Crowe, and the couple's blow up argument over Annie's review of a Tucker Crowe album leads to their break-up.<br /><br />Tucker is a burned out musician who disappeared from the music scene just as his career was taking off.  He then went from relationship to relationship, creating several children over the years with different women, leading to another divorce which leaves him the single father of a 6-year-old boy.<br /><br />Ironically, Annie connects with Tucker after he reads the review she posted online about his album and this connection changes both of their lives.<br /><br />Although regret is one of the major themes in the book, it is not as dreary as it sounds.  Annie and Tucker have regrets about the choices they have made in their lives, but they discover that their paths can be altered by making different choices now.<br /><br />If you like other Nick Hornby books (How to Be Good, High Fidelity, About a Boy), you'll like Juliet, Naked, too.  I love all things Nick Hornby!  I did not want this book to end.
1469984202|5.0|That's the bottom line for me. There has to be a great story, or I lose interest and stop reading. That did not happen here! I read the Omnibus in 2 days. I borrowed it from the Prime library originally, then decided I'd like to read it again. I think I missed things the first time. So I ordered a hard copy from Hugh Howey's website, which he signed. I've never been able to do that before, thanks, Hugh! In fact, since I got a Kindle, the number of fiction print books I've bought can be counted on one hand. But I had to have this.<br /><br />This engaging story of life after this civilization is fascinating. All of society has been reduced to one underground silo, as far as anyone knows, and the only view of the rest of the world is through cameras. No can go out there and live. People want to anyway. Of course they do. Human curiosity never dies, no matter how repressive the society may be.<br /><br />Hugh's exploration of his character's feelings makes them come alive in the story, each an individual, but part of the whole as well. Different jobs and different ages for each character makes them very much real people to the reader. The common thread is the human need to know and understand their place in the world, and how that world came to be. Why is the outside deadly, how did it get that way, why is it not allowed to even ask? Everyone wonders, and hopes for answers, while living day to day in a complicated, close knit world.<br /><br />An intriguing story, written extremely well, with plenty of room for more stories to come. So many questions to be answered - this is what I think makes a classic. Anyone can enjoy this - it's not just for SF fans. It's about people much more that science of any kind. Enjoy!
B00479SVBU|3.0|I really like how the sound cable is detachable and the fact that you can use SD cards with this little guy.<br /><br />Worked really well for quite a while. It fits a little tight into the aux port though. This seemed like a plus at first, since it prevents it from wiggling around and losing sound quality, or falling out.<br /><br />It's not that durable though as I found out recently when pulling it out of the aux port. It snapped right in half, with the little clear, plastic piece on the inside shattering and the wires detaching from the circuit board.<br /><br />I'd really like to find one of these FM transmitters that can actually stand the test of time, but this one was OK for the price point.
0670023329|5.0|Blaine Harden, the author of this compelling story, takes great pains to make the reader understand his efforts to prove the validity of the remarkable story he tells:  the escape of a prisoner(who has spent his entire life in a prison camp in North Korea with nothing but brain-washing by the government and guards) from North Korea and the subsequent changes in his life and understanding of the world.  It's an extraordinary story of thought control that has lasted decades, geography and demographics utilized to maintain power for the ruling family and the abysmal living conditions for most people (whether in or out of the prison camp) in North Korea.<br /><br />While the story evokes tremendous admiration for the former prisoner, it also made me appreciate the many aspects of life in the U.S. that we take for granted.  Freedom, of course.  Food in its infinite varieties, yes.  Public schools for all, yes.  But more than that - we take for granted the love of our parents.  (Yes, I know this may not be universal...)  The book's hero never experienced that love, as the system he lived in was created to deny it.  Whether that early indoctrination can be changed is just one of the many discussable points.<br /><br />Highly recommended for the story, the psychology, the very full understanding of North Korea and the threat it is to the U.S. and the excellent writing.  A must-read.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|This book was very short and I missed the personal stories of how the sniper attacks his target. I would like to have read more about the research about how a sniper is assigned his target.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|At this point, I'm just piling on -- this book is simply incredible, and Part 6 \\"First Shift\\" is even better, in my opinion.<br /><br />It is particularly fun to watch Mr. Howey develop as a writer in between Part 1 and Part 5, and then just really open it up in Part 6.  You will not go wrong reading this book.
B0014DQSG2|1.0|This film was way too predictable - my 10 year old was rolling her eyes and begging to turn it off and was batting about 90% on her predictions on what the next scene would be. Firth is fine and so is Jonathan Pryce, but they're not even enough to distract from Bynes'awful performance - if you can call it that. Someone mentioned it was a \\"teen\\" flick - I beg to differ - it would be ok for pre-teens maybe, I can't imagine any teenager actually sitting thru it. It was just tiresome and silly. Sad waste of Firth and Pryce. Amanda Bynes' eye-rolling and tripping was old after the first 2 times and just got irratating after that. Can't say there was anything much redemable about it - it was just really bad and this is coming from a big fan of Firth's.

0345803485|2.0|This book was really rather stupid.<br />I had heard all the hype, and I just had to get it. Boy was I let down.<br />It reminded me of a cheesy porn movie. You know, where there's some kind of awkward acting just to build up to the sex? Yeah, that's like the first four chapters.<br />The characters are so one noted. Ana is awkward, and the only thing she does more than blushing is biting her lip. Grey is supposedly some dominant guy, yet he gives into her every whim without much thought.<br />Overall, it's just lame.
B0050PYNP8|4.0|Like a shopping list of all that is bad about Hollywood comedies, this movie seemed to have it all. Start with Seth Rogen and Jason Bateman - arguably the two most pervasive actors working today, add in some CGI and plenty of dope smoking and beer drinking, and toss in the well-worn buddy/road trip scenario. All that was missing was Judd Apatow's stamp of approval. The comparisons stop there, however, because that's the one conspicuously absent element in Paul.<br /><br />Paul completely took me by surprise as one of 2011's best as well as a downright keeper of a movie. Clever, quick paced, chock full of pop culture/sci-fi references, and funny, with a dash of sentiment and some of the most brilliant swearing in any movie ever, Paul is a perfect example of what Hollywood can do when it truly puts its collective head into something.<br /><br />Bateman goes a bit against type but Rogen is his same slacker self, as if the role was written specifically for him. This is the only negative about the movie, not because Rogen does a bad job, but because he is so over-exposed and the character of Paul is the least fulfilled of them all. Brit's Simon Pegg and Nick Frost (the movie is their idea and they demonstrate why cheeky is much more appealing than crude) do the heaviest lifting, but they are supported by a worthwhile cast. Notable is the cute and naïve portrayal of a former Jesus Freak-turned swearing novice by Kristen Wiig (good enough to forgive the gender equality stupidity and puerility of Bridesmaids) and a warm and edgy Blythe Danner as the pivotal character who first makes extraterrestrial contact decades before. There's also a lovely surprise in the form of an obvious cameo.<br /><br />Paul not only makes you laugh, but it also brazenly skewers Christians fundamentalists (granted, that's like shooting fish in a barrel) and the whole geek culture of sci-fi with spot-on accuracy and nose-thumbing glee. Not bad at all for a movie that looked groaningly dumb during previews last year.<br /><br />Paul is good enough that it gives me strength to keep trying comedies in the hopes that I might once again come across a true needle in the haystack just like it. Definitely recommended.reviews last year.<br /><br />Paul is good enough that it gives me strength to keep trying comedies in the hopes that I might once again come across a true needle in the haystack just like it.

006016848X|4.0|I feel like a lot of the reviewers here expect the impossible.  No book will ever speak to the soul of everyone's experience, and this one really isn't trying.  Mars/Venus can help you to think about your experiences with your significant other in a different light, and it can be a great resource for growth and development of your relationship.  But, you must take care with how you read something like this.<br /><br />\\"Men Are From Mars, Women are from Venus\\" leans on a lot of stereotypes and personal experiences of the author to assemble its opinion on what the ideal relationship between a man and woman looks like, and because of this, it is not a perfect fit for everyone (or arguably, anyone).  That said, stereotypes exist because they apply to a significant portion of society, so it would be wise to at least know the stereotypes and societal norms of the other gender.  If you haven't gone beyond \\"Women/Men are weird/don't make sense\\" stage, then it's probably worth the buy just for the sake of learning the generalities.<br /><br />As with anything that's said about groups of people and then applied to indviduals, you'll find that neither you nor your partner totally fits the mold of the things Gray talks about, and I've met many a couple that has the exact opposite experience (Cavewoman engineer, emotional man who wants to talk about every detail of the day).  As you read a book like this, you need to consider what from it actually applies to your partner (and to you) and what doesn't.  It could really be helpful if both of you read it and discuss what you agree or disagree with about your depictions, and about the practicals that he offers and whether they really are what your partner wants.<br /><br />The beauty of the book is that it helps people who are used to their way of thinking to see that other methods are just as valid and come from generations of success in fulfilling different societal roles.  The danger in it is twofold.  First, these societal roles are changing rapidly, so a lot of this won't fit or doesn't apply the same way it would 2 generations ago.  Second, your partner is an individual who defies any stereotype...they will fit some of the mold and not other parts.  If you take every generality in the book for face value without talking to your partner about it (that ALL women, for instance, ride emotional rollercoasters and have emotional breakdowns at their low point), you may anger your partner and make them feel like their individuality is being ignored, or that you just really don't know them at all.  This stereotyping happens on both sides, so if you're reading it together and your partner does this, take the time to discuss it and define how you're different from what the book portrays.<br /><br />The book is only a starting point for understanding, meant to lead you back to your partner and give you some light practicals to change along the way.  There are many books that dig into the topic much deeper and in a more accurate, scientific manner (with actual research and real PhDs!), and if you want more info on them, there are lots of other reviews on here that will point you that way.  Again, no book will take the place of knowing yourself and your partner.  But, if you are stumped and not sure where to begin in understanding something your partner does or thinks, this is a good place to start, as it is a simple, conversational read with memorable examples. If you are patient and careful, it will provoke you toward questions and conversations to have together that will lead you to the real, individualized answers for your sweetheart.are changing rapidly, so a lot of this won't fit or doesn't apply the same way it would 2 generations ago.

The book provides a fantastic and structured approach to the most important business model all, your personal career. I found the book to be not only useful, but enjoyable to read and work through.  It provides thought provoking questions that make you reflect on where you are, where you want to be and how to get there.  Lots of interesting examples of people who have gone through the process illustrate the process and how it has worked for them. Probably the best book I have come accross for personal career evaluation.

0345803485|4.0|I started reading this book after I kept hearing Ryan Seacrest talk about it on his morning radio show. I read the five sample chapters from Amazon and was intrigued enough to keep reading. Halfway through the book, I got bored. The writing is mediocre and it is honestly the same dialogue over and over again. The \\"romps\\" change a little bit here and there, but it's basically the same scenario over and over again.<br /><br />For whatever reason, I can't stop reading it though! I think I just want to know what happens to Christian and Ana and it's enough to get me to look past how repetitive the book is. I wish I had a Christian Grey in my life now!

B00005LOLD|4.0|It really isn't worth denying that Marlon Brando was one of the greatest actors of, not just his generation but really ANY generation.  He just had such natural flow to his rugged progression of character.  He understood who to disappear into a role and `become' whoever he was portraying.  Even his lesser works were still monumental achievements when compared to other actors of the time.<br /><br />`Sayonara' is one of those lesser works by him, but like I said, this is still no small feat.<br /><br />The film as a whole discusses the racial prejudice that dwelled in Japan during the Korean War.  Brando plays a fighter pilot promised to a general's daughter who happens to meet and fall for a Japanese entertainer.  His buddy, a fellow pilot, also falls for a Japanese woman and actually marries her, which causes immense trouble for him and his wife.  Trouble follows Brando's character, Gruver, as he builds his relationship with the beautiful Hana-Ogi.  He's hesitant and yet he is discover something about himself he wasn't aware of before; happiness.<br /><br />As a romantic drama, `Sayonara' doesn't always work.  Brando and especially Hana-Ogi are very good (she deserved that Oscar nomination, not Miyoshi Umeki) but their `star crossed lovers' build up doesn't always have the impact desired.  More attention is shifted towards the sub-plot concerning Gruver's friend Joe and his Japanese bride.  Those are the moments where the film actually takes root in something strong.  The way with which racism and political controversy is handled is very well, especially for a film of the 50's.  It is daring, but in a more conservative and commercial way.  Some balk at that, possibly considering the treatment soft, but I actually admire the way that it can be sewn in a way that is impactful yet palatable way.  Joe and Katsumi's final scene is devastatingly sincere.<br /><br />The film's finale does feel a little forced or faked or not really in tone with the film as a whole.  I just didn't buy it nor did I respond to it like they obviously wanted me to.  That said, there is a lot to admire here.  The sets and costumes are beautiful, the acting is really good on almost all fronts and the detail in certain areas is poignant, even today.t didn't buy it nor did I respond to it like they obviously wanted me to.

1609611543|5.0|I was skeptical.  I have been through it with so many doctors.  I have followed their guidelines and plans aka diets and told I must be doing wrong or not following what they told me to do exactly.  (I was anal about keeping track too!)  There was \\"no possible way\\" I could be gaining weight or maintaining if I was eating what they told me to.  Then someone mentioned this book and I started reading and researching.  I have been gluten free for 3 weeks, lost 24 pounds and am feeling so much better.  I know now that I am severely gluten intolerant (possibly celiac) and all the things that were happening were due to the gluten in my diet.  My \\"severe eczema\\" that was only ever on my hand and ankle, completely CLEAR!  You can barely tell right now that I had dry skin on my hand.  A complete turn around of something that normally was itchy, oozing and gross that the doctors gave me some cream for, said it was eczema, and couldn't figure why after 5 years it had NEVER healed. It was my body trying to tell me that all the whole grains were killing me slowly.  It was my body's last resort after not getting the hint with severe inflammation and arthritis and autoimmune disorders....<br /><br />Wheat Belly has a handful of recipes and some great information to get you started on the path to well being, just like your ancestors.  Don't look at this as a diet book, it is a complete life change.  Anyone who has celiac disease knows you can NOT ever ever go back or eat anything with wheat/gluten in it.  The AGONY of it is too much (I found out after a few weeks off gluten the truth of this when something I ate had gluten and I didn't realize till it was too late...).  So read the book and try it for a month.  I know it maybe difficult to begin with, but you are eating such wonderful food that after a month there will be no reason to go back to the junk food that is killing you.<br /><br />Processed foods, wheat and gluten containing in particular, are not our friends.  This book reminds us our bodies were meant to process food directly from the Earth and in a particular balance. Be sure to check out the Wheat Belly blog too.eminds us our bodies were meant to process food directly from the Earth and in a particular balance. Be sure to check out the Wheat Belly blog too.

0345803485|4.0|I noticed about 3 chapters in that the author constantly uses the following terms EXCESSIVELY: 1- 'er....' (I think she uses this instead of 'um...') and let me just say, it's annoying.  2- Ana biting her lip (girl needs chapstick apparently).  3- Christian 'cocks his head to one side'. 4- Christian puts his hand to Ana's chin and lifts it up so their eyes can meet (he must be a giant, and she must be 4 feet tall).  and 5- Her first time giving a bj and she is next to near perfect at it (ok, this isn't repetitive but I am not buying that for a second...at least tell us she used to practice on bananas or something).<br />Now my admission....I am only halfway through the first book, and even though these things can be quite annoying, this book isn't THAT bad.  It has a catchy title, great cover design, fairly decent storyline, and the imagery of a super sexy man who takes charge.  I would hate to put down anyone who has crazy fantasies from reading this but to me this is not shocking (I used to work in a 'sex' shop).  It might come off as exciting to those who have never really been dominated, so perhaps a good thing that might come (pun intended) is that some women go to their local sex shop and pick up a few items, thus stimulating the economy, giving to small businesses, and releasing THEIR inner goddess who might be hiding under that bed, finally getting out.  And lastly...in a world where most women are in charge of cleaning, cooking, driving kids to events, organizing, and let's face it...ruling the world, it is a nice change to just lay back and slip into a world where for once someone else (Christian Grey) is telling YOU what to do.  Don't think too much about this book...just enjoy it.

I had to tape mine on to keep them in place.<br /><br />On sound:  They definitely aren't a pleasure to listen to, and you will find your ears fatigue quite quickly.  I have six different pairs of Pro headphones, and these are definitely my least favorite now.  Not only do they sound flat, they have problems all over the frequency spectrum.  I got these when I first started working on sound (and didn't know much), this is my second pair bought in an emergency.  Ten years on I would never recommend these to anybody.  Definitely go for AKG, Ultrasone, Beyerdynamic, or Audio-Technica before you waste money on these cans.  I couldn't be more frustrated.  At least they are metal.
B0074EIQUG|5.0|I had never heard of Dr.John before,a friend recommended this album to me knowing that I'm a Black Keys fan and one of the band members produced it. Wow! One of my new favorite artists and after reading up a little I'm embarrassed to have now discovered him before now considering how influential he is.
0439023521|2.0|I think it was a good book, but not the best I've ever read. The first one is my favorite, but with the other two, not so much. I don't like Katniss, she didn't have a good personality and wasn't what I expected for a heroine. Peeta is too sweet and perfect and Gale is a mess. I don't think Collins thought that through. It was very predictable. She isn't going to kill Katniss off already.<br /><br />Catching Fire was even worse! It was pretty much the same thing as the first book!<br /><br />I couldn't even finish the last one. It was soooooo boring!!!!,
0439023521|5.0|I read many books but seldom follow a series. I did with this book. From the beginning, I thought How horrible. Oh my goodness. Oh no. All the while flipping pages to find out what happened next. And then I reached the end and said, \\"Where's the next book?\\" I immediately found and read it and then the next one. Great job!
B007PBKG5G|2.0|After reading all the press on this band, hearing a segment on NPR, and seeing them on Letterman, I was very excited to hear this album, especially for only 5 bucks. Unfortunately, I was disappointed as none of the cuts deliver much in the way of excitement at all. There are a lot more throwback bands out there - Black Joe Lewis, Carolina Chocolate Drops- that deliver the goods. Don't believe the hype, the Alabama Shakes need more punch and better production before they really rank as a top act.
0439023513|5.0|Books are difficult to end well, but trilogies are nearly impossible.<br /><br />Collins did an excellent job in my opinion. In fact I think this is the best of the three books. It's packed full of action and twists. It's darker and grittier and shows many symbolic and non-symbolic comparisions to how people, government and societies act in real life. Many people were upset at the ending, but for bad reasons in my opinion. It's obvious in the end that Katniss is going to have to end up with either Peeta or Gale. The author did a good job making both characters likable so many people thought Katniss chose wrong. In my opinion I couldn't be happier. Also, people felt there were loose ends left over.<br /><br />Trilogies tend to end two ways. Too short or too long. I think this was just right, bordering on the short side. After I finished the book I though about how excellenet it was. Then as I started reflecting on the book, I began the mourning process of being done (deep readers will know the feeling. It's like you've lost a bunch of friends even though they aren't real). I started realizing, I wish I knew more about this character or that and found myself wishing the author would put a wiki of conlusions online for each person to hit on points maybe missed. But as I thought about I realized that this book was written in first person. In real life, especially when we didn't have facebook and smart phones, you don't know everything that happens to friends, exes, etc. It's just life and I think it was portrayed well. She left just enough detail so you know what everybody might be up to, but doesn't draw it out to weaken the ending and ruin first person accuracy. You may not be happy with how some of the characters end up, but does everybodies life end happy? It's a real ending!<br /><br />Wonderful book, but I am sure my review won't matter because as you have most likely read the first two books, you are already sold on the third.  But maybe it will help calm your questions about the ending.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I purchased Season 1 after reading the book.  I would highly recommend reading the book first, it sets you up for the entire story and then when you watch the series it makes more sense as you can start putting faces and names together.  I had to fill in information for a friend who had not read the book and only watched the series.  I really do feel that I got more out of the series and book by actually reading the book first (normally I don't do this), but the series does miss a lot of information and background that the book is able to offer.<br /><br />I love the medieval fantasy that the series and book has to offer, it definitely sparks the imagination and satisfies my nerdom of loving both genres.

There was plenty of nights where I didn't go to bed until way later than I should have and had to actually force myself to turn it off. Its one of the best series I have read. I am sad that I am almost done with the 3rd. LOVE IT and defintely recommend!

0345803485|3.0|I have heard about this book for over a month now and my local DJ was the one who originally had my interest piqued on reading this. I downloaded the preview version, which anyone who does, be forewarned, where the story leaves you off at (approx Chapter 3), WILL not leave you wanting to read more. I actually was angry and seriously considered not even finishing it, so I emailed the local DJ and a friend that recommended this book and they explained to me it does get better, much better.<br /><br />So, I ordered the eBook version and I got hooked. There were some issues I had with the book, but I didn't dwell on them and continued to read the book. I feel a lot of people going into this thinking this is a stand alone book, which it is not, even though now they are trying to make it as such. This story originally started as a fan fiction of Twilight, so yes, there will be SEVERAL similarities with the characters in this book versus Twilight. And this is where I think a lot of the 1 star reviews are coming from. I honestly think someone should not review the book unless they have read it from cover to cover, it's a rather unfair review and if I was only judging on the first 3 chapters, I would have never read this.<br /><br />If there wasn't such repetitiveness of actions, thoughts or certain looks. It just seemed like she lacked imagination (but not when it came to the steamy scenes). A lot of the stuff she reused throughout the story made me think of when my kids think they have done something funny. First time is great, but after that, it gets old.<br /><br />And the sex scenes, most were definitely steamy. But I am not a fan of inflicting pain or receiving pain, but being tied up is highly erotic.<br /><br />I do not know who E.L. James editor was/is, but did they proof read her novel before publishing? She did after all write fanfics, and this story was the fan fic that she shared online, but when the demand of readers asked her to publish, she changed the characters names from Edward and Bella. The original title of this book was \\"Master of the Universe\\"<br /><br />I did find some parts in the story where I had a hard time putting down the book, but then there were parts I had no qualms putting it down and walking away from it. But I wasn't glued from beginning to end nose in the book. I love a good story and will try any new genre of writing once, but I am hooked and am curious to see how this story goes.ters names from Edward and Bella.

0345803485|5.0|I devoured this book, and then downloaded the next two at the same time so I wouldn't have to wait one second to continue!  Even without the amazing sex, this story is amazing.  I am anxiously waiting for E.L. James' next books!

0670022705|5.0|When I began this formidably lengthy book I thought I would cherry pick among the 100 objects, choosing the ones that seemed interesting and skipping over others. In the event, I found it difficult to skip over anything, for each chapter seemed to contain new and absorbing information. I thus wound up reading about virtually every one of the 100 items pictured.<br /><br />Neil MacGregor is a scholar of singular erudition who writes in a lively and engaging prose style. With the aid of numerous specialists whose commentary he invites, each of the 100 objects is brought to life by being placed in its appropriate geographical, historical, anthropological or archeological setting.<br /><br />This is a truly wonderful work of scholarship, one that is as pleasurable to read as it is didactic. Anyone interested in the history of art will not want to miss it.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I had never read a romance novel before, but I kept hearing about this book and how amazing it was and decided it would make an interesting read. I had to find a book to entertain me and distract me while my husband was having minor surgery. From the first page of these books to the last page of Fifty Shades Freed, I was spellbound. I became addicted to these books, every free chance I had I was picking it up. The story,passion, lust and sexuality of this book speaks volumes. It was bittersweet when I reached the last page of Fifty Shades Freed, as I knew I would no longer read about the \\"coming of age\\" of Christen Grey and the assertive becoming of Anastasia Steele. I would love for these books to become a televison series (for course one shown on either HBO or Cinemax so that all the enticing parts are kept in the story line). Will definately read the entire trilogy again.

B0076D20E8|3.0|Anonymous had the potential to win over many people as the first major mainstream expose of the Shakespeare authorship debate. Whilst an interesting film in terms of its underlying concept, I spent the first half hour of the movie trying to work out who was who and what was going on. It was only when the issues of Shakespeare being a front for the Earl of Oxford came to the fore that my attention was hooked - although the depiction of Shakespeare as a buffoon was way off the historical mark - a country bumpkin perhaps but he was actually very shrewd - just look at his business activities and money lending activities (little known facts about Shakespeare I know - but my blog explores this more).<br /><br />Overall once the film settled down it was good - but was a little confusing about what it actually was - was it a political thriller or an expose about Shakespeare being a fraud. This does not seek in any way to take away from great acting, great historical sets and the attention to detail by the director (to the point of ink on the fingers). Worth viewing but not that memorable.<br /><br />Tim Lea<br />Author of the Pelican Code - a contemporary thriller about Shakespeare not writing his own works<br />[[ASIN:B0061JPT78 The Pelican Code]]
B007ZYK3CE|4.0|This movie stays with you after watching it, or at least it did us.  It's not a feel-good, laugh type of movie, it is pretty dark and has some very depressing moments in it.  We started watching it after renting it through the mail, but it did not have subtitles on it and was impossible for us to understand with the thick accents but thankfully we found it through streaming that did have subtitles and we were able to finish it.  It is a good movie, well-written, great casting on it and the acting was excellent.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Every so often, something magical happens in Hollywood: a movie comes out that's so big, so epic in scope that it can only be called epic.  Such films have included \\"Gone with the Wind,\\" \\"Star Wars,\\" and \\"Titanic,\\" and now the superhero genre joins their ranks with \\"The Avengers,\\" what just may be the biggest, most amazing superhero film to ever grace the silver screen.<br /><br />\\"The Avengers\\" tells the story of Marvel's biggest heroes, Captain America, Thor, Iron Man, the Hulk, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and Nick Fury, must join forces to combat a threat so great, that if they fail, the earth itself will fall.<br /><br />To put it simply, \\"The Avengers\\" is the most epic superhero film ever made.  A rather big statement to make, but the fact that it even exists is nothing short of astonishing: a massive cross-over film where multiple superheroes from multiple films comes together with the same actors from all of them (well, save the Hulk) to act as the climax to a series-wide storyline that's been in the works for over five years now.  It's a miracle that it even came together, and that it works.<br /><br />What is so great about \\"The Avengers\\" is that it's so much damn fun.  We've been following Captain America and Iron Man and all the other heroes as they had their origin stories, and now that all the exposition is out of the way, the film gives us exactly what we want:  Superheroes saving the world, beating the crud out of lots and lots of bad guys, and bantering with each other.  From the halfway mark to the very end, \\"The Avengers\\" is a non-stop barrage of action and incredible sequences that took my breath away, often from the action, and also from laughing at the near-endless stream of hilarious moments (in a wonderful surprise, this is the funniest superhero film I've ever seen, but I won't spoil any of the jokes).  Yet, balancing out all the action were many little character moments that make each hero come alive with their own refreshing touches, such as Black Widow's desire to overcome her bloody past, or Captain America wanting to keep everyone together when they're all in danger of drifting apart.  Even among all the explosions, punches and hammers, \\"The Avengers\\" has a strong emotional core, and makes us care about our heroes as they plunge into battle.<br /><br />Are there any flaws with \\"The Avengers?\\"  Well, the story can be pretty weak at times (Loki's motivations, his plan for the Avengers, etc.), and there's an awful lot of talking early on.  Do any of them matter?  I was having so much fun that I didn't care in the slightest, cheering with my fellow audience members, laughing with them, and gaping in amazement at the spectacle before us.  For two glorious hours, all of us were kids again, caught in the excitement and sheer wonder of larger-then-life heroes working together to save the earth.<br /><br />\\"The Avengers\\" is not just a superhero movie.  It's an event, a film that oozes fun and coolness on par with seeing Godzilla fight King Kong.  It's a sheer joy, and for superhero fans, it's not to be missed.

B007HO392S|4.0|Carrie Underwood deserved to win season 4 of American Idol. She has a great voice and can carry a country tune well. With that, she has had three hugely successful album and now a fourth one.  Carrie's fourth album, \\"Blown Away\\", is a pretty good collection of country songs of the countrypolitan variety.  It's not groundbreaking, but it will satisfy Carrie's fans and most country-pop fans.<br /><br />The album features a variety of the typical themes found in country music - love lost, love reunited, cheating lovers, having faith, small town life, and letting your hair down. The only excellent songs on the album are its first three. \\"Good Girl\\" is a rock-flavored, upbeat song where Carrie gets feisty with a boyfriend. \\"Blown Away\\" has the best melody and chorus on the album. About an alcoholic father, it's the darkest track on the album. \\"Two Black Cadillacs\\" tells the story of a man's wife and mistress meeting.  This track definitely has the best production and lyrics on the album.<br /><br />The rest of the album includes some songs that are pretty good, others that are just okay.  Pretty good songs include \\"Good In Goodbye\\" (a mid-tempo track about a reunion between two lovers), \\"Nobody Ever Told You\\" (a song meant to build self-esteem for those who may need it), \\"One Way Ticket\\" (upbeat, reggae flavored fun song), and \\"Who Are You\\" (last track, shows Carrie's pipes well).<br /><br />Fans of Carrie Underwood and country-pop, check it out for yourself.<br /><br />(4 out of 5)
B007BWUGJ0|3.0|I owe both 1984 and 2012 new version pressed on 180g vinyl, but the original dated 1984 is much better! Bass is full and strong, sound is clean and warmer. 2012 version is based on a digital master, not on the original analogic master tape, the results are a compressed version closer to an mp3 than to a good 180g analogic remaster.<br />The same problem regards Michael Jackson's Thriller: the original version (also re-edited on a 180g vinyl) is better than the 25th anniversary remaster, which is digital.<br />Hope this info can be of any help for the readers.

B004I8WD6E|5.0|I love, love, love this case!<br /><br />I bought an Incipio case a month ago, which was absolutely wonderful.  Unfortunately, my cat ate the silicon inner-case when I took it apart to clean it.<br /><br />Not wanting to go through that again, I started looking for less expensive cases.  I saw this and read a lot of really good reviews and the price was right, so I bought it.  I'm so glad i did!<br /><br />This is a really well made case.  I already dropped the phone once and you can't tell by looking at the phone or the case.  Both still look brand-new.  I can't tell if this is made out of stiff silicone or hard vinyl, but whatever it's made out of, it's terrific.  It's just the right consistency to protect the phone, have a good grip and be fairly easy to put on and take off.<br /><br />The case and the film were both easy to apply, and I like the fact that this clear case shows-off the aesthetics of this beautifully designed phone.  Why get a  phone that looks so nice and cover it up with an ugly plastic case?<br /><br />The only drawback is that this case and the film show more fingerprints than the phone does.  There seems to be something about the glass that the iPhone is made out of that seems to repel oil and fingerprints.  Or maybe it's just that it finally started to get warm around here, and that's causing extra sweat, etc.  Regardless, it's a minor and trivial complaint.

Instead of being able to choose between Sony's software or iPod you get forced into Sony's software. Almost everyone else who's tried to do this has failed.

0345803485|5.0|I have read so many reviews on this book, some bad, some good, some \\"eh\\".<br />I read this book knowing that the author was a Fan Fiction writer so the Twilight similiarities I can understand (and appreciate) completely. This book was a lot of fun. I liked how dirty it was and found myself laughing out loud at the dry sense of humor (especially through the email exchanges).<br /><br />My understanding was that fans of E L James' fan fiction stories begged her to release these books in hard copy. So for all the readers who are criticizing these books saying they are not well written, too erotic, silly, etc. I don't believe it was the author's intent to write an award winning novel to be put on national reading lists. Her intent was to give the fans what they wanted, the rest of us jumped on for the ride.<br /><br />These books are fun, silly, erotic and have given my friends and I another set of books to pass back and forth. They were meant to be entertaining...not life defining.

B0076I624W|2.0|The only reason I was in the theatre was to see the opening day premiere of the Episode I trailer (little did we know Lucas was about to destroy his own franchise). We ended up staying for the movie.<br /><br />Which was a mistake, because when Brad gets hit by 3 (THREE!!! Talk about overkill!) vehicles near the beginning of the film, I could not stop laughing at the overwhelming stupidity of it. I guess the director thought so little of his audience that he had to really make sure you understood that he be dead. Anyway, I couldn't stop laughing, so I left the theatre.<br /><br />Any movie that thinks so little of its potential viewers that it has to drive that particular point home in that particular way deserves to never be seen, and I'm happy to oblige. Which is too bad, because I like the cast...even Hopkins, who has coasted through many a film on the stink of his banal Oscar-winning role. Brian Cox was the superior Lecter.
B007UXTG8M|3.0|Let me preface this brief review with a \\"tip of the hat\\" to the actors, the editors and the production crew. The quality of the acting and the quality of the production were impeccable.<br /><br />However, when it comes to the story, I haven't seen such a dull piece of emo tripe since the first \\"Twilight\\" movie. Seriously. Every one of the characters in this mellow drama [sic] just needs a serious dose of MAOI inhibitors combined with a regular regimen of full spectrum lighting.<br /><br />Again, let me iterate that the performances were amazing, but the writer/director needs to take more \\"B\\" vitamins and stop writing such dull, self-serving scripts.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|the game is alright but its not a game where u can play it all the time and not get bored with it. got rid of it because it just got boring
B006WQLH7G|5.0|This app works well on Kindle Fire and it does perform updates like it should.  The user-interface is very nice.  You can download and install a free anti-theft program from Avast! through this app (although some features are not accessable because you cannot 'root' the Fire).  This anti-virus scans all your installed apps and you can even schedule scans for certain days at certain times.
B0076NAWWA|4.0|This electrifying debut by Flying Colors is a killer melting pot of musical styles from some of the best musicians in rock. Combining the talents of four respected musicians with a relatively unkown vocalist was always going to draw alot of interest and criticism but Flying Colors have managed to produce a great album that fuses elements of progressive rock with memorable pop hooks and a clear influence from some of the best British bands of all time. Steve Morse on guitar and Mike Portnoy on drums are the main driving force of the music while Casey McPherson provides an interesting melodic voice to capture the essence of each song. Neal Morse on keys and Dave LaRue on bass are also thick in the mix providing the groove and texture to these songs. Highlights include the amazing sound and wicked guitar solo of \\"Kayla\\", the great groove of \\"Forever In A Daze\\", the brilliant harmonies of \\"Love Is What I'm Waiting For\\", the awesome musical interlude of \\"All Falls Down\\", and the explosive performance of \\"Infinite Fire\\" where the band truely fires on all cylinders. Flying Colors is a great album that is highly recommended to fans of Queen, The Beatles, Muse, and Pink Floyd. By the way, check out that cool album artwork.
0345803485|5.0|Where to begin......Lets start with \\"in love\\", I am now on my 3rd time reading all three books again.  I just can't get enough of Anastasia and Christian's love story.  I am not quite sure why it is considered \\"mommy porn\\", why yes there are quite a bit of sexual encounters in this book it is so much more than that.  The love, passion, excitment, danger, unknowns in this book is what has drawn me in.  While I already have them on my kindle, I have now bought all three paperback books so that I can be ready for the book tour that E.L. James is on.  I have highly recommend these books to all of my friends and anyone that would listen and will continue to do so.
1400069289|4.0|I blew through The Power of Habit in just three days. It was a very interesting book, but I think there are parts where the author kind of reaches to make his points.<br /><br />He gives a story about a guy who suffers from a virus(or is it bacteria? I don't remember) that erodes the part in his brain that stores memory. He's in his 70's and every day his wife takes him for a walk along the same route, but as soon as they arrive home he doesn't recollect going for a walk at all. After so many days he starts to leave on his own and walk the same route alone and show up back home,sit on his chair and go on with his day like nothing happened, not remembering he just left.<br /><br />I thought that was a very good example of habits developing, but later in the book the author goes off on how habits where responsible for the civil rights movement and he kind of lost me there.<br /><br />His premise was that because Rosa Parks had habits that made her involved in the community and everyone knew her that the bus incident was taken as more of an outrage because she was so well liked and well known. It feels like the author just needed some filler to make the book look thicker so he did what college students do when they have to write an 8 page paper with only 4 pages of information. They start reaching for anything to meet the minimum.<br /><br />Overall there's a ton of interesting information in this book like how Target can predict your life stages by your shopping habits, and there's stories of a compulsive gambler, and a man who committed a horrible crime while he was asleep. I think this book would be better off if it were marketed as just a book with a bunch of interesting facts because there is some reaching by the author.<br /><br />That being said I would still recommend reading it because there is some good information on habits and how you can change them. If used the right way this book can allow you to make changes in your life and that's usually a good thing.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed playing this simple yet engaging game. You could play it over and over and still never master every level. Both peaceful and frustrating.
B004X2M7MK|5.0|I'll admit when David Tenant \\"regenerated\\" I wasn't too happy about it.<br /><br />It took a couple of episodes into season 5 for me to appreciate what Matt Smith brings to the table, but I have to say him and his bow tie have grown on me.<br /><br />I really liked season 6 for 2 reasons. 1.) The writer does a very good job of tying in twists with with episodes in the past, it's written as a season, not individual episodes. 2.) It might be me but I think Amy Pond's accent has gotten thicker and I love Scottish accents.<br /><br />Buy the season or Amazon Prime and watch it.<br /><br />P.S. the only thing that sucks is the Matt Smith Christmas specials aren't covered by Prime so you may have to pay for them if you're a subscriber.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Being a reader of romance for about 20 years now not many books have left me knowing I will never forget this one for the rest of my life. I don't get how women find it scandalous or ashamed to be reading it…did they just come out from under the rock? This book is tame and beautiful compared to hundreds of other erotica that can be read and truly hardcore BDSM. All the hoopla because of prude women that were not aware of this genre of novels.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It's been a long, long time since I read a book I<br />couldn't put down.  I've read the reviews about the<br />sex, read past it if it bothers you, there's more to<br />the book than that.  The story will keep you turning<br />the pages. Thanks EL James for waking me out of the<br />everyday rut, I sure do appreciate my husband and family<br />all the more and am making everyday count!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing book.  The movie doesn't do it justice by any means. Also it's a pretty easy read for people who don't do a lot of reading like me.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|some of the games on the higher pages get into the 200000 point cost to unlock. this game would get a five from me if the unlockable games were less time consuming to unlock.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I loved this book and found it to be well written and intriguing. I loved the magic and how she utilized it in the story. The characters were well developed and interesting, adding much to the story. I want to go visit a circus like that!!!!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a very basic game but great for mindless activity when you're chilling. I don't care for all the spin on a game of solitaire so this one works good.
B005MVLI8A|3.0|There is still hisses and crap on Something in the Way and there is a full blown guitar error 1.07 in Polly - sucks hard.  But the tunes are cool.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|I hate this game...also it does not make it easy for you to exit..I had to shut down and then uninstalled it
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I was excited to finish the series after reading the first 2 books, it took me a lot longer to finish the book and by the time i actually got around to finish it I was just over it. Parts of it are realistic (issues in relationships) a lot of it isn't realistic (him having endless amounts of money at the age of 27.) It was ok, I was just ready for something new by the end of the book and the ending was so so, nothing amazing.
B007QRWXJG|5.0|I'm not sure why one person reviewed this season so poorly--it is certainly gone back to some of the surrealism and edginess of the first two seasons.  This is probably my favorite one since Season One.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|samurai vs zombie is a great game that provides hours of great gamplay and action. I was impressed of the different alleys you can get and the upgrades you can get I suggest you get this game if you like strategy action games.
B0068ZZ6CI|4.0|at $16.99 for the digital download, this collection lives up to the price. Although I already owned all of Rammstein's previous albums, I purchased this one for the remix's and to complete my collection. Some good remix's, and some classic songs make this worth the money. I recommend this album for any dedicated Rammstein fan like myself. More Rammstein never hurts.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|i love this game! i've had it for over three years on my iPhone, and purchased it again today for my new Android tablet.<br /><br />it's a great way to relax and have some fun!<br /><br />the first few levels are training levels, so by the time you are REALLY playing, you don't notice the change in difficulty.<br /><br />the zen garden is nice to collect coins to buy more upgrades in Dave's crazy shop.<br />you can increase how many plants you can use in each game this way.<br /><br />the sound effects are separate from the music of the game, which you can control - i mute the music but keep the sound effects about 25% so i can hear the game say \\"brains\\" in the zombie voice - that gives you notice of when the zombies are approaching.<br /><br />i don't purchase many apps, but at $2.99 this one is my first download for my tablet!<br /><br />enjoy!
B007R41E8O|4.0|love the graphics.  The game is challenging enough to keep you hooked but not so hard to br discouraging.  The arrows are a must to get you where you need to go. SOOOO when's the sequel? ?????
B006AZZPCM|1.0|I have insurance on my kindle so if I needed to replace it or something I could. I just replaced my first kindle and the geek squad said it had some sort of virus. I'm getting this one replaced for the same reason. Youtube, although fun and has great videos and music. It has a lot of virus potential. Which I got from this. I'm not sure if it was an ad that got in the way or video but it erased my whole drive. do not get this app. This is my second kindle that it has wrecked. I'm not getting it again.
B005ERX20E|5.0|All fans of Angelina Jolie should own this film. Be warned, this movie depicts the REALITY of making poor decisions. If you can't stomach watching a young beautiful girl struggle with addiction and ultimately losing her life to it, then stay away.
B00457WZEI|4.0|It was so easy to see the characters and especially the horses come to life.  The whole book just captivated me.  I could not put it down.
B005IQZB14|1.0|Great book ! Fabulous story. Did you have any lasting foot injuries?  But,  I wanted to read about the PCT. Spiritual and personal redemption was incredible, but I didn't want to read about sex, drugs and rock n'roll.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is addictive and its easy to forget the time. Some of the games are more challenging than they look.
0765322889|5.0|I am just into this book and loved it from the first paragraph.  In my ind the hallmark of a master of this art is character development and substantial, deep mood setting.  That's what separates the geniuses from the hacks.  Evoking the presence of the characters, their worries and perceptions, and the feel of their world...which means the plot itself develops slowly.<br /><br />Erikson nails it.  The only other other I have read who compares, and in fact reminds me of him a great deal, is CJ Cherryh.  If you like Cherryh you'll love Erikson.
B0055SWM08|5.0|A surprisingly wonderful game that is enjoyable and calming at the same time.  I have never experienced a game like this before.  You truly owe it to yourself to try this.
0792849124|5.0|The item was shipped quickly and neatly packaged. There was no problem whatsoever and am very impressed with everything. They seem like a good company!
B00400NHRO|5.0|I read this book when it first came out.  I am in the medical field, and at that point was flying frequently to visit my then fiance in Cambridge.  Several times I  WOULD BE SITTING ALL ALONG,LAUGHING.  I decided to reread it this spring, and got the same response.  If you don't like black humor, are not in favor of medicine, you may not get the same jolt, but no matter what, you will be facinated.

1402786360|5.0|If you are familiar with Heather Baird and her award-winning blog, SprinkleBakes, then you are going to be thrilled with her book, SprinkleBakes:Dessert Recipes to Inspire Your Inner Artist! If you aren't familiar with Heather Baird's blog, then this is the perfect introduction!<br />This is not your average cookbook! Besides an abundance of eye candy, wonderful instruction and recipes, Heather becomes your personal cheerleader as you read through each chapter. She takes you out of your own comfort zone and prompts you to think \\"outside the box\\", leading to creative baking and inspiring you to put your own \\"signature\\" on each recipe.<br />An amazing book!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Book made me physically sick at times. Compeled to finish to see if there was any redeeming value.  Did not find any except that it was over!  I must admit I am naive when it comes to the atrocities of war. This wasn't for me and children that I know.
B00466HN6S|1.0|This was a burned copy of the movie! I wasn't pleased with this being a present for my daughter's Easter present. However the movie was cool and fun for the family.
B002ONC9NC|4.0|This film was a beautiful coming of age tale--the kind I hope to write some day. The characters were well-developed and likeable. Upon first glance, it is a \\"chick flick\\", but a man who has a sensitive side will appreciate the rich landscapes and devilish male characters. Carey Mulligan made a brilliant, effortless, seamless transformation into a woman and her parents were lovable. Albert Molina is by far one of my favorite actors and his performance was honest and heart-warming.
B004UID2LC|5.0|this is such a good app..I can download music and videos any time that I want. I would want everyone to get it because its so simple and easy!!
1401937519|5.0|Most of all I'd like to thank Anita Moorjani for her decision to write this book. It was very confirming to me to read her feelings, her knowing for sure, 'during' her NDE that this was the real 'thing'. This is how we all are 'supposed'to feel, this is who we really are.<br />We don't have to dy to feel this way.<br />It was recognition to me, so Anita brouth me to tears, to read this in her own words.<br />Thanks again!
1401323820|5.0|I ordered this book so that I would have a hard cover copy of each in this series and I'm extremely glad a bought it from these guys. It was delivered very quickly and it is much better condition than I was expecting.
B004Q3RDVG|5.0|I had seen the movie \\"Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" (english version) prior to reading the book and after the read was very pleasantly surprised at how well the movie followed the story line, which prompted me to follow up with reading the other two books in the trilogy.  I am now looking forward to seeing the next movie(s).  It was a wonderful read and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for suspense, drama and a great story.  Could not wait to finish one book so I could get started on the next.<br /><br />I enjoyed it so much I just read another similar book by another Swedish author - and it was great also.<br /><br />thanks...
B0006IUDXA|5.0|Being big into hunting and camping and growing up on MacGyver and liking it, I bought the first season for both entertainment and to see if I could pick up any interesting camping tips.<br /><br />2 episodes into it I'm guessing I won't be picking up any real camping tips but its still entertaining to me.
B007X15GRQ|5.0|Great movie with great acting, direction, and strong cast. Thoroughly enjoyed it,,,  the strong story line with great cast makes it a worth watch. Yippeee,,,,
B002ZG994U|4.0|If I were to watch the first season of the tv show before watching this movie I probably would've lowered my rating even more. The problem is the tv show was just too good and this movie gets downgraded based on the comparison.<br /><br />If you've never watched the tv show then you'll probably like the movie. If you did watch the tv show, keep those memories and don't ruin it by watching this movie.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I only bought ithis book because of all the publicity!  what a waste of money.  No one would be this stupid or needy.  And there are two more of these? what a sad day for literacy
1400069289|1.0|The first two chapters weren't bad. They made me think that the succeeding chapters would be even more interesting. They weren't. The book fell off a cliff at that point. Chapters on companies that turned around -- I thought I was watching CNBC. The science, which is what I was interested in, apparently is only enough to fill one or two chapters. Then the author manufactured a bunch of filler to make it book-length, most of which only seemed to relate to the topic marginally. And if you're looking for a self-help book to help you break bad habits, go somewhere else. The advice is: find out what reward you get out of the habit, then do something else to get that same reward. There, you don't have to read the book.<br /><br />If the book is intended as an advertisement for Febreze, it's fairly effective. I found myself actually wanting to buy a bottle, but then realized I was probably being manipulated. (Years ago, I read the label on a Febreze bottle. It said make sure the fabric you're spraying is clean first. If my couch was clean, I wouldn't be spraying it with something to remove odors! Give me a break.)<br /><br />And woven throughout the book, you have to suffer through the author's admonitions about the habits that *he* thinks *you* ought to practice: the usual boring, politically correct, cultural-narrative-approved, scientifically unproven advice like eat more vegetables, cut down on fat consumption, and wear sunscreen just to go outside. What a hack. I see why he's won some \\"journalism\\" awards -- he pushes the cultural narrative of the news media.<br /><br />It made me realize that one habit I could try to break is buying books on Amazon based on other people's reviews.
B006OAB2XO|2.0|This music is somewhere between synthpop and dreampop, a bit of glitchy experimentation in parts but not a lot. Think of really old electronic artists like Jean-Michael Jarre or Kraftwerk, mixed with stuff like Cocteau Twins, maybe a little more ambient in overall execution but still bouncy, and you have a rough idea of what this is. Vocals are breathy and a little spooky, lots of pitch shifting and chipmunk vocals. Overall it's a very cute girly and noirish aesthetic, some say it's hipster, I'd say it's more gothic lolita myself. Gothic because it's a bit dark and moody; lolita because of the breathy chipmunk vocals that make the singer sound like a young girl.<br /><br />A bit of an acquired taste this one. \\"Be A Body\\" is the track I find most memorable. Biggest gripe is that too many of the tracks are quite samey and don't really go anywhere.
B007ZD17XO|3.0|I am enjoying this game a lot. It is alot of fun and it can be a challange. The only complaint is that the directions before each time you start s new grid goes off way to fast. Not enough time to read what you are doing. I hope this can be fixed. It would be better if this was fixed. I will give five star rating when this problem is fixed. I am playing on Kindle Fire.
B0002XNSY0|5.0|A long time ago, nuclear attacks weighed heavily on most American's minds.  Many had bomb shelters stocked with water and food.  Many I'm sure refused to live in or near Washington D.C., thinking that would be target # 1.  There was a moment in history where this country was at the brink of losing it all.  Thank goodness now-a-days this is not the threat it used to be.  Granted, there are now new strains between this country and Russia about nukes, but the hands of the nuclear clock are no where close to where they used to be.<br /><br />This film in a serious and humorous way shows the dangers of nuclear arms, and what happens when we stock pile them.  It shows that safety measures can be circumvented and we all could theoretically be plunged into nuclear winter in no time at all.<br /><br />**Some Spoilers Ahead**<br /><br />The film focuses in on one B-52 airplane, commanded by none other than Slim Pickens himself.  The plane gets orders to bomb Russia from America and to go into radio silence.  Any transmissions sent to the plane are to be regarded as enemy trickery.  Thus the plane goes on a suicide mission into Russia to drop all their nukes on an unsuspecting Russia.<br /><br />The President and his war counsel are soon notified of this horror and learn the plan has been master-minded by a mentally unhinged General.  The General thinks Russia is somehow \\"Corrupting the bodily fluids of America\\" and must be stopped.  He's nuts to say the least.<br /><br />Peter Sellers plays 3 roles in this movie, all funny and different.  He plays the President, a British Soldier over here in America on an exchange program, and Dr. Strangelove himself.  Strangelove is a former Nazi scientist, and sometimes unwillingly hales hitler.  He appears to suffer from \\"alien hand\\" snydrome, an extremely rare condition where a person's hands will act on their own accord, and even attack the owner of them, i.e. your own hand can try to strangle you.  This makes for some hilarious scenes where Strangelove is fighting his own arm and trying to keep it from saluting the Fuhrer.<br /><br />Things escalate and you the viewer are not sure what's going to happen.  To make matters worse, Russia is revealed to have a device that will launch all their nukes if even one is dropped on them.  To make matters EVEN worse, they have fortified their nukes with a new available element, that makes them pack even more boom.  Bottom line if Slim Pickens and his crew succeed in their mission, the world's gonna end.<br /><br />Once the film is over you are left laughing, BUT thinking.  How horrible would this be if if actually happened?  What safety procautions are currently in place to avoid this?  Would our President actually do this?<br /><br />Not many films can make you laugh and think at the same time.  You have to love Kubrick and his films.  I have never seen one yet I've hated.  The man had the unique talent to make each one different.  He literally never repeated himself, and always strived to make his next film not even an echo of his last.<br /><br />A must see for anyone who proclaims themselves a film buff.  You can not be a film expert without seeing this masterpiece.<br /><br />Well...that's my 2 cents worth.  Now if you'll excuse me, my left hand is attacking  me...adlkakj;dlkajd....help!!!where Strangelove is fighting his own arm and trying to keep it from saluting the Fuhrer.<br /><br />Things escalate and you the viewer are not sure what's going to happen.

B007CKNX28|5.0|I knew I kinda liked Jack White, and kept thinking about getting some White Stripes.  My son gave me this album and I am totally loving it!  I usually have to listen to CD's a few times before I start really liking them, even with my very favorite artists, but this one I loved right away first time through!  I'm not even sure what it is, I don't even think this is my type of music, lol.  But it just reached right out and grabbed me!  Very good, from start to finish!  This is one talented guy.
B0034G4P8A|4.0|(Much Overdue Review Of Movie)<br /><br />Well, now that the 'Avengers' has hit theaters and getting rave reviews, I decided it was time to get my 'Thor' review submitted.  FYI, I haven't seen 'Avengers' yet, but WILL be seeing it next week.  So far it's getting AMAZING reviews and I have high hopes for it.  Is it possible the movie studios are not butchering super-hero movies anymore?  Here's hoping...<br /><br />Anywho...I myself watched 'Thor' on the big screen last summer, and rewatched it this last weekend on television.  Call me crazy, but this film almost seems to get better after multiple viewings.  Does the film have it's flaws, YES.  Is it more of a prequel and less of a stand alone movie, ABSOLUTELY.  But despite this it still has some solid action and is quite necessary to watch before viewing the 'Avengers'.<br /><br />**(Warning, Some Spoilers Ahead, In Case You Haven't Seen This Yet...)**<br /><br />--Story/Premise--<br /><br />The film begins with a brief flashback of the Norse God Odin (Anthony Hopkins) coming down to Midgar, aka Earth, and defending it from a Frost Giant invasion.  He loses his right eye during these battles and saves Earth from an induced ice age.  Flashing forward we get to see Thor and Loki as children getting educated by their father in the armery.  We see Thor's hammer Mjolnir sitting there long before Thor begins to wield it.<br /><br />Well...Thor grows up and is about to have the kingship of Asgard transferred to him, when a covert Frost Giant attack occurs.  Odin summons the Destroyer to dispatch the invaders and they are fryed instantly.  It appeared the attackers were after (The Casket Of Ancient Winters.)  (-Source Wikipedia)<br /><br />This angers Thor tremendously and he wants to go confront them in their own realm.  Odin forbids this and leaves Thor, his will clear.  He also reminds Thor he is not king yet.  Long story short, Thor and his companions and Loki travel to Jotunheim and a HUGE battle ensues.  Thor fights, and probably kills, numerous Frost Giants AND some huge Frost Giant monster.  The Asgardians are still outnumbered and would have died, until Odin appears and stops the fight.  But...the damage is done, and Jotunheim says the truce with Asgard has been broken, thus war will be coming.<br /><br />Odin and Thor and his warriors return to Asgard through the Bifrost.  Thor's vanity and immaturity peak here and he insults Odin one too many times.  Odin in anger strips him of his powers, makes him mortal, and enchanted Mjolnir so that only a worthy person can wield it.  He then banishes Thor to Earth.<br /><br />For anyone who watches 'Iron-Man 2' past the end credits, you would have seen Thor's hammer in the ground in New Mexico.  This scene is in this film also.  Also, FYI, there are posts going around that you can see Thor in the 'Incredible Hulk' movie.  I can't confirm this though.  Apparently there is a random bolt of lighting in the background in the movie.  It's at the end where the Hulk and the Abomination are fighting.  Some claim this is the part where Thor is sent to Earth by Odin.  Who knows...pop in your copy and watch for it and you decide.<br /><br />I personally found the banishment portion of the film quite slow and feel it hurt the movie overall.  It does serve a purpose, it humbles Thor and makes him care for Midgar.  Still though, when you pay to see action and you have 20 minutes of no action, you feel cheated.<br /><br />The film does get back on track, Thor proves himself worthy and gets his grove back.  Loki's deceiving is revealed and after a pretty cool fight falls into a wormhole.  Of course he survives and is set up to become the main villain in the 'Avengers'.<br /><br />--After Credits Clip--<br /><br />For those who watch after the credits, there is once again a Sam Jackson clip.  The clip is quite crucial to see.  It contains the Cosmic Cube, the blue cube from 'Captain America', and will be the primary focus in the 'Avengers'.  We also see that Loki is here on Earth now and is manipulating Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard).<br /><br />--Character/Casting Decisions--<br /><br />(Chris Hemsworth as Thor):  Great decision in my opinion.  Hemsworth looks like Thor and really gave this role 100 percent.  I first remember seeing him as Capt. Kirk's dad in the 'Star Trek' revamp.  He's the one who stays with the ship and crashed it into the Romulan ship, saving a lot of federation lives.  I personally think Chris's attempt at a Norse accent is a success.  Not too strong, but dominating when called for.  It is also obvious that he packed on the muscle for the role, and combined with the AMAZING costume, nailed the part.  I have high hopes for his part in the 'Avengers' and believe his character will get a lot of screen time.<br /><br />(Anthony Hopkins as Odin):  Another good decision.  An actor we have all loved for years, I mean who hasn't seen 'Silence of the Lambs' at one time or another.  I was actually surprised he accepted the role.  Hopkins usually sticks with thrillers and horrors or dramas.  A super-hero film seemed out of place for him.  But...I'm glad he did take it.  Hopkins also looks the part.  I am disappointed he did not have his ravens much in the film.  This is a defining feature of this character, not having his ravens was a bad call.  Still, nothing worth rasing too much of a fuss about.  Overall a good performance by Sir Anthony Hopkins.<br /><br />(Tom Hiddleston as Loki):  I was not familier with this actor before seeing Thor, but I'm sure we all will be seeing more of him now.  If I had to rank which actor gave the BEST performance, he would be number 1 in the film.  First of he looks the part.  Second he actually wears his signature helmet with those long horns.  Thor wears his helmet once the entire film!!!  Hiddleston is able to go from one side of the emotional spectrum to other with the snap of a finger.  He gave off a creepy vibe sometimes as well, you really felt like this was someone you couldn't trust.  His whole confliction when he discovers he is a Frost Giant was pulled off fantastic.  You find yourself the viewer feeling for him one minute, and wanting Thor to bash his skull in the next.  I am confidant he will be a GREAT villian in the 'Avengers' and can't wait to see his performance.<br /><br />There are other actors in this film, but I have nor the space nor time to review them all.  I will say I don't believe Rene Russo added much to the movie.  Natalie Portman was OKAY, but not stellar, in my opinion.  Lady Sif and the Warriors Three were overall good, I hope to see more of them someday as well.<br /><br />--Various Home Releases--<br /><br />I personally will be buying the Blu-Ray/DVD combo-pack here soon.  I don't have a Blu-Ray player yet, but I can still watch the DVD.  However when I do finally upgrade, I'll already have the Blu-Ray.  FYI, it appears the Blu-Ray has the most special features and deleted scenes.  DVD's are on their way out, and anymore get only the most basic of special features.<br /><br />There is a 3D Blu-Ray release of this.  I personally don't like 3D movies though.  I already wear eyeglasses, so trying to wear another pair of glasses over them is a mess.  Also, I got a huge headache from watching 'Tron: Legacy' in 3D and swore of 3D movies forever after that experience.  Bottom line, if your a fan of 3D movies, your in luck, they have released this movie in 3D.

B007XKEY6Q|5.0|ive heard a lot about this app and I'm so happy amazon finally got this app! its awesome and fun.I recommend it for everyone
0783226845|5.0|Believe it or not, there are movies that do not have explosions and death in them.  There are movies that rely solely on the acting ability of it's cast.  This is one of those masterpieces.<br /><br />'Scent of a Woman' has been around for some years now, but I bet there are some kids that are now teenagers who have not seen it.  If you are younger and just starting to explore the older films of cinema, PLEASE PLEASE check this one out.  This film is why we go to the movies.<br /><br />**Some Minor Spoilers Ahead**<br /><br />For those who are not familier with this title, 'Scent...' focuses in on Liet. Col. Frank Slade (Retired) from the U.S. Army.  Frank is now blind and lives with his niece and her husband & kids.  He is not happy and spends most of his days drinking 'Jack Daniels' and listening music in the garage apartment he lives in.<br /><br />Enter (Chris O'Donald) aka \\"Charlie Simms\\".  Charlie needs some cash and answers an ad to spend a weekend watching Frank.  Frank's niece and husband are leaving for a much needed vacation and want someone to stay with him.  Charlie after an awkward interview with Frank is given the job by the niece.<br /><br />Well...long story short Charlie witnesses something at his school.  Something the Dean of the school is not happy about at all.  Charlie is bribed into giving a testimony about what he saw, when he returns from school break, in exchange for a free ride into Harvard.  He is unsure about this decision and this weighs on him quite a bit throughout the movie.<br /><br />When he shows up to watch the Colonel, what does he find...Frank is preparing for a trip to New York City, AND Charlie has to go with him.<br /><br />This is where the film really picks up and Pacino becomes quite a charming, entertaining character to watch.  He is quick with snappy lines and seems full of wisdom for the wet behind the ears Charlie.  But there is a darker purpose to this trip, one that will weigh on Charlie even more once he finds it out.<br /><br />Stellar performances by O'Donald and Pacino.  Pacino has the unique ability to make you love or hate Frank in this movie.  You laugh at his jokes one minute, and are practically crying for him the next.<br /><br />Excellant demonstration of how movies don't 200 million dollar special effects budgets to be awe-inspiring, just a well written screenplay and actors fully behind the project.  Also fun fact, Al does not blink the entire movie!!!  How he pulled this off, I have no idea.  But he truly acts like one who has lost their sight, going as far at never focusing his eyes in on anything.<br /><br />The film ends with one of the all-time best speechs ever given by a leading character.  Even better than the speech at the end of '300.'  Yeah, it's that good.<br /><br />Fantastic film, a must watch for every human being, young and old.  Pick it up now and prepare to see what films should always rely on, acting ability.<br /><br />Can't rave enough about this.  If you like this consider 'You Don't Jack', the story of Jack Kevorkian.  Another hands down great performance by Al Pacino.<br /><br />Well, got to go.  WHOOOOAAAHHH!!!out.<br /><br />Stellar performances by O'Donald and Pacino.

B002G1YPH0|4.0|The installation was a bit tricky but it was worth it. My cpu is heavily overclocked and this cooler keeps it cool and happy. Not sure there is anything under $50 that can come close to the Hyper 212+.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|I had very high hopes for this triology.  I thought for sure that it would knock my socks off considering all the craziness surrounding the book and movie and the fact so many people I knew loved it.  Unfortunately I didn't.  My bf and I both read it and we liked the 1st book, but felt it went downhill after that.  We both had different reasons, so I'll just tell you mine.  I didn't like the idea of kids killing kids (just awful), but I thought for sure there was  something to it and there would be some sort of moral story at the end......  I did not expect the killing to go throughout to the end (I could elaborate here, but I don't want to ruin the books for someone else).  Just had really high hopes.  Saw movie #1 and was not impressed.  Ah well, I'm sure I'll love the next series that is all the rage!
B003Z0D4S2|5.0|A little slow to get into, but a must to read.  This book has everything... suspense, romance, mystery and a real love of the characters.  You must read this before seeing the movie.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Colleen Hoover, you officially have yourself one very happy new fan!! OMG this book was freaking AWESOME!!! All I can say is, if you have this in your TBR list, BUMP IT TO THE TOP!!<br /><br />Slammed is such a heartbreaking but beautiful, sweet story, and I just loved every single moment.  Lake and Will meet as Lake's family is moving into their new home in Michigan, and they have that instant chemistry that just takes your breath away.  Will and his brother Caulder live across the street, and Lake can't believe her luck that she's met her dream guy the first day in her new city.  When the bomb is dropped and Will and Lake are forced to stop any relationship they might have had, my heart just shattered!!! I was so upset for both of them, because somehow even in the short time they'd known each other, it was so clearly a fated, destined, meant-to-be love between them. I had butterflies in my stomach every time Will was near Lake, he was just so unbelievably sexy and sweet!!! OH *swoon* I am officially in love with this man, he's just the perfect romance lover in the making!! *sighs*<br /><br />Will and Lake struggle so hard to fight their feelings for each other, and it was just torture that they couldn't be together.  To be constantly near the one you're falling for, seeing every day how amazing he is, and know that it can never be...damn!!  Will handled himself so well despite the wall he had to put up so he could take care of his brother, and Lake...well, she was your typical teenage highschool student bitter over a love that was shot down before it could even take off!! I wanted to slap her on more than one occasion, but honestly it was the perfect reaction for a teenage girl.  She's trying to be adult about it, but her teen angst sometimes just wins out!  My heart was racing as they did their little dance around their predicament, I was so anxious for the obstacles to just go away so they could finally be together.<br /><br />The secondary characters in Slammedwere phenomenal, too. Eddie, Lake's quirky new best friend with no boundaries when it comes to her behavior, was my personal favorite.  She was so supportive of Lake no matter what, and she was an awesome comedic distraction that I loved.  Lake's mom earned a place in my heart as the story went along, too, she was so strong and amazing for her kids through it all.  And of course, I absolutely adored Kel and Caulder as Lake and Will's little brothers! They were so adorable and sweet with their 'long lost brother' relationship.  And they were pretty damned funny, too...backwards day had me LOL!!  I have to say, though, what really sold me about Will was the fact that he was raising his little brother.  I was already falling pretty hard for this guy, but when I found out he took responsibility of his brother I was a total goner!! I mean, OMG could he be any more perfect??!!<br /><br />This story put me through so many emotions.  My heart broke numerous times for Lake and Will, it raced every time their romance ignited, I laughed, I cussed from frustration, and I cried my eyes out at that inevitable moment at the end of the book.  It was beautiful, but it was so very sad that these characters have to go through so much.  I like the way it was tied up neatly for the sequel, I don't think I could have handled a cliffhanger on this one!! Granted, I'm going straight to book 2 now, but still... =)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|If you have read the first two books then you WILL be reading this one.  It sums everything up perfectly.  Don't cheap out and miss the finale.
0345803485|4.0|I really liked Fifty Shades of Grey. If there was some thing I did disliked it would probably be the reference of the twilight books, of its characters and the setting in  Fifty Shades of Grey. I loved all of twilight books, and when I saw E.L James on a interview that she said she got her ideal from Twilight. I guess I wasn't paying enough attention, because she based everyone to everything, to facial features and mannerism down to perfection. I just wish when some one write a book, come up with there own characters and settings and mannerism. I just kept coming back to all things twilight, this book can stand alone with out all the twilight references. Still a good read that kept me reading until I finish the whole book.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This is a  typical romance novel with some added erotica. It is light and fun to read  with a fair amount of humor.
1469984202|5.0|I COULD NOT put this book down and I didn't want it to end. I've read a lot of post-apocolyptic stuff lately and this is by far the best and most entertaining one yet.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|Truly a great game of the genre. Good graphics and story, interesting puzzles that aren't too difficult, and object finding that requires some logic but isn't overwhelming.  just perfect.  keep 'em coming, Alawar!
B0058YPILY|5.0|Service was excellent and I received it very quickly.  I have always enjoyed Criminal Minds and I am sure that this one will be enjoyed as well.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Fun game.  I enjoy these types of games.  It isn't too challenging, yet makes you think also.  Would like it too move quicker though.
0765316994|3.0|For anyone who's ever watched a few episodes of _Star Trek_, the notion of turning the narrative around to tell it from the viewpoint of the doomed Redshirts has obvious comic potential. And this book is fairly funny, with one particular conversation regarding pants being a real stand-out among quite a few chuckle-worthy scenes.<br /><br />That said, the explanation Mr. Scalzi provides for the high mortality rate among the Redshirts on the _Intrepid_ never really worked for me, as it turned the whole book into a writer's reflection on his craft more than anything else. Instead of a goofy romp through space, what we end up with is a pseudo-serious, sometimes preachy take on The Use and Abuse of Minor Characters, which I found to be sort of interesting but not terribly entertaining.<br /><br />All in all, this novel is a diverting way to spend a couple afternoons, but it won't be one I keep on my shelves for another reading at a later date. Most science fiction fans will probably enjoy it, with the exception of those who are really attached to _Star Trek_, as Mr. Scalzi's criticisms of the show are merciless.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|The Forever Girl is an Urban Fantasy with a new look into the world of the supernatural. The portrayal of vampires, shifters, and witches is much more believable, and has hints of mythology. I can't wait to read the next chapter of Sophie and Charles' adventures together.
B006ISJQ3K|4.0|I thought for sure that the alternate version of \\"Love Hangover\\" would be the one that circulated on Disconet DJ pressings back when this album was hot. It had an unexpected, brilliant stripping down to the vocals in the middle of the song--a break of sorts--and then the song built back up, track by track. Note to the producers: why wasn't this rare mix included?<br /><br />Otherwise, great sound. I had forgotten what a great all-around album this was.
0345803485|5.0|I really can't say enough about how interesting this trilogy is.  At first I was really taken aback by the \\"graphic\\" nature of the book.  However, after you get past that, it is incredibly well-written.  The amount of thought and care put into developing these novels is fantastic.  Not usually my type of topic, but I would highly recommend reading all three.
0547569653|4.0|I'd heard of Scott Jurek through the \\"Born to Run\\" book. While I'm not an ultra runner, I dabble in half marathons and am always looking for great inspiration to get me to lace up my shoes. This memoir of Jurek's path from cross-country skier to ultra phenom is more than a dose of inspiration of runners. It's jam-packed with motivation no matter what your goal is. I also like the gentle encouragement to eat more plant-based food. Jurek doesn't hit you over the head with his beliefs. Instead, he encourages you to give it a try and see if you feel better. He says we'll naturally do more of what makes us feel good.<br /><br />Anyone looking to live a more healthy life will find this a great, easy read.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I really loved the book. Well, I should say the book on my Kindle. With the Kindle I can now read longer and faster with the ability of the Kindle to make the print larger. I can't wait to see the movie!!!!
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I was excited to finally have this app available, but after downloading it I am saddened. First it told me to make room for memory. After I did that it stopped opening upm I have uninstalled ans installed again twice already. This app is clearly broken and needs to be fixed.
B0050VFRVG|4.0|This YA fantasy is engaging for its story, characters and creativity, although this reader thinks it owes a bow to the Harry Potter tales because Thief has its own trio, two males and a female, who go on a quest not entirely of their own choosing.  At the story's outset, Percy Jackson, our first person hero, thinks he's just another ADHD and dyslexic chronic failure, a hothead who seems to find and be found by trouble entirely too easily.  He is humorously good at snappy comebacks, sometimes dangerously for himself.  He is at a boarding school, but has lived with his mother and stepfather, a man whom he doesn't like, with all evidence being with good reason.  A weekend at the beach with his mother becomes a turning point, when the weather becomes threatening and they run for a `summer camp' his mother has long known of.  Percy's entry is a mixture of triumph and disaster, and takes him into the camp where he finds out who and what he is after wondering at past hints.  He spends time there, finding out about the other rather special campers and staff, and then is sent on a quest in search of the solution to a festering disagreement that seems headed directly to catastrophe for both mortals and those like Percy.  Without spoiling the details of who and what Percy is, and what his quest is, this reader enjoyed the story's characters, the ties to Greek mythology, the cleverly created bad guys and threatening situations, and the pace and development of it all.  I'm already looking at book two, and will be back.
B007Z9QO2M|4.0|This show has problems but I still believe those can be worked out and this series can be salvaged for a season two.  It would be a shame to lose it entirely.  What is still the chief problem is our too many characters with our too many plot threads.  Some of these must be cut so that the center will hold.  This episode, as usual, showed the characters with future potential and those who should be cut.  Here are the ones who are working:<br /><br />The director is very strong.  He has shown many interesting facets.  He is very talented and knows what is working on a show and what is not.  He also womanizes for the sake of his show, ready to be the new consort to any and every leading lady while at the same time being a tyrant on the set.  This is all fascinating and very believable.  He is my number one choice for what is working.  Angelica Huston comes in next.  She also presents interesting  story lines.  Her wealthy husband has cut off her money so she has to raise show money on her own.  This has led her down the slippery slope of getting financing outside of the normal sources.  She is strong but she is also bull headed which tends to get her into trouble.  My next choice is Tom, the gay musical composer.  He is very talented and very likable but makes a lot of mistakes in relationships.  As for our two Marilyns:  I think they both are made too extreme.  Ivy is the villainess and Karen is too naive for her age.  Both need to lose some of that extremity. It is wearing very thin. Also, is Ivy so dumb that she can't tell Uma Thurman is now her rival instead of Karen?  She is still waging battles with Karen on every front when it is Uma who is killing her in the main battles.<br /><br />As for the ones who are not working: Debra Messing as the lyricist along with her husband and son are just one long soap opera on their love and family lives. This is nothing we have not seen before on tv and it is boring.  So is her affair with her leading man, although I enjoyed his singing when he was playing Joe in the workshop. So keep him for his onstage talent and get rid of the rest. Karen's boyfriend and the reporter who is trying to take her boyfriend away--I hate both of them.  That whole storyline is awful as his political job is of no interest to this show biz drama. If they got run over by a bus in any episode, it would be great news. The scheming production assistant, first for Tom and now Angelica, is just too much.  He is a miserable little no talent schemer.  Leave the scheming to those with some talent.<br /><br />As for Uma Thurman, now cast as Marilyn: I am assuming that this is a brief role which will be abandoned. The reason I am assuming this is that she can't sing and the production is a musical. So if she is in for the short haul, she is fine.  If hers is a long term role, I don't find it believable that she would play the lead in a musical.<br /><br />I'm still enjoying the show.  If these problems are taken care of, I think it might find its adult audience in season two.  This will not attract a kid audience like GLEE does no matter what changes it makes.  Well, short of giving some teen heartthrob a role in this.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B007CGLRWA|5.0|I liked Adrien Brody better in this role than in THE PIANIST, for which he won the Oscar.  That is saying a lot but he sure delivers in this magnificent movie about the experiences of being a teacher.  He teaches in a tough school and the problems at that school don't pull any punches.  These problems are experienced by both the teachers and the students.  This is extremely well written and there is never a moment which lags.  Outside of school he begins taking care of a homeless girl, trying to get her into foster care.  He also cares for his grandfather who is dying in an aging facility.<br /><br />The film also cuts back to the past seamlessly and we learn about his early experiences living with his mother and grandfather before she killed herself.<br /><br />There is an adolescent girl student who is receiving no encouragement at home or elsewhere about her burgeoning art talent.  Brody is one of the few able to offer her some encouragement and solace.  But a woman dating him from the school mistakenly thinks he has other interests in the girl, which ruins things.  This leads to tragic consequences.<br /><br />But this is not a grim film.  Yes, it has some tough moments but overall it is about what a difference a great teacher can make in children's lives.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B007Z9RAI4|5.0|This was fitting for a near to end episode of House.  If anything was going to touch House's heart, it was the prospect of losing Wilson to cancer.  As he sees cancer specialists with Wilson, it fast becomes apparent that they will go it alone together on chemotherapy as Wilson wants the most toxic chemo treatment available.  Fittingly, House decides to hold this at his apartment.  This is so compelling that the remainder of the episode, while interesting, is certainly of lesser interest.  It is about a child with a rare genetic disorder with a doctor mother who has used her as a guinea pig in her experimental drug program, until the child collapses while out with her father. The rest of the team must cope with this as House isn't even taking phone calls as he treats Wilson.

B007IX383I|5.0|The album is just beautiful - in many ways different from previous Anathema albums, but at the same time easily recognizable Anathema style. Every song is great, you listen it and can't get enough.<br /><br />My biggest fear was that the album would be just another Anathema album, i.e. copycat of A Natural Disaster, but Brits delivered one of their best albums - very deep musically and thematically.<br /><br />Must hear for any Anathema fan!<br /><br />Listen this album 20 times and only after that draw conclusion.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|be careful of update , it wipe out your level &amp; DON'T tell you why they needs to update . I have Samsung Galaxy 2.
B0079R8IYW|5.0|I've now tried this and the Amazon Basics case.  I like this one a little bit more, mostly because it's a lot easier to get the Fire in and out of the case.<br /><br />The Amazon Basics case has 4 elastic straps that hold the Fire at the corners and they're a bit tricky to get on.  If you have dexterity issues you'll probably not be able to get the Fire into the Amazon Basics case.  This case just has you slide the Fire right into it and then secure it with a flap.  There are holes in all the right places for your charger, earphones and the Fire's speakers and the cover is held shut with a weak (but sufficient) magnet.<br /><br />I do like the Basic case's stand a little more.  This one is a bit fidgety with a flap instead of notches... it's hard to describe.  Still, it's been working well enough.  It supports two angles -- one at like 60 degrees and one at like 30 degrees.  There are slots in the inside of the case where you could store business cards (or business card sized things).<br /><br />Note that this will only hold the Fire for horizontal viewing, but the Basics case has that limitation too.
B005HP2J66|3.0|Chauvet cave is my favorite of the painted caves, so I was truly looking forward to this film. Unfortunately, there was absolutely nothing in this film I hadn't seen or heard before in terms of the paintings.  The narration didn't go deep enough to be an introduction to painted caves, nor was it scientific enough to satisfy a person with a particular interest in Chauvet.<br /><br />And the musical score...I see in the reviews that many people were enthralled by the score. I found it horribly over-dramatic, discordant, and outdated in style and production, as though composed in the 1980's.
0783229526|5.0|My husband has been a Hunter Thompson fan for years & has read all of the books.  We both think J. Depp is one of the best actors around.  If you haven't seen this movie--maybe rent it.  Buy it if you love it.  We bought it and have watched it at least 10 times over the years.  It's got enough great scenes that if you can't invest the time to watch the whole thing, you can laugh at what you have time for.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|I love the Forerunner 405 CX.  I've had it a little over a year and it has been one of the best presents ever. It has totally changed my trail and road running. I took 15 mins off my 1/2 marathon training with it. It lets you know your current mile pace so you know if you need to push it or slow up. I use it when exploring new trails - when I return, you can view your route in Google Earth and see a profile of the trail.  The best thing is that you don't necessarily have to plan your running route. If you want to run 8 miles, you just start running where the trail leads you and it keeps track of your time, distance, pace, etc. I have not had any issues with the % charge as described in some other posts. I've even used it mowing the lawn to see what distance I walk (about 2.25 miles).<br /><br />Very few downsides, but here they are:  I went on a 12-hour trail run and the battery died about 2 miles from the end so it didn't record my data (but it was very useful before it died). Also, the GPS can be very accurate, but I'm impatient and if I run as soon as it locates satellites, the accuracy of where I start can be off a little bit. I've solved this by turning on the GPS when I start lacing my shoes and stretching or driving to a trailhead. One other thing... recently, the distance (and therefore pace) has not automatically started when the timer was started. Not sure why - could be a user error, but it is usually solved by resetting the timer and going back into the training mode, locating satellites and starting.<br /><br />I would give it 4.5 stars overall. To me, it is evident that the product is very well thought out and beta tested. It can be a great easy to use tool for the casual user but it also has enough features for the intense user. I had to restrain myself from the urge to micro-manage myself in the beginning due to all the data it makes available. I strongly recommend this watch for trail and road runners.

1400049628|3.0|I have mixed feelings about this. On one hand, it's a fascinating and complete primer on how one should behave in a Romeroesque zombie outbreak or apocalypse. On the other, it helps to codify the version of zombies that has already become so common that some people don't realize they don't HAVE to be bite-contagious, cannibalist and headshot-vulnerable.
193355021X|5.0|This book is the most effective short presentation of economics I have found. Hazlett made the lesson very clear. Contrary to some negatives in the reviews, the essential content is fully as meaningful as when it was first written. If you want an update, turn to Thomas Sowell's [[ASIN:B0047T86CO Basic Economics: A Common Sense Guide to the Economy, 4th Edition]]. Both authors present the reality of the mechanics of economics, not the pipe-dreams the politicians would have us believe.
B00006I53S|4.0|Very good lens.  I got this used and shipping was fast.  This lens is sharp and you still can get shallow dof at f3.5.  When I zoom in video mode though the aperture compensates and the overall exposure changes.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I defeated the lord of hell right know but I hate the bowmen they sucked plus the spearmen and the farmer is pretty cool
B00095NX9G|5.0|I've had this DVD for a couple of months now, and I absolutely love it. I'm pretty new to belly dance, I've been taking classes for a few months and did sporadically for a few years before that, but I've never performed or anything like that. There is SO MUCH material on this DVD, it will easily take several more months before I can even use all of it on a regular basis. So far, I've mainly used the yoga parts since I take belly dance classes 3 days a week already. The yoga on this DVD is challenging, but I'm noticing a ton of improvement in my flexibility already. I work out a lot, and I love to do one of Rachel's yoga routines before I go to bed to help keep myself from getting to stiff from the weight machines and body weight strength training I do. It's been a major lifesaver in that regard. I love the drills as well, and I use them religiously when I travel or can't attend my classes for any reason. I haven't gone through the choreography parts yet, but I can tell from watching them that they will be very useful for practice as well. Everything is top notch quality, so much value for the money.
0811870413|5.0|Really, the best bread book I've read in a long time. Well organized, great explanation of breads, and clear directions in the recipes.
0525478817|5.0|As a physician, I am always a little skeptical of books about people struggling with major illness.  I am skeptical because I find most books about illness are about that and nothing more -- the characters never become anything more than their disease.  Which is why I was so pleasantly surprised by this book.  Whenever I recommend this book to friends I try to explain, \\"It's a book about teenagers with cancer, but its not really about the cancer at all.\\"  I think the book is so heartfelt because the character feel like people to me first, and cancer patients distant second.<br /><br />Although the book is technically written for young adults, people of all ages will be able to appreciate John Green's talent for words and wit.  I found the only times that I wanted to put this book down were when I needed to write down a quote here or a passage there that I didn't want to forget.  There are lines in this book that are worth remembering.  Lines that will stick with you.  This is John Green's best work to date and a great read for both young adults and not-so-young-adults alike.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent book.  Full of suspense and action.  Left me wanting more from start to finish.  Have already purchased the final part of the trilogy. :)
B001E45XT4|4.0|I found these to be well worth the money. They're extremely comfortable which is great because with a larger head like mine some of the headsets can be pinching. Despite their size they're rather lightweight. The sound is clear and immersive however I was underimpressed by the bass. I had a pair of Plantronics Audio 355's (http://www.amazon.com/Plantronics-Audio-355-Multimedia-Headset/dp/B001J30FZM/ref=sr_1_11?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1336162885&sr=1-11) that lasted over a year and seemed to have even better base. I plan to buy Plantronics in the future.
B0073J9SGS|4.0|This is near as perfect a match between artist and producer as 2012 has seen. Mark Ronson nudges Rufus Wainwright into Ronson's retro-world just as Rufus writes his most melodic material since his wonderful \\"Want One.\\" The end result, \\"Out Of The Game,\\" is just as it's title states; Rufus has reined in his last couple CD's worth of extravagance into a listenable and highly enjoyable album.<br /><br />He's also as unconventional as ever. \\"Look at you, suckers,\\" he snorts at the newly out character on the title track, with soul-backing singers. It sounds like conventional pop-soul, but that dark streak subverts the meaning. Same with songs that are self referential (\\"Rashida,\\" \\"Barbara\\"), yet the swirling ABBA synths of \\"Montauk\\" change the game completely. Rufus sings to his new daughter about her two dads, in a sly and somber hopeful song about her future, along with a bittersweet, heartfelt verse about his late mother and growing older without her. It's easily the best and most reflective song he's written since \\"Poses,\\" and made me a fan of Rufus once again.<br /><br />I have to admit, his last few albums had left me cold; the redo of Judy Garland, the overt arty \\"All Nights are Days\\" and I was feeling \\"Release The Stars\\" was the artist reaching past his grasp. \\"Out Of The Game\\" proves me wrong. Despite all the diversions - and the way he now draws upon them for this album - Wainwright has kept his touch as a masterful singer-songwriter. That's something I wasn't expecting to say, but I'm more than happy to eat my words this time around.
B004T4LUPW|1.0|It crashes on my Kindle Fire everytime I open it. It had been working great. Now it is a waste of money.
030746363X|5.0|This post was originally written as a response to another review, but since I ended up being so thorough I decided to post it as it's own review, with some modifications, to refute some of the negative claims about this program and clarify some of the confusion that I've seen in others.<br /><br />If you follow this program you *will* lose fat and inches, even if it's not the same percentage that Ferriss lost in a given time frame. Ferriss doesn't claim that everyone will lose 'x' number of pounds of fat in 'x' amount of days by following his program; he says that *he* lost that much weight and therefore, it is possible. What he does claim is that if one follows the program as he describes, 99% of the time there will be a decrease in body fat and/or body measurements as a result. There is no guarantee of time-frame anywhere, and the only mention of time is the '4-hour' inference in the title of the book, which makes complete sense but I'll address that later. I do have to say that I find it alarming that so many of the negative comments here are from people who admittedly have not read or tried the suggestions within this book and dismiss it outright based on preconceptions they feel have been confirmed after reading a few negative reviews. I challenge all of you to start thinking for yourselves and do some legwork! By definition science is a continually shifting discipline, and dietetics is certainly no exception.  I won't ask you to believe me on my word; I'll just provide my own experience and ask that you form your own decisions through research. Enjoy!<br />-<br />This week I started following Ferriss' recommendations to a 'T' as he instructs in the book, and the results I am seeing coincide with Ferriss' claims for weight loss. I assume that most reported failures are a result of not doing this; the \\"Oh, it won't matter if I eat a little bit of bread with lunch!\\" types of failures. My adherence includes consistent 4-hour intervals for meals using only the approved foods, protein-laden early breakfast, legumes and vegetables with every meal, cold compression in the evenings, and 500ml ice water immediately upon waking (I simply couldn't handle the cold showers, however). I'm also taking the recommended dosage of the PAGG stack. Since I am taking the supplements and following the diet, I wanted to experiment by taking exercise out of the picture to scale the effectiveness of the diet/supplements alone. Thus I only perform the recommended `Damage Control' post-meal air-squats and wall-presses, with the occasional light cardio session thrown in out of necessity to walk my dog. I plan on initiating the body-building suggestions in the book once I am nearly done cutting weight, but one thing at a time is good enough for me. :)<br />-<br />My results so far? I started on Monday and upon weighing today (Friday) I was already down 5lbs. I have not measured since the day before starting the program, but I can feel my clothes fitting better than they did on Sunday so I'm confident I will see a decrease in inches when I measure Saturday before the binge. Since I'm sure some of the skeptics will attribute this to the rapid decrease in water weight that many experience after initiating a diet program, I should provide some details. I'm a 29 year old male, 6'1\\", currently 211lbs at 19% body fat. I had already lost 23lbs in the 2 months leading up to beginning the 4HB program by following a strict lower-carb diet, jogging 15-20 miles/week, and spending 3-4 hours/week on resistance training (Bowflex). Even though this amount of exercising was significantly compromising my amount of free time, I had nonetheless hit a 2-week plateau in both weight and inches lost and had become frustrated for lack of results for my effort, as had happened many times before. My discovery of this book could not have come at a better time as my weight loss immediately picked up again after initiating the 4HB program. So, the results clearly speak for themselves for me as they have for Mr. Ferriss and many others.<br />-<br />My personal weight-loss aside, I agree with many of the other posters who have stated that even if you do not achieve the 'advertised' fat loss or muscle gain results, the content of this book is easily worth the low cost for the other tips, data sets, and the enjoyment of reading about what Ferriss is willing to put himself through for the sake of science. To elaborate on the notion of 'advertised weight loss' the fact is that books are products, and like every other product being sold that expects an ROI, they must be marketed intelligently. A great way to do this is through the use of numbers and exploiting recognition in the target audience. Ferriss even admits that originally he wanted to call the book simply 'Becoming Superhuman' but was talked into the 4 Hour Body title for its marketing appeal and similarity to the 4HWW. It's the same reason so many blog posts have headlines like 'The Top 10 Hottest...'. Numbers are attractive because they are easily digestible and infer simplicity. And yes, I work for a marketing firm.<br />-<br />As a great man once said, \\"The world doesn't move to the beat of just one drum; what might be nice for you, may not be good for some.\\" ;) I do appreciate that this program may not work for some for whatever reason, but since none of the recommendations that Ferriss suggests in this book are more dangerous than taking most over-the-counter medications, what's the harm in trying it? One of the most attractive things about this plan for me is that it is easily achievable, staves off hunger between meals with high protein/legume intake, and allows the 'cheat day' to help curb initial cravings for non-dietary foods and prevent your body from entering the dreaded 'starvation mode' (despite the adequate caloric intake) that commonly results in a weight loss plateau. From personal experience earned by failing numerous diet and exercise programs throughout my life, I know how much of a struggle it can be to stick to it. I am experiencing none of that struggle on this program, and though I've only been following the diet for less than a week at this point, it is very similar to the lower-carb diet I had been following for months yet much easier due to the allowance of legumes, cheat day, and the refined structure regarding when to eat and exercise. Before reading this book I did not have this information and was struggling to consistently lose weight as a result. I only regret that I had not found this program earlier, as I would likely be very close to achieving my weight-loss goal of 47lbs by now. It saddens me to think of the other frustrated individuals who came here hoping to benefit from this information as well, but were turned away by the inaccurate and haughty reviews of a few frustrated individuals that make up a very small portion of those who have tried this program.<br />-<br />---- TL;DNR ----[Too Long; Did Not Read]<br />If you are frustrated or feel helpless due to past failures with other diet program, give this one a try, stick to it *faithfully*, and ignore the nay-sayers for now. Have you tried low-carb diets but felt the all-too-common drain of energy as a result? I am just coming off of a 2 month low-carb diet and in my experience, the legumes allowed in this diet reliability satiate and keep energy levels relatively stable. I highly recommend purchasing the book itself because it contains so much information and it's pretty inexpensive for a best-selling hardcover. Additionally, this is certainly not a small book, yet remains very easy to digest due to Tim's intelligent organization of content. I've re-read chapters numerous times and used it as a reference as well, so it's definitely nice to have a copy of the book on-hand while undertaking this program. However, if you're worried about \\"wasting\\" $16 you can simply Google search '4hb slow carb' or any of the items I listed in the second paragraph of this post relating to my 'personal adherence to the program', as those are the cornerstones for Ferriss' suggestions for rapid weight loss. Search for 'PAGG stack' if you're interested in the supplements as well. Since this program has been so successful, there is a large community of advocates so you can easily find most of the information provided by the book in forums and blogs. As you browse these communities you will quickly notice that the success stories greatly outnumber the failures. Of course, in the view of some of the reviewers here, every one of those forum members must have been outsourced from India or know Tim Ferriss on a personal level. I find both of those notions quite hilarious. :)how much of a struggle it can be to stick to it.

0345803485|5.0|Audio version review Only-<br />Ok, so I love audio books, really!<br />I saw a short review and caught some of the buzz about this book so I bought it. After a couple of weeks I finally got around to listening to it. Whoa, I can only do it when I am by myself in the car! Anyway, Anna's \\"inner goddess\\" and must I have a lot in common because I found myself yelling at my car's audio saying things like \\"No, don't sign,\\" or \\"you dummy!\\" I even stopped listening near the end of part one. And after several stops and starts; I finally made it through the book. As audio books go; this one is read with wit and for some reason the voice, Anna's, reminds me of someone from my past, so innocent, so gentle, and so hot! So, even though the reviews seem to be mixed; I enjoyed it (the audio version). And I'm pleased that there will be two more. As long as the reader (voice actor) remains the same; I'm in for the sequels too. And I have found myself looking at the neckties in my closet that I don't wear anymore in a different light lately too.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I may not be the world's greatest artist, but this game is so much fun! I love that you can invite your facebook friends to play also. Looking for something to kill time or just bored?? I HIGHLY recommend it! :)
B0064X7FVE|3.0|This is a good app, unless you want weather 5-20 minutes ago. Its not good at exact weather for your house or area either.
B003Y5HWMW|2.0|The whole series and content is fabulous, no complaints there its a 9.5 star show. But who ever created the Menu for this boxset should be FIRED immediately. Worse navigating menu I have ever come across. Viewer should be able to see whats available on the disc not be told after selection load a different disc.....and the loading times, especially the first disc. Look I dont write this review to put you off, you must get the series as I wrote content is fantastic. Am just writing to make you aware as many others have done to be prepared for difficult navigation through the discs. Being aware is forearmed.<br /><br />PS. Boxset is Region Free.
B0076NAWWA|5.0|I'm usually underwhelmed by all-star albums. But this one is an exception. Somehow, the producers found a group of stars who sound as though they've been playing together for years. There are plenty of fireworks of the kind you might expect from musicians at this level, but there's also a coherent group sound. I find myself listening to it over and over. It works.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|this is one of the best films i have ever seen<br />it makes you laugh it makes you cry well worth getting.
B004UID2LC|4.0|I can download any video as either video or mp3, but it takes forever to view it online before hand. It downloads fairly quickly long as your not downloading many at once. It's a good app, but it could be better.
B004T6IBNY|3.0|I really like this pinball game. I play it on my HTC Vivid. Problem is, it crashes. Not really clear what causes it. Maybe tapping the screen too many times in succession.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Forget about the sub-genre of SciFi -- this is simply a wonderful piece of fiction.  I checked out a sample on my Kindle and bought the Omnibus and First Shift before finishing the sample.<br /><br />The cadence of \\"question/mystery\\" and \\"answer/clarity\\" is absolutely intoxicating.  At times I would get irritated because I needed to turn the page to continue reading; and turning pages slowed me down.  So, if you're getting the Kindle version, reduce your font size to the smallest so you can fit extra words onto each screen.<br /><br />I love character-driven stories, and Wool is a paragon of achievement in that regard.  I shouldn't want to, but I kind of want to live in this book just so I can meet these characters.  The post-apoc backdrop was (in my case) very unexpected and a real delight (I love post-apoc fiction).<br /><br />This is a novel with very convincing characters and compelling scenarios.  There is no futuristic wizardry or other such deus ex machina-type solutions, which scores massive bonus points for me.<br /><br />So, buy this book.  It's astonishingly good, and we need more from this guy!
0802473156|5.0|The Five Love Languages saved our marriage. We were seperated and I had lost all hope that my husband had any clue why I was so unhappy. I bought this version for me and the mens version for him. After he read it, and I read it, and we marked the books up, we exchanged the books and talked about it. Everything changed. I highly recommend this book. I have bought a set for my cousin for his wedding gift, for my son and his wife and for my nephew and his future wife. If every couple that truly loves eachother would just read this book, their relationship would change in a great way. Love it.
1439127700|5.0|Just finished this book, and I highly recommend it to everyone. Whether you are Democrat,Republican, conservative or liberal, it is a revelation of true historical perspective. From Presidents Truman and Hoover, who unoffically created the Former Presidents Club, all Presidents since have been greatly influential in American politics. Fasinating read of how each successive President have supported their successors and also defended  the office itself. Nixon's legacy is greatly enhanced for his insight of American politics and his uncanny ability to understand world politics through the years. This should be on every student's curriculum of American Government studies.

B000JMLFLW|1.0|This is just very boring. Amazon should put more exciting book on the free list, such as, The CHERUB series by Robert Muchamore, Cris Ryan books, and espionge.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|very good game didn't glitch (yet) hope that it doesn't. would make me mad lol. playing. many gameloft games and like them so ya
0061124265|5.0|There were books that I wanted to preach to my friends and to people close to my heart, 'Veronika Decides to Die' was one of them. Coelho had written many books and I had yet to read all of them aside from 'The Alchemist', 'Brida', and 'The Winner Stands Alone'. I found 'The Alchemist' to be one of his greatest classic, the foundation of all his works to follow. 'Veronika Decides to Die' was told in beautifully poetic yet realistic Coelho way. I loved the book because it pondered into the life we all lived in. Had we really lived? Have we actually felt anything while living? Coelho would take you to a journey inside your spirituality, your dream, the norms that we grew accustomed to, the insane, the extraordinary, and the ultimate question,\\" have we really lived?\\"<br /><br />It was a triumphant finish when I put down the book. You will definitely love the book and the journey Coelho will take you to.
B004LZF2LW|5.0|Works as stated by developer. Extra worthless words inserted in this comment to meet the quota that are not worth typing or reading.
B0079M8R6Q|5.0|It is hard to comment on this book as it brings so many feelings out in me.  I was shocked and felt sick that this sort of thing is happening as we speak.  I am hoping that Shin is finding peace at last in his new life. He is a special person. But what of the other thousands like Shin who are still suffering today. We have to do something about this. I feel help less not knowing what to do. What disturbed me is that South Koreans are not concerned about what is happening to their very own people. I will be following other books that come out on North Korea with interest and recommending this book to all of my friends.<br /><br />I think Blaine Harden's handling of the story was well done. I liked the way he incorporated Shin's story with the general history of what was happening in North Korea at the same time.
B003Z0BSUS|5.0|Thank you BBC for making these available - from a prime time in Ella's great<br />career.  Love this!  A \\"must-have\\" for Jazz fans and popular music fans<br />and Ella fans.  It's almost like a miracle that this music has been made<br />available after such a long time.<br />Ah, modern technology.<br />Thanks so much - this is truly wonderful
B001GCUER0|5.0|The series is great.  The characters are totally believable, the direction is flawless, and the story writers do a job that is hard to equal.  The seller is excellent.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Being an avid reader I often just pick stuff randomly based on a mention here or there.  But several folks said \\"Read the Wool series, you have to!\\"  So I did.  Read 1-5, and am working on 6 now.  All I can say is, with no reservations whatsoever, buy them.  Some of the absolute best sci-fi I have ever read.  I will be expanding into other books by the author.
B000IDEQTK|5.0|After reading the reviews, I nearly decided against this movie.  I'm so glad I went ahead and watched it.  I loved the setting, the scenery and the costumes.  The acting was as delightful as the script.  And, it was a sweet story, without being totally sappy.
0345803485|4.0|I was very hesitant to read this book because of the many 1 star reviews and because I was under the mistaken impression that perhaps this was another vampire based novel because the author came out of the twilight based fan fiction.  The genre has been worn a bit thin.  In the first half of the book there is a bit of word repetition but give the female protagonist a bit of a break, she is an \\"innocent\\" and if you can overlook that this book is a pretty decent \\"romantic\\" read take it to the beach enjoy it as a poolside read.  I found the dominant/submissive thing a bit refreshing, the interactions between them aren't a classic romantic story but I liked the character development in both Grey and Ana as the story went along...she wasn't quite the pushover he expected and he is a bit tortured from his upbringing as to be expected.  Yes, there is a bit of the S and M stuff you can skim those sections of the book.  I don't regret reading these and am gleefully reading the second book and look forward to what the future holds for them.
B003F3NDOO|4.0|I love Cougar Town that is why I purchased the 1st & 2nd seasons. Some time had passed before my husband and I had time to sit down and watch.  We were enjoying the 3rd CD of season 1 and it stopped playing (at one of the most exciting parts) it was tiring attempting to fix the problem. With no luck, we finally moved on to the next CD and it was fine. Just diappointed, I should have viewed sooner to ask for a replacement. [[ASIN:B003F3NDOO Cougar Town: The Complete First Season]]
B007TNS6JI|2.0|This game was fun at first.  But very repetitive.  The worlds are so small, there is no exploring.  Just push button until everyone is dead, rinse and repeat.
B0000025D0|5.0|First of all, this is seminal music for me. It came out the year I graduated from high school and followed me through college. So perhaps my bias is built in. But what is amazing is that no matter how much I loved and wore out my vinyl edition then, it speaks more to me now. I even wonder how I connected to it when I was young and full of dreams. The album speaks of lives disappointments, hardships, and most of all, broken dreams. It resonates with me much more now with 30 plus years of life, struggle, and broken dreams behind me. The excellence and brilliance of this album was demonstrated in the movie 'The Promise.' If you liked this album back 30 years ago, pick it up again. I'm sure it will speak to you even more now. If you have not listened to it, but want to hear some Springsteen, I hope you get this and enjoy it as much as I do.

B007BLCGNU|1.0|Plodding plot, if you can call it a plot. Probably the worst make-up I've ever seen in film. Set's dark, gloomy and foreboding(of what I have yet to glean). Dialog of no useful, insightful content. Looks like Clint Eastwood is in need of a visit by Hoover's Doctor. I think he's running low on vitamins, either that or he's just become obtuse.
B003NHRIUW|5.0|I loved this movie!!! I didn't have high hopes for it at first because I'm not a big Miley Cyrus fan, but she won me over with this movie!!! The only reason I wanted to watch this movie was because it's based of a Nicholas Sparks book and I'm a big fan of his work!!!
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I'm living outside the US and my dad bought this kindle for me. It's very useful especially for my studies. but whenever there are times that I'm bored and need to relax from reading, I can't use the games app. >.< It is only for users in America. I am hoping that they can manage to open all the app, available to all countries.
B005UKJX4E|1.0|Worst movie ever. Horrible, had absolutely nothing to offer. I feel like poking my eyes out. I don't understand how people can go on acting like they enjoyed this. I don't even understand how any of these actors decided to take part in this movie. The script was probably no longer than 5 pages.

B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a fun little diversion to keep me from stressing out at my many doctor appointments.  I used to play solitaire sitting at my fathers side as he played the same thing. This brings back those old memories.  Mom in the kitchen baking cookies while dad would basically play both of our games. I frequently pretended to miss a move just to see if he was watching me. He always was.
B00000I41G|5.0|This album is one of guitarist Kenny Burrell's best-known sessions for the Blue Note label. Burrell is matched with tenor saxophonist Stanley Turrentine, bassist Major Holley, drummer Bill English, and Ray Barretto on conga for a blues-oriented date highlighted by \\"Chitlins Con Carne,\\" \\"Midnight Blue,\\" \\"Saturday Night Blues,\\" and the lone standard \\"Gee Baby Ain't I Good to You.\\"<br /><br />I think Kenny is one of the most underrated jazz guitarists in the history of jazz. But over and over again. Just when you thought he has made his best nrecording, he comes up with something better. This is a quintet with a great sound & Stanley Turrentine does some great work on tenor sax on every tune, especially \\"Mule, & \\"Gee Baby, Ain't I good to you.\\"<br /><br />I'd get this  CD if I were you, especially if you've never heard  Kenny before. I guarantee, if you're not a fan now, you will be then. Highly recommended.
0345803485|1.0|I read about half of this book before throwing it in the trash. This book was so poorly written I couldn't stand to waste my time finishing it. How many times does the author need to describe how the main character, Ana, repeatledly blushes and bites her lip in this book? Jeez! The characters basically have no depth, the story is ridiculous, cheesy, unrealistic. I was reading and asking myself \\"why is this stupid girl buying into all of this guys crap?\\"  It was so far fetched and I still puzzled how this book could even be considered for a best seller. Have we lowered our standards this much as readers that we need to resort to reading crap? Save your money and spend it on quality writing.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|This is the most poorly written book I have ever read, so childish, so pathetic. What on earth was this \\"author\\" on????
0307352145|2.0|Susan Cain tellls us that Introverts are undervalued by society. Unfortunately she doesn't tell us in the book why they are undervalued. I believe she has done a dis-service to all introverts. There is a powerful case to be made for her thesis -- unfortunately he doesn't make it. I feel ripped off by Cain and her publisher. I think she just wanted to make a quick buck on a provacative idea she she promises to address but never addresses. Save your money!!
1440503257|3.0|Dinah Bucholz has done an amazing amount of research and experimentation to produce this amusing cookbook, which purports to offer the Harry Potter fan recipes to cook at home the delectable, sometimes fantastic and often traditionally British, treats found in the books by JK Rowling. Bucholz takes pains to emphasize that the cookbook is Unauthorized and in no way connected to Rowling or the official publishers and film makers who produce the Potter franchise. Still, her premise is to relate and then draw upon incidents from the book that revolve around food, and then give instructions for foods that fans can replicate. The question, of course, is what group of fans compose Bucholz's intended audience -- the young reader and fan, his/her parent, or adult fans who continue to adore the characters enough to visit Harry Potter World and cook recipes like these.The level of complexity will divide those fans out.The book does offer a variety, for sure, such as simple bacon and eggs, a fairly easy-looking recipe for Rock Cakes, those infamously hard confections made by Hagrid (though the recipe looks pretty tasty), and numerous sweets that have a simple list of ingredients and instructions. The best choices for young fans, of course, are the simplest -- meringues and those simple sweets. Recipes for things like homemade ice cream and those for entrees like pork loin and Shepherd's Pie, which seem good but complicated to follow, will turn off all but the most rabid fan, however. How much of a fanatical fan would you have to be to want to go to that much trouble for an ice cream cone, just because the ice cream flavor is mentioned in a book? More useful are recipes for traditional English crumpets, the ever-famous Hogwarts Pumpkin Juice, and Cauldron Cakes (actually huge, fluffy pancakes.) Bucholz gives a long list of helpful hints in the front of the book, including suggestions for replacing traditional British ingredients with those more readily found in the US.

B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Grabbed these Blu-Ray discs on pre-sale for a song. So glad that I did too! I've read the entire series through twice, and this show is probably one of the best adaptations of a book series to TV/movie/visual media I have ever experienced. That being said, it's probably not for everyone. My girlfriend and her roommate cannot stand this show, and I don't press it on them. But, if you do enjoy this show, or if you enjoyed the books and have not seen the show yet, do yourself a favor and watch it! The Blu-Ray version has the amazing quality as is expected, which is awesome for this series with the incredible scenery and cinematography. I've only gotten around to watching the actual episodes, and haven't seen much of the extras or commentaries, but I can't remember ever being one who enjoyed extras or commentaries.<br /><br />TL;DR - Excellent show, great product! (see what I did there?)

B004LZF2LW|2.0|Maybe I misread the description, but I was hoping for the option to choose by country and see all of the time zones in the world. This only provides 4 cities so if you don't know if the place you are looking for falls into that time zone it is useless. I have colleagues who travel throughout the world and students that I need to contact and to avoid calling them back in the middle of the night I need to check the time where they are. This app turned out to be useless for me.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I haven't read the book yet but my sister has and she said it was awesome. We went to see the movie and she said it was mostly like the book except some dogs attack Katniss and Peeta and they were supposed to have the other players faces on the but in the movie it was just a normal dog face. My sis says it was an intence book with tons of action, my friends all say the same!
0470932139|5.0|I am completely fascinated by the skills of food photographers, I have been known to contact people with stunning photos and try to glean all I can from them. It has been perplexing to me how one person can take a completely average photo of food, while another person can make that same subject matter strikingly beautiful. Helene Dujardin, owner of the amazing blog, Tartlette, has written Plate to Pixel: Digital Food Photography & Styling, which is filled with examples and information on how to produce high quality food photography. The book itself is beautifully designed, with patterns and colored pages perfectly setting off the photos. It is a book I would even leave out for guests to flip through while waiting for dinner.<br /><br />The author focuses on \\"natural food styling\\" since that is her personal expertise, versus commercial type styling, which use glue, vaseline, etc. The text is written in a down to earth tone and helps make even the technical explanations of camera, lighting and settings easy to read and understand. I loved having the opportunity to learn from such a talented photographer as she shared the lessons she has gained, like the golden hours to photograph outside in natural light or using nuts or fruits as a garnish. Other helpful suggestions are included in Plate to Pixel, like both artificial and natural lighting needing to be diffused and reflected and how \\"goopey\\" foods can be a challenge. She even walks you through correcting and adjusting photos, once you load them onto your computer. I have learned so much from Plate to Pixel and I'm sure I will turn to it again and again for education and enjoyment.

B0006AAS5G|3.0|Invicta makes cheap Rolex knock-offs for those who want the Rolex look but not the Rolex price. Keep in mind a $100 watch will not perform like a $10,000 watch. I've owned several Invictas over the years and they work ok but they are not serious watches. They are good-looking, but that's about it. The 9211 is a knock-off on the Rolex Daytona and looks good, but don't expect to use it to time your next yacht race.

1469984202|5.0|All I can say is, this is the first book I've read that ever prompted me to write a review. To be honest, I was not expecting much from this book, as the past few years in sci-fi literature has been letting me down. But After reading the first chapter, I felt like I was reading one of the classics. My only disappointment - I read the omnibus and first shift way too fast- now I have to wait for the next in the series to come out!

B007HO392S|2.0|I find this album to be Carrie's weakest so far. It tries to bridge too many genres, and be all things to all people...There is modern country, pop, and traditional country. The biggest problem is lack of album cohesion and a narrative. The best song is 'Two Black Cadillacs,' which has spunk and sass. This song is reminiscent of one of Carrie's classics - 'Before He Cheats.' One way I gauge an album, is if it excites me, gives me chills, makes me want to play it over and over. This album just doesn't do any of those for me. It goes to show, that although this album will be a huge commercial success, that doesn't make it good. With the amount of money spent on writers, producers, promo, etc., I expected something much more creative. Sometimes more isn't better, and some albums produced on a shoestring budget are masterpieces.

1934429821|5.0|I did not buy this book here or from any local bookstore, I found it at a very small coffee-stop/misc-books-seller that was marked at an astounding $7.00.  That alone caught my eye but once I opened it I realized I would have paid ANY price.  This is one of the most visually amazing books I own.  I love to open it to a random page and be surprised by whatever I see because I always am.  If you are attracted to the cover and the \\"Look Inside\\" images posted here please get this for yourself, it is one of those pieces that you won't regret owning.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|read the first 4 books, found out the video was available, bought it and loved it. Very close to the book in storyline and drama. Very graphic period violence and sex. Will grab the second season when it comes out. Also I need to read Dances with Dragons, the 5th book. BTW, my wife and 22 year old son watched it with me and we went thru the whole set with rapt attention, all.  SST.

B001CDZZI6|5.0|This revised classic is still as relevant as ever. There aren't major changes to the text itself but you are probably better off getting this later edition than picking up an old used copy and being unable to take the online strength discovery test (more on that below).<br /><br />The author utilized a major study involving over 30 years of research and over 1 million work teams to describe 34 key strengths and offer an online test to discover the taker's top 5 strengths. You can take the test for free with a purchase of a NEW book (don't get a used one if you want to take the test; there is no way to buy a test code short of buying a book). The kindle purchase too will get you a test code within minutes to your Kindle email address.<br /><br />The 34 strengths are somewhat arbitrary but they mostly make sense. Along with the strength descriptions there is a guide on how to work with someone with that particular strength, whether you are a coworker, a supervisor, or just a friend.<br /><br />This is a helpful book but it does not address the possibility that one's weaknesses may be overwhelming the strengths the person has. So you get half of the equation but it is a valuable half nonetheless.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|What can I say about The Hunger Games? It is an amazing story full of action, suspence and emotion. It has all the ingredients necessary for a great novel. Katniss is a remarkable character who is ready to do anything to protect the ones she loves. Once you read The Hunger Games, you cannot stop reading the second book Catching Fire. It is a wonderful story that is worth reading.
B006ZT47O0|5.0|I don't see why a lot of people don't like this album. Granted, I have just started listening to them.<br />I see why people don't think many songs stand out, though. Compared to \\"The Divine Conspiracy\\" and \\"Design Your Universe\\" and \\"Consign to Oblivion\\" there isn't many. \\"Storm the Sorrow\\" is probably my favorite song on here, and then \\"Internal Warefare\\".<br />The one song that I didn't like at all was \\"Stay the Course\\". Not something that found pleasurable to listen to.<br />\\"Avalanche\\" is beautiful. \\"Serenade of Self-Destruction\\" is another masterpiece of Epica's, along with \\"Monopoly On Truth.\\"<br />\\"Deter the Tyrant\\" I really liked this, too. Definitely one of my favorites on the album.<br />All the other songs that I didn't mention, well, they didn't leave an impression on me. Honestly, listen to \\"Serenade of Self-Destruction\\" and you know this is probably a great album.

B00866JL96|2.0|Do you ever wonder about the big questions? God, destiny, the greater meaning of life as a whole or if there is one at all? Clearly Nicholas Sparks does. Whether that makes a good story or not is an entirely different question.<br /><br />  Sergeant Logan Thibault (played by Zac Efron) is on his third tour in Iraq when he and his fellow soldiers engage in a firefight. Logan (Efron) is spared but not everyone is so fortunate. Then, following the firefight, he sees something on the ground and, as he bends down to pick it up, there's an explosion which takes the lives of even more of his compatriots. Still, thanks to the picture, he lived. While travelling in an armored vehicle discussing this, another soldier dies and, again, Logan doesn't. He attributes this to the picture and, more specifically, the woman in it. So, after it becomes clear to Logan and his family that he brought home a good deal more than a photo, he decides it'd be better if he left and sets out, on foot, to find the woman who he considers his guardian angel. With nothing more than the photo and whatever was written on the back, he finds this woman more than one thousand miles away in New Orleans. Her name is Beth Clayton. Beth (played by Taylor Schilling) is divorced, a mother, on sabbatical from her career as an elementary school teacher and running a kennel with her mother Ellie (played by Blythe Danner) who's recently suffered a stroke. Coincidentally, Logan left a dog with his family before going to war and came to Louisiana with said dog in tow. Also coincidentally, Beth (Schilling) is looking for help and offers the job to Logan immediately once she hears he's a former Marine. She regrets that once she hears how he made his way to Louisiana but her mother (Danner) tells him he has the job and after that there was nothing to be done.<br /><br />  Of the seventeen novels written by Nicholas Sparks, this is the seventh to be adapted for the screen, the sixth I've seen, and the only one I've seen in the theater. The worst was, without a doubt, 2010's The Last Song starring Miley Cyrus and Greg Kinnear. The best was The Notebook. As for its predecessors, Message in a Bottle and A Walk to Remember, I'd rank them somewhere in between. Many have commented that Schilling is too old to be playing opposite the former star of the High School Musical series, but as Efron is a mere three years younger than his co-star, I'd say it's the least significant problem in a drama with many, many others. Others include the Homeric trek undertaken by the main character and the inexplicable manner by which he accomplishes what he set out to. Don't waste your time. Don't waste your money. Don't see this movie.in the theater. The worst was, without a doubt, 2010's The Last Song starring Miley Cyrus and Greg Kinnear. The best was The Notebook.

B005LAIH9A|2.0|I normally begin these reviews with a question. My only question for this film, the fourth in the series, why?<br /><br />  All our favorite sex-obsessed high-school students are now 13 years older and experiencing varied levels of disappointment with the current state of their lives. Jim Levenstein (played by Jason Biggs) is married to the same girl he's loved since high school and they have a two-year old son. They are completely out of synch romantically. Jim's (Biggs') sex life revolves around his laptop and Michelle, his wife, (played by Alyson Hannigan) is dependant on mechanical devices. Chris \\"Oz\\" Ostreicher (played by Chris Klein) is a TV sports anchor living with a supermodel. I said he was unhappy with his life, I didn't say I could explain why. Kevin (played by Thomas Ian Nicholas) is a married architect who works from home in addition to running the household. Lastly, Steven Stifler (played by Seann William Scott) is still carrying an attitude big enough to fill most rooms and some buildings despite working as a poorly-paid office temp and living at home with his mother. Even though they missed the ten-year mark by three years, Kevin, Oz, and Jim decide to plan a reunion and \\"forget\\" to invite Stifler. But, somehow, he shows up anyway.<br /><br />  I didn't catch any of the spin-off films, e.g. American Pie presents The Naked Mile, Beta House, or The Book of Love. I did see Band Camp, and will regret it till the day I die. Having seen the original film and both the canonical sequels, I can say unequivocally that there's nothing new here. Embarrassment, obscenity, and nudity from people who really have no business being naked anywhere, let alone onscreen.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Simply put, a beautiful, heartbreaking, hilarious, emotional story. This is by far one of the best books I've read in the past year. I ended up crying myself to sleep over Green's characters, who are so, so real, and who really bring a difficult topic - cancer in children - to life. Hazel and Augustus are both extremely believable characters. Definitely worth a read.

A great time to consider his legacy in this marvellous set.<br /><br />The title words to this review are those Harvey Sachs uses in the liner notes to the original Rubinstein Collection to describe how those of us who were lucky enough to hear Rubinstein play live felt after one of his performances. As Sachs says, those words also describe how one feels after hearing Rubinstein's recording of Chopin's B Minor Sonata.<br /><br />This set is full of such wonderful performances. The recording of the Busoni arrangement of Bach's Chaconne is titanic and must rank among the greatest piano recordings. It exemplifies what Eunice Podis (quoted by Sachs in his excellent biography of Rubinstein) says of Rubinstein's ability to shape very long legato lines, especially in Chopin. Barenboim, also quoted by Sachs refers to something unerring about Rubinstein's healthy musical intellect and Jeremy Siepmann in sleeve notes to the BBC Legends series speaks of his powerful, all embracing sense of rythm, stating that his playing was straightforward, natural simple and healthy. Siepmann also refers to Rubinstein's ability to hear and balance voices in single chords.<br /><br />Then there is Rubinstein's natural and delicate use of rubato and his gloriously beautiful tone. I would add to the learned opinions above that Rubinstein's sheer love of the music he plays shines through time after time.<br /><br />You will hear and be touched by these qualities countless times throughout this set. Listen to the delicate weaving of Chopin's Nocturnes, especially Op. 55, no.2 in the 1967 recording and the powerful sense of structure in his Ballades and the 1959 Scherzos. The recording of the F minor Ballade is another towering performance.<br /><br />The 1932 recording of Tchaikovsky's First Piano Concerto under Barbirolli is out of this world and the Andantino unbearably beautiful. This recording also demonstrates the amazing clarity of even the earliest recordings in this set thanks to the legendary Fred Gaisberg who produced the original recordings and to the painstaking transfers by Ward Marston.<br /><br />Going to the very end of the set, despite some imperfections, Rubinstein's Decca recording of the Brahms D Minor Concerto with the Israel Philharmonic under Mehta is of such intensity and so full of love for the music that for me it is an essential reading of this great work. Rubinstein was 89 with only one more recording session to go and weeks away from his final ever recital at London's Wigmore Hall on 31 May 1976.<br /><br />Unusually for such a prominent musician, Rubinstein recorded a lot a chamber music and there are many beautiful chamber recordings here. No less of an opposite in many ways to Rubinstein than Glenn Gould was quoted in Look magazine in 1971 as saying in an interview with Rubinstein that the Rubinstein/Guarneri Quartet recording of the Brahms Quintet was the greatest chamber music performance with piano he had heard in his life and that the recording had changed his view of what Brahms represented.<br /><br />One of the pleasures of the set is a wonderful photograph of Rubinstein and Gould in the beatifully illustrated and well set out book which accompanies the set.<br /><br />In addition there are lovely reproductions of the original LP sleeves and the CD's (with the original LP length programmes) are illustrated with the original labels and made to look like mini records. The earliest recordings are in covers cleverly representing 78's in plain sleeves showing only the record label. It is all a pleasure to look at and I find the original LP sleeve notes legible despite their reduced size.<br /><br />I am still discovering new beauties in the original Rubinstein Collection after ten years and have returned to favourite recordings dozens of times.<br /><br />Buy this incredible bargain set: 142 CD's (the equivalent of 95 full length CD's) and 2 DVD's forthe price of about 20 CD's. It will reward you with a lifetime of pleasure.
B002L4QP0M|4.0|Really enjoyed this escapist story and recommend it, but the Kindle version is a mess.  There are many typographical errors, quite a few of which interfere with understanding.  A word like \\"learn\\" can be written as \\"barn\\" causing the reader to stop reading to try to figure out what the word is supposed to be as what appears is obviously wrong.  This happens distractingly often and detracted from my enjoyment.  A disservice to an otherwise good story.
B007MU85D0|5.0|The Icelandic music scene is bursting with talent and this band is no exception.  I found the tracks to be an enjoyable experience to listen to.  I hope to hear more from this band.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Amazing book, if you've seen the HBO series your gonna love this book, and if you haven't your gonna love it too.
B004LWZW9C|1.0|I get the irony of using the cliche \\"worst. movie. ever.\\" to describe this cliche ridden pile of trash, so don't point it out.<br /><br />I left the theater smiling, but only because I was so dumbfounded I couldn't help but laugh at how horrible this movie actually is, I just couldn't wrap my head around it.  I can easily imagine it being written on Dec 29th, filmed over the next two days, and shipped to theaters on New Years day, thats how little thought went into this production.  They don't even attempt to hide the cliches used to try and hold this thing together, one character's main dilema is that he isn't prepared for his \\"big company speech,\\" another is a grizzled old man whos dying wish is to see the stupid ball drop for some reason...<br /><br />It may actually be worth the $20, just so you can show it to young aspiring screenwriters and directors and give them hope that no matter how talentless they may be, they might still suceed in hollywood.
159514188X|5.0|With every page turn, I just wanted to keep on reading.  I wanted to find out what had happened and who was next.  I could not put it down.  The suspense made me just want to keep reading... I would have finished it if it wasn't for my husband telling me to go to bed. :D  Overall the book was great.  The story was well written and the flow of the story was great.  I really liked how everything fit perfectly together.  You could understand and feel the emotions that were brought fourth.  Yeah, the topic is something that not everyone is comfortable dealing with or sometimes even want to understand but it happens, and unfortunately, sometimes, it does happen this way. ToT
B007KOMTUI|5.0|Mad Men IS back! So far, the season is great.  I didn't love the first show, but they are all getting better steadily.
B003UMW68Y|5.0|This Combo of Blu-ray and DVD is great.  You have the option of either type of player so you are always prepared for wherever you may want to view this great movie.  I highly recommend this item for diversity and price!
B001MKQS4O|5.0|I never got to see this when it came out originally.  What a fantastic movie!  It is captivating from beginning to end.  I can see why Hoffman got the Oscar, but the other performances are very good too.
B005KQVDH8|5.0|I have had soo much fun enjoying this movie all over again with my daughter. She's four and loves this movie. She's even learned the truffle shuffle!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I am enjoying this game like a kid again. definitely recommend it to anyone who played the original don't cheat and pay just play and wait. makes it all worth it
0439023513|4.0|I've read all these books and the Twilight Series too, many times.  I have to say that I like the Twilight Series better.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|You will be very unlikely to run into anybody this weekend(or the next couple of weeks for that matter)who didn't like \\"The Avengers\\",the superhero movie to end all superhero movies.I would be slow to call it a masterpiece,but it's so likable and action-packed that in my opinion,it comes damn close.Director Joss Whedon lets you know that he was the right one to bring this $220 million superhero powerhouse to the big screen,and his cast dosen't dissapoint either.From my standpoint,Robert Downey,Jr.,Chris Evans,and Mark Ruffalo give the best performances in the film(Downey espicially,since his last outing as Iron Man was so downright full of himself to the point of nauseam).He takes a step back and down from his pedestal to be a team player.Evans as Captain America(who is my all-time #1 superhero)brings us a Steve Rogers who is still out of his own place and time,but always ready to jump into action when the situation and movie calls for it.Ruffalo downplays the scientist with an angry green-man complex role so much that he seems to not be trying all that hard to bring it across(not that he needs to,of course).Chris Hemsworth was actually better in this film as the god of thunder Thor,than he was in his own film last year.Renner,Johanssen,Jackson,Gregg,and last but not least Hiddleston as the uber-baddie god of mischief Loki are all excellent in their own scenes (with or without the avengers).Bottom Line-GO SEE THIS MOVIE AND ENJOY EVERY SINGLE MOMENT OF IT!!!.
0439023491|4.0|Good book, but, I liked the Twilight Saga a whole lot better. I've read both series of books, many times, and I still like the Twilight series best.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|totally awesome game that's addicting ii ilove it&iexcl;&iexcl;!!!!!&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!&iexcl;!&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!!its the best game ever i ncantation stop playing it its so cool and its sweet.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This was, without a shadow of a doubt, the GREATEST Superhero/Comic Book movie of all time!!! It's as if God himself walked into a theater and said \\"Let there be EPICNESS!\\" and we were blessed with The Avengers. Not to take anything away from The Dark Knight(which is an amazing movie period), but The Avengers is just the total package for comic book movies. Joss Whedon deserves so much credit for being able to craft a story where all the characters have enough screen time to not feel overshadowed by any of their co-stars. The movie flows surprisingly fast with a run time of over 2 1/2 hours. The final hour of the movie is where the characters truly shine. Speaking of the characters, they are all excellent, but there is one who truly stands out among the cast, and that is Mark Ruffalo's take on Dr. Bruce Banner/The Hulk. Joss Whedon managed to do in this film what some have tried to do for years, he perfected The Hulk. I am a fan of the Edward Norton Hulk movie, but he always kind of felt out of place being in a comic book movie. Mark Ruffalo brings much needed depth, charisma, and charm to the character of Dr. Banner and \\"The Other Guy\\" as he calls his alter ego through out the film. The Hulk in general steals the show, which is a great feat, considering we only see him twice in the movie. Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man is again on his A game. Stark is still a quick-witted, ego maniacial, self obessesed, genius, billionaire, who also grows up and learns what it truly means to be part of a team. Plus you can't help but still love the guy. Thor is still awesome as the God of Thunder, who does some serious damage in the final battle. Hawkeye finally gets to show off his skill set as a master archer. Black Widow just solidifies her position as being the only girl who can truly hang with the big boys. Captain America is like the breath of fresh air in the group. As a \\"fish out of water\\" in the modern world, he has a lot of funny moments with how out of touch heis with how the world is today. Nick Fury is still just as cool, calm, and collected as ever thanks to the performance of the always amazing baddest m.f. Sammy L. The movie is also very funny, mostly with The Hulk. Loki was the right choice to be the villain to unite Earth's Mightest Heroes to Avenge the Earth for all humanity. Just curious if anyone else went to the midnight show and if the crowd went dressed up and was reacting to the movie in such a way that it made an epic movie more of an event like it happened when I saw it? I need to see this movie at least 3 more times in theaters and this will be a definite pre-order on Amazon. My only complaint is that the movie had to end haha. In closing, see the movie a bunch of times, buy the Blu-Ray (which Whedon promises will have 30 minutes of extra footage added in), and make sure you sit tight during the credits as there is also a mid credits scene that will have every Marvel fanboy geek out and salavate at the prospect of what is to come next for The Avengers! EXCELSIOR!!!!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this app on the IPod and I love it on my kindle. It is really fun. It is about time that they had something from the Apple products on a kindle.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|just like Mario and easy to learn... you can get up to three hitpoints and can shoot pinefones at enemies as well. too cute.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is so fun. Its really addicting and I haven't a single problem yet. Yeah, the whole money type thing. is expensive, I work around it!
B000SFJWLU|5.0|I love Five Finger Death Punch. It is great music to listen to when you're lifting weights! I haven't been let down with any of their CD's. If you like heavy music, you can't go wrong with 5FDP!
B003OF3R0S|4.0|Nightmare is the first song on the disc and it is awesome. I bought the CD after hearing Nightmare on the radio. The second song is pretty good. Then the rest suck. A person might be better off buying a single song.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|one moment I'll have full energy and another evrry thing is gone even when i dont spend my energy. it hangs a lot on my kindle fire. please fix these defects.
B007T2XC7A|3.0|I've been listening to Norah Jones since 'Come Away with Me' and really liked every album until 'The Fall'. I bought it but couldn't listen to it. I just did not like the sound. I heard the sample of 'Happy Pills' a few months ago and thought it was awesome. It had a more evolved sound and the lyrics were great. Then when the album came out I listened to all the songs and felt despair. The songs are spectacular but why does it sound like Norah was locked in a metal cabinet wearing an oversized dental retainer while singing all of them? It's an original sound for one or two songs but doing it to the whole album makes for an overall dull record.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app. is a joy in so many ways. From the various translations to the wonderful daily features that make gods word available on a regular basis to those on the go. This app. allows you to share gods word with family and friends through email or post to facebook and is always as close at hand as your android or smart device. I suggest you pick up this app. for its obvious benefits and there is surely no denying the fact that the price is RIGHT!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|No offense to fans but i'm honestly a little nauseous. I'm not so sure I can even finish this book. I really had no idea what it was about, I just heard that it was a good read! I'm really not a prude and I enjoy a romance/fantasy story as much as anyone, my issue is mainly with the dominance/control themes. *SPOILER* I also find it hard to belive that a girl that has just lost her virginity wants to start an s&m relationship with some guy she just met no matter how hot he is. just my personal opinion. I'm willing to admit that i'm judging without having finished the book, but soo far i'm not into it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This app is awesome. It is like mario, but it is better because you can shoot acorns ir something and it is a leprecaun instead of a plumber.
0345803507|5.0|I have never attempted to read a book, too busy & not very good at interpretating written scenes. However, for some unknown reason I started to read this book. I finished the series in 8 days. Very well written, it was as if I was watching a movie. I have recommended this book to everyone I know. Some people may have to look past the sex scenes (which by the way are more than I ever imagined & well enjoyed). What a wonderful book knowing that it is possible to find love. I would love this this to be a TV Series so much more could have been added. I am afraid it is does become a movie there will be so much missed. Thank you Ms. James for stirring my creativity. LOVED IT & SO HOT!!!!!!!!!!!
B006OAC1T8|4.0|The story continues & even though I struggled with the large cast of characters in the first book it's not an issue anymore. George Martin does a very good job showing how much kings care for ambition & the throne at the expense of the lives of their subjects. Some things don't change.<br />Often writers suffer a slump with the second book in the series, not so in this case. Martin solidifies the story & really hits his stride with this book.<br />Unfortunately the ending doesn't tie up all the loose ends nicely so if you enjoyed this you will be compelled to continue by reading \\"A Storm of Swords\\".
B006WXW098|5.0|I was lead to the music Juja Wang via another prodigy I've been following, Umi Garrett. In one of her YouTube videos she was all aflutter about an upcoming visit with her pianistic idol, Miss Wang. Since then I have paid careful attention to this young lady and now possess her DGG catalog. Her latest offering \\"Fantasia\\" has captured this old sod and my house is filled with her music. In the program notes Yuja mentions that her \\"first encounter with classical music as a child\\" was via the Disney film by the same name, and her rendition of \\"L'Apprenti sorcier\\" is magical, taking me back nearly sixty years to my viewing of it. It alone is worth the price of admission.  Thank you, Yuja.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Loved this book full of love and crazy college drama! What a page turner... just could not put it down. Finished reading it in 2 days!
B007ZYJT1U|5.0|Excellent performances and story. Realistic and believable, this shows sometimes you have to play with the cards life dealt you. A must see.
B005HSG3VK|1.0|First, I really dislike leaving a negative review.<br />As a matter of fact, I have never left a negative review.<br /><br />I didn't need this type of cover for my new Kindle Fire, but I had no thoughts that it would be other than as stated.<br />But I did need a cover.<br />And this cover did sound like a good idea and a useful product.<br /><br />Pros:<br />The cover is sturdy.<br />The pink color is quite pretty.<br />The elastic holds the cover closed very nicely.<br />The Kindle is held firmly inside the cover with no chance (in my opinion) of coming loose.<br />The inside of the front cover is soft and will not scratch the screen.<br />The on/off switch, power light and earphone plug are all accessible with the cover closed.<br />The pink back is solid and firm and while the front is thinner it also seems protective.<br />The price is good.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The indentition on the hard, pink back is very, very shallow, measuring just 1/32\\" deep.<br />This barely holds the the insert from the other cover.<br />And when it does hold, pressing on the screen almost always causes the easel to collapse.<br />Constact collapsing is very annoying.<br />If it were near the edge of a surface, it could fall and break.<br />It is heavier than the cover for my Kindle Keyboard but because it is made from hard material I would only give that a 1/2 demerit.<br /><br />This is being returned and replaced with a cover without a stand.<br />I can live with that!
B0059XTUVI|3.0|I watched Iron Lady more because because I enjoy watching Meryl Streep than because I had an overwhelming urge to watch a movie about Margaret Thatcher, but somehow anything that Ms. Streep does usually perks my interest.  Once again, she totally embodies the character and you really believe her in the role.  My issue was that I didn't feel it was a very fleshed-out portrayal of Thatcher.<br /><br />The movie is set up as flashbacks.  She is now an old woman, who has lost her husband and seems to suffer from some kind of dementia.  You see flashbacks of her as a young woman, a mother of twins and in her role as Englands first and only Prime Minister.  The movie just didn't really delve very deep and it was very sad to watch her as an old woman, just a shadow of the strong \\"iron\\" woman she once was.  What I felt was the best part of the movie was the overwhelming love that she and her husband shared and through her time as the prime minister she could come across tough as nails and then sit at a desk writing personal letters to families that had lost loved ones in the Falklands, showing her vulnerable and maternal side.<br /><br />I didn't love it or hate it.  She did a fantastic job but I would have liked to have learned more about her from a younger age through her time as Prime Minister. A fuller story line was really what Streep deserved for her stellar performance.<br /><br />So, for fans of Streep, you might want to check out her Oscar winning performance, but for those looking for a great movie about Thatcher, you can probably take a pass.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|They redid the Hulk, Batman and a whole host of other bad movie ideas... how about redoing these god awful prequels.  Lucas just lost touch with struggle and challenges of life by living in his secluded fortress in Marin.  Oh how I wish he would have left the prequels to the expanded Star Wars Universe creators or that he watched his films with a few fans and had an idea session before destroy the Star Wars world.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Have really enjoyed the game. I did have a couple of buildings and 2 animals get stuck in the &quot;Ready &quot; mode for a couple of days but they all came back to life.
0790742780|5.0|This movie is simply an outstanding movie, a man just trying to see his little girl on her birthday after a harsh and bitter separation from his wife, he goes through alot of real life drama and I  feel the way that he feels about life in general and the way society really is, in this tough world we are living in. He showed remarkable courage against every obstycle that he had to endure. The end made me have tears in my eyes,it was just too sad how it ended, but it's a great movie that everyone should see!
B005LAIGF0|5.0|I was fortunate enough to see this film recently at the West End Cinema in DC. Having read some of the mixed reviews, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. I found myself pleasantly taken with the movie. Yes, there are one or two digressions that could have been better integrated with the story (or, possibly, cut). Yes, the climactic scene could've stood some tweaks. And yes, between this and You Can Count on Me[[ASIN:B00003CXQ4 You Can Count on Me]], I do prefer the latter. But this was still one of the best films I've seen in years! It is a mature work, and honest, and considered. The emotions and psychologies of the characters feel real and authentic. If you're looking for a light, generic popcorn movie, this film is not for you. But if you appreciate true to life drama with weightier themes that will challenge your preconceptions and stimulate your higher cognitive functions, Margaret is definitely worth watching.<br /><br />An early scene, of the story's tragic inciting incident, was so brutal, so powerful, and so upsetting that I almost had to leave the theater. The main character's involvement in this scene means that she is forever changed, and it's to be expected that she will begin to &#34;act out&#34; as she struggles to recalibrate her life in tragedy's wake. You might not like, or agree with, everything she does, but she is fascinating to watch. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone sums it up best: &#34;Margaret, for all its flaws, is a film of rare beauty and shocking gravity.&#34;<br /><br />As a product note, the disc release includes both the theatrical version (on Blu-ray) and an extended cut (on DVD). From what I've read, it sounded like the director was pressured to cut the film down to less than 2 and a half hours for the theatrical release, so it will be particularly interesting to watch the extended version. Perhaps some of the film's loose threads will prove to be more interwoven after all.
B00008G8M4|5.0|Will Smith out did himself in this movie. He was great and the movie kept you on the edge of your seat. I liked the beginning when Will Smith knocked the alian out cold, that was funny.Then the suspence came all through the movie with the alians attacking the earth. Great movie! Great plot! I liked it lots!
0307949508|5.0|This book was amazing, just like the first, but something, just something makes it not quite as good as the first book of the series.  If you are debating reading them.... do it.  They are completely different than any other books you've read, and wonderful too.
B00003CXRM|4.0|This was a used movie and It was in real good shape. Good movie and love the main song . enjoyable!!!!!
B001F7MSG6|3.0|Film is fine. Disappointed with purchase. Was supposed to come with downloadable digital copy, and when I tried to get it, I was alerted that it was no longer a valid offer.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love Lep's World. It is a great game. I love to collect coins and four leaf clovers. Fun times!
B0055SWM08|5.0|just an amazing and also a bit relaxing and sometimes frusterating but definetly a fun game.<br />a great game for knowlege too. all i van sat is its fun.
B007R41E8O|5.0|if you love hidden object games you will love this one! Hours of play time and great graphics. Definitely worth the money,  hope they have more games like this!
B006VFLIYK|3.0|This is  his least interesting book. I have read them all and this book did not even seem like his work. If you have not read his other books start with them you  will love them. Read this one last. If you read it first you may not read his work again and that would be a loss on your end.
0670023329|5.0|I'm ashamed to admit, I've had no real knowledge or interest in North Korea.  I basically knew one of the Koreas were the 'good guys' and one was the 'bad guy.'  Sad...I know.  After reading Escape from Camp 14, my understanding of this area has been transformed.  The author does a wonderful job in bringing (pitiful) people like me up to speed on the history of North Korea especially.  He does so in an intriguing way by interspersing information while telling the heartbreaking and heroic true tale of Shin, the escapee.  I began the book yesterday afternoon and finished it this morning.  I couldn't get enough.  The heartbreaking story of this young man, with all the odds stacked against him is riveting, because it's true.  This is a story that needs to be heard around the world...of the atrocities still occurring within the camps in N. Korea.  My heart went out to Shin throughout the book.  I found myself praying for him, rooting him on, as I read.  Shin, if you are reading this...I'll keep praying for you as you come to my mind.  To the author, Mr. Harden, thank you for telling a story that we all need to hear.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I like creating the families. I don't like the push for outside connections, but it isn't a big deal. Getting out of the program was easy once you select options.
B006OFN0SE|5.0|This is why Leonardo DiCaprio is probably the finest actor in the last decade, his acting has become a level of perfection that few ever achieve.<br /><br />The life of J Edgar Hoover portrayed by by DiCaprio is magnificent, he is perfectly suited for this role as he was in the Aviator portraying the unbalanced Howard Hughes. I've seen him grow from Whats Eating Gilbert Grape to the basketball diaries, then to roles such as Marvins room into epics such as the Titanic and titles like Gangs of New york and shutter Island. He never ceases to amaze me in every single performance including this absolutely magnificent role of one of Americas most controversial figures. If anyone but DiCaprio was cast for this I really don't know how I would feel about the film but I will say that it was an intriguing movie that opened my eyes to a man I knew little about.<br /><br />First I'm going to point out that this is a film on the life of a man shrouded with conspiracy and deceit. This film is not an exciting thrill ride but rather an in depth look at a dangerous man with secrets enough to secure a lifetime in an office he built. DiCaprio portrays Hoover as he did Hughes, with a complete immersion in the role itself. In short he makes this movie magnificent. I don't know how he does it but if it was anyone but DiCaprio I may have hated the film but I really don't know because I loved all the cloak and dagger political intrigue hoover seemed to be a master at. I've never seen a film put together like this which keeps my belief that both DiCaprio and Eastwood are masters at their crafts<br /><br />I have read the reviews and I really had to make the choice. Do I ignore a film with this duo? or Do I take the plunge as I did Aviator, Shutter Island, and Inception? I take the plunge and it pays off big, I will add this to my collection. This is a very complicated film to review because so many people are rating it horribly but you have to understand that it is a political cloak and dagger movie. I LOVE cloak and dagger movies and I have always been intrigued in how the F.B.I came to be and how it exercised so much influence. Now I have my answer, It was J Edgar Hoover and he was the keeper of some of the darkest secrets in Americas history..<br /><br />Go into this one expecting it to be a slow grind, a grind of character building coupled with some very sinister twists and turns. This man could walk into the office of some of the most powerful men in our governments history and exercise complete control of events in his favor. It was so interesting that I really didn't mind that it was a slow grind but If you need constant action and cannot sit through a slow movie then you should avoid this movie like the plague. I've seen all of DiCaprio's and Eastwood's works both on and behind the camera. I will tell you it is nothing short of a great movie experience, especially if you ever wanted to know the true inner workings of the F.B.I 's gritty past from humble beginnings to complete power and control. All in the span of hoovers reign of an unprecedented 48 years causing them to limit the term of service to ten years unless higher authority approves it. This should tell you that you are in for some real incite into this mans life and I have really learned much from this film. I will confess that I didn't know much but this has given me incite to expand my knowledge base on the life of Hoover<br /><br />The way the film is built is also very well done. Many people are saying that DiCaprio is ill fit to play this role as a young man but the thing is it is a flashback story set in the form of hoover explaining his life thus jumping from present to past. That being said He was perfect for the role as he played a young man as much as he did an elderly man. DiCaprio excels at these roles as he is able to transition perfectly into a very paranoid ocd type character. He played an elderly man quite well I should add and this film has shown me just the depth that DiCaprio can go in his versatility as an actor. His performance is nothing short of amazing otherwise I wouldn't be able to even attempt a review on this film.<br /><br />If you are a DiCaprio fan then this is something that you should see and as a Clint Eastwood fan you should see this as well if only to see how far he can really go into his talent behind the camera. Be warned that I did say it was slow so if you hate political intrigue and cannot stand slow character and story development then you should stay away from this title as you will probably be very disappointed (Hence the really bad reviews). If you have an open mind and a depth to your movie interests then I suggest at least renting it before completely dismissing it per the majority of the reviews.<br /><br />Well done, as good as it gets for both respected stars<br /><br />Thanks for reading, I hope you enjoy the filmt DiCaprio can go in his versatility as an actor. His performance is nothing short of amazing otherwise I wouldn't be able to even attempt a review on this film.<br /><br />If you are a DiCaprio fan then this is something that you should see and as a Clint Eastwood fan you should see this as well if only to see how far he can really go into his talent behind the camera.

B001N1DPDE|2.0|The knife was already scratched up. It looks used and scratched. Good thick knife, but the black coating was ruined already. I ended up reselling as a \\"used\\" knife on Craigslist to try to get some of my money back. I liked the knife, heavy, thick, felt strong, but I would recommend buying at local store instead or ordering online.

B000QXDED6|5.0|I love the way color is used in the film.  That and the fantastic combat sequences make this an exciting action film to watch.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|A friend of mine wrote a review on this series and when I went to read her comments I noticed many did not finish the first book. That is such a big loss, this series is sooooooooooooo good. I am not going into what this book is about, since it has been all over the TV, I am sure you already know. I am writing this review to encourage any reader who bought 50 Shades of Grey, and does not care for it, to please just keep reading. I am not into BSMD reading and I don't read erotica. I am a Danielle Steel, Nora Roberts, Robyn Carr, Diana Palmer, Sherryl Woods, kind of reader. I had a hard time reading book one.<br />This book was recommended to me by my step daughter, and as far as I know, doesn't read erotica either. She said she heard about this trilogy on all the talk shows & it was even on the news. So I bought the first book and started reading.<br />I, like many of you, did not like the first book. I didn't like Christain and I was not into all the erotica. There was a group of us on Facebook talking about 50 Shades of Grey, I was telling everyone, I would not be buying the next two books, and may not make it through the first book. I kept reading and made it through to the end. I decided I had had enough.<br />In about 24 hours, I couldn't stop thinking about the ending of the first book. I really wanted to know what happened next. I started to feel sorry for Christain, he had such a dark past, and you are already in love with Ana. I couldn't stop thinking about what happened and I gave in and downloaded book two.<br />I fell in love with book two and was crying at the end of book three. What a terrific love story that turned into one terrific read. A little mystery and a lot of love. Yes, the sex continues but it becomes less intense and is a real part of the story.<br />This series will stick with you long after you are done reading it, it is a wonderful love story. It has been over a week since I finished this trilogy and I can't stop thinking about it. I started my next book and I am having a though time trying to get into the story.<br />Please do oyourself a favor, if you have bought the first book, keep reading, the next two books make it so worth it. I am a senior citizen, retired, and reading is very much part of my life. I have been a reader since I was a child, over the years, I have read many classics that I have read again many times. I have to tell you, I bet I will read this series again. I have put this author, E.L. James, on my favorite author list and look forward to her next book.rted my next book and I am having a though time trying to get into the story.<br />Please do oyourself a favor, if you have bought the first book, keep reading, the next two books make it so worth it.

1451627289|4.0|I haven't read Steven King since \\"The Tommyknockers\\" which I just gave up on and gave it away. I couldn't take the book whore he had become after being so enamored of his writing during the early Stand/Shining period. But I recommended this book to my sister, she read it electronically, and I kept it for a vacation in Hawaii as my recreational reading. To say that enjoyed it would be an understatement. The thread into the past, the interplay with the very ill Al, and the observations of the somewhat milquetoast Jake Epping are seamlessly crafted. The emergence of Jake into George Amberson, using the ability to do move within phony ID's and without a past due to the lack of an Internet is an interesting component to the story. Everything from paying a couple of hundred bucks for \\"classic\\" cars, to a few dollars a night for a hotel never seems to get stale. The relationship Jake/George has with the characters of the past is interesting, fresh, and continues to evolve decently. The book's relationship with history is no more, or no less, than the multitude of LHO/Kennedy assassination works available, and shows Oswald to be the petty little man he was consistently portrayed as.<br />But as you will read, you will want to know what happens on Jake's return, and this is where the last star is not earned. King wraps the book up, loops around to the old Jake meeting with the old characters decades later, and that is sweet and somewhat satisfying. But the destruction of the country because of the events Jake and Al set into motion is treated superficially and that leaves you with the feeling of being cheated in a 900 page book. King could have done better with that specific aspect of the book.<br />But the total is a nice, satisfying, entertaining read, without delving into Sci-fi detail, and anyone who enjoys his work normally will love it, and those that lost faith in King because of his book mill period, will welcome his indisputable talent back.<br />Recommended.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|I simply love the size of these decals they are large and look wonderful. The colors are bright and each of the princesses are paired with an item that goes along with their story (fairy tale) ----> Great product :)
B007UXSDYU|1.0|I can't really thing of any aspect of this movie that is worthy of positive note.  I love the end of the world kind of movies, and since Michael Biehn (sp?) is in this movie I thought it might be fun to watch ... I actually rented it online.  What a dog of a movie.  If you want to see something with the idea of this movie, watch \\"Lord Of The Flies\\" because that is all that happens here, the people in the movie degenerate into rapists, murderers, insanity - not to mention stupid.  This is already many multiples more words than this piece of garbage deserves .... 1/5 - AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE.

B000L3CHC0|5.0|I bought this for my stepson as a 18th birthday present. He loves it and it looks really good on him. The pictures do not do the watch justice. It's stylish enough to be worn if he dresses up, but is rugged enough that he uses it around the farm at his dad's house. After a month of constant wear it still looks brand new on him.
0062060554|2.0|The storyline was very promising, however the way the story was executed was so dragging, i was on 3/4ths of the book and the story is still going nowhere. The story picked up only on the last chapter. On the bright side, it was an easy and quick read so you won't have to endure the snooze fest for long.

B007Z9RAX4|3.0|This movie was definitely mediocre at best. It's really a shame, because it's possible Miss Carano won't get more opportunities like this one, and I think she should. I seriously wouldn't place the blame on Gina Carano for the fact that this movie doesn't really work. As surprising as it might sound, considering the caliber of the other actors and the director's credentials, she's really the only thing that makes this movie worth watching.<br /><br />Certainly her acting wasn't very good, but this is her first big-budget leading role, and she's aspiring to be an action star, not an Oscar- or Tony-winning Shakespearean actress. I think she was really let down in terms of her acting by the direction and writing in this movie, and that's really where the problem was overall. The director's style just didn't work in this context. He created a very odd mix between the story scenes and the action and chase scenes that felt uneven and jarring throughout, and not in a positive way. I didn't mind the tendency towards visual exposition, but mixing that with deadpan action movie one-liners and some stark and unemotional violence just made it seem like Gina was a worse actress than she really was. The writing was genuinely cringe-worthy in certain parts...There was really nothing any of the actors could have done with some of those lines.<br /><br />The fight scenes in the movie didn't really work because the choreography and timing (editing) was poor...I'm not sure if Gina choreographed her own fights or if someone else did who was completely in awe of her real-life skills, but it just didn't translate well to the big screen. Combining that with the director's decision to try and create a more visceral feel by removing any music and just displaying the fights exactly as they were, and you end up with all the fight scenes looking odd at best, and downright fake at worst. Sometimes you have to do things a bit less realistically on film to make it look real, if that makes sense.It's pretty much impossible for a magician to pull off a trick if the camera is trained on his hands the whole time. I guess I can understand that the director wanted to put her real-life skills on display...but I think the movie, and Gina Carano, would have been much better served with some really solid movie fight choreography. She has the presence and look of someone who can kick your ass, and it would sell good movie fight scenes without any trouble at all.<br /><br />I sincerely hope she's given more opportunities as the lead in movies. She definitely has an unapologetic power and can be quite intimidating, and I think that's far too rare in female movie stars. She's a very welcome breath of fresh air from the sickly waifs that we are normally expected to take seriously when they are throwing people around or punching out 250-pound men. She undeniably hot, and at the same time it's easy to take her seriously. I'll go see any movie in which she stars, simply because I really would like to see more leading women like her in action movies. She's just all-around awesome. I have no doubt she'll develop enough acting chops to make legitimately great action movies, if she can work with directors and writers that don't drop the ball like they did with this movie.

0345803485|1.0|Honestly, there are very good, accurate 1 star reviews already published, I'm just trying to \\"up\\" the numbers. Think of it as a public service! But here is my brief take on the book. Don't bother. You want erotica? There is far better out there to read and enjoy. Romance? Please. Barbara Cartland is better then this nonsense. Oh, and my theory is that the author is a man...or a very precocious 14 year old.
B004PGNB1K|5.0|I came to know this work in february, I got the first book in april, I finished the second book in may the 4th. Enough said. Looking forward for the conclusion
B004SYP5WC|4.0|I really enjoyed this application because it kept me from overdrafts from my bank and kept my checkbook balanced! I was able to keep more time with my family instead of balancing my checkbook. I trust it!
B0048LPRCS|5.0|I was pretty reluctant to watch the film, due to the fact that I had heard it contained flashing lights and a first person view. But, once I finally put it on.. within 12 minutes I was hooked.<br /><br />The story is basically of a guy who dies, and this is his journey after that 'moment'.<br /><br />This movie will make you think; and maybe even comprehend that every single action we make as human beings has an effect on those around us who we care about.<br /><br />I think this movie is THAT good that I'm actually getting this for my wife's mothers day. You'd THINK I'd be a little more romantic with sending flowers or candy or something I KNOW FOR A FACT she LIKES.... but, I'm not. I'm giving her this movie because to me- IT'S THAT GOOD.
B007P3TMW2|5.0|Simply put this movie moved me. It was well done!!! You must have the tissues close at hand when watching
B000063COX|5.0|Despite being old enough to have enjoyed Iron Maiden from the outset, I'm a relatively new fan. I started out with the Somewhere Back in Time compilation, which confirmed I was on to a good thing. I had some trepidation in purchasing this record as it did not feature Bruce Dickinson as lead singer but Paul Di'Anno. Fear not my friends, its a fabulous record and I find it consistently enjoyable throughout. Not a bad song on the record in my opinion. Paul does not have the vocal range that Bruce has but his voice has an edge to it that works very well with the sound they had at the time. Kind of a punk meets hard rock sound. Looking forward to purchasing Killers.

0439023513|3.0|spoiler<br /> Suzanne is a great writer. The way she wrote this last book pulled me right into the depression and hopelessness that Katniss experienced. I struggled to get out of it even when I closed the book. That is powerful writing.<br /><br />I really grew to love Finnick and it broke my heart that he died. That is an intense statement and demonstration of the fact that war can and does rob us for this lifetime of such incredible beauty and purity that exists in the souls of faithful soldiers. I didn't see Katniss truly appreciate those lives that were given to her, to protect her. Sure Katniss- feel guilt. Feel frustration that you didn't really ask to be in this situation. But if you stay in those emotions, you waste those lives. They didn't die so you could live a mediocre life filled with pain, doubt and fear. They died so you could create a safer, happier, more beautiful and fair existence for yourself and their loved ones. The book paying tribute to these saviors is a good idea, but I'd like to see more passion and gratitude poured into that. It should be a project about them and honoring them that helps Katniss really heal and value the gift they gave- their lives and her life and the freedoms she now enjoys. Her love for those kids she has should be out of this world. And for Peeta too. And I think her mom and her could have some kind of relationship- same for Gale.  I see her as still consumed with herself. She has suffered greatly and some of that can be expected but not as a dwelling spot, not for a heroine. She's stronger than that.<br /><br />If Katniss can forgive and heal, she can live a life that's real. She needs a mission. She needs to be contributing. She needs conviction that she fought for a reason or an understanding that she did wrong and a willingness to do whatever she can to make things right or righter anyway. I think there might be a bit of both. But a revolution was due and things are better all in all. Sacrifices are made in thesesituations and it is a huge cost. The price is paid though because it must be, because success is worth any cost and because what is lost will be regained tenfold. If she cannot look her children in the eyes and tell them this someday when they are mature, then she may as well kiss their heads and send them off to the Hunger Games. That would have been their reality excepting the fact that they would not even exist unless she had been forced to have them. My Katniss would at some point have realized that she is loveable
B005GVA2L0|5.0|I have listened to Evanescence off and on since the beginning. I recall the first time I listened to \\"Bring me to Life\\" on the radio, I thought, \\"What's that beautiful voice doing mixed in there with the raunchy music?\\" It took me over a decade to really get it because I'm not into gothic metal or gothic themes. That is, unless the Morticia Effect from the Addams Family has finally come to fruition within me.<br /><br />I have listened to the entire album three times as of this writing. Of course, I have also been watching the videos. Since learning about Amy Lee's background in classical music and knowing how classical musicians evolve, I was curious on how this album evolved. If you have ever taken music classes, I can promise you that each time you listen to this album, you're going to pick up on different nuances every time - it's that complex.<br /><br />The glissandos and cresendos that lead into the bridge works are amazing. The piano work such as the staccato on \\"Erase This.\\" is equally amazing. My personal feeling is that Amy rivals if not exceeds the works of Vivaldi.<br /><br />Although this album may be lacking the chilling gothic soul of previous albums, the album is a sign of maturity. If your soul hasn't matured out of its guilded gothic cage, then you probably won't appreciate this album for what it is: Beautiful, Hopeful, Caring, Nurturing, Loving - REBELLIOUS.<br /><br />Yes, there's definitely a gothic theme, but \\"Sick of it all, Sick of it all\\" is more of a rebellious song that resonates more with me and everyone else who's sick of the \\"bottomless pit of lies.\\" I can definitely hear this song at occupy protest rallies. Isn't that better than wallowing in self pity? Well, OK. Most of the lyrics do wallow in self pity, but that's the essence of gothic, isn't it?<br /><br />If I have a complaint, it's only one: Amy's voice has been processed in every song. I can't find one song that's purely Amy. \\"Call me When You're Sober\\" makes me feel like Amy is right there with me. Most of the songs on this album feel a little distant - and I'm pretty sure it's because of the engineering. I guess that's what Amy wanted, that's her female prerogative.<br /><br />The thing is, I've watched Amy w/o the gothic makeup and listened to her sing only with piano and acoustic guitar - and I love it when she's purely herself. Yes, she's gothic, but she's a beautiful, passionate gothic. If any song reveals that, it would be \\"Secret Door,\\" to her soul, I imagine.right there with me.

B000059TCE|3.0|I enjoyed the live-action version of 101 Dalmatians. Cruella was always one of my favorite Disney villains, with her unique looks... freaky hair and all. I would probably say I like the original animated version better, but this remake was pretty good. The dogs' lack of speech was a disappointment, but Glenn Close as Cruella was awesome, the dogs were still intelligent, and Hugh Laurie as a dopey Cruella sidekick was pretty fun after being used to him as the snarky House.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I have to knock down the rating because of 102 Dalmatians. None of the same characters as the first movie! Just Glenn Close again (who was still great), and a handful of dalmatians, which was kind of weird seeing how there was supposed to be one more than last time! Well, it still would have been a decent movie had it not been for the ending. *SPOILER ALERT* Cruella had already fallen into a sticky vat of food in the end of movie #1. I can't believe they ended movie #2 the same way! What are the odds that a person falls into a sticky vat of food twice in their life? Zero. Because the odds that it happens even once is already slim to none. And both times were right before she was arrested and hauled away that way. Ugh those poor policemen. What a mess! What, did they just not feel like writing a new ending? Besides, I don't care how awful the villain is, I don't really enjoy watching a human being traveling through a giant piece of machinery. Made me think of SAW! (Which I liked, but not for bloody reasons.) The oven would have killed her, not made her come out a walking cake. I can see how kids would find it slapstick and funny, but I just kind of cringed at the whole scene. And like I said, it was a complete copy of the end of the first movie.
8866130915|5.0|I have a Moleskine notebook and love it. So I decided to get this Moleskine planner to replace my current type of planner I'm using for 2012. I make plans a year ahead so I bought the 2013 planner. I was surprised and delighted to find many pages at the front containing lots of unadvertised wonderful and useful information. Too much to list here but the best thing for me was pages with the 2014 calendar and space to record plans for 2014. Next year I will order the 2014 Moleskine planner when it's published in May. But now I don't have to worry about where to keep plans between January and May. And don't believe those few who give Moleskines bad reviews. The paper quality is excellent. The binding is sturdy. The cover has a wonder soft leather-like look and feel. As for the useful pocket in the back, it's made out of paper so only a stupid person would expect it to stand up to a lot of in and out daily use. I plan on keeping only rarely needed items in that pocket. This product is definitely worth the price and five stars.
B004CFBMRY|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, it was filled with fascinating characters and a very interesting look into the world of long (long, long) distance running.  I have recently started running and I read this book just after starting so I think that by reading it I'll save myself a fortune by not upgrading my shoes - ever.  The book is an easy read, hard to put down and provides a great deal of food for thought in terms of running style, the running industry and human origins.  I regularly find myself mooching around the internet researching its many characters, tribes and claims - it's always a good sign if a book won't leave your head I think.<br />Well worth a read whether you're into running, thinking of getting into running or just want to read something.

1433521784|5.0|I've been using the ESV Study Bible on my iPad for a little more than a year, but really missed the ability to write notes in the margins of my Bible and, thinking of my own father's Bible, I started wondering if I was denying my children a future glimpses into what God did in their father's life.  So, I decided to look for a high quality print copy of the ESV Study Bible and settled on this version after seeing how much cheaper I could purchase this Bible through Amazon than directly through Crossway or my local Christian bookstore.<br /><br />When the Bible arrived it was in the original box but not shrink wrapped, although it looked to be in new condition.  I thumbed through it but noticed nothing unusual.  A couple of days later I noticed some printing abnormalities that covered most of Paul's epistles.  The pages looked slightly darker and a little blurry and, on closer inspection, the pages seemed to be double printed.  I immediately contacted the Crossway customer service number included on a 3 x 5 card in the Bible.  I reached a live person who emailed me a return label and offered to send FedEx to my house if I didn't want to drop off the Bible at my local FedEx office.  I elected to drop it off and about two weeks later I received a brand new Bible, shrink wrapped and in the box.  I've found no printing or other quality issues with the new Bible.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-Excellent translation.<br />-Great study tools, including notes, outlines, and full-color maps.<br />-Beautiful cowhide leather cover that should last for many years.<br />-Responsive customer service from Crossway should you need it.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-Even at Amazon's price, this is still an expensive Bible<br />-Initial printing issue makes me wonder if quality issues might be a more common problem.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am a fan of post-apocalyptic fiction.  This is an excellent example of both the genre and fiction generally.  The author gives his characters real personalities and makes you actively root for or against them.  The plot moved right along, with well-paced reveals -- enough information to keep you reading but not so little as to be frustrating.  I would recommend this work to anyone who appreciates a well-written book.

Although learning about the \\"behind the scenes\\" issues and history of Saturday Night Live and 30 Rock was fascinating to one who has watched SNL for years, the honesty plus comedic way Tina wrote, made the book the success it is.  Also, I especially enjoyed the way Tina shared information about her family, herself as a child and teen, and the many actual life roles she integrates as an adult.

Customers need to have a better discription of what they are buying.  Very misleading. Unfortunately it's too late to return. I wonder....if purchased directly from a store if you would get a better quality product. The only reason for 3 stars is we enjoy NCIS.  Otherwise 2 stars...hopefully we have a COMPLETE series after reading others reviews.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|These books are sooooooooooo good!  I just can't believe someone would not like them!  Oh well different strokes for different folks!  This book was even better than the first and can't wait to read the third!  I devoured this book in 1 and a half days...  Hummm... It was that good.  I have to recommend this book to everyone!

0684857219|5.0|You can listen to a bunch of sissy reviewers on amazon crying about having to work too hard, or you can listen to a guy who's been there done that & is widely condidered the best the sport has ever seen.  Cry all you want about \\"overtraining\\" but the fact of the matter is you will NOT become an elite body builder by doing three 45 minute workouts a week. If it were that easy we'd all be walking around looking like arnold. To be an elite body builder you have to treat it like its your job. That means hours and hours of training. These coments remind me of my days as a competetive swimmer. I swam for an olympic coach who was notorious in the sport for his literally brutal training methods. We trained 5 hours a day 7 days a week all year round. We even did a 24hour swim once a year! Many other so called \\"experts\\" criticized this coach saying his methods lead to overtraining & it wasnt the best way to develope athletes. Well this coach made more olympians, world record holders, & world class swimmers than any other coach ever.  What he knew that most didnt & what arnold knows that these 1 star amazon reviewers dont, is that you need to put in the time to be the best. It sounds like a cliche but theres no shortcuts. Overtraining can happen but its far less common than people think. The human body has an amazing ability to adapt. Follow the advice in this book but ease into it. Once you are up to speed, you'll find your body will be able to handle the workouts & you'll see tremendous gains.
B003EYVXV4|5.0|At 2 hours and 22 minutes long, diehard fans will STILL wonder why their favorite scenes from the book were cut. Where is the bread from District 11? Where is Prim's goat? We would love to see a 4-hour Director's Cut!<br /><br />We have seen this movie 7 times. It is by far the most times I have ever watched a movie with my kids! And I enjoyed each and every viewing. The subtleties of the film become clearer with repeat viewings. The attention to detail is extraordinary.<br /><br />If you do not read the book first, there is much that you will miss. You'll still have a positive viewing experience, to be sure, but there is a certain shorthand that the movie employs that only avid readers of the series will \\"get\\". Why does Katniss not speak to Peeta on the train? Why is her relationship with her mother so strained? Why does Katniss kiss Peeta? Reading the books first will give you insights that a non-reader won't even know they missed.<br /><br />The movie is a tour de force. Suzanne Collins (who had a hand in writing the script) has accomplished the near impossible: She has used violence to demonstrate the banality of violence without ever once glorifying the violence. Not once when a tribute dies, do you cheer his or her demise. We do not even root for our heroine Katniss to win. We simply see the tributes for what they all are: pawns in the sick, twisted game that the Capitol forces upon them. Even when the tributes themselves do not realize that they are pawns, we do.<br /><br />Donald Sutherland asked for the role of President Snow because he considered the message of this film to be just that important to the young people in America today. (Snow's part is very small in this film.) I agree. You should encourage your young teen to read the books and watch the film. But I wouldn't recommend either for the pre-teen crowd.

0345803485|3.0|Fifty Shades of Grey: I read as many of the reviews as I could stomach.  Oh come now!! I think each person who is so critical is taking the book a little tooooo serious.  Well written? I do not know- I am not an English professor.  Good plot - well it kept some you reading up to as much as 88%, why stop there?  Characters - You have got to love the inner goddess hiding behind the sofa.  As stated this was her first book.  I find myself laughing at some of the scenes because they are funny.  Truth be told I wanted to skip past come of the emails but even those had me laughing.  I took the book for what it was.  A first novel written by a new author.  Where is the learning curve for her. E.L. James rock on but tone down the email.
B00723NWJE|1.0|I usually like Norah Jones' music.. But I have to say I am not a fan off this album.  Each song sounds the same and is so depressing.. My only advice is that you listen to each of the tracks before you invest in an entire album. You may only purchase one song to get the idea of the whole album.
0439023491|5.0|I became interested in The Hunger Games when Jennifer Lawrence was cast as Katniss Everdeen in the Movie The Hunger Games. She had starred earlier in Winter's Bone, for which she received an Oscar nomination, set in our southern Missouri Ozarks, where I live in my little cabin. All three of my grown daughters said I should read the books. One of them loaned me the first book in the series. After a few pages, I immediately ordered this, the second in the series, so it would be on hand when I finished the first. I am sure glad I did. It was here, and I picked it up and started reading as soon as I finished The Hunger Games. My daughter who lives nearby loaned me the third, the Mockingjay, so I had it when I finished Catching Fire. So happy for that. I've now finished all three and am amazed at the story, the continuity, the way you are pulled through all three books, non-stop. I wish the books I write read that well. I will keep trying, being inspired by this story-telling. The story is not particularly nice. I would not normally read this kind of story. But, once I got into it, I was hooked and did not want to stop until the end. The end was done nicely as well.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just finished Wool and was blown away!  I stayed up many nights reading, lost in an entirely different and scary world.  First of all the book is very well written with the perfect mix of description, character development and a page turning plot.  The world these poor lovable people from Silo 18 live in is fascinating.  You become so engrossed in how they survive and the delusions they live under.  I am an avid reader who is very critical of books that start out exciting and end up being just another version of a book I already read.  This was the exact opposite.  It started out interesting and a little confusing, yet it made you want to keep reading due to the endearment of the characters.  Once you read a few chapters you are hooked.  I remember getting so caught up in the action I was scaring my kids with all the \\"Oh my God\\" outbursts I had while reading.  If you liked the Hunger Games you will love this book.  The action never stops and the emotional attachment to the characters is as strong.  Thank you Hugh Howey for giving us a book that makes you reflect on your life, your values, society, the environment and most of all makes you so grateful for the world we live in.  Even with all it's faults our world is a wonderful place to live.

B007WQYH4K|5.0|I saw the movie on TV a few times and bought the VCR version, and then the DVD. I loved it from the opening water tower scene, until the credits stopped rolling. The music is as beautiful as the western vistas throughout the film. When listening to this original soundtrack you can easily visualize Claudia Cardinale's beautiful eyes and that funny hat at the train station. Every track brings this magnificent film to life in your head as you listen. Use caution if you listen while driving. It's that good.
0345803485|5.0|I really REALLY enjoyed this book!  Aside from the \\"stuff\\" that everyone knows & talks about, I loved the relationship between Ana and Christian.  Their witty banter back and forth just made me smile ear to ear.  The ending KILLED ME and I have to go start the other one now... immediately. :)

1609611543|5.0|\\"So when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship and threw out the wheat into the sea.\\" -- Acts 27:38 (NKJV)<br /><br />As I have watched health degenerate among those around me over the last several decades, I've been continually struck that there must be some few new factors that have wide effects. When I ask scientifically and medically trained people, they assure me it's all a result of too many chemicals being used to raise crops and to feed animals. Until I read this book, I was also aware that the American diet has become too full of foods that spike blood sugar. Now, I realize that wheat has a special role in undermining health through the ways it accelerates a number of harmful bodily processes, especially in encouraging fat storage. That alone was worth the price of the book.<br /><br />Dr. Davis does an excellent job of explaining why today's wheat is not the same as my grandfather's wheat and what the harmful effects are. Those explanations were worth the price of three of this book.<br /><br />I was in the middle of a diet that was going pretty smoothly when I read Wheat Belly. I didn't go wheat free but I did reduce my wheat intake by more than 80 percent (as far as I can tell) and my oatmeal by 65 percent. My weight loss accelerated, and my energy level is much better. Hurray! I feel quite confident now that the rest of the diet will go well . . . and that the belly weight loss will be high.<br /><br />When I was young, people referred to men with big bellies as having \\"beer bellies.\\" Yet almost everyone I know who isn't an exercise fanatic has such a belly, even if they haven't had a beer in decades. \\"Wheat belly\\" is the description that should be used except for those who do consume way too much beer.<br /><br />If you have extreme health problems and really need to go wheat free, this book will be a God send to you.<br /><br />My main question is how much wheat someone can consume who doesn't have the more deleterious health consequences of eating too much wheat. I didn't feel that question was as thoroughly addressed as the other issues were in the book.<br /><br />If you combine this information with the South Beach Diet Super Charged approach, you should be quite a fit and trim person for the rest of your life. I pray that you will!<br /><br />Avoid the wheat!eating too much wheat. I didn't feel that question was as thoroughly addressed as the other issues were in the book.<br /><br />If you combine this information with the South Beach Diet Super Charged approach, you should be quite a fit and trim person for the rest of your life.

0307959856|3.0|\\"Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good.\\" 3 John 1:11 (NKJV)<br /><br />Extending Pride and Prejudice, that monumentally subtle masterpiece, would be more than a handful of writers should even think about doing. Adding a murder mystery element to such an extension, perhaps that will have to await for a new Jane Austen to arise.<br /><br />Baroness James deserves an A for effort, and perhaps some words of caution about trying to do too much . . . but not an audience for this book.<br /><br />Unless your curiosity has to be quenched, I don't see much advantage to reading Death Comes to Pemberley. The imitation of Jane Austen's style sticks out so much that it feels artificial rather than pleasant. The mystery itself is more of a crime story than a mystery. There's not much realistic chance that you'll figure it all out before it is revealed. When all is revealed, you may feel (as I did) that the crime is a bit thin in its plotting.<br /><br />Perhaps the most candid thing I can say without spoiling the story is that Elizabeth isn't the fascinating heroine that she is in Pride and Prejudice. Instead, she comes across as Darcy's appendage. Yuck!

B005J29HCQ|5.0|\\"Smile Sessions\\" by the Beach Boys may not be the finished project that was going to be once upon a time, but it more than delivers. The songs that were sequenced together to represent how the album would've sounded are stunning. They sound incredibly innovative and ahead of their time. A lot of the time, the music can't be categorized as rock and roll because of how different and well composed it is. This is without a doubt just as good or better than \\"Sgt. Peppers\\" over-all.<br /><br />As for the demo's, sound collages, stereo mixes and intermissions that are on the first cd, there's nothing really bad to say. Brian Wilson used vocals like musical instruments so the vocal collage is very impressive. The first disc pretty much is the album with bonus tracks.<br /><br />Disc 2 are out-takes and instrumentals that some people will either love or not appreciate. There are brief intermissions where Brian Wilson is actively composing and arranging while the tape is recording everything and it's amazing to hear it in action. It's almost like hearing Beethoven or Mozart jamming and rehearsing their compositions. The evolution of the songs is amazing and shows that Brian Wilson is a genius that ranks up there with those classical composers.<br /><br />Finally, when you upon the CD box, there's a pin with the \\"Smile\\" logo on it, a very informative booklet with lots of pictures, and a poster of the album cover.<br /><br />This is most definitely worth whatever money you pay for it. Had this been completed fully and come out in 1967, I think mainstream music would've been changed forever. We have about 80 percent of the finished product here and it still feels that way.<br /><br />Definitely buy.

B00723NWJE|4.0|With each album following Norah Jone's smash debut \\"Come Away With Me\\", she drifts a little further from the sound that made her popular. According to Jones this is not by mistake and doesn't want to make the same album over and over. She wants each disc to its own vibe. I would say at this point in her career she has accomplished just that. While the vibe of her recent releases hasn't set well with some of her original fanbase, I have to give her props for trying to be creative, while still maintaining a distinct Norah Jones sound.<br /><br />Her latest release \\"Little Broken Hearts\\" was co-written and produced by Brian Burton or Danger Mouse. A man who has become quite the collaborator in recent years, releasing material with Jack White, The Black Keys, and Shins lead man James Mercer, which was called Broken Bells. This disc finds about half of it with a Broken Bells influence and the other half sounding like they could belong on one of Norah's previous two discs. Songs such as the title track \\"Little Broken Hearts\\", \\"She's 22\\", \\"Good Morning\\", and \\"Travelin On\\" sound as though they could be on \\"The Fall\\" or \\"Not Too Late. Songs like \\"After The Fall\\", \\"4 Broken Hearts\\", lead single \\"Happy Pills\\", and likely future single \\"Say Goodbye\\" have a Broken Bells sound to them. This isn't a bad thing really, as it adds a new wrinkle to her sound and isn't over done. So if you've enjoyed Norah's recent work and the Broken Bells cd, there is no reason you shouldn't enjoy this one. The two do good work together and I wouldn't be suprised to see further work from the duo. The one song I would avoid is \\"Miriam\\", which to me is a bit psycho coming from Norah, even if this is a breakup disc.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I have read a number of books about the inhumanities of North Korea. This is the most extraordinary. The story requires no hype and gets none. The idea of a child being 'spawned' in prison camp as a reward for cooperative inmate behavior (sexual relations otherwise being punishable by execution), is repulsive in the extreme. That this person just happened by chance to learn enough about life outside to even imagine escaping, and then pulling it off, is astounding. This book is not over-written. The story in a good reporter's hands tells itself. It is written with real empathy for the survivor of this escape. One can almost imagine his life would have been horribly simpler if he'd never escaped. He might as well as escaped from Mars.
B00755646W|5.0|Those who are interested in early career of Queen of Pop must watch this movie.<br />It shows a lot of her private life, relationships, career.
B0013ND30M|4.0|I remember watching this movie as a little girl and falling in love with it. Now that I have 2 little girls of my own, I had to get it for them. Truth be told, they didn't really enjoy it very much. It was pretty boring for them in the beginning, but paid attention towards the end. I just think they're more into the Disney movies with lots of action and songs(Toy Story, Tangled, Princess and the frog). Overall, it's a beautiful movie.

0374203032|5.0|Michael Sandel is unsurpassed in writing books that are delightfully accessible while being intellectually rigorous. What Money Can't Buy lacks the academic references to classical thinkers that were in his book Justice: What's the Right Thing to Do, which is a shame, but it is still one of the most thought-provoking books I have read in a long time.<br />Sandel's subject is money, specifically how monetary incentives and disincentives are being used today in a wide array of realms where money was not a factor in the past.  Sandel is a philosopher, not an economist or political scientist, and so he asks, \\"What does this mean? And why should I  care?\\" As he says in the introduction, \\"to decide what money should--- and should not ---be able to buy, we have to decide what values should govern the various domains of social and civic life. How to think this through is the subject of this book.\\"<br />To explore the implications of the expansion of the role of markets in our lives, What Money Can't Buy considers two primary aspects: fairness and corruption. The first aspect, fairness, is the more obvious:  a wealthier individual will not be affected by a societal incentive/disincentive as much as a poor one. Granted, true, but I do not need a Harvard professor to tell me so. The second aspect is the more interesting: does the use of monetary factors corrupt our sense of values? Are there basic human rights and feelings that should be immune from market manipulation? An interesting example is that of a Swiss town that was a potential site for a nuclear waste dump. The town was a very good site for such a facility, and  51% of the town residents said they would accept it. They were then asked if they would accept the dump if authorities offered to pay an annual inducement of over $8000 per person. The rate of acceptance fell from 51% to 25%. Apparently the residents did not like having the issue turned from one of civic altruism into a pecuniary matter. People do believe that there are issues in which money should not play a role.<br />The book's prolific examples range from Bruce Springsteen concert tickets to paying for an  upgraded prison cell (!)  to cap-and-trade. I especially loved the Springsteen example. People were scalping tickets to a Springsteen concert in New Jersey; you may or may not feel this is unethical.  However, if you are also told that Springsteen deliberately kept ticket prices low because he is from NJ and wanted ordinary people to be able to come, AND this cost him an estimated $4 million in ticket revenue, does this affect your opinion?<br />Although I thought Sandel's examples were well-chosen, thought-provoking, and enjoyable, I wish the actual discussion of the philosophical implications of the lessons to be learned had been more extensive. He made ME think, but I'd like to have heard more about what HE thinks.  The book was fairly short and over too soon.t there are issues in which money should not play a role.<br />The book's prolific examples range from Bruce Springsteen concert tickets to paying for an  upgraded prison cell (!)  to cap-and-trade.

B00005NTN5|5.0|This brilliant caper film came to life because Joel Silver wanted to see if the Wachowski Brothers could actually make a film, before he sank all of that money into The Matrix.  This low-budget gem was a kind of test, and so slipped in under the radar of Hollywood.  In other circumstances, it's unlikely that a dark, sexy, R-rated film about two frankly lesbian protagonists burning the mafia would have made it to the screen without being heavily rewritten.  Unlike most lesbian-themed films, this is definitely NOT a Coming Out or Coming To Terms story; the orientation of Corky (Gina Gershon) and Violet (Jennifer Tilly) is a given from the very beginning.  There are also a couple of major departures from the usual pattern of caper films, but to go into them would be a spoiler - and this film is too good to spoil.  Very, very fun little film, with solid performances all around - Joe Pantoliano is especially fun as a villain who thinks he's smarter than he is.  Definitely worth a look!

B007P6VM04|3.0|I bought the deluxe version at target as soon as I could without looking at the list of songs on the back. When I got home, I was really disappointed to see how many of the show's original songs were missing. \\"Second Hand White Baby Grand\\" was my absolute favorite song from the show, but it (along with many other songs) wasn't included in the cd. The songs on the cd are great, but I really wish it had less covers of pop songs and more of the original songs. I'm considering returning it just because of the principle of it.

1589944607|4.0|We debated getting this game for a while and finally took the plunge.  For any BSG fan, this game is amazing.  For players unfamiliar with BSG, the game is still fun, but some of the terminology on the board and cards will need explaining (e.g. Cylon, FTL, CAG).<br /><br />This game does require about 4-5 hours to play with a full group with some of the players knowing the rules.  The setup is a little time consuming (think 15 minutes) because the manual's setup rules are not all in the same section.  This game really shines with 5 players, but is fun with 4.  3 players really can be done, but I wouldn't recommend it.  Players are given a race (Human or Cylon) that only they can look at.  Most of the game ever player is accusing others of being a Cylon.  Games at our house often have the phrase \\"That's exactly what a Cylon would say.\\"  The best part is, 1/2 through the game another set of race cards are given out and current humans may find out they are now a Cylon.<br /><br />When playing this game, you'll usually feel like there is absolutely no way to win and you're doomed (so exactly like the TV show =p).
0345803485|1.0|I found this book to be boring, poorly written and predictable. The media hype over the supposed positive effects this book has had on American marriages is without merit.  I love erotica but this book is labeled as a Romance.  Not a romance, not really so erotic after the first couple of chapters.  Completely without literary merit.  I returned the second and third books because I cannot imagine reading the same thing over and over again.
0670023329|3.0|The story about Shin is very tragic and fascinating. The author wrote it to much like a newspaper article and not enough story telling. For example when Shin is working on a cattle farm there is hardly any detail at all. I would have liked to have read that story, how many cattle, did he ride a horse, was he there for birthing of the calves. etc.<br /><br />I think it would have been a really great book if the author would have cutback on the past history and current political situation by about 25% and increased by about 25% Shin's story.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Summer Movie season's here! Finally some movies worth going to the cinema for. My 1st anticipated movie and...it's a HIT! Hats off to Whedon on handling this ensemble. No main character was given too much/too little time. It was well rounded. I loved the banter between them and the acting was good as well. Loki had charisma as the villain. Superb action scenes. It was a living comicbook. My only complaint is it didn't have that suspense. Why? Because Marvel already made it known that sequels are in the works. So you knew they all were going to make it. I look for the heroes to make it anyway but give me the illusion they might not. Also, the Chitauri punked Loki but Loki gave The Avengers more trouble than they did. How's that? Hmm. And there were some impossible feats by Hawkeye & Black Widow; regular humans. Anyway, not a disappointment at all. Fun! And it should be. Batman it isn't. I don't expect the darkness or as much complexity. TDKR will give me that in spades. Meantime, The Avengers gets an A.<br /><br />I still love this movie and still would give a 4.5 score but on the high end. The only small problem for me still is the weak aliens. They just posed no real threat to me. Loki, however, was great. Glad I own this movie.

B003L77GH4|5.0|The Vampire Diaries series is amazing, with brilliant actors and actresses. The plot is intricate, yet easy to make sense of. Each episode is better than the last, and the books are great, too. This is so much better than Twilight, True Blood, and Supernatural combined. I am completely in love with the series!!!

B004LOMB2Q|4.0|This is a great app for keeping track of all different things. I can make my shopping list, create a quick note, take a picture of something I may want to find later. In short, great orginization tool! I have deleted several other note apps since downloading this one. I just don't need any of the other ones.
0345803485|1.0|Don't bother.<br />I am amazed at the rhetoric behind this book.<br /><br />I am a 54 year old man who has been involved in the public Bdsm scene for some 35 years. I have not only read fiction and non fiction literature for my entire BDSM career but I have also lived the lifestyle.<br /><br />This ridiculous representation of a bdsm relationship is a farce. Not only is it incredibly misleading but it is also poorly written.<br /><br />If you would like a taste of BDSM there are far more interesting well written pieces.<br /><br />Try : The Sleeping Beauty Novels: The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty / Beauty's Release / Beauty's Punishment [Box set] [Paperback]<br />[[ASIN:0452156610 The Sleeping Beauty Novels: The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty / Beauty's Release / Beauty's Punishment]]
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Like the heading says, how can you go wrong with Adele, answer you can't...Enough said. 5+ stars what a singer and song writer....
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I am not a consumer of novels and short-stories. However, my son enjoyed the book so much that I decided to give it a look. Once I began, the story drew me in with its simple portrayal of hope in a society lost. The straight-forward emotions of kids and young adults thrown into an arena of perverse competition was compelling and saddening. I also enjoyed the pacing with moments of sheer terror and others of silliness and thoughtful downtime. A fun read.
1423101499|5.0|Bougjt it a couple of years ago as part of a set. It was in great conditions and family is enjoying them.
B0055SWM08|5.0|just because I'm not great at puzzles isn't the games fault. the game is awesome it takes a lot of thinking but that's the point of a puzzle.
1423113497|5.0|Great series for the family. Entertainment value is great and kids enjoy it along with the remainder of the books
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|So I had the game on my phone so I waited and waited for it to come out on my kindle fire.When I got the free version and I played for two days two days and it logged me out. So I log back in and add my e-mail again and it says already a game so I now know someone hacked into my account.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game; it literally just keeps on giving and I guarentee you that you will never get bored. it is solo cool.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|since iv downloaded this app iv loved it! its fun and easy.. somthnig to do when your bored! iv neaver had a problem with this app neaver freezes or messes up .. dose not take a long time to load like most games i enioy this app!!! (:  &quot; i would recamend it to anyone!
1401216676|5.0|Totally worth the buy.<br /><br />When i saw this book, i instantly got in love with it. It's those books you need to read and have to be a true Joker fan.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its a fun awesome game that has a lot of finger movment and when you see how fun it is you will never stop playing
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it use it everyday I love all the versions. if I don't understand something look it up in a different version.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|I never thought I'd say this,but Star Wars never looked or sounded this good in theaters!!!Colors are more vivid,the pictur is MUCHclearer and the sound is amazing!I saw and heard things I'd never caught before!If,like me ,you love these movies more thanthe prewuels, this collectin is an absolute must!You won't believe your eyes and ears!!!!
B007Z9QWVK|3.0|Visually Stunning. Though not terribly engrossing, the plot and storyline were pleasing. Interesting switch up to use Wallis's view. (Love the red lip). I would have been more forgiving if the story had exposed something new about Wallis & Edward, but over all, not a disappointment. I would own this on DVD just for the visual feast.
B007PYEY9M|4.0|This movie was adorable and greatly enjoyed by all of my children. I would recommend it to others. The bunny was cute and it had a good story line.
B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|Blu-ray version adds so much more color and depth, definitely worth viewing at least once to see the movie in it's full glory.  However, it is the story is what holds the young ones attention (at least my girls, don't have boys so can't comment there).  They like to watch again and again.<br /><br />No truly scary parts and works their imagination.
B005LAIGLE|4.0|I liked the story line to protect family.  I didn't agree with some things that took place but it was clearly understandable.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved how quick and easy the book downloaded. The electronic book is the fastest and easiest way to keep reading when you're on the go. Excellent for trains planes and automobiles.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I liked this book. It is not the type of book I usually read and thought I would try something different. It was very well written and imaginative. I would recommend it.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|There is no free non hd version of this. Nuff said. Why do they not allow kindle fire owners to have this free without the extra storage needed for the hd version?
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Was really fun until it glitches and makes unrealistic time on revenue. It said I had like 200 hours until my stuff would be ready to collect.
1451627289|5.0|I have been a fan of Stephen King since I first read Carrie in the 70's. I put 11/22/63 in the top 5 of my favorites. This is truly one of Stephen King's best works of art. This book really made me think about 'what if?', the same way The Stand did, and still does. I will carry the fantasies of 'what if' from this book with me for as long as my brain is capable of coherent thought. When I reached the end, I was sad because I was enjoying the ride so much that I didn't want to get off.
0385342063|5.0|I never thought id ever say this..but I totally love Poppy Wyatt...even more than Becky Bloomwood! I know, I know, but this book was so great I could really relate to Poppy and thought she was hilarious but in a real \\"that could totally happen to me way\\". All around great book. Definitely a keeper/re-reader!<br />Ps..I added this note after I read some of the lower reviews. This book is not supposed to be intellectually stimulating or deep. This is pure chick lit; quirky, overdramatized, romantical, and fun! Please pick pick up War and Peace if this is not your genre. AND btw, the footnotes are on purpose! Poppy specifically said she read her fiancees book and thought the footnotes made her look so clever.
0307592731|4.0|Once a started reading Cheryl Strayed's memoir, Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail, I put everything else aside until I finished it. Following her mother's death and her own divorce, Strayed decided to take time off and on something of a whim, decided to hike 1,100 miles on the Pacific Crest Trail. Somewhat unprepared with too much gear and the wrong size shoes, her grit and determination brought me vicarious pleasure as I read about something I would never do. Her reckless behavior and her transformation were compelling to read because of the clarity and candor of her writing. A friend recommended this book, and I pass that recommendation along to any reader who enjoys true stories of the indomitable human spirit.<br /><br />Rating: Four-star (Highly Recommended)
B007UWBQEU|3.0|I am not going to gush over this album as it wasn't all that much to gush over, I like Carrie Underwood and have all her other stuff, but this album sounded like she was experimenting with different types of songs.  I guess with the money she has now, she can afford to 'experiment', but to be honest she should stick with the country and leave the Enya and Lady Gaga alone.  I see the price has gone up since it was released 5/1, this is common practice I guess.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It plays like any city building game. great time waster!  The characters are very well done &amp; the movie that plays is very funny.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I want to play this game forever but my kindle fire keeps dieing then I what a hour and then play it again
1455508977|5.0|Enjoyed reading this book, wonderful plot.  Ending was excellent, bought tears to my eyes. Nicholas Sparks has a wonderful way of introducing each character and highlighting each of them.
B006ZPJWBM|5.0|Arrived timely. well packaged,,,no issues ...the DVD is a classic with Tony Bennett and invited duet singers....a great sequel to the first Duets
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is really cool and the pictures are so awesome like heck I think you should get this game and rate it 5 stars!
B003TQKVGU|5.0|Joseph Murphy and Neville Goddard were both taught by the same person. I am a big fan of Neville and so I wanted to look into Murphy as well.<br /><br />This is a really good book. It takes a different tack than Neville. Murphy is more analytical than Neville and offers many examples. Some of Murphy seems a bit outdated and perhaps a bit too enthusiastic. But, it is almost always best to read the original. He and Neville are both labeled as New Thought or as New Thinking.<br /><br />I'll be honest. I like Neville a lot more. Neville is more poetic and more inspirational. And, to me Neville is more practical.<br /><br />Whatever floats your boat. You can't go wrong with either if you are open to a new way of thinking, new even though this is a 1963 book.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great game! a few bugs but easy to fix.its free and its fun! what hag u got to lose if u get this!!
0525478817|5.0|I'm a middle-aged man. I read a lot of fiction. I came to this w/ some trepidation; aware of it's \\"young adult\\" target, but read some glowing reviews and am always intrigued by this subject matter, mostly because it's always dismayingly and disappointingly handled so poorly. Not this time. What a revelation  this book and author John Green turned out to be. Smart, sensitive, insightful, gorgeous writing. This one will stay with me. It will stay with you.  I feel like a young adult wise beyond the years! Read this best book of 2012.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|the game is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!! buy this app!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! it is fun!!!!!!!!!!! (fun fun fun)! buy this app know!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!please :)do it for a 9/10 year old :)
B007V2UGPE|5.0|great game very addictive but there is a flight that rodent let you start game please fix do not buy currency packs till fixed
B003V4AK8E|3.0|this's not a good controller for games like battlefield3 or COD, where speed & accuracy matter the most.  lag + inaccuracy lead to decrease in k/d ratio results more frustrations.  you've to rethink your strategy if you want to continue playing sfs with this controller. a flanking maneuver or a coward move from behind is the option.<br /><br />i bought this controller specifically for game like batman or gta4. while the ruberized texture provides good grips (wish it had that on ps3 stock controller), the battery life is not bad either (it out lasted the stock controller) & finally the redLED lit buttons are good.  blueLED lit butons would have been awesome, more in line with the current trend.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love this app!!! it is AWSOME!!! I love helping the birds from their cage's! I really reccomend this app for kid user's.
B000W453KQ|1.0|This may be a classic. I know that lots of people enjoyed this movie.  I was not one of them.  It was extremely disappointing.
B00723NWJE|5.0|Norah Jones just sends you to dream land.  Great Album, Norah's voice just set your mind adrift. Just inagine setting watching play and sing is great.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|a fun way to kill time and zombies and you get to use a sword and a bow not to shabbie
B0000WN0ZK|1.0|It's a long time since i saw the movie, but i think i will always remember it as an excruciatingly boring experience. (I had to sit through because it was presented in a college course.) IN this movie, nothing happens--very very slowly.
0439023491|5.0|I have read all three books and this one was the best of the three.  I could not put it down and had it read in less than 24 hours. It captivates your every moment and is impossible to leave.<br />The author does such an exceptional job plotting each scene.<br />Remarkable
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This was a fun game before the update . Now its even better! The new level &quot;Surf and Turf&quot; is fun. But the update only put 15 levels so if you go to the next page it says &quot;NEW LEVELS COMING SOON&quot; so that's why I rate it 4 stars.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing Solitaire. It took a while to get use to the cards ( only shows one number and suit on card).  Other then that its fine.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is so fun. Its all about Ice Age. I love it. You rebuild a village for the animals. You can visit other people's villages and play minigames. Its so cool.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Invested many many hours of playing and then glitched. 300+ hours to collect coins... I don't think so! After the first time, I re-downloaded it and then it happened again.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a great time killer. it is very addicting. I start. to play for just a few minutes, next thing I know an hour has gone by. fun game!
B007V5CF5K|5.0|one of the best hidden object games ive played. the graphics are beautiful. the puzzles are challenging but not impossibe and the clue button is actually helpful. i solved the game fast enough to have a sense of accomplishment, but not so quickly that it was boring
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Finally!  The one we've been waiting for... well, one of them anyway. \\"The Avengers\\" written and directed by Joss Whedon arrives in US theaters today and it's one of the few movies that's absolutely worth the wait.<br /><br />What's Good:  Joss Whedon's script!  Nobody does it better when it comes to blending both characterization, action and storytelling in sci-fi.  His repertoire is on full display in this flick; not a single character gets shorted despite the size of the cast, and the movie flows nicely- forget dragging, there's barely time to catch your breath around here.  From Bruce Banner's nervous mannerisms to Maria Hill's cool competence everyone gets some attention to detail that makes them human and not merely characters.  You're gonna love Agent Coulson's reaction to meeting to Captain America for the first time!  And without a doubt the best scene in the movie is Hulk vs Loki!<br /><br />Being a superhero movie you gotta have references both to the source material and beyond.  Whedon shows his love and reverence of the genre by loading the movie with homages.  I think I even caught a Great Darkness Saga reference in there.  (If I have to explain what that is, forget it...)<br /><br />And what's a Whedon script without the humor?  From the amusement of a couple of running jokes and a couple of comedic bits (\\"...that man is playing Galaga!  He thought we didn't see him, but we did...\\") to some straight up laugh out loud moments this is one of those movies that brings everything together so well it makes you wonder how so many others can keep screwing things up... *cough* Green Lantern *cough*<br /><br />What's Bad: Honestly, very little.  I thought the beginning was rushed, so we really didn't get to see what the Chitauri were all about, how Loki found them and why he was allied with them.  They were just there and they were coming to Earth; given that it's a two-hour plus movie Whedon could've spent a little more time on them.  And Captain America's costume just... didn't look quite right.<br /><br />The Rest of It:  Visuals are excellent.  I don't go to 3D movies but there were a couple of shots that made me wonder what they'd look like full-on.  The SHIELD Helicarrier was like the Death Star designed by earthlings, and the Hulk's rendering was spot on.  Even the alien monstrosity skimming the skies of Manhattan looked like a part of the scenery it was destroying.<br /><br />Forget \\"The Hunger Games\\", \\"The Avengers\\" is the first true blockbuster of the year and deservedly so because it exceeds all your expectations.  This is a very satisfying, highly entertaining movie and of course, you gotta stick around until the end of the credits.  You will not be disappointed!tume just... didn't look quite right.<br /><br />The Rest of It:  Visuals are excellent.

0140186409|5.0|The Grapes of Wrath, Redux: Outline for a Sequel<br /><br />Many readers have complained about the abrupt ending of Steinbeck's immortal classic, \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\". Like Preacher Casey, I went off and did some thinkin' and then some more thinkin', and here's what I think might possibly have come to pass in the lives of the principal characters:<br /><br />Ma Joad: The trials of migration, familial disintegration, and non-stop tragedy finally break this great lady down. An excess of greasy, non-nutritional food causes a massive heart attack. The children, Ruthie and Winfield, returning from gathering firewood, find her dead on the ground near the cooking fire.<br /><br />Tom Joad, Senior: Being displaced as the head of the family wears mightily upon his mind. He catches pneumonia from the exposure to the flood, and dies in the barn two weeks after the original novel ends. He is delusional, and seems to be permanently in the land of shades.<br /><br />Uncle John: Scrapes up enough coin to \\"enjoy\\" one last big drunk, buys and imbibes several fifths of Thunderbird  wine. Found floating in the same river as the sad little bundle he was sent to bury.<br /><br />Preacher Casey: Like John the Revelator, becomes a sort of anti-prophet, and goes wandering all over Southern California, occasionally dropping in unannounced at religious revival meetings, damning the preachers as \\"scribes and pharisees, hypocrites\\". Beaten to death by religious zealots, dies in Barstow,  CA 1949.<br /><br />Rose of Sharon: Finds work as a \\"hostess\\" in a bar in Lodi. Sells her favors for a while, then meets and marries a grifter and bunco artist. They travel the West, hanging bad paper, until one day she finds herself alone in another cheap motel. Goes to sleep forever after taking an overdose of something, after a lifelong overdose of no good men.<br /><br />Winfield Joad: Lies about his age and joins the US Marine Corps in 1940 at the age of 15. Killed in action on Okinawa, 1945. Posthumously awarded a Silver Star.<br /><br />Ruthie Joad Anderson: Found wandering near Bakersfield, picked up by a kindly, childless Christian family who are moving to Oregon. She grows up in a good home, surrounded by people who love her. Completes high school and then nursing school in Seattle. Specializes in pediatric nursing because of her love of children. Retires in 1968, dies 1970.<br /><br />Tom Joad, Junior: Anti-hero \\"star\\" in the original volume. Caught just one month after last seeing Ma Joad, charged with First Degree Murder. (\\"Them cops\\", he says, \\"they work twenty- four hours a day, while a reg'lar guy's gotta sleep sometime. God damn it!\\") Zealous young \\"leftist\\" public defender J.I. Hurwitz gets the charges reduced to 2nd Degree, but Tom still gets a 25 year sentence, at California's notorious Folsom Prison. His inflated reputation (by the press) as a \\"red troublemaker\\" and \\"cop killer\\" precede him, and Folsom's guards make his life miserable. He does a lot of time in solitary, for petty infractions. After six years inside, he is a broken man. Found hanging in his cell, 1943. Foul play suspected but never proved.<br /><br />Al Joad:  At last, a \\"success story\\". Many readers have noticed that Al is better adapted to a changing America, with his uncanny knack for fixing cars, coupled with a \\"can-do\\" cockiness. You can't keep a good man down, we all know that. He and Aggie Wainwright hitchhike to L.A., where Al gets a job as a \\"lot boy\\" at a big Chevrolet dealership. War breaks out, and the management finds out Al is a crackerjack mechanic. An early childhood bout of rheumatic fever damaged his heart enough that he is turned down for service in the Armed Forces. He quickly rises to be Service Manager, all the time squirreling away money from his day job and his moonlight job, fixing and reselling old beaters, and trading in black market tires and ration stamps with fellow Okie Eddie Moon.<br /><br />In 1946 he takes over a down at heel used car dealership on Long Beach Boulevard. He gets the land and inventory for free because the former owner owed him money from a deal that went bad. He buys lots of spot ads on local country/western stations, appealing to struggling young people to \\"come on in, yer job is yer credit, We know how it is, just startin' out and all, We BELIEVE in YOU!\\" Before long he is the owner of most of the used car lots in South L. A. and  Long Beach, although shrewdly leaving in place the former names. In the 50's he wins Chrysler/Plymouth franchise, and becomes a constant presence on local TV, sponsoring wrestling matches, music shows, and demolition derbies. An only son, Thomas Winfield Joad, is found dead of a heroin overdose in Hollywood, 1969. Al retires from the car business but becomes a fierce spokesman for the War Against Drugs, as well as a big contributor to local Republican candidates for office. He dies, fabulously wealthy, without an heir, in 1975.<br /><br />My apologies to Mr. Steinbeck. I mean no disrespect. Maybe, as Preacher Casey says,  too much's thinkin's bad for a fella.ong Beach Boulevard. He gets the land and inventory for free because the former owner owed him money from a deal that went bad.

0765348276|2.0|Bought the book based on the excellent reviews. Book starts really well - entertaining, sometimes funny and interesting, new idea (seniors enlisting to army). But excitement soon disappeared - book soon turns into boring \\"starship troopers\\" killing all kinds of \\"evil, nasty\\" aliens and plot just gets week ... towards the end I felt like the whole book should have condensed to 30-40 pages and let's go ... what's next? Well, that is maybe answered in other Scalzi's books, but I won't know ...
0385474547|5.0|First, I DIDN'T read this as a school assignment. It seems like I'm one of the few.<br /><br />Roughly, this fits into similar territory as Dances With Wolves, Little Big Man, or even Dune and Avatar. But while those stories of native vs. civilized man draw very sharp (and shallow?) lines in the moral sand, this book admiringly avoids it. The Ibgo are not a hippie's dream come true--unless you think polygamy and infanticide are groovy. But they are not savages either. In fact they are quite civilized--if by \\"civilized\\" we mean adhering to an agreed upon code of laws and conduct. Their only flaw is they are at times TOO civilized and conforming for their own good. For all of Okwonko's physical strength, he can't bring himself to refuse the oracle's order of the death of his adopted son, for example.<br /><br />The missionaries are the same. They believe so blindly in their own code that they can't see that they are wrong to murder half a village and impose their own set of laws on the Ibgo simply because they can. They are rule followers too--and their love of rules too often trumps their respect for all of humanity.<br /><br />In the end, I'm not sure the villain of this story is the White Man. I believe it's rather the blind, unquestioning faith in religious dogma and superstition on both sides. Without it, the Igbo wouldn't have granted the Christians unearned respect after nothing happened to them after building a church in the Evil Forest or after they killed a python. And without dogma and superstition, the Englishmen wouldn't have believed gunboat diplomacy was His wish.

1401937268|5.0|For years, I wanted a Angel based deck that I could relate to - that used Angel guidance, angels I was familiar with and the knowledge and tradition of the old Tarot. I use both Tarot decks and oracle decks to understand my life and others. I am a intuitive psychologist who offers separate readings for those interested. When I heard of this deck, I bought it intrigued. Now I am glad I did and grateful Dr. Virtue and Radleigh Valentine created this loving deck.<br />The Major arcana is comprised of the Archangels; (major events, turning points in our lives)-<br />Magician- Archangel Raziel;<br />High Priestess-Archangel Haniel<br />Empress-Archangel Gabriel<br />Emperor: Archangel Michael<br />Unity-Sandalphon<br />The Lovers-Archangel Raphael<br />The Chariot-Archangel Metatron<br />Justice-Raguel<br />Hermit-Raguel<br />Wheel-Archangel Michael<br />Strength-Archangel Ariel<br />Awakening-Archangel Gabriel<br />Release-Azrael<br />Balance-Archangel Zadkiel<br />Ego- Jophiel<br />Life experience-Lord Chamuel<br />Star-Lord Jophiel<br />Moon-Lord Haniel<br />Sun-Lord Uriel<br />Renewal-Lord Jeremiel<br />World-Lord Michael<br />Minor Arcana: has four suits. Here they are and their categories. Fire- Burgundy and Ideas or inspiration.<br />Water- Teal blue and emotions.<br />Air-  Blue and intellect.<br />Earth- Green and material world, objects issues. Cleverly done and the most helpful thing about this deck is a beginner can use this as it will tell you the situation you find yourself in- how you attracted that card, and what action steps you can  take to make the most loving, joyful, productive, constructive, kind and creative steps possible. Happiness is guaranteed with this deck! When do you ever hear someone saying that?<br />This deck is also great because some people resent and rightly so the tarot crowd for their egotistic, uppity, acting like they know it all, energy that comes from the arrogance of the old tarot terms- like Death, Tower and so forth. Some readers who are con artists use the ignorance of the public to scare them.<br /><br />Readers with a more spiritual practical basis like myself, don't bother and never do that because  I know how arrogant, mean and vindictive it comes across. Rather I use terms like these are some choices based on what is going on in your life. This deck has a loving energy of \\"do your best and surrender your problems to God and we will help. Have faith, you will see.\\" I love that. So all in all, I recommend this deck for angel lovers, tarot lovers with a strong spiritual bent and new beginners and as well as oldies. My only complaint is that the art is so minute in detail, I think they should have done bigger graphics or photos on some cards. The 9 of water is a mermaid - representing wishes come true and has Doreen Virtue's face!ders who are con artists use the ignorance of the public to scare them.<br /><br />Readers with a more spiritual practical basis like myself, don't bother and never do that because  I know how arrogant, mean and vindictive it comes across.

B007SYWFRM|1.0|If I could get the app to open, I'm sure it would be great. But every single time I try to open it, a message pops up saying that it is not responding and I have to force close. I even tried re-downloading the app! Thus is really frustrating, and I expect better from Gameloft
B004O3YGMC|4.0|I just love the fact that I can log in in my PC/MAC using my google credentials not silly random numbers I have to remember like on team viewers and it works great. (I know it is missing some functionality that team viewers has)
B005OZE9SA|4.0|When I unpacked this I downloaded the latest drivers and plug-in's, then plugged in this unit to do a test recording.  I use Sony Sound Forge Pro 10.  With this device and using the default settings of 44.1K @ 16 bits, I get a distorted recording.  Same setting with Audacity and it works great.  Set Sound Forge to 24 bit or higher and it works great, but for some unknown reason it distorts at 16 bit ONLY (so far) with Sound Forge Pro 10.<br /><br />Tech support wanted me to do a ton of changes which I won't do as I've never had a problem using any other USB interface.  BTW, it does the same thing on my laptop as well.<br /><br />Having said that, I've done several hours of recording (at 24 bit or higher) and love this little box.  Plus it's really pretty.  The glow indicators around the input level controls remind me of the old \\"cat-eye\\" VU meter system.  Enjoy!
B000W9DSVW|5.0|Absolutely loved these movies! Bought them so my wife could enjoy them too and she loved them as well. Got the whole trilogy on blue ray, brand new and at a great price!
B007V2UGPE|4.0|i'm hoping there is some way around having to really buy to progress .. but still fun to play otherwise
B007SYWFRM|5.0|very addicting. just don't like the idea of having to buy acorns to purchase items.  seems like they could do away with that idea and add more stuff to obtain by playing it more often.  otherwise it is a cute game.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|lots of fun,  quick play no waiting around for something to happen after the first few levels. how refreshing..!  and you can spend as little as 2 bucks and have alot more fun.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book was very entertaining. It does get a bit annoying with Ana's persistant self esteem issues and nagging but over all the story is very sweet and just hooks you. There is a lot of sex. Personally I got bored with all the hanky panky, but the story was what got me. I have read the complete trilogy and will probly reread it again. I do recomend these books. I would like the author would write this trilogy in Christian's point of view as was started in the last book...Uggg... Such a tease.

B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I am not a huge fan of angry birds, but I decided to download this game for my kids. They love it and it is very user friendly for them. They are 7 and 5. For a free version it gives them plenty of levels and keeps them entertained, which is saying a lot considering their age and attention spans.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a pretty good app assuming you like nintendo graphics on a game, which I for one don't mind. you start out with a handful of games unlocked, but you have to play games to earn points to open up more games (one at a time). playing the same game over and over to open the next game can become tedious. however, the game IS free and gives you hours of play for an awesome value. you ha ve the option to buy more coins to open up games faster, but its not necessary. overall, I say all people who are looking for a game to play should at least try this one.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|Great work that makes you wish you were there. Good sound quality and visuals. If you love Pink Floyd, it has to be part of your collection.
B0059XTUVI|3.0|This film is plotted from a retrospective point of view--from that of Margaret Thatcher as an elderly widow suffering from dementia.  Photographs, music, and TV programs serve to remind the declining old woman of her younger years and her glory days of Prime Minister.  Unfortunately this plotting device devotes too much time to her hallucinations--going through the same sort of imaginings again and again--especially those in which she conjures up the presence of her late husband.  This time would have been better spent on detailing her personal life and work in Parliament and as Prime Minister--or even her younger days as a shopkeepers daughter.  They also would have done well to show her interacting with her friend \\"Ronny\\" Reagan--an aspect of her tenure as PM that seems to have been all but forgotten here.<br /><br />Despite this awkward and tedious retrospective framework, this movie has moments that shine--for which we can thank consummate actress Meryl Streep.  I especially enjoyed the part where she acts on the advice of her political advisers and works to remake herself into someone who the voters can better respond to, and who they could imagine as Prime Minister.  The elocution lessons in which she is taught to speak in the grand way that Brits has come to expect from their leaders is hilarious!
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Add new levels already. I love this game. but have beat it and gotten every achievement. I'm playing it over again now and wish there were new levels, its all the same as last time I played it. which was along time ago. please update.
0307949486|1.0|Ok, I know this is only a drop in the bucket in an ocean of bad reviews, but I must state my piece....forgive me if it's rather free-form, but I really hated this book.<br />Firstly, I must comment on the blurb on the back cover: \\"An Ingmar Bergman movie crossed with Silence of the Lambs\\". That translates two ways... Ingmar Bergman - Swedish and dull. Silence of the Lambs - a serial killer with a torture chamber. That's it. How dare someone even mention Thomas Harris' name in connection with a piece of crap like this.<br />Every point brought up in negative reviews of this is correct - thin characters, nonexistent motivations, meaningless exposition and descriptive passages...literally, nothing happens for 300 pages. NOTHING.<br />I started skimming through this about 200 pages in - and I never skim through a book. But I learned quickly that once it started talking about the \\"hero\\" walking around the town, or sitting in his magazines offices, or talking about his relationship with Erika, or sitting around doing his research, or there were bits about the Vanger family history, it was time to start skimming. None of those elements contribute in ANY way to the narrative. The only two family facts that are relevant is that Gottfried was a sick Nazi and his son Martin was an awkward young boy. That's all. There are so many red herrings and undeveloped threads in the family history, it's aggravating. And amateurish. And to draw another Thomas Harris comparison, in the book \\"Hannibal\\" he manages to squeeze more menace and a sense of corrupt wealth out of the story of the Verger family in a few brief chapters than this schmuck Larrson does in 200 pages...<br />And it's easy to see why the name was changed for Western audiences. Not only was the original title heavy-handed, but it's clear from the beginning that Lisbeth is the ONLY interesting character. That's why she's on the cover of the movie tie-in editions. That's why she dominates the cover art of the 3 Swedish films made from the books (and David Fincher's version), that's why she's made to look like the title character, even though the split between her story and Blomkvist's feels more like a 70-30 one his way. But even she gets tiresome after awhile. Her virulent mistrust of ANYONE she meets gets old quickly, and the references to \\"All the Evil\\" are pretentious. The author is clearly milking this, waiting for the second or third book to explain what \\"All the Evil\\" means, if you care to make it that far. I don't. Lemme guess, Daddy molested her? And no matter how antisocial she is to everyone else, when she meets the \\"hero\\" she warms to him and inexplicably hops into bed with him inside of ten pages...yeah, sure. Larsson's attempts to describe her clothing, habits and outlook seem desperately out of touch. It's like if a Midwest preacher decided all those darn teenagers dressed like goth clones from Hot Topic.<br />Granted I don't know much about Sweden, but it is either a country just emerging from the Suffragette movement, or the author is clearly a misogynist with no understanding of women. And the statistics regarding women and violence sprinkled throughout seem a desperate attempt to provide a thread to this rambling piece of junk.<br />This thing should've been edited with a chainsaw. It's so obviously front-loaded to instill a sense of foreboding about the Vanger family, and none of it pays off. Ever. You get your little twist about Martin 2/3 of the way in, and it just feels like it was shoehorned in there so that thread could be wrapped up and Larsson could now concentrate on the two other plot threads you don't care about and barely remember. Irrelevant characters are given too much space. For instance, Michael goes to see his sister at one point. Her husband is Italian. Facts, names, and brief descriptions are given about his extended family that are at the gathering. Why? None of them even have lines...this is not \\"weaving some tapestry of intricate characters\\". It's padding, people. Pathetic.<br />25 million copies of these books have sold, according to the cover. Probably more by now. That makes me cringe. My copy of this book - which I mercifully bought for $1 at a resale shop - has a mass market sticker from Wally World on the cover. The fact that someone somewhere threw this in their cart with their bacon, milk, and toiletries is a sad statement about our culture. This is why signs of mass consumption are never a good sign of quality. That's why I never read Harry Potter. Or Twilight. Or The Da Vinci Code. Or the Hunger Games. Whenever you go into a bookstore and see a whole table or shelf devoted to a book series, or it's various \\"Illustrated Guides\\", books about the movie version, or knicknacks associated with it, you can guarantee your being hyped.<br />This isn't a book, it's a game of three-card Monty.<br /><br />P.S. - I tried to give the second book a chance and gave up after 200 pages. I read somewhere else that Stieg Larsson originally planned to make a 10 part series but died before he could write more. GOOD!!!! If he hadn't, I might've had to hop a plane to Sweden myself and off the idiot!'s padding, people. Pathetic.<br />25 million copies of these books have sold, according to the cover.

B0018OIK0E|5.0|I had heard from friends that this was a great movie, but after watching another so called \\"good\\" funny zombie movie last week that disappointed me (Zombieland) I was really hesitant. I have become such a \\"Walking Dead\\" fan with all the drama and action I was not sure I wanted the spoof in the mix, but please, folks, this is a good zombie flick. In the first part of the movie, even before people are zombies it is easy to see that most of us go through life in an unemotional zombified haze. Everyone on the bus, in the store, is half asleep or daydreaming with heads bobbing and vacant stares. This movie has the same feel and vibe as Jack Black and his roommate in \\"School of Rock\\". The stars are easily distracted by the everyday issues of life and have to come up with on the spot plans to change certain disasters. This has an impact on each person's ability to fight the zombie hoards. Along the way Shaun loses family and friends and deals with it as only a regular guy could. He is an every man super hero except his costume is a nerdy saleman's white shirt and tie. He grieves the loss of family and friends as he tries to  guide the rest to safety. His actions are ones  a regular person would consider and it creates the potential for all of us to see the sometimes silly and petty actions that govern our day-to-day lives to make it seem as if each day were indeed a crisis. In the end he makes a decision about how his life will end or continue and it quite likely the same that any one of us who is not a regular super action hero would take. Enjoy! I was very pleasantly surprised. It has the British humor of movie classics like \\"The Full Monty\\" and the real zombie gore one would expect of \\"The Walking Dead\\".
B0073Q0DZG|3.0|OK movie love Steve Martin, in most of his movies, this would be an excellent movie for a bird watcher, I know my sister would have loved it!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wonderful story line, characters, and writing!  I LOVE this story about a society duped into living with one set of rules while others kept the true meaning of their existence secret.  If you like science fiction, 1984, post apocalyptic stories, you will love this book.  Very quick reads and I regret reading it so quickly.  I found myself constantly concerned about the characters and thinking about their world.  Many political issues involved with this story and the author does an incredible job of character development.
B005TBN3EU|5.0|Hahahahahahahah, funny movie!! Loved it, not recommended for kids but it was a very funny movie probably liked it better than the first one.

031603441X|5.0|If you're like me you've suffered through more than your share of really awful rock bios. \\"No One Here Gets Out Alive\\"? More like \\"No One Here Gets Out Awake\\". Stephen Davis' \\"Hammer of the Gods\\" reveals nothing of import on Led Zeppelin unless you count Davis' unseemly display of his giant man-crush on Jimmy Page. Then there's Eric Clapton's morose self-absorption, Frank Zappa's prickly political posturing, Dave Crosby's laundry list of sex partners, Warren Zevon's narcissistic insecurity, Motley Crue's general idiocy...and on and on and frigging on. So many musicians, even great ones, seem to be douchebags who both write badly and inspire bad writing. I've never been a huge Stones fan, either. I remember finding them terrifying when I was little, in the early seventies. Later on as a teenager I liked them, but I never went bananas over them the way a lot of my friends did. So I figured I'd dislike this book, or just find it uninteresting.<br /><br />I was, happily, wrong about that. Finally somebody has gotten this right. Keith is honest, witty, and humble but aware of his own significance in a balancing act that he carries out for the duration of the book. And he delivers, he makes a point of touching on all of the important stuff. There's a lot of talk about musicianship and songwriting, and it is conveyed in a way that is completely accessible to non-musicians. Keith's love of his work is evident in the palpable joy he takes in simply talking about it. He recalls growing up in piles of rubble in postwar Britain, his mother was a big jazz fan and the music is what he seems to remember most vividly about the time. This is the binding thread throughout the book; despite the enormity of the material no more than a dozen pages goes by without a lapse into a plainspoken discussion about music, how this album was recorded, how that song was written, self-destructive marathons in the studio. The insight allowed into the mind of the craftsman is unprecedented in this kind of book, and nobody has explained it better.<br /><br />It's also a frankly perfect portrait of a junkie, a subject about which I know a thing or two. \\"Everything revolved around the stuff\\" sums it up in one sentence, repeated many times throughout the middle third of the book. The rationale for starting, the certainty that it'll be a different story for you than for every other dope fiend, the daily grind of dependency, the lost friends, the failed attempts to clean up...yeah, he's been there. It's not like it's new information, but if you're a dope fiend Keith will crawl in your head with his uncomfortably intimate recollection of the state. If you're a clean dope fiend this book will help you stay that way, because it won't remind you of the ride to the bottom so much as the day-to-day pain in the ass of needing a substance to maintain your life. A huge hassle, why do we do it? Keith admits he still doesn't know.<br /><br />By now we've all heard the myths surrounding Keith and he admits that after a point he felt obligated to live up to them, and some of them seem to have been self-fulfilling prophecies. Like the one about snorting a line of his father's cremated remains - he says it happened. But I'm puzzled as to how it happened in 2002 and he didn't cop to it for another four years, when I remember hearing the story as early as around 1982. Had he already heard the erroneous story and decided to make it real? By the time he mentions his daughters with second wife and real lifelong love Patti Hansen, it's evident he's running out of steam a bit, but he still jokingly refers to them (Theodora and Alexandra) as \\"Little T and A\\" adding that \\"they weren't even born when I wrote that song.\\" After all this time Keith admits that where his physical reality ends and his myth begins is often a blurry line. There are plenty of first-time revelations too, like the fact that Keith's record for time logged without sleep is nine days, or that Bobby Goldsboro, a pop singer of especially gloopy sixties and seventies easy-listening hits, taught Keith the secret to a valuable Jimmy Reed lick.<br /><br />He makes a big fanfare of finally revealing once and for all that no, he didn't have his blood \\"changed out\\". I never believed that one anyway; I always thought it was like the gallon of semen in Rod Stewart's stomach, so stupid that it couldn't possibly be true.<br /><br />The women in Keith's life each get a meticulously gracious mention; only with Anita does he really go deeper, into the considerable pain this dazzling, difficult woman caused him during the ten years she was in his life. A life story this huge - how does it fit into his frail, dessicated body? - demands a great love story at its center, and this doesn't disappoint. Keith acknowledges a measure of bitterness towards her unwillingness to pull it together for him and their kids, but in nearly the same breath he defensively points out that his daughter Angela's robust constitution is proof that Anita hadn't used enough \\"stuff\\" to present a harm during her pregnancy. Angela was whisked away to live with Keith's mother as a very young child and grew up quietly in Keith's home town of Dartford; the obvious triumph of nurture over nature seems to fly over Keith's head here. But to his credit he does have son Marlon, a successful, well-adjusted adult despite having a completely dickered upbringing, including a stint on a Stones tour where Keith relied on him so heavily that the child was essentially forced to be the father of the father.<br /><br />The funniest parts of the book are provided by Bobby Keys, the saxophone-playing Texas madman and Keith's best bud for forty years (after being dumped by a French movie star following a whirlwind romance, Keys laments about how he misses the way \\"we'd give each other a little smack on the ass with a syringe\\".) Keith's later jabs at Mick Jagger for attempting to hamstring the band in favor of his own solo career in the eighties mademe laugh out loud too. Wandering in a bookstore he finds a romance book by someone named \\"Brenda Jagger\\" and takes to calling Mick \\"that bitch Brenda\\". Complaining about a mynah bird he briefly owned, Keith grouses, \\"To me it was like living with Mick in the room in a cage, always pursing its beak\\". But at this point it's a familial relationship, and nobody else could hope to get away with a cross word about Mick in front of Keith.<br /><br />Look up some of those other books I mentioned here on Amazon, but don't buy them. Invest in this one and if you're crazy enough to be left unsatisfied, check any of those others out of the library. While they're at your house leave them in the crapper.
B0073U2F12|1.0|All good with the Seller, no problem there. but the movie we watched last night and it sucked, terrible movie, story wise, 3D wise was fine, they just needed to put in more action, actually, our company fell asleep on the couch and it took everything we had to sit thru the movie and watch it awww it was an awful movie!

0345535421|5.0|The sequel to Game of Thrones concerns the war between the Starks of the North, the brothers of Baratheon, and the Lannisters, while overseas the only surviving Targaryen mothers her dragons, and the Nightwatch faces problems beyond the wall. The characters are just as brilliant and fascinating in the sequel, though the plot is much more action-heavy, and therefore a lot less engaging and a lot more predictable. Gone, mostly, is the political intrigue, and the characters seem to stagnate rather than change or evolve (except for that nitwit Theon Greyjoy). A necessary sequel, and one that lives up to the first in keeping the pages turning. Still a wonderful, refreshing addition to the genre. Just, far from exceeds the first book in terms of brilliance or ingenuity. But, can't help loving returning to Martin's brilliant saga. Grade: A-
0345803485|1.0|And free is exactly the price the story was worth. This is Twilight fanfiction with different character names and descriptions. I thought the title and premise were familiar, but wasn't positive until I read the excerpt. Good for the author that she managed to push her fanfic this far, sad for the editorial staff that they didn't fix her lack of geographical knowledge of the Northwestern US, or switch her language to US terminology. The writing is a bit juvenile for the best seller's list, and probably would being in the young adult section if it weren't for the graphic scenes.

B000DZ6VAK|3.0|Sanctified by Tony the Blair, some say the Sound-Bite is a Twentieth Century creation. I argue for an older lineage and assign it to John Keats and his infamous verse: &#34;Beauty is truth, truth beauty.&#34;<br /><br />It's meretricious. Even so, it finds its exemplar in the Uchida/Tate/ECO survey of Mozart's Piano Concertos. True, there's nothing wrong with the recording or orchestral contribution (though I prefer a larger ensemble). Tate is an astute Mozartian.That leaves Auntie Mitsuko at the keyboard.<br /><br />&#34;Beauty is truth, truth beauty.&#34;<br /><br />There are lots of nice touches from Uchida. Lots of them. They're easy on the ear. The soloist muses on her sophistication. But there's more. No, not steak knives - china. Lots of china. Lots and Lots of china - and much of it alarmingly is made in Dresden.<br /><br />&#34;Beauty is truth, truth beauty.&#34;<br /><br />One would have thought these 'centralised readings' on the part of Uchida and Tate would have been lauded by the Magisterium of the Penguin Guide with its espousal of the 'Via Media' but the opposite was the case: they disliked them just as much as yours truly and for the same reasons.<br /><br />Such as it is, this Pollyanna approach is shown up by the likes of Edwin Fischer or Gilels - Isaiahs at the keyboard - or witches such as Clara Haskil or Maria Yudina. Mere perfumery is in short supply.<br /><br />There is no Suez Canal in this domain. You have to go by the Cape. True, the Uchida cycle boasts a magnificent K 482 & K 488 but for works such as K 271, K 413 & K 453 one should call upon the services of Geza Anda ([[ASIN:B00004YZ36 Mozart: The Piano Concertos [Box Set]]]). Gilels is sovereign in K 595 & K 365 ([[ASIN:B00005MJ15 Mozart: Piano Concerto No.27; Concerto For Two Pianos K.365; Schubert: Fantasie D. 940 [Germany]]]). Defiant of time, Edwin Fischer rules the roost in K 453, K 482, K 491 and K 503 ([[ASIN:B0038AMC0K Mozart Piano Concertos: The Complete 78rpm Studio Recordings 1933-47]]. Brendel has strong claims in K 459 ([[ASIN:B004I4HCTG Piano Concertos]]). Zacharias in K 449 is far less self-regarding than Uchida ([[ASIN:B004CJYQHI C 069-46437 CHRISTIAN ZACHARIAS Mozart Piano Concertos]]. Lipatti is supreme in K 467 ([[ASIN:B0009NDKUK Piano Concerto No 21 & 24]]).<br /><br />Let's close with the doomed poet: &#34;There is not a fiercer hell than the failure in a great object.&#34;o Concertos]]).

B0063GORYU|5.0|fun game.  I hardly ever lose. I wish there were a bit more instructions because I had to do a lot of trial and error.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Like others, timers are being set to 90+ hours making the game unplayable. Needs an update. Gameloft really needs to fix this widespread customer issue. More one star ratings should help drive home this point.
0307352145|4.0|I would recommend this book to others. It's an insightful read, and I think people should read it to get a better understanding of introverts vs extroverts. Although it is more of a personal opinion, I think she cited her sources pretty well.
B007JWKLMO|3.0|I loved George, I still do. He was highly intelligent, highly spiritual and was NOT interested in commercial pop music charts. He hated touring. He hated the media. He had a wicked sense of humor. With that said,. I watched this entire documentary and keep thinking \\"where is the candid interviews with stories we have NOT heard?\\" \\"Where is the rare video footage  we have NOT all seen? For the most part this has concert and video clips we have ALL seen. That is fairly inexcusable. The rest of the JAPAN  video concert exists  --put a song or two in. There is video from the 1974 tour ..(we got one song here). There is MORE rare Wilbury's rehearsal footage (OK not the greatest quality..still very rare and would have been welcomed). So I felt theis was lacking in having any truly rare video.<br /><br />As to the interviews --McCartney refused to speak candidly. It is very obvious he was NOT interested in revelaing ANYTHING. He hardly spoke . A few clips. Not much and when pressed about \\"drugs and women\\": he refused to even answer. It is Scorces's JOB to get that rare bit of information or story on George we do not already know. How about an interview with his close friends DYLAN (LOL yeah now I am PUSGHING it--I know). I felt it was a GOOD documentary, certainly not 5 stars.
B0063GORYU|5.0|love playing.....just like on the game on your computer.<br />it even has the three levels like the computer.  I am addicted

B006FE83UE|5.0|It's a staple for every English classroom and one of the most enduring films of its time. This version comes with a great many bells and whistles, like a digital copy and some time capsule-like easter eggs. Very pleased with product and seller.
B00785P2QC|4.0|my kids really seem to like this. a little hard to expand unless you make a purchase of the ticket things.
B0058YPL66|5.0|This is the best show ever. I cannot believe how wonderful the writing is and not to mention all of the actors. If you want to see a show that is all about how far one will go for family and just how far that same family can litterally drive you past all point of reasoning, then this is your show. And on top of that add in constant guessing about what is going on which character and what could possibly happen next. Basically the only things guaranteed in this show is you will love it and you will never think about anything else when you start it. I LOVE this show.  OuO
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Very well done.  Runs great and has all the features I love from my desktop version.  If you've never used Evernote before I highly recommend it.
0345803485|1.0|Ana is an idiot and Christian is a preverted prick but yet I continue to read hoping they become likable and do something besides have sex. It was on the NY Bestsellers list..for crying out loud..how did it get there and what does that say about us?  Any girl who would agree to letting some idiot beat her, sexually demean her, then not allow her to touch him but do all kinds of freakish stuff to her??? Christan is abusive and this story is romantizing it, and making excuses for his behavior.  Please tell me the next book is something more. And if she refers to her inner goddess one more time....please........maybe some of the beatings will  knock out her inner goddess so we don't have to hear it anymore.

B006MGC3VK|5.0|I'm a massive OSI fan. I follow Kevin Moore and buy pretty much anything he's into, so this CD was a preorder, just like all the other albums. Initially it didn't connect, but on repeated listens it sunk in. This is my main thought: give the album time to grow on you.<br /><br />This album differs from previous OSI offerings. For one, there is no outside talent brought in. All previous OSI albums have featured guest musicians, at least for one track. This time it's all in house. Kevin Moore handles keyboards, vocals (writing all lyrics), and programming. Jim Matheos (Fates Warning) does guitar and bass, plus some programming as well. One of my favorite drummers, Gavin Harrison of Porcupine Tree, returns for his second stint as OSI's drummer. In my opinion, he nearly steals the show. I'm guessing this time he was much more involved in the recording. He's actually credited on the instrumental which seems to support my theory. His drumming adds a lot to the overall ambiance of the album. Blood was a bit more of a rocker, much like Free. The initial self-titled album is in my opinion the most progressive sounding, perhaps due to the newness of the band. This one fits nicely into all aspects, though it is (in general) a bit softer and not as rocking.<br /><br />Speaking of ambiance, my only real gripe is Moore's vocals are almost too quiet. This is why I say the band sounds a little more somber, a bit more reserved, but it is a stellar album none the less. The samples are here, though perhaps not as strongly as in previous efforts. I don't think the songs are quite as catchy (not as many \\"hooks\\"), but I do love the tracks.<br /><br />I was hoping for a double-disc option like all the other OSI releases, but sadly this album bucks that trend. None the less, if you're an OSI fan feel confident you'll like this album. If you're new to the band, this might actually make an interesting entry point, though I'd typically suggest their first album to new listeners.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I love this game because anyone can play it. it has a realitively smooth gameplay and its not like you have to keep buying glue credits to survive like other glue games.
0374275637|5.0|As many other readers have already pointed out, this book is a masterpiece and contains nearly all of the latest in research on how humans think. It should be required reading for anyone working in knowledge industries and who make decisions on a regular basis.

0743496736|3.0|Let's face it: we carry our middle-school scars to our graves. It's a jungle in there and, if this author has achieved anything approaching accuracy, the situation is deteriorating in our increasingly coarse and secular society.<br /><br />Three stars represents my compromise rating.  The author deserves full marks for shooting a valuable blip across the nation's collective parental radar. Unlike some of the one-star posters, I cannot quibble with the exaggerated soullessness of the students in the small town of Picoult's creation. Western literature is replete with examples of social messaging packaged, with great effect, into a work of fiction; when an author magnifies the harshness of certain social conditions, we understand and condone the inaccuracy.<br /><br />Picoult creates a world in which EVERY kid -- bar none -- is either heartless and sadistic or utterly spineless in conformity.  I doubt any of us attended a school in which no student was kind or courageous -- in which the nerds and geeks found no port in a storm.  But it is clear that Picoult has deeply researched the psychological and physical realities of bullying, and that this very extreme setting is her device for conveying a victim's sense of helplessness and isolation.<br /><br />But my five-stars for messaging must be averaged with one-star for fiction writing.<br /><br />If you are primarily seeking a well-written work of fiction -- keep looking.  While Picoult's storyline is an effective vehicle for her message -- at least it keeps us reading -- the book, otherwise, is beach-read caliber, at best.  The characters are cardboard cutouts, like stock characters in a musical comedy:  the bully, the beauty, the nerdy guy, the Earth Mother, the professor, the career woman, the good cop.  While the overarching plotline is \\"ripped from the headlines\\"-fresh, the individual episodes are stale and eyerollingly predictable.  Moments of introspection are relentlessly repetitive.  Having poured her passion into a message, Picoult cuts corners in literary craftsmanship.<br /><br />Here's one annoying example: Picoult wants us to like certain characters, to see them as cool and compassionate.  Instead of doing the hard work of developing those characters, she bludgeons us with the awareness that they are affiliated with liberal parties or liberal causes. Never mind that neither politics nor abortion has even the remotest relevance to the storyline or even to the message!<br /><br />**Sigh**.  Picoult is not the only author who employs this mindless device, and it is so gallingly lazy -- dated, too, in an era when the percentage of self-identified conservatives is double that of self-identified liberals.  (And need we mention which ideology is characterized by a higher rate of charitable giving?)  Picoult would be just as current and no less lazy were she simply to have her favored characters wearing white hats.
057809665X|5.0|I grabbed this book after a 5 day Social Engineering workshop and wanted a bit more information about tools used in elicitation and communication. I found \\"It's Not All ABout Me\\" to be a quick informative read without all the unnecessary fluff associated with larger books on similar subjects. A no nonsense approach to communication which instructs the readers through stories and key points Robin introduces in each section of the book.  The best part about the book is that its a quick read which can easily be reread in its entirety to gain newer insights during each iteration. I love books that are clear and concise.  I hope to see more from this author on the subject and similar subjects.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Good game. It has great qualities. The controls can be a little better though. Making the controls better would make it 5 star
B000I9YLUI|5.0|I have enjoyed this movie so very much.  I was able to catch what was said that I did not hear before.  It is a keeper for sure.  A true classic!
B007BRJYF2|2.0|I 'm awake now. Boring game unless you're. into looking for 15 microscopically small white butterflies or teeny tiny orange butterflies. And that's with the zoom on. Also pedantic repetitive instructictions for the mini games. Come on! It's Alice in Wonderland. I expected more. This one goes in the reject bin.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I was pleased to find a new trilogy that sounded like something I would enjoy.  I read about a dozen pages and put it down and don't intend to pick it up again.  I'm just sorry I didn't review it a little better prior to purchasing it.  What a waste of money!
B0063IH60K|4.0|free.  no issues. playing and screen options enough to keep you happy.  Only issue is the add when fifdg starting.  Worth checking out.
B006S08RLU|4.0|I liked this movie. Before renting, I thought it might one of those artsy movies much beyond my grasp or patience, but the movie was light and amusing. I was drawn in by the charm and whimsy of the movie and plot. Audrey Tautou played Amelie perfectly. The movie was warm though not deep. The direction of the film was different and unlike traditional straightforward film yet the plot was there and came through well.<br /><br />I would recommend for those seeking some optimism and ebullience about life and connecting with others.
B003XCVQ3C|5.0|I bought this to use with an HDMI cable to plug into my MacBook pro to use my tv as a either a secondary screen or a mirrored screen. Great for watching streaming movies off Netflix.  Also cheaper than on the apple website where I originally found it.
B006QKKMBA|1.0|I didn't know what \\"final destination\\" was about when I rented it, but I suspected it was one of those dumb movies - the kind with not much plot, cheap thrills, and few surprises. I would have rented it anyways since a friend wanted to see it, but really, the movie was just dumb. A bunch of young people getting bumped off one by one in gruesome and semi-fathomable yet unrealistic ways. Really just an outlet to show blood, gore, and accidental death.<br /><br />Some people enjoy this type of movie, but it wasn't my cup of tea.
B0070Z97LG|1.0|Avoid this title and save money.  I cannot say anything good about it...the storyline was silly and unbelievable, and everything else was subpar.

0345803493|3.0|The first and third books are better... The first is cringe-worthy at parts, but not \\"mommy porn\\" like some would suggest. There just doesn't seem to be a real relationship here. Sure he's screwed up, but all they do to \\"solve\\" problems is have sex... And sure we're suppose to understand why for him and his situations, but not her. It gets annoying, actually, and I liked the other books. I'm totally fine with sex in books, but it's just rediculous how much, and then they talk about how deep their relationship is... 5 weeks into it when they basically ONLY have sex. The first was a quick read and the last had a great fast paced ending that I was excited about. But I am disappointed this book is in between them. The inner goddess stuff is so annoying, too. No one thinks like this in real life. And their e-mails are so lame.. And I hate how she calls him \\"Fifty\\". Christian is a hot name! The words used for the sexy parts is so olddddd. He touched her \\"sex\\"? \\"Behind\\"? And they say the same things over and over, such as how often he has to tell her \\"If anything ever happened to you...\\" or \\"You're all mine\\"... It's kind of a pathetic love story in this one. This isn't a well developed relationship. The other books are soooo much better. I do like this series, but book two was lacking!
0871404133|5.0|A must read for anyone who would like to leave a habitable planet for their children and gradchildren. Wilson addresses complicated issues so they are understandable. This book deserves a Pulitzer Prize.The scientific parts are clear and mesh well with the ethical components.

0792844890|5.0|So,...obviously I love this movie! The only comment I have is the rating (PG) if you are picking this up as a family movie for younger children (maybe under 13 or so), you might want to think twice.  This movie is funny without question, but most of the laughs are sexual innuendo and toilet humor.  The language warrants a strong PG-13 rating (I don't think it deserves an R rating but it should not ne PG!).  Since the PG-13 rating was added in 1984 and Spaceballs was released in 1987 I'm not sure why it got away with a \\"PG\\" rating.  I knew this movie backwards and forwards so I was sure to mute the strong profanity when watching it with my 9yo son.  Have you ever seen a PG movie that drops the \\"F bomb?\\"
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I would suggest this game to anyone who enjoys fun and sometimes a bit of a challenge. It's great so don't even hesitate not to get this epic game.
B0076NAW48|5.0|My first knowledge of Chuck Leavell came from ERIC CLAPTON: UNPLUGGED. Next I found him on the Mike Figgis directed RED, WHITE & BLUES DVD from Martin Scorsese's THE BLUES series on PBS. In both cases, I loved that sort of 'cathouse in New Orleans' feel his music had.<br /><br />Here Mr. Leavell plays homage to the Blues piano pioneers who influenced his playing style. Most of these songs were originally recorded during the stretch from 1920 to the mid '60s. These are all songs that have stood the test of time - first thing these tunes do is entertain.<br /><br />For the people who wrote and first played these for a juke joint audience, if you failed to entertain... you were soon out of a job. So you might say that the steel ribs of these tunes, the melodies and the lyrics, have been tempered in the fire. They stand up because they were well-written in the first place, and the listeners enjoyed what they heard. With Mr. Leavell's respectful treatment here, you will, too.<br /><br />The intros alone have that 'hook' quality that makes you want to hear where these songs are going.<br /><br />Great recording quality and some really solid liner notes put the last of the shine on this wonderful album.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Blues piano, you'll do more that just 'like' this one.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I play on my Iphone but its so hard to draw &amp; small! I love my kindle fire and I am so glad they have this app available now. now I have as much room as my friends with Ipads do.
B004HO6I2E|4.0|I was impressed with the creators for taking an R-rated movie and infusing it within a PG genre. The body swap concept has been beaten to death over the past 25 years, but never has there been one so crass and non kid-friendly. There's nudity, swearing, porno parodies, and poop-in-the-face shots. Things you'd never expect. AWESOME! It's about time! The biggest haters of this film are prudish parents throwing a collective hissy fit because their 7-year-olds saw some boobs. Whose fault is that? As a parent, you should familiarize yourself with MPAA ratings. Any parent who thought this film was going to be as vanilla as the trailer made it out to be should never breed again...ever. As for the humor, it wasn't all frat boy humor. Most of it was smart and witty. The ending was sappy and typical, but I'm glad I took a chance on this one.
0345529057|5.0|My girlfriend recently got me this and A Dance with Dragons (5th book) as a present and i Love it! my first concern was that the font of the paperback books to possibly be too small for my comfort but as I got my hands on it, the font is not a problem to me.<br />I love the box that this set comes in. It has the HBO Game of Thrones characters on the front cover and the back cover and it has a wonderful photograph with the moon over a forst on it's spine.<br />I am loving this series so far (HBO) I can't wait to break open the first book \\"Game of Thrones\\" and read it!
B000JQU1VS|3.0|I've only read two of the stories contained in this book. They are interesting because of the \\"old\\" way they are written. I need to get another book that is just one story as I'm not as interested in short stories as I am in a complete novel. The situations are well described so I can visualize what is going on.
B0072NWKEC|5.0|Philip Kerr author of \\"Prague Fatale\\", is a 56 year old British subject that was born in Edinburgh and writes both fiction and non-fiction novels, most notably the `Bernie Gunther\\" series of thrillers. Kerr also writes children's books under the name of P.B. Kerr. Philip Kerr received a master's degree in law from the University of Birmingham although he was subsequently employed as an advertising copywriter until he became a full time author in 1989.  Philip is married to Jane Thynne, a fellow author, and they live in Wimbledon, London together with their three children.<br /><br />\\"Prague Fatale\\" is a historical based novel narrated in the first person by the fictional character of \\"Bernie Gunther\\".  The writing is straight forward and not complex in its construction.  The composition contains a good deal of names and places associated with Germany and Czechoslovakia during Hitler's rise to power.<br /><br />The novel's main plot involves a murder mystery taking place at the quarters of a high ranking Nazi official, one SS-General Reinhard Heydrich.  Heydrich's adjutant, Captain, Albert Kuttner is assassinated while attending the meeting of high ranking officials hosted by General Heydrich.  The Captain is found dead apparently having been shot, although his second floor room door is locked from the inside and the window secured.  Detective Bernie Gunther is summoned by Heydrich to assume the duties of Heydrich's body guard and to solve the mystery of Captain Kuttner's murder.  In a secondary plot, Bernie Gunther intervenes in the apparent attempted rape of a young woman named Arianne Tauber who he subsequently becomes romantically involved with. The circumstances surrounding Arianne's encounter with her assailant find Bernie investigating his death and that of a foreign worker that are somehow inexplicably joined; the linkage only revealed at the final surprising conclusion.<br /><br />This was a very engaging novel.  The writing was very good and the plot development kept the reader's attention throughout.  The character of Bernie Gunther is at once likeable and encourages the reader to follow along in his pursuit of evidence and ultimately solving the crime.  The historical background was also quite interesting as it delves into the workings of the Nazi hierarchy and personalities of the period.  The novel should be attractive to those who like a well written murder mystery with a historical setting.<br /><br />Of three ratings, \\"Forgettable, Pleasurable-not memorable\\", \\"Memorable\\" I would rate this novel \\"Memorable\\" and recommend you add it to your reading list.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is a high quality game. graphics great. addictive. wish it had more games within it as the one isn't enough.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Fun game. like most game mindless fun. would recfommd like defender game save your gate. played for 30 min straight

0439023483|5.0|Loved this book so much! If you enjoyed the movie then you will love the book (since it is better!)! Don't get turned off if you think this book is for young girls because it isn't. A great fast read for people of all ages and genders. Coudn't put it down!
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Definitely not what I expected which is a great thing. Story unfolds through first person protective as the action happens which lends to an exhilarating reading experience. Very much recommend this trilogy.
0439023491|5.0|Loved Catching Fire! Didn't enjoy it as much as The Hunger Games but still a great book that I couldn't put book. A must own for everyone, no matter the age or gender.
B004SDSSFY|4.0|Excellent for on the go review and edits of docs. Very satisfied. Could use more variety of fonts. Still exploring all its potential but does satisfy all on the go doc needs.
0062060562|1.0|I picked up this book and began reading it, expecting it to be interesting.  Within 30 pages I'd read the same thing over and over again because the main character loses all memory every time she sleeps, and each day is new.  Her only way of getting back any memory is to read a diary she has contributed to daily, to that point.  (The way she knows it even exists is that her doctor calls her to tell her where it is.)  The book itself is written in diary format, dragging you through the same discoveries each entry (chapter) as the character catches up on her life by reading it.  You now have the book's entire content.  I won't divulge the ending as it would be a spoiler, but the wrap-up is too tidy, as though she'd made notes throughout the writing and checked off every discrepancy that needs to be explained, almost in laundry list format.  And the \\"surprise ending\\" is trite beyond description.  The last page can sometimes at least leave you excusing the author to some extent, but this one gives no satisfaction whatsoever, it's as though the school bell rang and the author simply put away her pens and pencils and called it an ending.<br /><br />The very next page reveals that the author had taken a course in fiction writing, and this book was the result. Arg.<br /><br />All that said though, as I often found myself wondering throughout the entire reading why I was continuing to return to the thing for another stretch, for some reason I did; so somehow the author did keep me coming back to it.  I believe, in my case, it was to stick it out, dreary page after dreary page, thinking that somehow it would merit some of the reviews it's received.  Maybe even a spoof that would have a \\"gotcha\\" ending, possibly even an hysterically funny one.  Nope.  That was all there was.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|great game if it was not infested with bugs - constantly resets buildings and animals to 100 hours - I have uninstalled and reinstalled in hopes of it working, but it did not - on my kindle fire
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I absolutely love this game. Thought about giving it 4 stars because I finished it in one night but that's because I seriously couldn't put it down!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|the hunger games is a book that needs to be read. Susan Collins has written it soo amazingly well. this has probably the best book I have read. It is filled with adventure love and suspense and trust me you will never want to put it down.

B007PVHANM|5.0|I have heard and read about the (family-approved) Marley documentary, and as a long time fan of Bob Marley couldn't wait to see this for myself. The movie opened today in Cincinnati, and I was there.<br /><br />Going into \\"Marley\\" (145 min.) I wondered whether this movie would be too long, I mean 2 1/2 hours! My fears were unfounded. The movie brings Bob Marley's life chronologically, and the first half of the movie was the most fascinating for me, seeing the (very) humble beginnings of where Marley grew up, being a son of a white man and a black woman who has a brief fling. Even though I am thoroughly familiar with Marley's music, it was a revelation to see his initial musical beginnings, such as hearing his first song (1962's \\"Judge Not\\", which already documents his social conscience at that early stage). The movie delights non-stop. Other highlights for me were the footage of the 1976 \\"political\\" free concert in Jamaica, done under great pressures. The footage on stage shows utter chaos around Marley as he performs, just unreal. There are many, many other highlights. The last 20 min. of the movie deal with his battle with cancer, showing pictures and footage I had never seen before. I didn't realize that after his last live performance in Pittsburgh (Sept 1980--that performance is out on an excellent 2 CD called \\"Live Forever\\", by which time he was already gravely ill, yet put on a great show), Marley moved to Germany for 6 months in a desparate attempt to fight the disease. He flew to Miami in May, 1981 and died 3 days later.<br /><br />In all, WHAT A MOVIE! Not to be missed by anyone who is a music history buff. I had one chance to see Marley live, when he came to Brussels in 1980 (I grew up in Belgium). My friends and I pondered what to do, we wanted to go but by happenstance, Belgium played the European soccer championship finals that night, surely a once-in-a-lifetime event. We figured we'd catch Marley on his next tour and watched the soccer game on TV. (Belgium lost, and never has advanced to a final since then.) Little did we know Marley would pass away a year later. Meanwhile, \\"Marley\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!lgium lost, and never has advanced to a final since then.) Little did we know Marley would pass away a year later.

B0000019PA|5.0|Though the phrase \\"changing the face of music\\" is thrown around a lot, it's pretty rare that an album that comes out actually does so: not only does something different, but does it loud enough for the entire world to hear it. One could cite albums like Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band for essentially creating Progressive-Rock, or The Dark Side of the Moon for defining it and transforming it from a psychedelic curiosity into an important sub-genre of Rock music. Sure, Abbey Road and Animals are all classic albums whose influence can be seen sporadically throughout the music of other Rock groups, but these albums simply cannot compare to the aforementioned two in terms of innovation and legacy. Though it isn't exactly a record of yesteryear, having been released in 1998, Neutral Milk Hotel's In the Aeroplane Over the Sea is the definition of a modern classic, being entirely unique (something almost every record fails to do) while also speaking to the human heart more passionately and singing to its depths more effectively than even the best of albums. It is a work that any die hard indie musician wishes they had written, as it flies far higher than the genre's best; better than anything written by Radiohead of Modest mouse.<br /><br />Perhaps one of the most notable aspects of the group, especially of its enigmatic frontman, the sweater-sporting Jeff Mangum, is that in the midst of all the Alternative acts simply aiming for gut-wrenching coolness, Neutral Milk Hotel aimed for authenticity to a beautifully horrific musical vision that is, in a wholly non-exaggerated sense, almost completely unlike anything ever conjured up by any other musical entity. There is nothing even remotely normal about this record, almost to the point that talking about the group is a herculean task, from Mangum's nightmarish and warm lyrics to the band's irregular carnival-esque instrumentation and its perplexing cohesiveness, especially with a collection of amazingly wild songs that still manage to strike such a powerful chord in the listener. At the beginning of this musical journey, one is presented a somber, yet sweet acoustic ballad decorated with Mangum's iconic nasally voice that quickly leads into a bizarre ambient build-up of guitars, horns, and musical saws over which he stiflingly belts, \\"I love you, Jesus Christ / Jesus Christ, I love you, yes I do\\". It's not uncommon that exactly at this moment, people give up with the record and immediately switch back to more accessible music, but from sitting through it in its entirety, Mangum finally immerses us in his previously inaccessible and surreal world, finally revealing to us a confusing universe that is just as complex and inexplicable, yet undeniably engaging and memorable as our own.<br /><br />The group's endlessly mystifying leader and songwriter creates this disjointed alternate-reality with the aforementioned eclectic range of instruments, using everything from Jeff's overly distorted acoustic guitar, an extremely fuzzy bass, and a whirring and clipped musical saw to several different kinds of horns, an orchestral bass drum, a warm accordion, and so much more. But even throughout the album, there is variety, as each song is backed with a different and random assortment of wacky instruments, always creating a familiar, yet new soundscape. In the Aeroplane Over the Sea can also be majestically praised for being the best-sounding Lo-Fi album ever produced, as despite its absolute distortion and fuzziness, this seminal work is surprisingly easy on the ears and would probably lose much of its charm if it was actually produced \\"well\\". This is quite uncharacteristic of me, as I am a die hard audiophile, collecting as little of my music in MP3's and as much of it on Vinyl and CD as possible, but there is something about Aeroplane's production that is simply perfect for the music, giving it a charm that few pieces of music share. Mangum's right-hand man and studio-engineer, Robert Schneider, understood one aspect of Lo-Fi production that so many other Lo-Fi bands ignore: Lofi production, despite its moniker, does not need to be bad to be good.<br /><br />Part of In the Aeroplane over the Sea's unique charm lies in the lovely, yet unbearable atmosphere that this production helps to create. Mangum's opus amost sounds as if it comes from a strange universe filled with carnivals, energetic and fuzzy Folk Rock, and what can only be described as weird flying sounds. It's difficult to cite examples of albums that do the same thing, but this almost aesthetically cacophonous album paints images in one's mind; images of a sort-of fantastical Penny Arcade conjure themselves up from the luscious Lo-Fi soundscapes while Mangum's actual songwriting packs this world with every emotion in the human condition. There is something so simple and perfect about each song, despite them all being composed of beginner's guitar chords - you can play every song on this album if you've played guitar for at least a year - that even some of the greatest, most technical albums sometimes can't compare to. What makes them all so perfect is Mangum's passionate, meaningful, and personal attitude to each song. Even on something like \\"Two-Headed Boy\\", which is entirely composed of nothing more than the singer's strained, throaty voice assisting the guitar, a strong feeling is evoked simply from his performance, driving the song forward with a charismatic energy and urgency, conveying a mood that is simultaneously whimsical and urgent, nostalgic and somber. Despite being nothing more than vocals and basic guitar chords, the song sounds special and unique, not quite like any other acoustic-songwriter. Thus, one discovers In the Aeroplane Over the Sea's charm; it has the special ability to convey so many feelings at once, all back dropped by one of the most imaginative worlds ever created and all tied together with a stellar cohesiveness that is sparsely challenged.<br /><br />But it stillwouldn't be what it is without what is possibly its most important trait: Mangum's undeniably beautiful lyrics, which he uses to tie the ribbon around the fantasy world he creates. The record is a surreal concept album about - well, Anne Frank, sex, ovaries, tomatoes and radiowire, and a little boy in Spain playing pianos filled with flames. In other words, its lyrics revolve around a nightmare that rarely makes sense, oftentimes becoming so otherworldly and disturbing as to defy comprehension itself. It's even made more inaccessible to fans as it requires that even to have a somewhat cursory understanding of its meaning, one must know its backstory.<br /><br />Jeff Mangum, the infamously hermetic man that he is, has been known for writing incredibly surreal lyrics based off of recurring night terrors, with some songs becoming so horrific as to simply defy expectations as to what could be thought of by human beings. Thus, his lyrics have always retained a very personal and human feel to them while being incredibly alien and foreign, a fascinating mixture no doubt.  The lyrics to In the Aeroplane Over the Sea would bring all of this to a completely different level, however, being derived from an experience that, while odd, is deeper than anything Jeff had written before: the terrors induced from his reading of The Diary of a Young Girl.<br /><br />Throughout his reading of the book, he was tormented by a series of related night terrors, mostly surrounding a beautiful Jewish family hiding during World War II and the inevitable, tragic events that occurred around them. \\"I wished I could have gone back and saved them with some sort of time machine,\\" he told an interviewer, basically explaining that he began to mourn so much for the constant destruction of this family that all he could imagine trying to do was preventing the awful incident from happening, even claiming that he cried for days after its completion. Certainly, the man might come off as a bit insane as to beaffected by a novel in such an unusually powerful way, but it's more than evident that the album is part of some sort of mesmerizing, esoteric horror that evoked such a strong personal experience that even glimpses of in musical form evoke such strong feelings.<br /><br />The album begins so expertly with \\"King of Carrot Flowers, Pt. 1\\", a simple acoustic ballad over which Mangum recalls his grim, yet peaceful childhood fantasies spent with whom we can assume is Frank (or something analogous to her in Jeff's mind) that, while so surreal, rings so truly to the bittersweet experiences of youth. \\"When you were young, you were the king of carrot flowers / And how you built a tower tumbling through the trees / In holy rattlesnakes that fell all around your feet,\\" re reminisces, telling of a romance between two lovers tragically underscored by stories of their parents' violent discord (\\"And your mom would stick a fork right into Daddy's shoulder / And Dad would throw the garbage all across the floor\\"). Along with his words, his music is sweet, his strange voice somehow smoothing the song out, all while backed by a lovely sounding accordion.<br /><br />But it doesn't last very long, as these innocent recollections are soon cut short by \\"King of Carrot Flowers, Pt. 2\\", beginning with a powerful, droning church organ and a simple arpeggiating Banjo. All of a sudden, Mangum begins unexpectedly shouting, \\"I love you, Jesus Christ! / Jesus Christ, I love you, yes I do!\\". One immediately shuts their mind off, as why Jeff would be saying these things is not immediately clear. Perhaps its meaning is derived from the combination of the ridiculous manner in which he sings (straining his voice and singing ridiculously loudly) combined with the juxtaposition of these lyrics praising the goodness of life to sad recounts of childhood, suggesting an existential, satirical critique of extreme religion. After hearing Mangum reminisce about these bittersweet stories that ultimately end intragedy, hearing one's praise of Jesus' ability to make life wonderful feels somewhat absurd, essentially stating that life is instead rather sad and unfortunate. This belief is even further expanded on a little later on the title track, \\"In the Aeroplane Over the Sea\\" (\\"What a beautiful dream that could flash on the screen / In the blink of an eye and be gone from me\\"), explaining that for all the happiness and beauty in the world, there is even more torment and sadness.<br /><br />The final section of the opening suite, \\"King of Carrot Flowers, Pt. 3\\", is an energetic, yet bleak overview of the life to come, summarizing each of its parts in a very brief, pessimistic tone (\\"Up and over / We go through the wave and undertow / I will float until I learn how to swim / Inside my mother in a garbage bin\\"). Beginning each section of lyrics with \\"Up and over...\\" over the top of incredibly Punky music, he finally goes through to the end of life at breakneck speed, ultimately trying to establish that life is meaningless, short, and tragic. With all the parts of the \\"King of Carrot Flowers\\" suite, Mangum expertly introduces us to his terrible world and its confused and troubling emotion while also preparing us for its undefinable world. Most of all, it allows Mangum the opportunity to take his audience on this bizarre musical journey of his. It's an absolutely perfect way to open the album, and has only been equated to by the likes of Pink Floyd's \\"In the Flesh?\\", which opens The Wall.<br /><br />Though there isn't exactly a linear story line throughout the album's songs, Mangum continues to tell heart-wrenching stories about these fantastical dreams. The title track, a warm psychedelic acoustic ballad with musical saws, brush drums, and trumpets, covers Mangum's musings about how little of the time spent with his Frank-ish lover was spent, yet how beautiful it all was. The following \\"Two-Headed Boy\\" cryptically tells a subtly disturbing, yet wholly affecting tale of a bizarre, robotic two-headed child that never really makes its whole meaning clear, though there seems to be very heavy undertones of alienation from the rest of his family and the paranoia of being Jewish in Nazi Germany. While there isn't any logic to its fractured story, one pieces it together in their minds in all of its tortured, ambiguous glory. This isn't even half of the tale that the album offers, and one of its best traits is that following it along and trying to uncover its possible meanings is such an engrossing and fun experience.<br /><br />But one thing is clear in the midst of the album's idiosyncrasy; Jeff Mangum's life, if the pieces of it we know are true, has not been an easy one, both in and out of his dreams. Perhaps his enigmatic nature is due to that rather than choosing to engage in the world and all of its confusion, he chooses to create a small world for himself that he can control. Yes, all the happy and gleeful parts of In the Aeroplane Over the Sea's world are surreal and nonsensical, and some of its disturbing parts as well, but the most critical aspects of it relate so universally to the most powerful parts of the human condition. Yes, he may be dealing with Anne Frank and Two-Headed Boys that eat radio wire, but with these things, he is able to profoundly explore love, loss, emptiness, sadness, and alienation, all things both Jeff and his audience have dealt with.<br /><br />What makes this album's \\"story\\" so engrossing, in all of its incomprehensibility, is that through all of its otherworldly and alien nature, it manages to be so familiar and human. As we listen to Mangum tell us his deeply personal stories, his pain, happiness, confusion, and complacency slowly begin to win us over and touch our hearts. We've all been in love and wanted to fly our lovers in aeroplanes over the sea, we all have bittersweet childhood days where we were perhaps the king of carrot flowers, we've all had horrible and tragic experiences akin to Jeff's in \\"OhComely\\", and we've all felt alone and terrified like a two-Headed boy. What truly makes Aeroplane so wonderful is that above everything else that it is, it is the story of a man trying and failing to understand a terrible world that is vital for him to understand. It may not be the first time this tale has been told, it has hardly been told  so uniquely and eloquently. It's such a personal story to Jeff, and the fact that he even had some of the elements of its ruptured story in his mind is slightly embarrasing, but his courage to say it to the entire world makes it all even more commendable and beautiful.

Madonna's directorial debut should also be her swan song (bad pun intended!). I wanted a film about Wallis Simpson, instead I saw a film about a boringly abused, trying-to-get-pregnant, woman fantasizing about the Duchess of Windsor. I'm sure this film was meant to be seen on \\"Lifetime\\" television at two o'clock in the morning,and NOT on the \\"big screen!\\" I think I've either found a cure for insomnia, or a reason to relish root canal!

0345803485|4.0|Warning this review comes with a lot of passion and gushing so if you hate the book, this is probably not the review for you. ;)<br />Any who, I loved this story and simply ate it up in a few days. The book is filled with a roller coaster of a romance that I truly loved watching it progress. I've heard a lot people complain that the writing is not good. Is it  like Edgar Allen Poe's brilliant literary style? (Who I Love), No. However, the writing is not nearly as bad as people have stated. My only issue with it was it was kind of repetitive but other than that I thought it was natural and frankly brutally honest. I think we reviewers get caught up in the mechanics of writing a little too much sometimes, shouldn't books be about wonderful storytelling? I give this book and A+ for story telling.<br /><br />Yes, I fell head over heals in love with Mr. Grey. I loved constantly guessing about what his mood was going to be or how he was going to handle a situation. He is a very complex character  and definitely 50 shades of complexity.....and lusciousness. He is a character you want to dream about but not sure if you should... you can't help yourself though.<br /><br />I liked Ana overall, some of her actions were annoying but as a whole, I liked her. I found a lot of her story easy to relate to personally ( so not expounding  on that lol). The inner goddess thoughts were so good, I think a lot of women have this going on in their head, they just don't want to admit. ;) Their email exchanges were fun to read to and kept me glued to the pages.<br /><br />The ending left my craving more. I had to think long & hard before writing this review because as many have said before me it simply leaves you speechless. I mean sure there is a lot of sex (I mean a lot) but all the scenes make sense and I personally never got tired of it (did I just say that out loud)?<br /><br />I would recommend this to Adults only who either like the erotica genre or like me was experimenting it. It is a fine representation that I cant stop talking about. If  your on my twitter or facebook you know I simply  can't stop gushing.<br /><br />I never read a series all the way through ( for fear I'll get bored with it) and to keep up with reviews I always read a book I want to read followed by a book I have to review. After I read my review book, bring on book #2!

B007WZ7ILK|5.0|Already a classic track, \\"That's Why God Made The Radio\\" is the latest recording from none other than The Beach Boys. Recorded and released in honor of their 50th anniversary, this superb song recaptures the spirit and true essence of why this group of California guys still sound so good after 5 decades (and counting)! Long-time members Mike Love, Al Jardine and Bruce Johnston gather together along with original member David Marks and the returning Brian Wilson. Collectively, they sound just as good now as they have ever sounded. No doubt that this song would have worked well for them in any of the previous decades of the 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s. As the preview track from their forthcoming new album of the same title, the song reminds the listener as to why these boys can still produce harmonies that are so special and distinctive. The musical arrangement on this song is a real treat. The group has even produced a new music video for this number: it is a simple, yet straight-forward visual delight that showcases images of the California summer scene, with the lyrics to the song appearing on the screen in a most pleasant visual presentation. The overall feel of the song takes us back to those wonderful days during the sixties when The Beach Boys were dominating the American music scene with their catchy melodies, fun-filled lyrics about the California surf and drag scene, and those legendary musical sounds that have a distinctive style all their own. \\"That's Why God Made The Radio\\" not only holds up well with many of their classic tunes; but, as far as I am concerned, it is now ranked as one their ten best compositions. There is also no doubt that if the other Wilson brothers, Dennis and Carl, were still here, then they most certainly would have added their unique contributions to this song, as well as to the entire album. Nonetheless; what you have here is quite possibly the finest sounding music selection of the 2012 summer season. Kudos to The Beach Boys for presenting us with another musical milestone.ing us with another musical milestone.

The main character starts out being a mouse that pretty well melts into the woodwork, despite his above-average skills in catching computer frauds or hackers.

When people go crazy at being left without ATM machines, banks, access to money -- they develop a mob mentality.  He maintains a cool head.  He discovers he is to be the fall guy and becomes pro-active.  What a ride!<br /><br />Give this author a try.  Yes there are some spelling errors, but not enough to disrupt the reading.  It's well written and provides insight into how a person can change dramatically, due to circumstances beyond his control.

B007DIQB50|3.0|Nobody knows how to polarize a fan base a well as Nicki Minaj does. Somehow, she manages to group all of her fans into two main camps, while retaining both of them, at least for now. There are the old adopters of Nicki (2007 era), who appreciate her hardcore and mixtape-style rap songs, and there are the modern Nicki Fans who listen to her poppy, zany stuff.<br /><br />The title of my review is a lyric that I thing represents Nicki and her style well. It is a reference to the old, old, old novel [[ASIN:1172402876 Trilby]], mainly a character in it named Svengali, who was a pro at hypnotizing people. It has since become a vernacular, idiomatic term (although I bet no one here has read the novel, myself included). But that's really what Nicki is doing with her sophomore effort: teasing her older fans with cool rap and pleasing her new-found fans with some pop tracks. And, this whole time she is managing to convince everyone that she has, at the same time, remained the same Nicki *and* grown into something new... Roman Zolanski, if you will.<br /><br />But Nicki's battling personalities aren't always as entertaining as they think they are, and often times, the reason everyone is here, the music, gets lost in the crossfire.<br /><br />This album is basically split into two halves. If it were a tape, A side would be all rap songs and B side would be comprised of pop anthems. I almost wish it was presented in a two disc format. That would make things less conflicting. But I digress, let us continue.<br /><br />The album starts off with \\"Roman Holiday\\", which Nicki performed at the Grammys. Say what you will about the controversial performance ( I appreciated it, personally, but it was not in everyone's taste), but I do appreciate this song a lot. My title lyric is from it. But the problem is, if you heard the live version, you will be jarred. The recorded track becomes amazing over repeated playings, but initially, it does not stand up to the grammy counterpart.<br /><br />Following \\"Roman Holiday\\" there are a few similar Rap songs: \\"Come on a Cone\\", \\"I Am Your Leader\\", \\"Beez in the Trap\\", and \\"HOV Lane\\" (pronounced /hove/). \\"Come on a Cone\\" is often compared to Pink Friday's Did it On 'Em, and with good reason. It is the usual \\"I'm so great\\" minaj rhymes. \\"I Am Your Leader\\" has a fun hook, but can get a bit contrived at points. \\"Beez in the Trap\\", which just released a music video, is pretty fun, too. \\"HOV Lane\\" has a killer beat and I like to bump to it.<br /><br />Then there's the title track \\"Roman Reloaded\\" which is very mixtape-ey, but Lil Wayne (the featured artist) steals a bit of Nicki's thunder. Its a great song.<br /><br />The Rap half ends with three fantastic tracks, \\"Champion\\", which is comparatively serious to everything else on the CD, \\"Right By My Side\\" with Chris Brown, which is really R&B, and \\"Sex in the Lounge\\" which is fantastic except for the fact that Nicki Minaj isn't really even in it.<br /><br />And now, onto Pop!<br /><br />The Pop arch begins with the previously released \\"Starships\\", which, let's be honest, you should have heard by now. Then, two similar, but awesome, tracks, \\"Pound the Alarm\\" and \\"Whip It\\", which I want to dance to in a club. They are cool followups to Starships.<br /><br />Tracks 13 and 14 are both kind of blunders, to be honest, but I still appreciate them. \\"Automatic\\" seems like it was written for Britney Spears and \\"Beautiful Sinner\\" is just missing... something. Nice effort though.<br /><br />Next comes \\"Marilyn Monroe\\", which is an interesting take on the icon and her personality. I dig it.<br /><br />Then we have \\" Young Forever\\", which is one of the most stand-out tracks on the CD. I really like it. Really Really Really. It's also a \\"serious\\" song, but the loud drum beat and neat melody pull it along.<br /><br />Things go bad though with \\"Fire Burns\\", which is too sad and slow and sappy for my tastes. I kind of wish it wasn't included.<br /><br />Track 18 is called Gun Shot, which I may have listened to once, but honestly could not tell you anything about it. Forgettable and meh.<br /><br />And we end with the other previously released track, \\"Stupid Hoe\\" which bookends the CD with some more Roman rap. I'm okay with this track.<br /><br />The Bonus Tracks are all outstanding. Everyone's probably heard \\"Turn Me On\\" with David Guetta, so it was really just included as a courtesy. But \\"Va Va Voom\\", which was almost the album's lead single instead of \\"Starships\\" is fantastic. DOWNLOAD IT. \\"Masquerade\\" is strangely addicting, too.<br /><br />In whole, the songs are all kind of hit-or-miss. I don't find myself in either the rap camp or the pop camp of Nicki's fanbase, but I admire her attempts in both musical stylings. It's just that this album really lacks focus... which the original [[ASIN:B004BSEKH6 Pink Friday [Explicit]]] did not. Nicki is doing more of the same, but this time, she's no longer fighting to make it with a huge debut album, she's just kind of rapping and dropping beats.

Forgettable and meh.<br /><br />And we end with the other previously released track, \\"Stupid Hoe\\" which bookends the CD with some more Roman rap. I'm okay with this track.<br /><br />The Bonus Tracks are all outstanding. Everyone's probably heard \\"Turn Me On\\" with David Guetta, so it was really just included as a courtesy. But \\"Va Va Voom\\", which was almost the album's lead single instead of \\"Starships\\" is fantastic. DOWNLOAD IT. \\"Masquerade\\" is strangely addicting, too.<br /><br />In whole, the songs are all kind of hit-or-miss. I don't find myself in either the rap camp or the pop camp of Nicki's fanbase, but I admire her attempts in both musical stylings. It's just that this album really lacks focus... which the original [[ASIN:B004BSEKH6 Pink Friday [Explicit]]] did not. Nicki is doing more of the same, but this time, she's no longer fighting to make it with a huge debut album, she's just kind of rapping and dropping beats. Which is fine, but it needs the extra oomph to get it going.<br /><br />BEST SONGS:<br />- Young Forever<br />- Va Va Voom<br />- Right By My Side<br />- Champion<br />- Come on a Cone<br /><br />WORST SONGS:<br />- Automatic<br />- Gun Shot<br />- I Am Your Leader (this isn't \\"bad\\", just not the best\\"

B002MQYOFW|5.0|You wont be disappointed I read all three books in just 4days!!!!! I was hooked ...my family was glad when i finshed...because they were able to talk to me again! lol
0345803485|4.0|...to be an absolute page turner. I first heard about the books, weeks ago...no, months ago. But I could never find the time to actually stop and get the book. THEN when I came across the fun fact that it was originally written as Twilight fanfiction (yes, I am a fan), I said, well, whoa - I got to read this now. I finished \\"50 Shades of Grey\\" in 2 days, \\"50 Shades Darker\\" in 2 more days, and I've just started the third book. I can't put it down, and have found myself choosing a night in reading this over a night out on the town. It's like reading a movie, honestly.<br /><br />I will agree with those that say the book is very amateur-esque. And subsequently, some of the scenes, lines, and descriptions do get very redundant. But I thought the writer brought enough alive through her words, where, again, I found myself reading/watching all at the same time. There were some parts in the book to which I found myself laughing out loud - particularly when she'd refer to her \\"inner goddess\\" and \\"subconcious\\". I think so many people enjoy this book because, yes, it's fantasy. Highly unlikely, unrealistic pure fantasy.<br /><br />If you're buying the book for its erotica, eh, I don't get the big hoopla over that. Author Zane has been writing very descriptive sex scenes for quite some time. They've even turned one or two of her books into a show. Anyway....still, I think the \\"50 Shades\\" trilogy is a great read.
B000FZETIO|5.0|I am a big fan of Pretty In Pink, Bkf Club, 16 Candle's. I didn't even know I had this movie. I was over excited when I found it in my dvd collection and watched it last night. These are three great movies that are a must see.
068987474X|5.0|I read this book prior to the movie being produced. My advice-- if you are dating you need this on your book shelf. I would also suggest, not that you will ever need this book, that you add to your shelf Greg's Breakup book as well...just in case you find yourself in a breakup once he is in to you!!!! #imjustsaying...it can happen!!!

0756407125|5.0|OK, so I was looking for a good book after finishing another series. I used my amazon account as a touchstone and began filtering and reading reviews looking for a recommendation. After reading several reviews for \\"The Name of the Wind,\\" I put it on hold, as several reviews mentioned that the main character, Kvothe, was \\"hard to like,\\" and I wanted an enjoyable read without too much \\"deep thought,\\" involved. Shortly,was in a local bookstore and found a hardcover edition on the clearance rack, so I picked it up. This is by far the best book that I have read in many, many years. My hat is off to Patrick Rothfuss. This story is well told, thought provoking without being \\"weighty,\\" and very enjoyable. For all of these reasons, I went out and bought \\"The Wise Man's Fear\\" immediately upon finishing \\"The Name of the Wind.\\" I am about half way thru it after 3 days, and find myself intentionlly slowing down as to savor the moment. Yes, I think that the book is that good; I don't want the story to end and have to wait for the next book. Now let me say that when you review a main character as being hard to like or sympathize with, I picture Elric the Melnobean. Kvothe is nothing like this. I find him to be extremely sympathetic, and without spoiling the plot, you will find yourself wrapped up in his life and thoughts as you read. Mr.Rothfuss does a fine job of not only painting a compelling picture of the evironment, but of descibing characters in such a way as to make them feel like old friends. So to sum up, if you like well written fantasy genre andare looking for the one book every decade or so that you can really sink your teeth into and love, this is the series that I would recommend.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|takes a while to get points but it is fun more than it looks but still fun so get it if you want
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I can't believe I mussed this book when it first came out. Written in simple, easy to follow language, it captures you from the moment you pick it up and does not let go until you finish. - leaving you wanting more. Very entertaining. Do NOT miss it!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|A wonderful blend of the holy scripture and a highly useful kindle fire application. Love the study programs and the different versions of the bible.
0316069353|3.0|Interesting story, but certainly not his best effort.<br />It's hard to say if Michael Connelly likes Michael Haller or not. In all of his novels where the lawyer is the main character, Haller has been threatened to death, shot or beaten. The same thing happened here, and I'm not spoiling anything by saying it because it's written right on cover 2 that Haller is sent to hospital by two thugs.<br />I know a defense lawyer is living a dangerous life surrounded by dangerous people, but it seems strange that the same man got so much trouble while doing his job. It reminds me Mel Gibson who likes to play beaten-up characters or direct films where violence is changing lives of people. The author has to be careful not pushing it too much if he's ever using this character again.<br />I like the fact that Connelly is trying to use the context and the reality of the foreclosure business to be part of the life of Mickey Haller. I like the fact that he has hired a young lawyer to assist him.<br />I don't like what's he's doing with his personal life. That was the most interesting part of the Lincoln Lawyer: Mickey Haller was a loner, with no family and no life except his work. Now Connelly is using Haller's past the same way he's doing it in Harry Bosch's stories.<br />Maybe it's time for him to bring a new character is his playing field? I know it's hard to do. Even a great storyteller like James Lee Burke is having a hard time to get rid of Dave Robicheaux. Henning Mankell has had the same problem with Kurt Wallander.<br />After reading \\"The Reversal\\", I thought that was is the end for Mickey Haller. Connelly found a new twist to use him again here in \\"The Fifth witness\\". But I think it's time to move ahead now.
B006RED4GA|4.0|This movie made me jump out of my seat. This movie starts out a little slow. But, has some realistic points of views, on ghost and spirits. That a person can relate to, if experienced before like myself. I did wonder, if the writers of this movie. If they got their idea, about the spirit Mary in the hotel. From the same hotel of Chelsea Hotel in New York. Their is such a story about a woman named Mary waiting for her husband at the Chelsea hotel. Only to discover, her new husband was killed in the Titanic of 1912. Of course, this movie was glamourized and left out details. But, it did make me think of the spooky story of the spirt Mary at the Chelsea Hotel.
0670023329|5.0|The story of Shin, who miraculously escaped the worst of North Korea's prison camps is at the same time horrifying, educational, and fascinating.  It was apparent to me after reading the story of Shin's escape, that for every one escapee like Shin who did make it, there were probably 100s who were killed on the attempt.  I have to wonder why the world is essentially ignoring the plight of the hundreds-of-thousands of prisoners who are systematically worked to death by the North Korean regime.  I hear and see more written about the brutality of the Nazi camps in WWII,  sixty+ years ago,  and virtually nothing resembling outrage over the people suffering now.  These are present-day death camps,  have we learned nothing?<br /> The most compelling part of this book is Shin's extreme difficulty in adjusting to freedom once he made it to the United States.  There is no cure for the damage to a human being caused by a sub human existence at the hands of a dictatorial, communist government.<br />  A must read for anyone who feels that they are informed enough to vote in an election.

B00122QC9S|5.0|I'll keep this short, just like the songs. People talk about The Ramones' legacy the same way they talk about Black Sabbath's albums: \\"The First Four\\". Of those first four albums that cemented their legend, their third album \\"Rocket to Russia\\" is the high water mark. It's just a touch less primitive than the first album and it's loaded with more great songs than you can shake a stick at. The fourth, [[ASIN:B00122HV34 Road To Ruin]] is on a par with this one.<br /><br />If you already own a 'best of' like [[ASIN:B000002LDX Ramones Mania]] or one of the collections that have been issued since then, at the very least you'd want to download this album's \\"I Wanna Be Well\\", and [[ASIN:B00122HGSY Bad Brain]] from their next album [[ASIN:B00122HV34 Road To Ruin]]. But if you're more than a casual passer-by, I'd recommend grabbing the first four AND a best of. For the past 35 years tons of bands have copied the Ramones sound, from snotty suburban wanna-be's to screechy guitar pop combos. But the Ramones are the genuine article and \\"Rocket to Russia\\" is still the best.

B0034G4OZO|5.0|This Blu-Ray tells a good story about a teenage boy coming of age. It is funny at times yet dramatic at times as well. The actors in this film do a great job of making it believable. I give the PQ on this Blu-ray 4 stars & the AQ 3.5 stars out of a possible 5. I would and have recommend this film to a friend.
0439023521|5.0|I actually can't believe how quickly I received my book! It was in perfect condition like stated. I'm really pleased with product and promptness and would certainly purchase from this seller again
B000C1YPY4|4.0|I was not familiar with the music of John Legend other than the previews I could listen to on Amazon. But when you can get an SACD for under ten bucks, it is worth taking some risk not knowing what you'll get. What I got was a fantastic SACD for at least the second half of the track list.  Tracks 8-14 are by far the best and if track 15 had been switched with track 6, then there would have been perfect alignment of the first seven tracks being so-so, and the last eight tracks being in a different, and much higher class.<br /><br />Overall the SACD mix is very good.  Like too many SACD's, too much bass is put into the center channel speaker (usually the two side speakers will reproduce better bass) but on this SACD the bass was done in a way that is better than most I've heard that are center channel focused.  Low bass through the sub is perfectly balanced.  While at times I think too much primary sound was coming from the rear speakers. After a few listening sessions I started to enjoy the way the music was mixed. However, personally I feel rear speakers should be used mostly to pick up spacial cues and acoustics of the room and not deliver primary sound sources.<br /><br />It seems to me an intentional decision to save the best for last on this album.  I love all genres of music from classical to jazz to popular music, when done well.  I was not a fan of the first seven tracks of the album with the exception of track 6, Number One.  They mostly seemed to lack real creativity. But starting with track 8, Ordinary People, it was like a light switch had been flicked and from then on every song is a potential Grammy award winner.  My personal favorite is track 9, Stay With You.  I had to play that track three or four times when I first heard it.  Awesome!<br /><br />On certain tracks I had to check the album information because I swore that a song or two had Keb Mo as a guest singer but each time I realized it was in fact simply John Legend at his best.  If Keb Mo's style was a little less Delta Blues and a little more Urban Soul, this is exactly how it would sound.  I cannot think of a greater complement to give the 50 percent of this album that is amazingly good.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Just try it; you will find it so helpful.  I use it for varios projects and it is wonderful.  I also use it for simple things like my shopping list.

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|This Kindle version of The Hunger Games Trilogy has been read by two members of this household, both adults.<br />We agree that, thought somewhat over-written (greater detail than was necessary) we both found it hard to put down once we got started. The characters are well developed and believable. With the exception of a single-product based economy,communities similar to several of those depicted exist in our present day world. Place, architecture, clothing and food descriptions are very vivid and colorful, and the plot is sufficiently riveting to capture and hold the mind and imagination.<br />  Both family members who read the trilogy also attended the currently running movie based on the first book in the series, and found that the movie adhered very closely to the book, a delightful departure from most current cinematic development. The trilogy was well worth the purchase price.
B000JMLFLW|4.0|Okay, just to set this straight, I absolutely love Jane Austen and always have. Pride and Prejudice is by far my favourite novel and I love the movies too, but this kindle edition was killing me.<br />What's with the caps lock where italics should be? I imagined everytime there was a caps Elizabeth would be screaming. It was just irritating.<br />Also, there were a few errors here and there.<br />I recommend buying the paperback or hardcover version of Pride and Prejudice if you really get annoyed by errors like I do, but overall it's still for free, and let's face it, Mr. Darcy in print is good no matter what.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is a very good game and very fun it never gets boring and is always fun and us awesome
B007V2UGPE|2.0|fun to play but it will randomly unupgrade something that youve already spent thousands on. small glitch but makes it annoying because youre strongest unit will be come useless suddenly
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This is one of the only actual defence games for the kindle that I find relatively good. If you like most defence games you'll like this. Only thing that isn't good about it is the fact that you have to buy things after a while
B007PTJOV0|4.0|I have no complaints to make!! This is a creative and fun game- even the free version :) I like the music and how easy it is to control.
B0074EIQUG|5.0|I am a member of the \\"new generation\\" but have been a long-time appreciator of the doctor's work. music like this is a precious rarity in this day and age. Expressive, intimate, celebratory, and gutteral sounds fill your ears and envelop you in emotion. prepare yourself for mindblowing baslines and organ solos. Dr. John worked with Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys on this album, and i must say they are fantastic compliments to eachother's work. The classic Dr. John New Orleans jazziness and soul and tribal percussion is still there but enhanced by auerbach's grind-style music. as far as auerbach goes: this is the album El Camino should have been but wasnt. I cannot wait to share this with my musically uneducated friends and blast this in my car in the 90 degree heat this summer.
0439023513|5.0|I discovered this trilogy through \\"The Hunger Games\\" movie, and found it captivating.  In the \\"young adult\\" fiction genre, it bears strong parallels to John Christopher's [[ASIN:0020425716 Tripods Trilogy (The White Mountains / The City of Gold and Lead / The Pool of Fire)]] from the 1960s, except that here the central character is a girl (a sign of societal progress, I think).<br /><br />I'm surprised by the many reviews that claim this third book was \\"rushed,\\" lacked character development, and had an unsatisfying ending.  Well, Katniss fared better than Joan of Arc, another charismatic female warrior who moved a successful rebellion, but \\"caught fire\\" in a far worse. fatal way.  That's a real-life parallel that many reviewers seem to have missed: At least Katniss survived.<br /><br />Moreover, I don't think the story was ever intended to end on an heroic, \\"happy\\" note. Katniss and Peeta remind me of many of our young men and women returning from Iraq and Afghanistan with deep physical and psychic wounds. The message of this triology is that war exacts a terrible toll on its young participants, and also, I think, that one must be very circumspect about the motives of the leaders who send our youth to fight and kill.  In post-9/11 America, this is very much a story for our time.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|For those in their 60's, as I am, I could only wish I were 30 years younger.  I found this book to be absolutely obsessive.  I could not get enough of Ana and Christian.  They make a remarkable couple and Ana's insight with Christian is right on.  She is addicted to him and he has made her addicted to sex, in all ways shapes and forms.  I would give anything to spend one week with Christian in his Red Room, no holds barred.  I highly recommend this book to all who are open minded and able to accept the author's quirkiness.  Keep up the good work and can't wait to read books 2 and three.
B002L4QP0M|1.0|Well, I just finished the book. It's unmitigated literary crap.  UNexciting and UNinteresting 1960's Cold War so-called \\"drama.\\" It MAY hold some interest to the Brits it was written about and for, but for us Americans, it is highly implausible and a burden to finish. Skip this one!<br /><br />The situations the main character Adam Scott finds himself involved in are so incredible as to be unbelievable...and hence, NOT believable and not realistic. I.E. ... boring to the point of eyebrow-raising. (\\"Are you KIDDING me??!!...That couldn't happen!!)<br /><br />The plot centers on the \\"Alaska Purchase\\" of 1867 by the US from Russia. Apparently, according to this book, the Russkies can buy AK back for ten times the purchase price within 100 years. And the 100 years are about to expire. But it's the Brits who are to \\"save the day, \\" according to Jeffrey Archer. Every story development is so illogical and so far-fetched that any sensible reader will say:  NO! That's ridiculous!<br /><br />So I churned though this completely unbelievable book to the bitter end and said to myself....Thank God, It's done!<br /><br />AND...I did not imagine that I would ever be writing this review as I read it... but I can tell you, Dear Reader....Do NOT waste your time or money on this piece of Cold War nonsense!
1612130283|1.0|This book is absolute and complete garbage in every possible sense. Try to imagine of the smell of a large crate full of month-old eggs in the dumpster behind a questionable greasy spoon diner on a muggy, sticky August morning. With a dead skunk on top. And garbage juice dripping onto the pavement. And a drunk guy urinating onto the whole thing. Now imagine rolling in that dumpster. Naked. That's how this book made me feel.<br /><br />The writing is clunky, repetitive and even more putrid than the legendarily-bad book that inspired the story (Twilight--yes, it is Twilight fanfiction repackaged. That should tell you all you need to know.) Its cliches are eye-rollingly bad. I wrote better Lord of the Rings porn in eighth grade. 1500 pages of explosive orgasms and \\"my inner goddess.\\" That's all \\"50 Shades\\" is. Oh, and the tampon scene, of course. And the pubic hair tugging. The second-hand embarrassment I feel for the \\"author\\" is enough to make me squirm if I dwell too much on it.<br /><br />The main characters are cardboard cutouts whom you'll want to backhand after, oh, twenty pages, and the story itself is not so much \\"BDSM\\" as \\"romanticized domestic abuse.\\" That is NOT okay, and frankly, I find the popularity of the passive, \\"awkward\\" female \\"protagonist\\" and the cold, \\"enigmatic,\\" controlling male \\"love interest\\" genre to be incredibly disturbing. What does that say about our society, that this portrayal of \\"romance\\" is so aspired to? I get BDSM--I do NOT get glorified abuse. It's not sexy, it's misogynistic to the extreme. Don't believe the blithering fools who call this twaddle \\"feminist\\" because it's the furthest thing from it. I could write a dissertation on this sort of thing, seriously.<br /><br />Sexually repressed hausfraus everywhere: you can do better than this pabulum. There is better smut on fanfiction.net if you so badly need to buzz one out.<br /><br />All the snark has already been said, really. Just...for the love of god, don't do it. Turn back before it is too late. If you've already ordered it...may all deities have mercy on what will be left of your soul after you've finished reading. You've been warned.ore it is too late. If you've already ordered it...may all deities have mercy on what will be left of your soul after you've finished reading. You've been warned.
B004JN1D2I|1.0|Extremely confused on the pricing for this E-book, the physical set on Amazon is a full ten dollars cheaper! Those books had to be printed on paper, stored in a warehouse, and shipped throughout the world so I understand paying more for real books in order to recoup the money they incur for actually existing. This is an electronic file and the price should reflect that.
B00377E5SG|4.0|Fast shipping, good service. The only problem is that when I play it on my laptop, there are some noise or interrupts once in a while. But I think this has something to do with my laptop. Overall, good service.Thanks.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|Cameron Mackintosh production for this 25th Anniversary with the talent of Andrew Lloyd Webber is amazing. The longest production on the West End and the Royal Albert Hall as the main scenario is exciting along the video.
1594202842|5.0|As much as I hate to start a review this way:<br />I laughed. I wept. There it is.<br />Another thing I did was reflect - a lot. Chua's memoir raises some valid points, not the least of which is the amount of time the typical Western parent allows his or her child to waste - on things like Facebook and computer games - an act which she believes leaves them unprepared for the future. Another idea is the notion that working very hard consistently for a long time will enable a child to master a skill, and the more skills a child has, the more prepared for a successful life she will be. As the text proceeds in this way, many readers (like myself) might be compelled to ask themselves some difficult questions and come to some rather painful conclusions. I have to admit, the main focus of my parenting was to make sure my children were well cared for, happy, and well behaved. I thought at the time I was being a good mother , yet it didn't occur to me to aim higher than that - as it didn't with my own parents. I have had to learn in adulthood the connection between self-discipline, tenacity and achievement.  There have been many times where I have given up on things too easily  either because I was lazy, or because I believed I wasn't smart or talented enough to accomplish what I set out to do. The \\"virtuous circle\\" philosophy was unknown to us. In her refusal to accept anything less than their best, Chua has given a priceless gift to her children, and after reading this book, I find myself recalibrating my own parenting style. Was she extreme? Perhaps. I was sad when I read that her now deceased mother-in-law just wanted one whole day with each of the girls. There are some moments in life that no amount of accomplishment will ever make up for - and those moments can't be retrieved once they're gone. I also believe that our loved ones are far more important than anything we can accomplish individually. Still, I am happy that Chua shared a slice of her family life in such a way.<br />One thing I found astonishing about many of the reviews I have read is the overlooking of something that stood out to me page after page of this book: humor. Chua's narrative is threaded through with humor - some of it at the Westerner's expense (her diatribe on the institution of the \\"play date\\" is hilarious), but most of it the self deprecating kind. I respect that; it speaks to the author's depth, as did the many themes that run through the book. I will be passing this one along to fellow parents  - both the new and the more \\"seasoned\\" of us, as I believe many of us Westerners have something to learn here.

0439023521|3.0|Before the flame wars start, I just want to make clear that I'm reviewing this book as an adult considering literature for adults (great young-adult literature should be great for all ages). Also, although I am an English Major, I know I don't see everything clearly. Heck, most critics thought Moby-Dick was trash when it was published. So, I'm trying to call it as I see it, but I admit I have my blind spots like anyone. Here goes:<br /><br />Writing Quality: 4/10.<br />Frankly, I was disappointed in the writing quality here. This was my first encounter with Suzanne Collins, but I had higher expectations given the buzz this series has been getting. I'd put her writing in this novel roughly on par with Stephenie Meyer's Twilight. To her credit, she mostly keeps her prose simple, avoiding the worst of the silly frills that Meyer frequently used (smoldering eyes, anyone?). Still, there's no elegance to the simplicity, nothing like what you'd find in Gaiman's The Graveyard Book, and certainly not anything as subtle as what you'd find in Cormac McCarthy's post-apocalyptic masterpiece, The Road. And despite the blessed lack of silly frills, Collins still ends up offering useless details, as when Katniss thinks this bit: \\"Concealed by a clump of bushes, I flatten out on my belly and slide under a two-foot stretch that's been loose for years. There are several other weak points in the fence, but this one is so close to home I almost always enter the woods here.\\" Okay, so the first sentence is fine. But in the next, we're offered little of significance about either the landscape or the character. Does it matter that it's close to home? And does she ever tell us why she might infrequently use gaps elsewhere? These are points that are unconnected to any plot-line. It may seem like a nit-picky example, but I think it highlights Collins' odd choice of using the present-tense, first-person point of view, and how it encourages filler and fluff for the sake of trying to display Katniss' voice. But the greatest distinction I can get from Katniss' voice is her tendency towards pessimism and the way she qualifies over-the-top statements with phrases like \\"My mother was beautiful once, too. Or so they tell me,\\" or \\"He hates me. Or at least distrusts me.\\" Although McCarthy's The Road isn't written using the first person point of view, McCarthy uses a very simple, sometimes even terse prose style that would make a useful comparison to show where Collins doesn't quite rise to the challenge. And if you want some novels that really shine using the first person, take a look at Salinger's Catcher in the Rye or Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, for young-adult comparisons.<br /><br />Depth of Concept: 3/10.<br />A dystopian, post-apocalyptic future isn't exactly an original concept. Long before The Hunger Games we had Fahrenheit 451, Brave New World, and 1984, for instance, all novels that most people read before finishing high school. The Giver is a great example of a similar, award-winning novel that skews even younger than the audience for The Hunger Games. The lottery aspect of the novel seems blatantly lifted from Shirley Jackson's short story The Lottery, and scarce food, game-like fights-to-the-death (Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, anyone?), and body modifications are staples of the genre. Ultimately, Collins' take on the typical set-pieces is enough to get the narrative moving, but doesn't add much that is original to the genre. And in contrast to iconic works like Fahrenheit 451, Brave New World, and 1984, there is no rebellious faction to counter the stupidity of the ruling power, and to serve as the insightful vehicle for the protagonist (and the reader) to observe the problems with the status quo. There is some fairly basic discussion of how oppressive the ruling power is, and how rough it is to be without food, but this story is much more about action than it is about critique, and you never hear of a single character who ever refusedto follow the program concocted by the ruling power of Panem. Collins never talks about it, but the characters must be brainwashed. And when it comes to the action of the novel (two hundred pages of teens tracking and brutally killing each other), there's hardly any moral critique at all. At one point Katniss is enraged that someone has the audacity to kill her ally, but she doesn't think twice about returning the favor. This genre has produced some of the most beloved and award-winning classics of the twentieth (and twenty-first) century, but The Hunger Games is never going to be read in a classroom at any level as one of the better examples.<br /><br />Rounded Characters: 3/10.<br /> A lot of the characters feel like they could be described by about two or three adjectives. Katniss: fierce, protective. Peeta: romantic, loyal. There's very little nuance to the characters, and though I eagerly hoped at one point that Collins was going to offer a \\"triple agent\\" character line to a certain character, he/she ended up being just as obvious as I feared he/she would be (I'm trying not to spoil). If we ever asked, \\"who is this character, deep-down,\\" I don't think we could ever really answer it for Katniss' younger sister Prim, or for her best friend Gale, or her mother, or her mentor Haymitch, and the list goes on. Katniss' internal monologue mostly goes to extremes: he hates me! He said that because he wants to trick me. To kill me! Her monologuing uncertainty is rarely very insightful or subtle, and often feels as though it's just padding until we get to another action point. And while on the surface Katniss seems fierce! protective!, her character is frankly not very interesting, nor does her character seem to change at all or come to any particularly significant insights. She merely endures pain, and comes out on top at the end. And at bizarre times, she's captivated by just how beautiful her stylists can make her, despite the way Collins seems to try to set her up as a character beyond that sort of vanity. I'm inclined to think that the first-person perspective contributed to the surface-level descriptions of characters, and it's too bad, since I think Collins could have done a better job with a more traditional third-person perspective that doesn't rely so much on the voice of the protagonist. Finally, I just gotta say that the \\"romantic\\" moments between Katniss and Peeta were just really obnoxious to me; in moments both when they were faking and when they were sincere, it just didn't feel real or interesting. And it got most irritating when Katniss inexplicably knew exactly what her mentor and the viewers at large wanted her to do in the games, based on the scantest of evidence.<br /><br />Well-Developed World: 5/10.<br /> I wavered between a 4 and a 5 in this category. Collins briefly describes a new North America and the history behind the different districts, but probably the most notable aspects of the \\"world-building\\" comes in the form of realistic knowledge and application of medical facts (highly appropriate in a story where people have a habit of getting axes in their heads or getting blood poisoning from festering wounds). Then we also have the people and animals that Katniss comes across over the course of her journeys. We see \\"mockingjays,\\" birds that were genetically engineered as \\"mutations\\" to be spies and then abandoned to populate the world. We see the difference between the struggling cast-offs living in the vassal-like districts and the richness and eccentricities to be found in the capitol (strangely colored stylists who shave every inch of hair off of Katniss' body; apparent traitors as servants whose tongues have been cut out; flamboyant and ageless TV interviewers with Halloween hair and over-the-top costuming). But we never really get a sense of the average citizen of the capitol, just a few stylists, and we never really get a sense of what the capitol is like, or what any district is like beyond Katniss' own, only a sentence-long description of each. Even in Katniss' district, it's hard to get a sense of what life is like for the average person, and how far Katniss is from an \\"average\\" person. The land is not described very specifically; we know that there are mountains in Katniss' district, but it's hard to tell much else that is distinctive about the geography of Collins' world. Ultimately, though, this story seems to be more about the intensity of teens killing each other than about immersing us in a richly detailed world.<br /><br />Page Turner: 8/10.<br />The novel doesn't start out super fast, but by the time Katniss is chosen as a \\"tribute,\\" about 30 pages in, it picks up the pace.  Katniss trains for the arena for a while, and then once the actual games begin, it's hard to put the book down. The \\"games\\" part probably deserves a 9/10 for pacing. The thing is, I'm not sure how much of my engagement came from a place I'm proud of. The parts that really gripped me were the 200 or so pages in the middle of the novel where teenagers (as young as 12) are doing their darndest to kill each other in some pretty horrible ways. This book brings out the voyeur in me, the part of me that hates myself for checking the news online and immediately clicking on news stories that involve murders, freak decapitation, strange deaths, and sordid crimes. I think the main reason this is such a page-turner for most of the book is the novelty of young people going at each other with swords and spears; it's not because of any great writing or insights. But, whatever it says about me, it still hooked me. The story certainly slows down at the end once there aren't as many kids around to die.<br /><br />Kept Me Thinking: 4/10.<br />More than some (more than Twilight, I think), but I wouldn't really call this a \\"thinking\\" book. It's a book where teenagers train to kill each other, and then kill each other, rarely with any critique about why or whether they should. There's not the nuanced suggestion of depravity held in check by civilization that you'd find in William Golding's The Lord of the Flies, or the brilliant moral ambiguity present in Ursula K. LeGuin's short story, The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas. Katniss' character never really has to make a hard decision or go against what is expected in Panem except for when she takes her sister's place as a tribute, and at a certain point at the end of the games (and even at the end, it turns out to not have been such a hard decision after all). Basically, her character does not question the status-quo of her world, when it seems to desperately need questioning. The most you get is akin to the moment when Katniss' friend Gale says, \\"You know how to kill.\\" \\"Not people,\\" says Katniss. \\"How different can it be, really?\\" says Gale grimly. And that's pretty much Collins' answer. It's not that different, and Katniss doesn't end up thinking overly much about it. Katniss is always concerned about losing sponsors, and never about whether it's okay to kill someone else. That would be okay if Collins was using Katniss' amorality to make some sort of point . . . but it really seems as though Collins sidesteps any chance to use Katniss as a way to indict us for enjoying Katniss' lethality and lack of conscience.<br />___________________________________________________<br /><br />Overall Recommendation: 5/10.<br />Maybe I should have made it a 4. This isn't a bad read, and it had me engaged, except for bits at the beginning and the end. But there are simply so many great options in this genre that I think are far superior intellectually, and not just the ones that are typical school-assigned reading list stuff. Scott Westerfeld, for instance, writes a lot of his young adult novels in post-apocalyptic or dystopian futures, and they are more thoughtful and better written (see Uglies and Peeps). Garth Nix has also produced some interesting twists in this genre (see Shade's Children and Sabriel). Collins' book wouldhave kept me occupied on a plane ride or while I commute, but I think Megan Whalen Turner's description in Publishers Weekly puts it about right when she explains that The Hunger Games is more Death Race 2000 than 1984. And even Death Race 2000 offered some \\"critique\\" in the way it treated violence with such an over-the-top comic tone. I'd really like to hear how fans of the book think it differed from the Stone Cold Steve Austin vehicle, The Condemned. I'm just curious.<br /><br />See my profile web page for an expanded review.Even in Katniss' district, it's hard to get a sense of what life is like for the average person, and how far Katniss is from an \\"average\\" person.

B0076L9W9Q|2.0|I enjoyed their previous album, with a few of the tracks on my \\"favs\\" playlist.  This album falls short with very poor lyrics.  I can't tell you how many times I've not worried about the lyrics in a particular song because the tune, rhythm, bass line, or crunchy guitars totally made up for it, but not this time.  They are most of all immature, sadly.<br /><br />I liked the melodies, the guitars are solid and have a great presence.  Drum work is tight.  Vocal quality is as good as the last album.  I'm a huge fan of female-fronted rock/metal.  HUGE!  But what she is singing just isn't quality.  Look up the lyrics to \\"Here's to Us\\" from your favorite search engine and decide for yourself.<br /><br />There is a little more screaming than in the last album, which doesn't bother me as long as it isn't pervasive.  If you are a first time listener to Halestorm, please give their self-titled album a shot over this one.  Thx.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Without going into depth (many reviews already have) this book was quite a disappointment after the amazing start of the Hunger Games and great follow up of Catching Fire.  The book was slow, didn't grab attention as it was trying to and ultimately had a pretty weak ending as well.
0061785652|4.0|&lt;Spoiler Alert> Plot elements may be discussed. \\"The Devil Colony\\" is a great read that keeps the saga of the Sigma Force going strong. New readers of the series should begin with the first book and follow the character development and team chronology, because this book delves into some of the interpersonal chemistry and past disruptions to team integrity that newbies might find confusing.  As usual, there is an evil plot to destroy the World (literally), and it's up to the brains and brawn of the Sigma team to save the day. For readers not familiar with Sigma, these special agents are not just secret agents, but have been recruited especially for their scientific prowess as well. Mr Rollins has created some inventive and intriguing anthropological implications for history as we know it, and it is all wrapped up in a fast-paced story that keeps the pages turning. There are some writers who have a knack for making words flow that fill your mind so easily with images, and Mr Rollins has that technique. I did withhold one star not so much for a technical reason, but my personal reaction to the human interest elements of the story is that they were a bit overdone. I want my heroes to be near bulletproof, but too much emotion makes them too normal; and while that may have been the objective, I prefer a bit more stoicism. Nonetheless, a very satisfactory read.
0374203032|3.0|As usual, Michael Sandel has written a very readable and highly interesting treatment of a topic. He's already attempted a critique of (small \\"l\\") liberalism [[ASIN:0521567416 Liberalism and the Limits of Justice]] and genetic engineering ([[ASIN:067401927X The Case against Perfection: Ethics in the Age of Genetic Engineering]]). Here, he is trying to articulate why markets, as effective as they are, should not be allowed to infiltrate certain areas of life. Unfortunately, as interesting and engaging as this work is, it is pretty incomplete.<br /><br />First, the good: Sandel has done his research, and it shows most in the examples he uses to illuminate his point. Paying scalpers to get tickets to a \\"free\\" concert on a public stage? Paying kids to get good grades? Paying for votes, or access to a public official? In bringing up cases like these, Sandel tests our moral intuitions about whether certain things just should not be for sale.<br /><br />The two primary arguments he uses in his negative answer to the above question are (a) fairness, and (b) corruption. Paying a scalper for \\"in demand\\" tickets to a free concert (when one could have just stood in line like everyone else) is unfair in the sense that what was supposed to be rationed in a first-come-first-serve way (stand in line, get a ticket while supplies last) now becomes rationed by how much money you have. Paying for votes means that, in effect, political rule-making goes to the highest bidder (rather than everyone having one and only one vote). And corruption? Sandel's argument is that introducing monetary incentives crowds out more \\"genuine\\" or approprite motivations, as in the case of paying a child to get good grades; suddenly, the child sees getting grades as a service that demands remuneration, rather than something that can be intrinsically valuable. Etc.<br /><br />My biggest criticism of the book is that, while I think there is something to be said for these arguments, I think there are other arguments (making a similar case) that are better. First, in some of the cases Sandel mentions (paying for votes, for instance) the biggest objection to \\"marketizing\\" the phenomenon may be that the results will have effects felt by parties who were not part of the transaction. So, when you and I transact in most cases, there may not be anything wrong with this because the effects of the transaction affect only us. But when votes are sold, what results are policies that affect everyone, not just those who bought and sold the vote.<br /><br />In some other cases, I just think Sandel is wrong. When talking about selling grades and the idea that offering money for grades crowds out nobler motivations to get good grades,  Sandel seems to assume that the two options are (a) pay for good grades, and (b) have students get good grades for the right reasons (feeling of achievement, recognition of the value of learning, etc). But, the entire reason we propose paying kids for good grades is that relying on the power of intrinsic and \\"nobler\\" motivations ISN'T WORKING! So, maybe the option is between paying kids for good grades and hoping in vain that our kids get good grades for our \\"nobler\\" reasons all the while watching this hope dashed. So, we can compare the \\"real\\" market with the \\"ideal\\" outcome, or we can compare the \\"real\\" market with the \\"more likely\\" non-market outcome. In the former, markets look dirty. In the latter, they look like the least worst option. (And if you want a more controversial case, look at some of the libertarian arguments for a market in organ donation and adoption and apply the same reasoning.)<br /><br />Taking off from this point, I am somewhat sympathetic to Sandel's argument that monetary incentives might \\"crowd out\\" nobler motives. But this, it should be pointed out, can also be a virtue of markets! Yes, we can bank on people doing good things out of charity, patriotism, sense of community, etc. And I agree that these virtues should be fostered inpeople as much as possible. But, again, markets often develop in certain areas because the \\"nobler\\" motivations are quite thin and just don't do the job. Sandel may have a point by saying that monetary incentives can \\"crowd out\\" nobler ones, but monetary incentives can also induce people who may not have cooperated otherwise to cooperate. At very least, Sandel should have explored the opposite side of this coin, where monetary incentives can actually facilitate cooperation.<br /><br />I still give this book three stars, because I think there are some great points here, and even when I disagree, I think Sandel gives some interesting arguments. The fairness argument is a good one, as many market advocates make market transactions sound like they are primarily between equal players - Richie Rich pays the high price for health insurance while Poor Pete does not; ergo, says the market advocate, Richie Rich must put a higher value on his health than does Poor Pete. Not necessarily, says Sandel. Richie Rich may just have a lot more money to kick around than Poor Pete, which is a HUGE variable in the equation. It may even be that Richie Rich, in spending that huge amount, may only be paying 1% of his income to health insurance, where Poor Pete pays 20% of his income to a cheaper health plan, and that may show that Poor Pete values his health MORE (as a percentage of income) than Richie Rich. Even as the advocate of markets I am, I applaud Sandel for making this very necessary point (as well as he makes it).<br /><br />Anyhow, buy the book and read it. Decide for yourself. I happen to think that Sandel, while interesting, is wrong more than he is right. But Sandel's work is always worth a good read.

This is not classic literature, it's a fun read that excites the senses.  Women love it because it has a psychological element and a lot of hot sex that helps ignite our \\"inner goddess\\" as the author might say.  It has certainly helped add some spice to my already happy marraige and I think that's part of the appeal.  Loved it and thought the story line was well done and unfolded at a nice pace.  Can't wait for the movie!
B005HEKM20|5.0|I thought this episode was very interesting, as you see the alternative aspect of the Enterprise failing their mission in stopping the Xindi.<br /><br />Though it is true like the other reviewer said that it shows what would happen if Captain Archer is taken out of the pitcture (and has been repeated in the show), I see it in another light that it shows how truly ruthless the Xindi are. It isn't the aspect that they just want to defend their homeworld, but want to annihilate a whole species, just because of something that hasn't happened to them yet.<br /><br />Overall, it was a good episode and I wasn't bored of it.
B000059ZIC|5.0|Although there are many good recordings of these works, this set hits the sweet spot for me. Tempos are very well-judged and the music's passion is portrayed very convincingly. Josef Suk plays very expressively with an exquisite vibrato, but also with a somber tone that strikes me as very Brahmsian. Julius Katchen matches him all the way. They are recorded closely and warmly with great  clarity and detail for a 1967 recording. There are other  recordings of this music that I have heard and enjoyed (Szeryng/Rubinstein, Perlman/Ashkenazy, and Mullova/Anderszewski in particular), but this one reaches a bit higher and can be found on my desert island shortlist. For more Suk/Katchen goodness look for their recordings of Brahms's piano trios with Janos Starker, also on Decca.

I can only say that what he says rings true.  I've had the benefit of age and the perspective it gives to recognize why I became immersed in religion from an early age.  It was to please my otherwise distant father, whose only approval came with my adopting his religion.  I agree with Dawkins, that we are products of our upbringing.
B007SSEBCU|5.0|This is a very sympathetic portrayal of a divisive historical figure, but it is a<br />wonderful movie.  Meryl becomes Margret Thatcher in a way that only she can.<br />Realize that for all her political controversy, she was still one of the first<br />respected female leaders in Western civilization and give her some credit for that<br />achievement.  For much of the story Meryl is \\"done up\\" in makeup to make her look<br />80-something (which is amazing), the rest of the story is told through flashbacks.

B0059XTUVI|4.0|Meryl Streep portrays the leading role of one of the most well known politicians of the most pivotal periods in history, the Cold War.  \\"Iron Lady\\" is a moving picture of England's most influential and at times controversial leaders Margaret Thatcher who fittingly inherits the name of being an \\"iron lady\\" with a domineering female presence amidst an environment of male counterparts.  The film depicts her rise as a young politician that weaves within a collage of memories of her personal and professional life.<br /><br />The movie is somewhat of a love play of Thatcher's career but most of all her love for her husband Denis Thatcher (Jim Broadbent) and family, especially her daughter Carole (Olivia Colman) and though not shown within the film except in flashbacks her absent son Matthew.  During the opening scenes of the film, one must orient one's self with what exactly is happening in the kitchen between Thatcher and her husband.  This is a moment in Thatcher's life as well as one of the focal points of the storyline of the film depicting her twilight years.  Director Phylla Lord and Writer Abi Morgan do a good job interplaying the film's storylines of the life of Margaret Thatcher.  There are moments in the film that may take time to understand amidst the history that most know of Thatcher during the Reagan Years and her personal life that only now, unless one has followed every point of her life, the film sheds a light upon.  While watching the film, viewers may think of other biopics that take an extremely intimate approach towards showing the humanistic aspects of almost larger than life figures.  There are qualities of the film that bears similarities to the film \\"Iris\\" or \\"The King's Speech,\\" each depicting notable figures in English history.<br /><br />But what one may come out of watching the film despite parallels with other biopics, it is an interesting movie that takes an unpredictable approach to delving into the life of a woman that made an enormous impact to the world during the most tumultuous times in twentieth century history.  This film is much recommended for the history aficionado or anyone who has the curiosity to understand influential people that have made a difference.act to the world during the most tumultuous times in twentieth century history.

B00445JSX2|4.0|I bought this for my favorite Depeche Mode song Policy Of Truth. This also contains 3 of my other favories :  Personal Jesus, Enjoy the Silence and Precious.  There are 26 songs in all including bonus tracks and is complied on 2 dvd's and 2 cd's.  This  dvd concert is rather good in audio & visual.  The only problem is it lacks close up camera angles as it's mainly shot from the background in the audience displaying the crowds hands and phones taking stage photos.  Too many hands blocking the band.  The bonus 2 cd's are simply the live concert audio and not the studio versions of the songs but still very good.  I am happy with this purchase and it's enjoyable to have playing on and on for a party or just a nice evening of music.  I also like the fact it's got available subtitles in multiple languages.  I would have rated this 5 stars if the visuals had concentrated on the stage/band area more so than long crowd shots and too many silhouttes of hands so I give this 4 stars.  This also has a 12 rating warning : says suitable ONLY for persons of 12 years and over  ( I don't quite see why this would be age restricted as there was no nudity or gore or anything offensive to me at all; but that's what the concert rating states )

B006PTL1GC|3.0|\\"A Dangerous Method\\" is an interesting film which is definitely worth seeing once.  It is a little too long and talky. The portrayals of Freud and Jung are excellent, but Keira Knightley tends to overact (a fact noted by other reviewers).<br /><br />I was annoyed that I had to fast forward through what seemed like an endless amount of Sony Classics promotional junk before I could get to the actual movie. There seemed to be no top level disc menu to bypass this stuff.<br /><br />I sent a letter complaining about this fact to Sony Classics, but naturally they never replied to me.

B002SAUCBC|4.0|I was first introduced to The Long Walk from a friend who shared the same love of The Hunger Games. I wanted a gripping story that made you think about the will to live. With The Long Walk I got so much more then that. Stephen King did a fabulous job telling a story that really digs deep into a teenage boy's (Ray Garraty) brain. I was surprized how spot on his thoughts were. I've never found an author that could capture the complicity of the teenage mind quite like he does. The Long Walk felt like it could almost be real in that sense. I would recommend this book to people with an open mind. If that is not you then you might get bored quickly and not see the point. This story can burrow deep into your brain and remain in your thoughts forever, but only if you let it.

B005COO1X6|4.0|No one can write horror like Stephen King. In Mile 81, he returns to his horror roots, and delivers a truly horrific story that reminds me of some of his earlier work.<br />It's not his best work, but it is still head and shoulders above most horror novels.<br />I was disappointed in the length of the book. It was a little short for the money.

B005GUQIDC|5.0|Kimbra's debut \\"Vows\\" is a different body of work. It's not mainstream and that's perfectly fine by me. I first heard of her when she sang \\"Somebody I Used To Know\\" with Gotye (his album is also divine) and looked her up. I heard she has an album out, so I bought Vows.<br />The result: A well spent $18.<br />And a listen at one of the best New Zealand singers I've heard this generation.<br />Kimbra's voice is so bluesy with a delightful pop sounding cross. Thus, EVERY song on Vows gets 5 stars from me.<br />I adore singers who bring back music of the 20th century and make it modern to this generation's tastes but with a smart twist.<br />Kimbra, Amy Winehouse, Adele, Sia Furler, P!nk, and Portishead are just some of the singers I love who use the technique I mentioned ^<br /><br />Overall, Vows is an A+++++++ album; it has NO competition. It's a beautiful album in itself. Kimbra is so wonderful, yet she's not that well known here in the United States!!! *tries to figure out why*
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire was awesome and hd a lot of twists and turns. I didnt accually read the first book yet but i saw the movie and own all three books. I got the third book a few days after the second book so i jut started the second book. Sorry got off topic. Anyways i loved Catching Fire. At the end of the hunger games i thought katniss really loved peeta and was shocked when i found out she didnt. I didnt excpect them to have to go back into the games agan at the end of the second book. Im about to start part 2 in Mocking Jay and i dont like how she hasnt mentioned peeta that much. I think the second book is the best but i read the last few pages of mocking jay and i know peeta and katniss are going to end up together. Sorry Spoiler Alert.
B0055SWM08|5.0|this game is addictive! Fun challenges that (of course) get progressively harder as you move through the levels. Tough, and challenging, but very doable. if you complete a level in the minimum number of moves (PS you can keep redoing each level if you want) you get coins you can use to unlock hints. the game never asks you to buy anything, btw.  the music sounds like a spa and the sound effects are fun - one of the rare games where I leave the sound on
1597801585|4.0|The story takes place in a futuristic Bangkok or Krung Thep as its called throughout the book, where there is very little oil or coal to power our machines and the city is kept from the rising oceans by a sea wall. It starts off from the point of view of Anderson lake, a calorie man sent on a mission to root out Thailand's precious seed bank. The story unravels as more points of view are given and the reader starts to see the different factions vying for power within Bangkok. Among Mr.Lake's character there is also his assistant/secretary, Hock Seng who used to be a wealthy chinese man before his exile from china. Emiko whom the book is named after, who is a New Person, or someone that was genetically engineered to serve. Jaidee and Kanya who are both members of the environment ministries strong arm law enforcement division called the white shirts.<br /><br /> The story starts off slow at first and about 60% through it really starts to get interesting. What kept me going through the first part were the motivations of the above characters, I was so interested in seeing if anderson ever found what he was after, and hock seng always plotting, and whats up with the windup girl? The motivations eventually lead all the characters as you might have guessed by now to cross paths and influence each others fate. The best way i can describe the way this book reads is comparing it to an episode of law and order, in that not much action takes place but what you really are interested in is the different points of view (especially when they oppose each other, as do some of the characters in this book) and seeing how things play out over the course of the tv show. Thats not to say there arent action bits every now and then but if action packed sci fi is what you want then this is not it. Not to discourage anyone from reading this but i actually put it down about 40% in to read the hunger games series, then came back to it with a greater appetite to finish it.<br /><br /> My advice to anyone that may think its going slow is to just keep reading, its a little more cerebral than most books but i think in the end thats what we're looking for, just a good read. This is that good read, or at least it was for me, i hope it is for you as well.to anyone that may think its going slow is to just keep reading, its a little more cerebral than most books but i think in the end thats what we're looking for, just a good read.

B000ICXQOM|5.0|Well I can say with absolute certainly that I wasn't expecting THIS, haha!<br /><br />Army of Darkness is about a man who gets transported 700 years back to a time when people are fighting with swords and shields, however his arrival isn't initially meant with pleasure and open arms.  Instead it's met with dissension and hostility.  Well what's interesting is that, what at first seems like a typical Indiana Jones type adventure eventually morphs into the WEIRDEST MOVIE EVER!<br /><br />Let me describe what I mean.  The man wants to get back to his present time no matter what, right?  In order to do so he has to walk through a mountain and search for a magical book however... as soon as THIS particular adventure happens, the storyline completely changes into whacked out, psychedelic-influenced oddness.<br /><br />NOW suddenly the man is running from miniature people that are hilarious in their antics to bring the man down (such as shooting tiny cannonballs at his head and jumping inside of his mouth) and later on when the man discovers three books sitting on a pile of rocks, he has to pick the one that has the ability to take him back to his time however... he keeps picking the wrong one, and each book has their own unique set of mind-screwing characteristics.<br /><br />One book for example has a vortex inside of it that tries to suck the man to another dimension, the other book actually lifts in the air and attaches and squeezes onto the mans face.  I have to admit, it was quite freaky watching the segment where the man was running from something BIG but was apparently invisible.  Whatever it was kept splitting the trees in half while running through the woods.  VERY creepy.<br /><br />It's creepy scenes like the ones I mention above that might do more harm to a childs imagination than help, which makes me wonder what kind of audience this movie is intended for.  Oh and the second half of the movie focuses around the man and his newfound friends battling moving skeletons with swords and shields.  Let me tell you something about moving skeletons... THEY CREEP ME OUT!  I've always had a huge fear of skeletons, and their movements in this movie are downright bizarre and trigger what nightmares are made of, haha.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like is that the man was just suddenly THERE at another place and time, with no dramatic or exciting build-up.  Having such a build-up would have allowed viewers to really pull for the guy to escape harm since there'd now be a good reason for him to return back to his time.  Small complaint.<br /><br />Overall, this is definitely an adventure movie with more violence than I went in expecting, but the amount of excitement is overwhelmingly awesome so I believe you should watch it.

B003Q6D2B4|1.0|First of all, take my review here with a grain of salt because Bruce Willis participating in a comedy/adventure is just a disaster/major disappointment waiting to happen.  And so... Red is just that- a waste of my precious time.  I knew this movie was going to be bad when it started- Bruce is calling a woman at work on the phone and for several minutes they talk nonsense about visiting Chili for vacation and other pointless topics.  That kind of writing is beyond pointless- it doesn't belong in ANY movie, let alone this one.  Well it gets worse, MUCH worse.<br /><br />One night Bruce walks into the kitchen and *in the most melodramatic way imaginable* intruders with guns break in and attempt to take Bruce out.  I just assumed Bruce was imagining this entire incident given the lack of suspense... but no.  He responds by putting bullets in a frying pan and having them explode and shoot across the room in an attempt to trick the crazy gunmen.  I admit I DID like how the men were firing literally hundreds of bullets per second at Bruce's house.  I may dislike the guy in these type of films but I don't necessarily hate him *that* much!<br /><br />The film then reveals what it is- a really pathetic, exaggerated, generic adventure/shooter.  Bruce kidnaps the woman he was chatting on the phone with, or rather, breaks into her home.  The suspense was killed here the moment the woman hesitated to feel frightened over Bruce's presence.  What?  The way the two of them communicate wasn't the least bit funny and perfectly indicated what kind of silliness and low budget writing this was going to be... for the next hour and 30 minutes.  It just gets worse from there.  Avoid.

B00026WU64|5.0|Lyrically this is a HUGE step up from Bob's first album.  That's because most, if not all the songs on the Freewheelin' Bob Dylan are originals.  This means Dylan was given the freedom to say whatever he wanted and my oh my does he *ever*, haha.    \\"Blowin' In the Wind\\" is a startling song lyric-wise especially the part about a man turning his head and pretending he just doesn't see.  Dylan's voice gives it personality and makes it the ultimate version.  I've always thought the song got REALLY depressing when the verse melody suddenly stops and the chorus comes in \\"The answer my friend is blowin' in the wind\\".  \\"Girl From the North Country\\" actually contains the SAME amazing vibes that \\"Blowin' In the Wind\\" contains which is amazing in itself because it proves Dylan didn't just luck out by creating much a masterful and legendary tune with the opener.  Such a sad and beautiful atmosphere and vocal melody... a classic.  Both songs.    \\"Masters of War\\" is an *incredibly* impactful song from a lyrical point of view because it reveals the frustration, mental draining and heartache of war.  What makes it so darn special is the fact it came out in the early 60's and points a direct message of anger towards anyone that desires to create war, especially the cowardly politicians that have no problem creating war but hide away behind their walls and desks.  The last verse melody is REALLY FREAKING SHOCKING.  I've never EVER heard Dylan so angry in all my life.  I'm not even going to spoil the lyrics- just *listen* to it for yourself.  I used to think Black Sabbath and Creedence Clearwater Revival had their share of angry anti-war lyrics but this?  THIS takes the cake.    \\"Down the Highway\\" is a unique take on acoustic blues thanks to the way Dylan wails away on his guitar.  You can tell it's an experimental piece and works really well.  \\"Bob Dylan's Blues\\" is a hilarious song about stability and dim-witted women.  Watch out so you don't step on Mr. Dylan!  He's got too many things to say so stand out of his way.  He doesn't need your stinky boots standing over him.  \\"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\\" is amazing for the way the verse melody is soft, ballad-like and acoustic before making the transition to a more concerning and adventurous set of lyrics about wolves, blood dripping from branches, guns and swords, children, travelling, crying clowns, mountains, oceans, dreaded silence and even the executioners hidden faces!  A little bit of everything!    \\"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right\\" has a homemade country vibe that's irresistibly charming.  I LOVE the final verse line \\"I ain't saying you treated me unkind, you could have done better but I don't mind, you just wasted my precious time, don't think twice it's all right\\".  \\"Bob Dylan's Dream\\" is about reflecting on old friendships in addition to questioning the tough decisions he made along the way.  I love the lyrics about believing Dylan and his friend would live forever but... that just isn't a possibility.  Wonderful guitar playing and melody too.  \\"Oxford Town\\" is a tribute to MY town... hooray!  Thanks Bob!  Oh wait, no, there's Oxford's in literally 20 states or more.  Also these lyrics don't really relate to my Oxford either.  Oh well, there goes MY dream.  This is about Mississippi's Oxford apparently.    \\"Talkin' World War III Blues\\" is NOTHING like \\"Masters of War\\".  This is more like a playful upbeat tune with humorous lyrics about Bob walking through town and having many misadventures with the people around.  I LOVE the line \\"I took her by the hand and my heart was thumpin' and she said \\"Hey man are you crazy or something?\\" and also the line in the beginning that Dylan's doctor says \\"I wouldn't worry about it the dreams are all in your head\\".  This line is actually funny for the way Dylan mumbles something incoherent in the middle of singing it.  \\"I was down in the sewer with some little lover, when I peeked out from a manhole cover, wondering who turned the lights on us\\".  I cankeep naming hilarious lines if you'd like!  But nothing NOTHING beats the line \\"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue I needed somebody to talk to, so I called up the operator time just to hear a voice of some kind, when you hear the beep it will be 3'clock, she said that's for over an hour and I hung up\\", LOL!  Then again on repeated listens the line \\"He (the doctor) grabbed my arm I said \\"Ouch\\", as I landed on the psychiatric couch\\" is also really hilarious.    \\"Corrina, Corrina\\" is a pleasant and somber lullaby and nothing more.  I actually really like it.  The guitar playing weaves in a really beautiful and uplifting kind of way.  \\"Honey, Just Allow Me One More Chance\\" is probably goofy filler about Dylan loving any girl that he happens to come across but it's just so much *fun* that I can't help but love it.  \\"I Shall Be Free\\" has funny lyrics about being in a drunken state and escaping a woman that doesn't even remotely appeal to him.  \\"I was high flying, naked, out the window!\\"  That's one aspect of the lyrics- it's probably much deeper than that.  \\"Well I got a woman 5 feet short, she yells and hollers and squeaks and snorts, she tickles my nose pats me on the head, blows me over and kicks me out of bed\\", lol.    I love every single song, and I believe the Freewheelin' Bob Dylan is the best Dylan album from the period of his debut through Another Side of Bob Dylan.  Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited, Blonde on Blonde and John Wesley Harding are probably a tad better, but only a *tad*.  Strongly recommended.

B001E45XT4|1.0|Comfort:<br /><br />Like the title says, I have a large head and wear glasses. These headsets are so unbearable, the clamping force on my head with these headsets just simply hurts my ears and like others have said, this headset are warm when you start wearing them for longer then 20 minutes at a time. And that is kinda hard NOT to do, when you play games and or listen to music. They are heavy on the head as well, you notice them on your head, not a good thing when your trying to game... Some of the worst fitting and sounding headsets I've ever tried. I originally thought MAYBE that stretching these things would help, I tried opening the headset around a small shoe box before sleeping and leaving them on, ( to get some burn in time on them) that did not help what so ever...The clamping force on these cans, what were they thinking? they hurt!!!<br /><br />Sound:<br /><br />The sound on these cans aren't acceptable either. I'm no audiophile, but you would imagine for a closed ear design, you would get some decent sound from them, but not really. The highs are really the only thing decent, mids sound flat and lows are muddy sounding. I listen to all types of music and I've had better sounding cans for the price or at a little bit higher price point. Creative HS-800 Fatal1ty Gaming Headset, is a good example of better headset all around, just do not expect long lasting cans, I had a year with the creative ones until the cord decided to tangle and split. In closing, look else where if you have a large head, take into the fact of other lower star ratings and look else where for your budget gaming needs.

I am always entertained by her books and find myself laughing out loud while reading them at many parts. I would highly recommend this book if you are looking for a good light chick lit type book.
1592402038|3.0|There was nothing overtly bad about this book, but nothing terribly interesting.<br /><br />I have a feeling that this book *really was* meant for British readers (rather than American ones), since a lot of time is spent in American high schools (or at least it was during the time that I went) talking about things like: proper use of quotation marks, how to notate titles, direct objects and so on. A *whole lot* of time. It is only the English/ British who spend take the \\"intuitive approach.\\" But I do believe that most Americans (who paid attention in high school and who read books/ periodicals on a regular basis) have a good feel for the basic rules of punctuation.<br /><br />The actual punctuation rules could have been found in other places without the benefit of the author's witticisms. (But yes, I do appreciate her aggravation about the fact that so many people don't know how to use proper punctuation. NO, the plural IS NOT constructed with an apostrophe.)<br /><br />The whole book took about 3 hours to read through. It was OK to read through one time, but not a book that I care to revisit. I paid $0.01 for it second hand, plus $3.99 for shipping. That price was just about right.

But Wyatt's map shows something entirely different.......As the good Brothers, Marshals and all, march up to the fight 3 abreast of each other, (with the intentions of getting the guns from the group to prevent violence if possible) old Doc stays near the street to the right side, showing he understands spreading out is the best approach, just in case the shooting starts......<br /><br />So according to Wyatt's own map, that walk up together splits up right before both groups are facing each other, with Doc staying off to the right closer to the street.....tactically a great move....after all....Doc didn't come to arrest anyone............he came to protect Wyatt and the Brothers and kill anyone who tried to harm them, or all of them if it came to that......<br /><br />I like it.....Doc you devil you.....you understand how to fight and WIN.....<br /><br />Like M. G Watson \\"Miles Watson\\" wrote in his great review on page 28: Never mess with a man whose motto is: \\"Say when!\\"

0618918248|4.0|This is the first Dawkins book I've read, and the first non-fiction atheist book as well. I would recommend it to others first venturing into the genre: the book is extremely broad and gives a comprehensive overview of multiple facets of religion and morals. Its downfall, then, is that it doesn't go into depth on any one topic in particular, which left me always wanting more. Fortunately, Dawkins recommends other authors in nearly every subchapter, which is another reason The God Delusion is an excellent starting point for \\"beginner\\" atheists or those with questions and doubts.<br /><br />The most disappointing chapter for me was \\"The Roots of Religion.\\" I was expecting much more in the way of neuroscience (what about the \\"God module\\" theory?), or even genetics. Instead, Dawkins focuses on Darwinian evolution (the main thread around which the entire book is woven), psychology, and sociology, all of which are important but don't tell the complete story. My feeling upon finishing the chapter was that Dawkins doesn't have a clear \\"answer\\" on this subject, and I definitely plan to pursue other readings. However, I was especially pleased with \\"Arguments For God's Existence\\" and the subsequent chapter, \\"Why There Almost Certainly is No God.\\" Without delving too far into philosophy, Dawkins articulates how illogical and improbable it is for a personal god or any superhuman/supernatural power to exist. (But, like a good scientist would, he knows better than to assert that he's proven a negative, or to insist anything can be proven beyond a doubt. But, beyond a *reasonable* doubt, absolutely.)<br /><br />I very much appreciate that Dawkins begins his book with an explanation of why religion doesn't deserve any special \\"respect\\" or \\"privileges.\\" He points out that you can argue with someone over political beliefs, or over any kind of personal taste or opinion, but if you disagree with someone's religion, you are still expected to respect it. Actions taken in the name of religion that would otherwise break the law are given special legal privileges, no matter how depraved or degrading to other human beings. To respect all religious beliefs simply because they're religious beliefs is ludicrous, and those beliefs (and their consequent actions) need to be actively questioned and examined, just as any other non-religious belief would be by an intelligent member of society.<br /><br />For those are already convinced, the second half of Dawkin's book is the most important, exploring humanity's roots of morality (hint: they don't come from the Bible), \\"what's wrong with religion?\\", and the psychological abuse of children raised in domineering faiths. It's not enough for atheists to be content with disbelief. Atheists need to raise their consciousness levels and the levels of those around them. Why is it acceptable to call a child \\"a Christian\\" or \\"a Muslim,\\" even though we would never call a child \\"a liberal\\" or \\"a Republican\\"? Children are too young to fully comprehend faith and to be assigned such a label, and they deserve to grow up exposed to multiple \\"truths\\" with the option of forming their own opinions, without being forced to assume their parents' beliefs.<br /><br />Many have accused Dawkins of arrogance. If he is arrogant or presumptuous, it didn't distract me from the purpose of the book, and I would still recommend The God Delusion to atheists, agnostics, recovering Christians/Jews/Muslims, anyone with an interest in science/biology/astronomy, and anyone able to think logically and critically on matters such as religion.

0143120530|5.0|Joshua Foer became so interested in \\"memory athletics\\" as a journalist covering a couple of memory competitions, he decided to give it a shot himself to see what he could learn from it. He wisely studied with European participants, who are more advanced than the Americans. He fully committed to the endeavour, and without giving too much away, he eventually proved to be a formidible competitor himself. Along the way of telling of his transformation from normal forgetful person to master memorizer, he describes some of the fascinating characters in the memory game. He also gives scientific and historical contest, including meeting and describing people on the extremes of memory scale, including Kim Peek, the person upon which the movie Rain Man is based, as well as another person who has almost no memory beyond the present (I forget his name:-)). He also reveals \\"Brain Man\\" Daniel Tammet to probably be a memory athlete duping others to believe he is a savant. Not that Tammet's skills aren't remarkable, just that as with the skills of the other memory athletes, they are more likely the result of rigorous structured practice of mnemomic techniques that date back to antiquity than natural talent. In fact, Foer explains how the techniques employed by memory athletes used to be part of a what constituted a well-rounded intellectual--the ability to memorize and recall vast amounts of information. Gradually with the advent and increased availability of books and more recently the internet, the need and ability to memorize has faded. But Foer argues the techniques (such as storing things in your \\"memory palaces\\") can be learned by anyone and that these skills are more than just party tricks and that they can help one become more fully conscious and aware of life. It is not so much a \\"how to\\" book (although you will pick up a few tips along the way), but more an overview of the history and continuing evolution of memory masters. I highly recommend this book for those interested in an engrossing non-fiction read or just anyone interested in mental self-improvement.

That's why I've been married to my sweetheart for 5 years now. He even told me that I could write a way better book than this, from what I know at my age, and he's older than me too. I dont need a cheapply written \\"erotic\\" book to teach me how to spice up my marriage, my husband can't even keep up with. Gosh I guess 95% of married women are a bunch of prude and don't have an imagination to spice up their own love lives, if they get amaze by this sleazy story.
B005JLN9ZI|4.0|I am a dedicated Drake fan, but I ordered this CD because of my favorite song The Motto.  I did not get not one bonus track.  The Motto is nowhere to be found.

I am certain this is not a deluxe version that was shipped to me.
B007HO392S|3.0|Few could contest that Carrie Underwood, the award-winning and renowned country artist from Checotah, has one of the most powerful voices in country music.  \\"Blown Away\\" is a music realty search.  Underwood finds herself uncomfortably wedged between country-pop tunes and adult contemporary genres.<br /><br />The title track, \\"Blown Away\\", is an interesting one.  While the title track would indicate the vocals are out of this world, the lack of connection and cohesion kept me from being exactly \\"blown away\\".  Other similar songs, such as \\"Good Girl\\", seem to appeal to a younger, less cultured crowd.  Songs like these seem to lack substance and sound strangely immature and misplaced on this album.<br /><br />To counteract these pop tracks, there are several that could form a bridge between this style and modern country.  Some tracks are particularly lovely--\\"See You Again\\", \\"Forever Changed\\", \\"Who Are You\\" could all receive regular rotation on pop/ac radio.  They seem to verge on Martina McBride territory, but they work well for her.  It becomes clear as she soars into a powerful chorus that she has learned to control her voice substantially well with this release.  \\"Wine After Whiskey\\" particularly impressed me.<br /><br />Some fillers remain utterly forgettable, such as \\"Thank God for Hometowns\\" and \\"Nobody Ever Told You\\". The material is redundant and Underwood does nothing to revive them.  Other tracks are difficult to place, such as the dark ballad \\"Two Black Cadillacs\\"--certainly a vocal performance, but unusual and \\"Cupid's Got a Shotgun\\".  Underwood's attempts at traditional country are pleasant, but seem decidingly unauthentic.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is that the album seems to lack cohesion.  While Underwood seems to show artistic integrity on some tracks, others remain boring and forgettable.  She seems to connect best with power ballads in the Pop/AC category while her attempts at country are somewhat forgettable and don't really enhance her appeal.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was an exciting book - so much better than the movie :) The details were not too gorey... I was worried because I wanted my children to read the book before seeing the movie.  They are teenagers and both enjoyed the books and movie too... I would not recommend the book or movie for younger children :/ Consider it a PG13 series.<br /><br />The rest of the series is a great read too. I don't usually read these types of books, but wanted to be sure they were okay for my kids because their class (7th graders) were addicted to them. I really enjoyed it (and I read the other books too)... ENJOY!

044024630X|5.0|Spider-man got bitten by a radioactive spider.  Batman watched his parents get killed.  The Green Lantern got a special ring from an alien.  The great heroes are all supposed to have their origin stories.  In a sense, Lee Child's The Affair is Jack Reacher's origin story.<br /><br />It is the origin story in the sense that it explains how Reacher left his Army position as an MP and became the civilian drifter he is through most of the books.  It is no spoiler to say that Reacher will be out of the military by the end of the book; it is pretty much implied on the first page, and besides, most of the previous books take place after this prequel (which leads right towards events in The Killing Floor, the first in the series).<br /><br />The case that threatens to end Reacher's career is the murder of a civilian woman in a small Mississippi town which serves an Army base.  Since there is a possible link to soldiers, Reacher is assigned to go undercover in the town to scope out the local law enforcement.  The ruse doesn't last long; the sheriff is a former Marine MP and catches on almost immediately; on the plus side, she does offer the possibility of romance for Reacher.<br /><br />It turns out this is not the first killing, only the most high-profile, and Reacher learns that there are political sensitivities involved; the base is run by the son of a U.S. Senator who oversees military appropriations.  Reacher, however, is not one to tread lightly, so it is apparent to the reader where the career threats may be.<br /><br />As always, Child delivers a suspenseful page turner.  As a bonus, this book comes with a short story called \\"Second Son\\" featuring Reacher as a 13-year-old; it's reasonably entertaining, but Child obviously doesn't write kids that well; the teenaged Reacher may be physically smaller (though still big), but he otherwise seems just like the adult character.  The important thing, however, is that The Affair is another great book by Child.

B00628RVV0|5.0|An SS Officer in Berlin receives a promotion and heads for the country to command a death camp. While the name of the death camp is not mentioned, the only death camp with four crematoriums was Auschwitz. His wife, daughter, and son come with him. The house chosen for the Commandant's family is a far stretch from the high society living in Berlin and the  \\"help\\" are Jews imprisoned in a close by camp. At first glance, Bruno, the 8-yr old son calls the camp a farm and proceeds to befriend an 8 yr old Jew named Smule while exploring. Through the electical fence they begin to communicate, both talking about their present environments. Gretl, the daughter, befriends a young SS soldier who brings her Nazi magazines which eventually cover the walls of her bedroom. Both Bruno and Gretl are tutored by an elder teacher who educates them on select German history. It is clear the Commandants wife, Else, just wants a good home for her family. One day the young SS soldier vaguely comments that the smell coming from the nearby Chimneys are Jews burning. Else is sickened by this admission and confronts her husband. Else represents the German polis that had no clue to the final solution and finds herself in a nation and a place she detests. She has ample compassion however to genuinely thank a prisoner who used to be a physician who took care of her son in a fall.<br /><br />The Commandants mother, who vocally did not support the Hitler regime dies in a bombing campaign. The Fuhrer has sent a card of regret which lays on her corpse before being placed in the ground. Else motions to remove the card but her husband moves her hand away swiftly. Meanwhile, Bruno continues to bring food to Smule. One day to Bruno's surprise Smule is in his house cleaning glassware. They greet each other as friends and Smule is offered pastry. The young SS soldier comes in demanding where Smule got the pastry. Bruno did not back up his friend out of fear and Smule pays the price. The next time Bruno saw Smule he had an injury to his eye. To make up for the betrayal Bruno agrees to search for Smule's father who is missing. This event would have to happen quickly as Else persuaded her husband to let her take the children away from the camp. Bruno took a sandwich and headed for the camp. Smule gave Bruno a set of \\"striped pajamas\\" and Bruno came through the fence by digging a hole. The young boys go running thru the camp looking for Smule's father. In the midst of this it starts to rain and a group of men and boys are rounded up and taken to the fake shower room. Bruno and Smule are in this group. They are made to undress and are herded into the gas chamber. The gas chamber door is bolted shut. After about five minutes the verbal quakes are silenced. Meanwhile, Bruno's family searches vociferously in fear and eventually finds Bruno's clothes. Else is inconsolable. The Commandant runs through the camp but comes to the reality that Bruno, his son, was gassed. The Commandant's expression is trance-like as the rain pours down on his clean pressed SS uniform.Smule he had an injury to his eye.

B006HGXGWU|4.0|I can't say enough about the performances in this film. Being from a town like this that has weather like this, i was captivated. Both of these characters could have easily been my neighbors or relatives. My point is this movie not only hits close to home it blows it down with a tornado. Michael Shannon is the Michael Shannon you've been waiting on. He gives it everything and then some. But the real force of nature in the whole movie is Jessica Chastain. Her character is as real as real gets. The pain i see in her eyes i will never forget. What an amazing actress that has been knocking em' outta the park here lately. The Academy Awards is gonna have to pull the fence back after this one.

1594202842|5.0|LOVED LOVED this book.  Great lessons for all of us especially in today's society where more kids are insecure, depressed, selfish and have lost their manners.  I recommend this book for all parents trying to raise the best kids possible.  I loved hearing you doubt yourself but still believing what you were doing was best for the kids. My mother raised me with a sharp tongue and people always wonder why I'm so confidant. What can anyone else say that she hasn't?  I think when you know that your parent is saying harsh words to make you a better person, you accept it, try harder, and what anyone else says negatively to harm you skims off your back. I will take many lessons from this book for my daughter and then tweak them to how I see fit.  Also read Bringing Up Bebe.  Another amazing book!

0385528752|5.0|Leading change is not just about being inspirational--there are hard realities most executives overlook. This is easily the most practical, useful book on leading change that I've ever read.  Key quotes: \\"Big picture, hands-off leadership isn't likely to work in a change situation, because the hardest part of change--the paralyzing part--is precisely in the details ....What looks like resistance is often a lack of clarity...Ambiguity is exhausting ...What looks like a person problem is often a situation problem.\\"  Written with vivid examples, you'll easily remember the lessons of the book after a quick read.

I was a little let down when I have found out that the next book isn´t written yet and it won´t be until Brandon Sanderson finishes the last instalment of The Wheel of Time (though it is a book I vave been waiting for ages). So it could be a year until the second book is out and then we eill have to wait a year at least for each new book up until the 10 and last one. Even so, I am very happy I read it and I highly recommend it. Both for women and men. If anyone can recommend something as good as this, the Wheel of Time and A SOng of Ice and FIre, please let me know.

B005SV9X22|1.0|I'm more of a casual fan of a couple Lady Gaga songs ... I've never seen her live, so this HBO special is as close as I've gotten.  After watching it, I wouldn't bother going to one of her concerts.  She talks WAY too much throughout the show.  A story here and there is ok, often even appreciated.  But Lady Gaga goes on and on and on throughout the show, to the point of making me wish she would just shut up and get on with the concert.  The show itself loses something in the process of over-explaining everything.  I kept thinking, \\"Please, let your songs speak for themselves!\\"  Pop stars, or any creative types, who can simply present their work and get a message across without all the exhaustive talking and explaining have something that Lady Gaga clearly lacks.  I found all the useless chatting a little amateurish.<br /><br />Also, why on earth does she have to scream SO much?  By the third or fourth (or fifth or sixth) time, I was like, really?  The constant pleading for the audience to dance and scream and put their arms (or paws .. haha) up got annoying too.  Again, I think Lady Gaga would greatly benefit by limiting certain aspects of her live performance.<br /><br />I wasn't a fan of her story concept either.  It was a take on the Wizard of Oz, with Gaga and her friends being lost and trying to find the Monster Ball.  It came off as way too silly and cheesy for my tastes. I especially hated it when she had her dancers asking where they were, saying they were lost, etc, etc.  Again, she did this a lot, and it got really annoying in repetition.  Maybe Gaga just isn't appealing to adults - I can see how a 12-yr-old might like this, but it's not for me.<br /><br />All that being said, if you're a fan of her hits, you'll find most of them here, including Just Dance, Paparazzi, Poker Face, Bad Romance, and Born this way.  Some of the costumes are fun too - I especially liked her giant, moving white outfit for So Happy I could Die. It had these interesting wing-likethings that opened and closed, creating a cool image.  Other costumes, like all the see-through rubber, was just cheap looking and pointless.<br /><br />As for the dancing, Lady Gaga should leave that to her backup crew.  Let's face it - the girl doesn't have the moves.  She'd be better off letting her dancers do the cool choreography.  At points, it seemed like she was really struggling, and she just looked awkward next to professional dancers.<br /><br />Overall, it seems Lady Gaga is genuinely trying really hard.  That's the problem with the live show, however - it should flow naturally and not be so forced.
1449389627|5.0|Much of what I thought I knew about innovation was wrong and counterproductive. Berkun looks past the simplistic and superficial stories we tell (\\"Watson come quickly!\\") to reveal the hard work and process behind innovation.  For example: \\"You can say `innovative' as many times as you want, but it won't make you an innovator....I know from my studies, if you are in the room when something that is later called an innovation is being made, the language is always much simpler. Words like problem, solution, goal, experiment and prototype--simple workman-like words--are the language you'll hear.\\"

I made that mistake with Shallow Life and The last Incubus album \\"If not now when?\\" they were both HUGE letdowns and miserable horrible albums that i was dumb enough to order as a pre-release.I will not make that mistake again: I do not like the new whiny sounding lead in the previews and the first album with the new singer was quite frankly, forgettable. So thank you Amazon for saving me money by allowing me to preview the album and find that it's not even close to the older Nightwish that is so good.<br /><br />I just don't feel that her voice denotes the power as Tarja's did in relation to the music. Not a die-hard Tarja fan per say, just as a set I feel Tarja's matches better...Kind of a beauty and the beast match. Extreme power in the beast of the music coupled with the powerful beauty and control of Tarja's voice was perfect.Annette's is just not up to it, off key with a lack of power and control that gets beat up by the monster of the music that Tarja could tame.

B0062OCNAI|2.0|The idea was unusual, a mother and daughter meet in spirit to solve the crime which harmed them.  About halfway through I realized I couldn't keep reading but I did skip ahead as I was interested in the outcome. Not so much in 'whodunit' as in the resolution to the medical conundrum.  Personally I thought the writing too frenetic, overwrought, overwritten and repetitive.  Would have made a great short story as it was an unusual idea I just dont think it needed 400 pages to tell it.  One reviewer said you got used to her telling the story to her husband...  I didn't.  All in all, I just got really tired of the incessent chatter of the protagonist.  Sorry, just wasn't for me.

They offer a realistic dynamic.<br /><br />I was very underwhelmed with the threat of the ghost. Therefore I'd have to say.. tons of erie/moodyness... not enough creepyness!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just finished wool 5 and I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the whole series.  It's very realistic and I loved the whole premise of an underground society.  The author is a great storyteller and his characters are full of reality and life.<br />Originally I had gotten the first 3 books in the series when they were offered for free, but having read the rather too short books for my taste I was hooked and purchased Wool 4, and 5.  I didn't want to leave an individual review for each one so I figured I just would leave one here at the omnibus review spot.<br />  Most likely you won't see Amazon verified purchaser by this review because i didn't purchase this but read each one individually.<br />I'm debating as to whether or not to get the sixth and latest volume due to some of the reviews I've read, but curiosity is taking over, and I'll probably be heading to the chek out stand with the sixth installment in my hand.<br />  What I would like to see is a continuation of the story and find out what happens to Juliette and all the loose ends from the 5th installment.  So Hugh if you're paying attention, I hope you're working on a sequel to the fifth book.  A prequel is nice and I'm looking forward to it, but I'm more interested in what happens after book 5.  ( I take it all back having read the prequel!)<br />Thanks for a great series which I highly recommned!<br />Ok, Hugh it's May the 14th and finally between working on my own book I fnished Wool 6 and I'm glad I did!<br />I enjoyed getting the prequel version to the whole story, and it cleared a lot of things up for me.  My review isn't going to add much to your success because your success is going sky high!  There is talk of a movie in the making and you're making the top paid list on Amazon!  Only in my dreams!  Looking forward to Wool 7!!!
B00766CLMQ|1.0|I would immediately recommend this collection to anyone if it was selling under $20.<br />At this moment in time, this five collection set is going for just under $35.  That would average to around $7 per cd.  Most of these cds are available at used record stores (in LA anyway) for under $4 a piece.  This is a great bargain concept IF the price had been a bargain.<br />Finally, for this non-bargain price, I would have expected that all five albums would have been remastered but they are not, except for True Blue.  True Blue received a remaster in 2000/2001 and that version of the album is included in this collection.  The remaining four albums are not remastered and an album such as \\"Like A Prayer\\" really sticks out like a sore thumb because of it's dated sound quality.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|For the longest time in my life, whenever someone asked me what my favorite sci-fi book was, I'd reply with Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card. It wasn't until I got a Kindle and blindly stumbled upon this series written by a random self-published author that that answer changed. I was on the toilet when the description and insanely high customer reviews caught my eye, and I finished the first novel in that same toilet session. In the following weeks, I was reading this book in small (but frequent) doses. By the time I finished book 3, I was telling all of my friends about how amazing it is and how they all have to read it. Today I was sick and spent the day at home, which gave me time to devour the entirety of book 5 in one sitting. And now I'm here, writing my first ever Amazon review for a book in hopes that one more 5-star rating will help give Hugh Howey the popularity that he deserves. Great plot, great characters, great pacing, great everything.
0439023491|4.0|I loved the first book, The Hunger Games, and knew it would be difficult to top.  I was right.<br /><br />Catching Fire, the second book in the trilogy, has a good plot, but falls a little short of the twists and turns and unpredictably of the first book. Suzanne Collins, though, writes in a way that makes the reader turn the page. Her character development is excellent.<br /><br />Catching Fire is a good read and should be a satisfying second book for The Hunger Games fans.
B00753MBHA|5.0|The other reviews are pointing clearly out why this a 5 star production. What astonishes most is how an aged band which started in the 70's is coming back with such a fresh, high-quality song-writing and this unbelievable level of energy. This power and the charismatic appeal must be offending for many young (pseudo) metal bands leaving them behind, lost in sub-genre limitation and attitude. What Accept is producing these days represents the best of Classic Metal / Power Metal since more than a decade. A must for metal fans of any age and any style preference.
1400069289|5.0|Just finished reading this book. Amazing is an understatement. What made this book very difficult to put down were the style, content, and message it carries - how anyone can transform themselves using the cues provided in the book.<br /><br />Started reading the story of Lisa and skimmed through the other chapters before coming back to the beginning and read it cover to cover. While each part stands very well on its own, it helps to read it in sequence, because the ideas build upon each other. The breakpoints in each chapter provide the right pause to reflect on what you have just read and come back to it a little later when that part of the chapter / story resumes. Very similar to sub-plots in movies. The extensive notes are like the special features in a DVD - they give you a behind the scenes look into the research and homework that went into writing this book.<br /><br />The Lisa Allen story, which the book starts with is very enlightening because of the nature of her transformation and how one can change oneself if there is a true desire, will power, and the right circumstances all working together.<br /><br />While there are many examples like the Febreze story where a product launch does not generate the initial buzz enough to make it successful, and gets transformed when the logistics and the content of the marketing message modified, the household applicability of this product is what makes the story relevant. Who would have thought that a product such as Febreze would take off only after the `message' and the positioning of the product should be used would make it so successful.<br /><br />Analytics, one of my very favorite topics, is why I liked the Target chapter a lot. To think that there is so much customer information out there waiting to be mined, analyzed, and patterns derived from, is beyond mind boggling - it is downright frightening . One has to just imagine the possibilities - almost nothing in the realm of possibilities can be too far fetched - when it comes to how this data can be used to help customers in every stage of their, their loved ones, friends, and acquaintances' lives. At the same time, the privacy concerns are very real, and with the exponential rise of the social media organizations, those concerns take on a very different perspective. Two sides of the same coin.<br /><br />Other stories that resonated with me were on Alcoa and Starbucks. Alcoa because of the `household' (in stock market parlance) name it has become when it is earnings announcements season, and Starbucks for their omnipotent presence. To think that training has the potential to mould employees responses in such a programmed fashion is truly remarkable - and to be able to handle any amount of traffic. Provides an insight into how to handle any volume of traffic.<br /><br />The appendix is what the makes the book one of its kind because it lays out the step-by-step process of how to use the teachings in the book to make a difference in your own life. As with some of the other books that I have reviewed, it was this chapter that makes the book very valuable for me, and for anyone else who is motivated enough to consider reinventing themselves into the vision they desire for themselves.- when it comes to how this data can be used to help customers in every stage of their, their loved ones, friends, and acquaintances' lives.

It is very organized with all the minifigs and sorts Them by the movie,the clone wars Tv show,and extended universe. I also love the Han Solo minifigure the book came with and I also have the visual dictionary that came with the Luke Skywalker minifigure so that fits in my collection.( I heard there is going to by a princess leia of those). Overall I love this book because of its highly detailed upclose pictures and other nice details about the minifig the info box with the set, set #varaintsband other stuff. For each minifig there is a fun fact about the figure. This book deserves 5000000000000000000000 stars but the most u can put is 5 this is an awesome book!!!!!!!!!! So buy this book foos!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|The game is great, and I encourage you to get it, but let me explain some thing first. We'll start with the bad news. First of all, what you do in the game is limited by a certain number of stamina points which can be purchased with the use of in-game dollar bills. The bills can also be used to purchase other things such as an axe, cute little bunny rabbits, and a whole bunch of stuff. Anyways, stamina pretty much is one point for every bill you spend.<br />  Well, you start of with fifteen dollar bills, which will be gone soon because you spent them on stamina points that ran out too quickly. Then, you use those stamina points. This is where the problem is. If you want more stamina points and not wait an hour or two for them to refill you'll have to use money (the real kind) to buy them.<br />  I know, I know they have to make some money off their games, but the way they set this up is really a rip off.<br />  Okay, now that I got that out of me, let's talk about some good things. THE GAME IS AWESOME!!! It starts off as you being a settler who has just made your journey on the Oregon trail. When your brother Jimbo dies you have to create a city on your own, without the supplies Jimbo was to bring back before he died. Now you have all this land and a few thousand dollars. Time to build a city!!<br />  So, if you have a few dollars to spend or you're fine just being patient and waiting for stamina to refill, I would seriously suggest getting this great game.<br />  - GamerGirl
0062082353|1.0|This book was not particularly well written. There were numerous poorly constructed phrases. I read it out of interest in the subject matter but would never recommend the book. It was laced with repetitions of the worst expressions of profanity. Chris Kyle seems totally unfulfilled unless he is killing the enemy or beating up his \\"friends\\". He talks much about binges with alcohol, his love of tobacco, and watching porn movies. I don't see how his wife or parents could bear to read after him. Mr Kyle appears to be a deluded man who is to be pitied in many ways. We can appreciate what he did to protect others and how he mastered his skill and sacrificed so much. But profane, abusive, out of control foul mouths should never be heroes to anyone. I haven't read any other reviews before writing this nor do I often write reviews. Decency demands that we have a revulsion for people who speak of a perverted sense of faith while reveling in ungodly behavior of every sort. Sincere Christians can relax. Heaven will not be populated with wickedness nor the souls of people who try to glorify it, regardless of how vocally they express their confidence in hope based on their beliefs.

0393088774|5.0|This is an excellent book.  Paul Krugman is very good at distilling complex economic principles into simple stories.  His basic message is that we are in a depression, but the pain is self-inflicted and fixable if policymakers embrace sound economics and summon the courage to act.  His diagnosis of the problem is that the US economy is laden with debt and caught in a liquidity trap where monetary easing has stopped working because interest rates are near zero.  In this situation, no matter how much the fed increases the monetary base, there is little credit creation because there is little incentive to lend.  The solution is fiscal policy (government spending to make up for the lack of household demand), moderate inflation targeting to ease the debt burden, and currency devaluation.  This will not result in runaway inflation when growth is still weak and unemployment high.  These points are lucidly argued and supported by economic reasoning and historical parallels, and the book is worth a read for his clear, compelling explanations alone.<br /><br />Compared to his previous book, the return of depression economics, this one is much more immediately relevant to the current 2008-2012 period.  He explores similar themes in both books, and his tone in this book is of increasing frustration that the US is undergoing unnecessary economic pain when solutions are available.  He particularly condemns 1) prominent conservative economists (who ought to know better) who preach counterproductive doctrines of fiscal tightening and debt reduction which would stifle any nascent recovery, and 2) politicians who lack the courage and resolve to take action in the magnitude necessary to end the depression.<br /><br />Personally, I share Mr. Krugman's frustration and believe his diagnosis is correct and proposed solutions workable.  However, if prominent economists can misunderstand the implications of a liquidity trap and depression economics, I have little hope that the average person or average policymaker can do so without significant education.  There's also the problem of figuring out whose argument to believe when many economists make contradictory arguments, and it's not clear that most people will come out on Mr. Krugman's side when his solutions result in reduced pain across the board.  There seems to be a general feeling that the people who over-consumed, over-borrowed, and over-indulged during the boom should be punished somehow through economic distress, and that the US somehow deserves a deep and painful recession after a period of excess.  It's this self-flagellation that Mr. Krugman believe is senseless, and I hope more people read this book and realize the same.

0374203032|5.0|In this fairly short book, Sandel brings back some sanity to a world that, at times, seems to have sold its soul to 'The Market'.<br /><br />It is not a rant or a polemic. It is a careful and thoughtful analysis of the encroachment of economics, market ideas and commodification into areas previous considered to be parts of an ethical and public realm.<br /><br />As in his previous book, '[[ASIN:0374532508 Justice]]', Sandel fills the pages with real, actual examples. From these, he draws out what he considers to be the basic principles underlying the pressure to 'commercialise' and the public harm that ensues. This he sees as being essentially either corruption or unfairness.  As he says (and it is worth quoting at length):<br /><br />'The fairness objection points to the injustice that can arise when people buy and sell things under conditions of inequality or dire economic necessity. According to this objection, market exchanges are not always as voluntary as market enthusiasts suggest. A peasant may agree to sell his kidney or cornea to feed his starving family, but his agreement may not be really voluntary. He may be unfairly coerced, in effect, by the necessities of his situation.<br /><br />The corruption objection is different. It points to the degrading effect of market valuation and exchange on certain goods and practices. According to this objection, certain moral and civic goods are diminished or corrupted if bought and sold.' (P111)<br /><br />From these two objections, Sandel looks at, for example, blood donation in the US and the UK. In the US, blood is bought and sold, in the UK it is voluntarily donated. You might say that being able to sell your blood is your choice, but in reality, what happens is that there is, in the US, a movement of blood from the poorest to the richest. In fact, it turns out that the market is, in this case, far from being the most 'efficient' mechanism for providing a need - the UK system is actually more efficient. But it is not just a question of efficiency:<br /><br />'Economists often assume that markets do not touch or taint the goods they regulate. But this is untrue. Markets leave their mark on social norms. Often, market incentives erode or crowd out nonmarket incentives.' (P64)<br /><br />The argument for efficiency it seems, is the Holy Grail of economists. They seem to believe that 'economics is a value-free science independent of moral and political philosophy' (P88). This is beautifully but depressingly illustrated by the problems economists face when trying to explain 'gifts' - hugely inefficient, you are always better off giving cash. Economics cannot explain the immaterial aspects of gift-giving.<br /><br />By putting a price on everything, by overruling objections of unfairness and corruption, the public sphere, the sense of 'we're all in this together' is increasingly eroded. Privileged queue jumping at airports, corporate suites at football grounds, 'gated' communities - all help to stratify a community, encouraging a 'them and us' attitude between the well-off and those not so fortunate.<br /><br />It seems that economists, with few exceptions, see human being as, in Adam Curtis' phrase, '[[ASIN:B004KGIUG6 lonely robots]]'. Once you have let market forces in, it is extremely difficult to get them out again, as [[ASIN:0745652212 Colin Crouch]] also noted, but from a somewhat different perspective. The effects of the resulting erosion of civic duty, public service and the common good are, I would say, plain to see.<br /><br />As Cyndi Lauper once sang - '[[ASIN:B00136PQNQ Money Changes Everything]]'.not just a question of efficiency:<br /><br />'Economists often assume that markets do not touch or taint the goods they regulate.

B004RSCWZ2|5.0|A few months ago I got a catalog from \\"Musicians Friend\\" featuring the Tedeschi  Trucks Band on the cover.  I already owned Susan Tedeschi music. So, I was curious.  A read of the article led me upstairs to the computer where I sampled and then purchased her collaborative effort with her husband Derek Trucks.  Yeah, I liked what I heard on \\"Revelator\\".  Susan Tedeschi and Trucks had basically combined their bands.  The cover picture shows eleven members.  Talk about a \\"tight\\" band--wow.  Trucks toured with the Allman Brothers band and you can hear the licks.  I love those licks.  Of course the featured sound on the album is Tedeschi.  Her soulful, powerful delivery leaves the listener wishing for more than 12 tracks, but that's a normal album anyway.  Sample it your self.  You agree.

I really like the music on this album from start to finish.To me, there's not one song on it I did not enjoy.The problem I had was in the production.I found it to be loud, harsh, lacking any dynamic range and very hard to listen to  with everything in the midrange spectrum. It's a raw sound that feels like it was recorded in a large metal warehouse as compared to the warmth of a studio.I guess that's the sound he was after, but I find it hard to listen to.

B007IXWL2C|1.0|And not in the \\"I'm weak in the knees because Christian is oh so sexy\\" way. Everything about this final novel felt like a poorly pieced together rush to tie up loose ends. Worse yet, some ends were left untied. And I'm not going to get into the repetitive emailing, fighting, sexing, and self-loathing thing. Unlike the first two books, I was relieved when I finally reached the end of the third.<br /><br />Honestly, the most captivating part of this novel happened to be the short story at the end. Not the first Christmas or whatever sappy thing I couldn't even get through, but the first few meetings told from Christian's point of view. I disliked Ana so much by the end of Fifty Shades Freed that I was fascinated to find out what Christian found so interesting in the first place.

0345803507|3.0|A good conclusion with a decent ending/climax, but most of this book is filled with pointless filler. There is only some conflict and a somewhat purposeful plot, but you have to read almost to the end to glimpse it. The ending is like the beginning, mushy and very repetitive.  By about 75% of the way through, the book starts skimming through time, marked only by repetitive text messages between the MCs.  The Sex scenes are all the same and quite boring. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen there, but alas, it never did. Overall this series is just fair. The only redeeming quality these books have is the endearing love story between the main characters. Other than that, this is really not worth the read. At least the writing improved as the books progressed.<br /><br />With a bit of editing, I truly believe all three books in this trilogy could have been sized down to just one. Most of the books are filled with superfluous events, especially the first half of book #3. And although I enjoyed the books as I read them, I didn't feel they were all that special or satisfying by the end. I find it funny that with so much sex & S&M subject matter, I found little of interest or shocking, and I don't read Erotica.
B004V6BQ3O|5.0|Excellent sound, much superior to the built in mic on Nikon D300s. Very convenient to have the mic powered by the camera with no batteries and no extra switches. It's also much more compact than the Rode or Sennheiser mics and less fragile than the Rode. I think the sound is as good (although not as directional). And at half the price of those products, this is a great deal.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|great game, lots of fun! this is a much better version of the Garfield defense game. can't go wrong with samurais or zombies.
B000083E79|5.0|What can I say about Cher!  She's an icon and, in my opinion, a legend.  I saw her in Vegas almost 2 years ago - she was fabulous!  I had this CD and gave it to a friend of mine, who was also going to see Cher in Vegas.  Then I regretted giving it away and could not find a store around that I could purchase it from.  I ordered it from Amazon.com and got it very quickly.  The ordering process is easy.  Thank you, Kayann Donaldson
0439023491|5.0|It had everything I loved about the first book and even more. The arena was crazy and the political stuff was even more twisted. But MORE GALE would have made it more perfect. It is a favourite that I reread all the time
B007C4ZJ0S|2.0|I wanted to like this movie. Unfortunately, I can't recommend seeing it.<br /><br />The Bad: The story is basically a series of flashbacks. They are hard to follow. The plot is slow and there's surprisingly little dialog. The acting was fairly wooden (think Ashley Judd). The worst part was the story...just plain old boring.<br /><br />The Good: Action scenes are excellent. Gina Carano is very convincing and confident in the fight scenes. They are the best part.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It is easy to use, no assembly is required and it comes with batteries.  I have tested the soil temperatures in four of my gardens and am ready to plant my annual flowers.
0671646788|5.0|This is an \\"oldie but a goodie\\" - first having been written back in the fifties. The book is full of great advice, and is easy to read - if somewhat dated in its approach or stories (I read the 1981 reviced edition).  The 13 chapters are filled with solid and practical techniques for improving and focusing you rlife, and provide significant inspiration and food for thought.<br /><br />Each chapter (with titles like \\"Use Goals to Help You Grow\\" and \\"You Are What You Think You Are\\" are about 10-15 pages in length, and are neatly summarized at the end of each one, with a checklist of sorts that truly does a great job summarizing the information contained in the chapter.<br /><br />A good book for everyone - but especially the soon to graduate student, the career changer, those looking to make a change in their life, or anyone striving for active self improvement.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Some say this read is porn.  Some say it is erotica.  I say it's between fiction and erotica.  A fun, quick read where the main character/dominate thinks he is in charge but not so much
0767836324|5.0|I must say that those who dislike the movie are missing the overall picture of what the movie is saying.  Even though I do believe that children will definitely watch this movie and enjoy it, adults will enjoy it as well.  I first watched this movie when I was younger and loved it.  I watched it again years later and much older and I realized that this movie has a different vibe to it.  I finally understand what the movie was trying to say. Even though this may be labeled a kids movie, the true meaning of the story can only be understood by adults. The moral of the story is to live life to the fullest.  As what Peter Pan usually says, \\"to live would be an awfully big adventure.\\"  It's about forgetting your childhood and trying to remember who you are.  As people grow up they tend to view life as nothing but work and they lose the innocence of being a kid.  Some people even end up as \\"pirates.\\" This is what happened to Peter Pan as the point of the movie is to help him remember who he was as his childhood was gone and he grew up too fast. The fact that Peter Pan lived for decades as a boy and grew up way too fast when he decided to leave Neverland shows this.  Decades of being a lost boy was lost. The most touching scene was when he finally remembers.  I believe all people will enjoy this movie.  Don't think too much on the action scenes and how cheesy it is.  Think of the storyline and what the movie is trying to say. It's better than you think.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|it works great on the kindle fire! I love it and it works great for editing photos!! so I definitely recommend you get it

0385737955|3.0|I'm relatively late to the \\"Maze Runner\\" party, but I'm still relatively glad I came.<br /><br />When I started reading \\"The Maze Runner\\" I was not sure if I liked it or not. However, I was compelled to read on to figure out: A) what the heck was going on? AND B) what was the reason for all of this?  At the end of the book, more questions were left unanswered than answered.<br /><br />These unanswered questions literally drive the plot forward. The mystery of the Maze is the force in the plot. Dashner does an excellent job crafting this mystery which leaves characters and readers wanting answers. However, it seems like all of the author's effort went into creating the world and the mystery behind it. Characters, it seems, were an afterthought and are not strongly developed. In fact, most of the characters are unlikable which makes it hard to care about what happens to them.<br /><br />I won't ruin the plot for you but I feel like I have to talk about the ending. Throughout the book I kept wanting to know what was going on. Mainly, I wanted to know why the main character, Thomas, and the rest of the characters were placed in this gigantic Maze. The answer Dashner provides is not satisfactory. When I got to the end, when the reason was revealed, I literally put the book down and said, \\"That was dumb\\".<br /><br />Overall, \\"The Maze Runner\\" is a good read, but more questions were left unanswered than were answered. Although Dashner has two more books in which he can answer the questions I want answered, I don't know if I feel up to reading them. I don't want to read them and feel like I did when I finished \\"The Maze Runner\\": disappointed and wanting answers.
