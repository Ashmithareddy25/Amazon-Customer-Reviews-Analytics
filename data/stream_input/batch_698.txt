B000OPOANE|4.0|EXCELLANT DVD, SUPERB EXTRAS, SOUND QUALITY WITH 5:1 SURROUND BEST I,VE HEARD BETTER THAN SACD AND DVD-A,IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT BEATS CD HANDS DOWN
B000OPOANE|3.0|I waited in high anticipation for the release of the MVI version of this album hoping the sound would be awesome in 5.1 surround. When I popped it into my DVD player I was disappointed to say the least. The overall sound is pretty good but there is literally no separation between the front, back, and center channels. Everything is mixed to come out of all speakers at the same time. Being a drummer myself I was really hoping to hear Neil's drums panning across the room and bouncing back and forth between speakers but there was none of that. As a matter of fact his playing on this album is probably the most lack luster/straight forward playing he's ever done on any Rush album to date. I love Neil and he will always be \\"The Professor\\" to me but I have to say I wasn't that impressed with his work on this album. It's almost as if he held back on his playing. There are no impressive fills or tricks on this album at all. Just routine fills that we've heard him do countless times before. I have the Queen Greatest Hits DVD and the sound and separation on that DVD far surpasses the sound on this MVI. The sad thing about that is the sound on the Queen DVD was mixed years ago. With that said, it shows there wasn't a lot of thought that went into the mix of this album. If you're a Rush fan than by all means this is a must have MVI/DVD. However, you're probably going to be very disappointed with the sound and lack of 5.1 separation. The one nice thing I have to say about the MVI version is that they included a very nice and informative documentary on the making of the album \\"Snakes & Arrows\\". It shows the band in the studio as you've never really seen them before. This was a nice addition and overall makes getting the MVI version a better choice over the regular CD version of the album
0792844890|5.0|Spaceballs is a wonderful movie that you can watch over and over.  It is a great movie to watch on a plane or train.  You will soon learn and repeat many lines from this film  and each watch will gove you many laughs.
0375703861|4.0|Zadie Smith is very, very funny and extremely imaginative. This book has many moments of genius. Most seasoned writers do not have a quarter of her talent.    The terrific characters are laced with sorrow, irony and pettiness. She creates worlds within worlds and shattered dreams within dreams. Almost perfect, and then the last 50 pages or so go off track. I suspect the author was just plain exhausted and couldn't fathom how to tie everything together. Why couldn't an editor tell her to go back and fix it? Such joy and then such sorrow.
1400079276|5.0|The author makes magical realism seem logical.  There is the interrogator Crow, (an inner voice), and the narrator, a fifteen year old boy, Kafka Tamura.  In Japan during the war people scrounged for food.  Everyone was hungry.  A man wants to talk about a cat so names him.  The cat protests that cats can get along without names.  The man naming the cat went into a coma for two weeks when, as a school boy, he was foraging for food in the countryside.  Now the government pays the man, Nakata, a subsidy.    The fifteen year old, Kafka, has run away from Tokyo and is spending his days at a private library open to the public.  The library specializes in poetry.  While at the library he reads Burton's ARABIAN NIGHTS.  He learns that his stay at the hotel at a reduced rate has been extended through the efforts of the YMCA.  Later he is permitted to stay at the library.      Miss Saeki from the library once wrote a song called 'Kafka on the Shore'.  When her boyfriend died in the student revolt she vanished.  When Kafka's father is murderd he learns irony.  Man doesn't choose fate, fate chooses man.  Colonel Sanders and Johnny Walker are people, or at least spirits, in the story.  The author's technique is one of sampling.  The Oedipus tale underpins much of the action.      Mr. Nakata attracts a follower.  A young man, a truck driver, who wears aloha shirts, decides to assist him in his journey.  Since Nakata and Kafka started in the same place and ended up in the same place, the police think they are connected.  (It is a police matter because there have been two unexplained deaths.)  Of course there isn't a connection, seemingly.  Nakata's companion believes the police are worse than the yakuza.      Readers will find all of this both confusing and delightful.

630514415X|5.0|This film shows the real crossroads where the Blacks are in America, and I say the Blacks because they call themselves Blacks and not Afro-Americans or African Americans. The mother is dead, killed accidentally in a temper but the father. The father is in prison for a very long time. The son hates his father and has to learn how to get over his hatred. The daughter is missing her father but her brother is isolating her. The uncle and aunt only see the money the son represents. He is a high school star in basketball and he can get directly into making a lot of money if he joins the NBA or he can go to some university and have a scholarship. One more tricky element: the governor wants the kid for the team of his university, the one he sponsors and likes. So why not use the father, give him a week of semi freedom and force him thus to negotiate his son's signing the right papers. What's more the basketball star is invited by some schools to come and visit and there he is provided with everything he may desire, including the girls and the useless other entertainments. The NBA is offering a car to the uncle, though in fact it is for the son to run it. And the high school coach is able to put ten thousand dollars on the table for him to join, guess what, the NBA of course. Immoral. The film is saved from this muddy marshlandish country by the son choosing the only moral solution, the one that will help his father to get out faster, the one that is going to cure him from his hatred, even if that is slightly idealistic, frankly utopian.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne
0316067598|5.0|This book totally has the readers attention from page one. I was a little hesitant to read the book at first since my husband is also with the Seal Teams. I decided to read it and am glad that I did, although there were times when I had to stop reading to catch my breath and stop the tear flow. This book hit home with me....Marcus did an awesome job of telling his story and letting the American people know what really goes on in Afghanistan and Iraq. Marcus is an incredible man! With all that he's been through and still deals with in regards to the loss of his team mates he makes the reader finish the book with a great sense of pride for our US Military and especially our US Special Forces!
B0002HSE18|5.0|This is a phenominal musical achievement. The amount of music these three individuals produced was extraordinary. The level of talent shown by Emerson, in particular, is unmatched to this day. But all three, including Lake and Palmer were superlative musicians. What you hear on this album encapsulates the musical brilliance of these three individuals. How they integrate classical compositions and turn them into their own unique statement with bravura performances by each astounds the ears to this day. I cannot think of another rock album which matches the level of musicianship shown by just three musicians. Honestly, if you don't like this album then you really have no appreciation for the stellar musicianship put on display. Emerson, Lake and Palmer should be enshrined foreever as musicians who came together to form one of the most unique and phenominal bands in rock music history. Each cut on this album shows how marvelous the band was both as band playing together and individually, with Greg Lake performing on guitar alone on some of his own beautific compositions.
0553588486|5.0|I'm not really a fantasy fan but I was blown away by this first installment in Martin's series. This is a fantasy series that is so much more than fantasy. It's a mystery, a political thriller, a historical chronicle and more. Of course most fantasy novels dabble in the above, but this one really pulls it off. This is far-removed from the traditional conception of fantasy being a genre evolved out of childrens' fairy tales. Although there is a tiny bit of magic here -- and hints of more to come -- the atmosphere is largely of gritty reality with all the sex, violence and intrigue this entails. Unlike some fantasy works, people actually die. And of course there's the dimension of historical reality, this work being based on the War of the Roses. I only found out about this just now looking at other reviews, but even reading the book it is obvious there's a whole lot of historical connections.<br /><br />No matter what your reading habits this should not disappoint!
B000Q6GUT8|4.0|I enjoyed this movie very much.  I wasn't disappointed, as I usually am, when Hollywood makes a movie from a great book.  It followed the book very well.  I wouldn't have chosen Mark Walberg for the lead, however.  When reading one of the Swagger novels, I picture him looking more like a young Clint Eastwood or taller Mel Gibson, but it was still very good!
0618154248|5.0|My 2 year old loves Curious George and these books are great.  They are board books and can stand up to a lot of use. The convenient holder keeps the books in a good storage place.
075640407X|3.0|My creds:  I've read em all: Martin, Jordan, Donaldson, Erikson, Bakker, Eddings, Weis n Hickman, etc.  I pretty much only read fantasy.    Average at best.  It reads like a Weis & Hickman novel.  Reviewers who call it \\"dark\\" don't know what dark means. It's about as dark as the later Potter books.  And there's a very noticeable lack of action.  It's quite the talky novel, with long descriptions of everyday things.  He spends several pages describing Kvothe's purchase of a horse, which he turns around and sells a few pages later in the same chapter, so why did he initally bother?      The book peaks 150 pages in when we meet the big baddy and his cohorts, and hear a storyteller's exposition of what is surely the background of the story.  But then we don't get anything else about the big picture and suffer 500 pages of medieval Hogwart's complete with Snape and Malfoy clones.  And we're treated to a chapter by chapter recounting of Kvothe's bank account, the amount of talents, jots and ha'pennies in his pocket. He's poor, I get it.  Though after he wins the coveted \\"pipes\\" from the inn, he should be able to rake it in just playing minstrel at any street corner.      Which brings us to the main problem: Kvothe.  For all the book jacket's blathering on about him being the legendary hero of the realm, he's just not that interesting.  He considers himself a genius, and though he manages to pull off some cleverness here and there, Ender would kick the crap out of him mentally and physically.  Expectations were high going in, but part of that is the author's fault for his introduction to his star character.  The book really doesn't accomplish very much and didn't pull any emotional response from me.  A disappointment.  I'll probably read the sequels in the hopes he gets back to the main story, but something tells me it's gonna be Kvothe-mania all the way until he catches up with the present.      Which is another problem: the present is more interesting than the past.  Thespider demons, his faery companion, Chronicler.  I was looking forward to the interludes. Not a good sign.
B000PA9Q6E|4.0|What an awesome album!  It is great to hear these live performances by Muddy, Johnny, and James back in the heyday.  This album is a must.  Jay
B000QGDIKM|1.0|ive been expectin this special edition really more special than the standard one.but the thing is this edition sucks.  i got a scrached cd after the 1st time i opened the sealed package cos the cd is put in the back slipcase and way a lot worse than it to put in a standard cd case for more protection.  and the 76 pages *full*colored book is bulls***!it only got 4or5 low quality picture prints and a *lot*blank pages and transparent pages(so they call a transparent page is TWO PAGES)that is ridiculous cos all the so called book contained 4-5 pictures that maybe billy took and one billy transparent page and one jimmy page the rest are lyrics just like the standard edition.    so everybody who got a brain don't buy this LTD VERSION,ITS A TOTAL WASTED OF MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!    though the music is good.everybody should listen to the music n don't expect anything more of this album
185984054X|4.0|I remember Ralph Ginsburg, a minor prophet of the '60s, who ranted against the Catholic Church.  At the time, I thought him a bit paranoid/crazy, but,now, I suspect he was correct all along. Then there is a certain mission in Haiti where they say \\"The poor will always be with us.\\"  They do not do anything to improve the country's social structure, though.  Now comes a devout atheist  to expose the holiest of the holy.  And he is apparently correct and it appears that everyone needs a watchdog.  Although it would appear the subject of the book was very, very adept at filling the tenets of the Church, some of us might counter that suffering and poverty are not conditions with which we  wish to endow mankind.  Does such a religion wish to enslave, all but a few wealthy who would fund its agenda, with suffering and poverty?  And, where did all her money go?  It does not seemed to have been used wisely to make the world a better place. Why did not the Church insist upon a more judicious use of the funds?  Shame on the Church for not doing much to improve the lives of the destitute!  Praise for Hitchens for revealing such a situation!  But, only four stars for the book, because, once again, it will not change one thing or influence one policy for the better.  The book is an important read, a call for the examination and justification of all humanitarian fund drives.
B0000035E7|5.0|So, a review for this product... well, I'd say nothing but the very best of Nirvana so far, case there will be more songs published after Sliver: The best of the box. I love In utero, I like Nevermind, I like Incesticide also, but Bleach is another world for me. I am a musician myself and play guitar and/or sing... if it's me I'd only say Nirvana is: this album. Raw, pure, good music, alternative as much as it could be, new frontiers reached with now more or less familiar songs like: School, Negative Creep, About A Girl and Blew and less known but all worth it buying this product like Big Cheese and Sifting. I play'em all every now and then. Nirvana fans hello! Do me a favour... Please buy it. You won't regret it.
B000LE1FAY|2.0|If you are used to listening to French songs sung by the French, and you know French, this disc will .... startle you. Still, I was looking forward to hearing \\"Merci Cherie\\", which was originally sung by an Austrian (Udo Juergens), winning the annual \\"Eurovision\\" chanson contest in the late 1960s. What a disappointment Belinda's rendition is- I wish she'd stuck to English songs! I love her solo work from the 1980's. The only thing I like about this album is the cover art. She continues to look marvelous! Try Mireille Mathieu, Francoise Hardy, or France Gall.
B000Q3648S|5.0|to hear the live daydreaming on record is true beauty. the demo of eric's trip shows just how far the songs travel from idea to finished work.   if i had to recommend one sonic youth album to be part of every true music lover's record-collection this would be it. every aspect of their music comes together perfectly on this one.    still on of the greatest records of all times even 19 years after it's original release. hats of ...
1594489505|5.0|As has been stated, it is difficult for an author to live up to an outstanding first novel, but Khaled Hosseini succeeds in a remarkable fashion with \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\".  This time his main characters are two women, Mariam and Laila.  Mariam is a child born out of wedlock to the owner of a movie theater and one of the maids in his home.  She lives with her mother, a very bitter woman, and is visited on an irregular basis by her father.  Laila is the child of a weak father and a mother who grieves her life away because her two sons are fighting in a war between Afghanistan and the Soviets.  Political circumstances in Afghanistan cause these two women's lives to intertwine, and the book is about how their relationship develops in the midst of cruelty, both in their country and in their home.  As in his first novel, \\"The Kite Runner\\", Hosseini proves himself to be a master storyteller, developing interesting and sympathetic characters against the chaotic political background of Afghanistan.
B000654Z2I|5.0|and that is exactly what this album does, with it's weird vocals and long segments of musique concrete, combined with freeform rock that never goes overboard like so much of the progressive music did in the early 70's. i owned it on vinyl for a good 15 years before buying it on cd. and to say that it was not an almost completely new experience would be at least half a lie.
0743464117|4.0|The strength of this book is the knowledge and expertise of Stephen Ambrose regarding the history of WWII. Through countless interviews, vistits, letters, books and his travels, Ambrose writes the story of a close knit group of ordinary men who accomplished extraordinary things in the face of fear, cold, starvation and of course, death. By reading this book you will learn what an incredible group of men these guys were and it will make you proud to be an American. For me, this book really reinforced the fact that the freedoms that myself, along with my wife and kids enjoy did not come for free. It was paid for by the sacrifices of brave men like these.    I must say that I thought the effort involving the research in this book certainly deserved five stars. Unfortunatly the actual writing of the book was far less than that, perhaps three stars at most. I found myself having to reread things more than once trying to figure things out. I think this book may have been written for people with military experience, not the average citizen like myself. He uses a lot of abbreviations which were confusing, he never really explained the different companies, platoons, divisions, regiments,etc. so I never quite figured out who was where and why. Also the maps at the front of the book were far from adequate, which  has been pointed out in previous reviews.     I still believe this is a definite four star book worth reading. It certainly could have been better if there had been more and better maps and if Ambrose would have taken his time and explained things better. He even admits in the acknowledgements at the end of the book that he had a deadline for when he wanted this book to be completed. I hope this helps you decide whether or not to read this book.    One final note: check the book for blank pages before you buy it especially the pages that come right after the pictures. I had three sections of four pages each that were left blank which resulted in missing about 12 pagesof text.
B000PFUAO6|3.0|Maybe after I listen to Systematic Chaos I might grow to like it, but on my second pass through it there is nothing on this disc that grabs me.  This is easily the darkest, heaviest, thrashiest album DT has ever recorded, but there is little here that impresses me and I can actually HEAR bits of other people's songs in this one!  For example, Jordan Rudess's piano part at the end of \\"Forsaken\\" sounds quite a bit like the intro of Pink Floyd's \\"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\\".  And the lyrics are really subpar compared to previous albums and not anywhere near the standards I expect for any progressive act worth its salt.    On a more positive note, James LaBrie's singing is more listenable than it has been on most previous efforts, in part because he sticks to the lower parts of his range (his voice is really grating at higher elevations IMO).  And as always, the band is tighter than tight.    As I said before, this might grow on me and I'll at least give it a chance.  But for now I'm underwhelmed.
B000001EL3|4.0|Though certainly no longer a Kiss fan (between the ages of 11 and 16, I indeed was one), this is the one Kiss album still in my collection. The band really grew up musically on Destroyer, producing several pure rock gems (\\"Detroit Rock City\\" and \\"King of the Nighttime World\\"), a bit of psychedelia (\\"God of Thunder\\"), a surprising hit (\\"Beth\\")and a few indisputably great teen anthems (\\"Shout It Out Loud\\" and \\"Flaming Youth\\"). The rest of the songs are listenable, though \\"Great Expectations\\" plummets into sentimentality--a rarity for Kiss. The production job by Bob Ezrin is typically heavy-handed but, let's face it, the group's first three plodding studio albums warranted serious studio magic, and Ezrin certainly doesn't disappoint with all manner of tricks in his sonic arsenal. The walkie-talkie on \\"God of Thunder\\" is simply a stroke of genius. Plus, a sensational cover. Kiss obviously learned a great deal from the Ez, as their next two albums (Rock and Roll Over and Love Gun) were quite good, though perhaps without the insistent sheen of Destroyer.
B000G7PMD2|5.0|Okay, I'll start with the bad stuff.  It sounds like one of the violinists in the orchestra is out of tune.  And John Petrucci's backing vocals are simply awful; I've yet to hear a live DT recording where he stayed on key.  OTOH, I can live with that because it's one of those little things that markes this album as a live recording.  The backing vocals aren't coming from a tape, they're coming from actual humans.    But overall, this is a great set.  The live Dream Theater is every bit as tight as the same band in the studio.  The second and third discs, with the backing of the orchestra, sound great as well, although \\"Metropolis Pt. 1\\" sounds a little cluttered in spots.  While I could complain that a few of my favorite tracks are not in this set, I won't; how many live versions of \\"Pull Me Under\\" or \\"A Change of Seasons\\" do they really need to record? ;)    This is definitely a great set, and one of the best live albums I've heard in years.
B000000H3Z|5.0|I cannot understand why this band never got the attention that say metallica, megadeth, slayer, etc got.  Sepultura \\"thrashes\\" the other thrash bands to pieces IMO.  This record makes Metallica sound like Justin Timberlake.  This album is heavy duty from start to finish with little or no filler material.  There are many standout tracks but I like inner self the best.  Max's vocals are truly rough and satanic sounding on this cut.  Grab this and Arise to start with and if you like those pick up Chaos A.D. and Roots(more tribal sounding).  This band SHOULD have been more mainstream as it without a doubt is right up there with the best thrash bands.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|I must say that I have become an addict of this film. Whether it's a penchant for anti-establishment-ism or the implicit siren's call of the stunningly beautiful Miss Portman, I can't pass this up when it airs on HBO (At least I don't have 14 copies of Catcher in the Rye...yet). Beyond her looks, though, I was thoroughly taken by her acting performance. It's easy to dismiss someone who looks this good, and trying to be as objective as possible, I was pleasantly surprised by her performance and range of emotions. There's more to this book than its lovely cover.    To simplify things, V is a more aesthetically pleasing take on the message in Fight Club, but with some Matrix flair in the special effects department. I would normally give this a 4 star rating, but since the last good movie out (IMO) was The Sixth Sense, I gave it a bonus star because I'm starved for something substantive.    The one annoying thing for me about the production is the volume delta, forcing me to boost same for certain portions of the dialog, only to have to haul it back down during the raucous volumes of the action sequences. I'm sure some of it is age-related (I'm 43 going on 16), but some of it is pure dB-centric. I don't think that people really need to be jolted by volume if there's a message. It's too bad, given that this movie has at least some message to deliver.    In any event, it's refreshing to see something with a message which is so well-polished and compelling to watch. Kudos
B000002HRE|4.0|fact: metallica does not sound like they used to...but guess what?  that is a trademark of a great musician.  the ability to evolve.  if every album had the excact same tempos,  beat changes, riffs, etc then all of their albums would sound the same; so who the f u ck would want to listen to album after album of the same material?  unlike their predecessors, load and re-load does contain about half filler material which sux.  initially they were supposed to be released as a two disc set.  what should have happened is take the first 5-6 songs off of load and the first 5-6 off of re-load and made one killer album and scrapped the rest of the garbage songs (i.e. low man's lyric and mama said).  if any other no-name band would have debuted this album or load everybody would be going nuts talking about how hard they rock.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|Being the music-enthusiast that I am, I rarely ever purchase a bad CD.  I do my research prior to buying most CDs unless I'm just so in love with the artist/band that it doesn't really matter that much. I'd never even heard a Linkin Park CD prior to buying MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT so it was weird that I'd even pick up the new CD by a band I hadn't followed. The only thing I'd ever heard by Linkin Park was the mash-up that they collaborated with Jay-Z, which was in my mind promising. I liked what I heard of their original songs (\\"Numb\\", \\"Lying From You\\" among others)so I thought I would try the bands long-awaited follow-up from 2003's massive METEORA. I mean, METEORA had teenagers swooning practically, so why not. If I could go back, I probably wouldn't have bought MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT. It isn't awful or incredibly horrible, but it certainly isn't what I expected or what I would gravitate to as a music CD.  I'm a self-proclaimed 'multi-dimensional' musician/music-listener, but if this is true Linkin Park, I have to say they aren't on my radar of musical tastes. To the credit of MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT, there are a couple of great numbers and I wouldn't slight the album of that in the least. As a whole, the album isn't my favorite.<br /><br />After a pointless intro via \\"Wake\\" (aren't all intros and interludes pointless for the most part?), the album starts with a true bang, via the exceptional \\"Given Up\\".  While I don't advocate screams that seem like they're ever going to end (Bennington vocal cords must be chocked full of vocal nodes/nodules),I appreciate the angst within Bennington's vocals. To call \\"Given Up's\\" lyrics are true, potent songwriting would be an overstatement, but angst filled teens and twentysomethings will be singing along: \\"I've given up... tell me what the f**k is wrong, with me\\" as wells as \\"put me out of my f**kin' misery\\". True, substance filled songwriting right there (sarcasm). \\"Leave All the Rest\\" isn't a potent as the screaming match that is \\"Given Up\\", but it is OK, which is the general sentiment of MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT. It does features nice production work, which is a positive point. What \\"Leave All The Rest\\" lacks is true star-potential, which the proceeding track \\"Bleed It Out\\" has written all over it. Thank God for Mike Shinoda's spirited performance here coupled with the second coolest hook of the album, provided by none other than Bennington (\\"I Bleed It Out just to blow it away\\").  Still, you worry about those vocal cords of Bennington's.<br /><br />\\"Shadow of the Day\\" isn't bad and it grows on you after a couple of listens.  \\"What I've Done\\" features the standard Linkin Park production and production-wise it is a standout. Overall, it is a fine track, but I do believed it has been overhyped by everybody. Sure, it went to no. 7 on the Billboard Charts, but is it really as great as everybody makes it out to be?  Compared to \\"Numb\\", isn't it insubordinate and a bit insignificant? Just my thoughts.  It's OK though, but that about all in my eyes. \\"Hands Held High\\" is a production standout and once again features the quiet Mike Shinoda, who isn't quite as effective here as he was on \\"Bleed It Out\\".  However, \\"Hands Held High\\" is one of the better tracks of the entire album. By \\"Hands Held High\\" (track 7), the general sentiment I get from the album is that it is a bit scattered as opposed to being unified, which in my opinion hurts it a bit. Again though, there are enough promising moments here that I think the notion of unity is counteracted a bit.<br /><br />\\"No More Sorrow\\" wins the production award for the album. The mammoth drums at the beginning are enough to wake any body up from a deep sleep.  The instrumental work here is top rate as well, which leads the listener to believe there is hope for MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT. To call \\"No More Sorrow\\" and unfaltered hit would be quite the overstatement, but it is middle-of the road minimally. \\"Valentine's Day\\" is average at the most and leaves you thinking 'so what?' after you've listened to it. You get the feeling that \\"Valentine's Day\\" is the breaking point of MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT. You have to ask yourself how many more predictable songs can Linkin Park produce on this album with the clich&eacute; anthemic refrains? \\"In Between\\" falls in the trap of being too repetitively bland.  Sure, I'm a fan of the production, but after hearing the loop for so long, it utterly bores you.<br /><br />\\"In Pieces\\" revives a bit more interest in the album as the penultimate track, though it is more a production masterpiece than a songwriting marvel. \\"The Little Things Give You Away\\" concludes the album showcasing Linkin Park's electro-centric production work coupled with a cool acoustic feel. It is good to hear Bennington a bit more senitive than usual, but then again this is the same man who scream for countless number of seconds on the twice as exciting \\"Given Up\\", the gem of the entire album.<br /><br />Production wise, this album is right on point and if my judgement were based solely on production, I would give this album probably 4 stars. But this is by no means a 4 star album in my mind; there are enough unspired moments and vocal instabilities to shut that notion down quickly. Where hit material and truly stellar tracks are concerned, this album meanders from the best, most exciting or exhilarating (\\"Given Up\\", \\"Bleed It Out\\") that don't question the credibility of Linkin Park, to the worst, least interesting (\\"In Between\\" or the boring \\"Valentine's Day\\"). At most this album is average though I've heard much more exciting, well thought out 'average' albums than this disunified affair. 2 stars.tened to it.

It is good to hear Bennington a bit more senitive than usual, but then again this is the same man who scream for countless number of seconds on the twice as exciting \\"Given Up\\", the gem of the entire album.     Production wise, this album is right on point and if my judgement were based solely on production, I would give this album probably 4 stars. But this is by no means a 4 star album in my mind; there are enough unspired moments and vocal instabilities to shut that notion down quickly. Where hit material and truly stellar tracks are concerned, this album meanders from the best, most exciting or exhilarating (\\"Given Up\\", \\"Bleed It Out\\") that don't question the credibility of Linkin Park, to the worst, least interesting (\\"In Between\\" or the boring \\"Valentine's Day\\"). At most this album is average though I've heard much more exciting, well thought out 'average' albums than this disunified affair. 2 stars.
075662472X|5.0|The Deluxe Limited edition (which was limited to only 1200 copies) is in a maroon/red slip case - if purchasing this title remember ISBN-10: 0756623588 is for the first American Edition and ISBN-10: 075662472X is for the deluxe limited edition. The Deluxe Limited Edition is beautiful - well worth the money - not only lmited to 1200 copies but also has a superior binding - and it will probably appreciate in value. So buyer beware...make sure you are getting the proper binding - ask questions or ask for photos before you buy this title - I personally have asked 10 buyers on various venues about there offerings and haven't found any (out side of Amazon that was offering the right editon)... The art work is wonderful in either edition but if you are a collector you want the deluxe limited editon.

1594489505|5.0|This story didn't sound all too appealing to me before I bought it, but luckily I had heard so many good reviews about it, my curiosity payed off. I typically go for the sci fi/horror/mystery genre, but the characters in this book are so believable and so easy to identify with even through the unimaginable experiences that plague them daily. There aren't very many happy times in this book but the attachment and hope you keep for the characters keeps you turning the pages.
1591841666|4.0|I enjoyed this book and found its message wise and on point for our age. The premise of the book is that there is a time to quit a role, project, effort and a time to stay. When we have the opportunity to be the very best and are willing to pay the price, it is time to stay. When it is clear that staying will result in mediocrity or worse yet (Mr. Godin's term for a dead end) a cul-de-sac, it is time to move on to something where we can be our best. The dip is the place in between. The place where we face opposition, adversity and discouragement. It is here that many wrongly chose to give up when greatness is not that far away for the brave souls who persevere.

0316067598|5.0|This book is a must read, We all need to have a better understanding that freedom is not free. Politics and the Media have a much greater affect than they are often credited with, and I don't mean positive. But thank God for the next great generation.

1594489505|5.0|This is an outstanding book, well-conceived and well-executed. As with [[ASIN:1594480001 The Kite Runner]], Hosseini pulls the reader in to the unfamiliar world of Afghanistan. He gives an intimate view of homes and villages. He paints a picture that is both beautiful and hideous. It's beautiful in that there is deep, transcendent love and perseverance through incredible hardship. It's hideous in that the characters experience pain that we, unfortunately, know is not entirely fictional.<br /><br />This book reveals deep pain - personal, familial and national. Even in the happier scenes, there is underlying sadness. Even when the characters seem to be enjoying some happiness and apparent freedom, the reader knows that it is fleeting. They are smothered under a blanket of oppressive traditions and beliefs that are more about shame, humiliation and control than they are about freedom, grace and redemption.<br /><br />I'm not sure if he intended it, but I found Hosseini's book to be allegory. The two main characters, Mariam and Laila, and the oppression they endure represent not just women in war and women under the extreme form of Islam. For me, they also represent two aspects of Afghanistan itself. Mariam, the uneducated (but not stupid) older woman, represents ancient Afghanistan oppressed under the inflexible dictates of tradition. As she awakens to the futility of her situation, the spirit of curiosity and ingenuity is stamped out of her. She accepts the punishment that comes to her and doesn't really question whether or not it is deserved. Laila, the younger of the two, represents the more modern (yet pre-Taliban) Afghanistan. She is about art and poetry and good food. She fights against oppression to the extent that she can. In the end, though, she is a powerless, voiceless woman who cannot ultimately, on her own, overcome the suffocating oppression of tradition and beliefs.
B000FIMG68|5.0|This is the best show on TV, possibly ever.  Some people complained this season was too much about the \\"tailies\\", but I still think it was well written and still showed a lot of insight into the orginial cast.  Definitly worth it to buy this entire series.
B000GCFO0I|4.0|The story of the movie is simple.  The corruption of the innocence and the horror visited on an innocent, psychically endowed child by believers (or should i say the false believers of God who act as her inquisitors) results in the creation of silent hill a hell in the mind of the child.  Satan as shown by the creature who offers to take revenge on her behalf needs to enter the church where the perpetrators of the crime have hidden taking refuge in the light of the Christ.  In the movie however it is shown that refuge in the Christ is no escape from retribution for horrors visited on innocence and that JUSTICE will be visited on those who attack innocent but powerful beings who often than not are made to be convinced that their power comes from satan.
0312360266|1.0|I did not like this book at all. I could only read the first couple of pages. I felt like I was in the mind of a typical cheerleader(Hollywood version of course). The character was so clueless and shallow. The book lacked any depth what so ever. I was really disappointed, I expected more.<br /><br />**Edit**<br />I ended up finishing the book and the next three in the series.<br />They were all awful, there is still more coming out, but i couldn't poison myself with anymore of that writing.<br />The one thing that kept me going that long was that there was a fairly interesting plot.
B00005N7Z1|3.0|I'm surprised so many people consider the original Robocop a classic sci-fi action film.  The movie was really cool when it was first released.  I remember watching it a few times back then.  Being a kid I was really into this kind of stuff.  Now, however, the film looks really cheesy and stuck in the 80's decade.  It's so cheesy that my dad and I were sitting there laughing as we watched it, shocked that we used to enjoy it back in the day and how the movie didn't stand the test of time.    It's got some nice action scenes, but the entire dated feel and the fact that it feels extremely old and cheesy makes it just an \\"alright\\" movie.
B000EYK4GW|1.0|I get a lot of kid's DVDs that I load onto my iPod for my daughter. It's great for long trips since a good movie will keep her occupied. The problem with this DVD is that it incorporates a new copy protection scheme that makes it much more difficult to format shift it to an iPod (I use HandBrake for this). It seems the only reason Disney released this edition was to prevent consumers from converting this DVD to other formats. The 60th Anniversary Edition released in 2001 has more content and doesn't have this restriction. So if you intend to put this on your iPod, PSP, AppleTV, etc. don't buy this edition and look for the older [[ASIN:B00005KARK Dumbo (60th Anniversary Edition)]].
0307276902|5.0|This book is amazing.  You truly feel as if you are there with James in his journey.  Who cares if he stretched the truth...the bottom line is that he was successful in his endeavors and triumphed despite the statistics of staying clean. His power is within him. Stay clean, stay healthy, and stay happy.  James is a true inspiration!
B000P0J024|5.0|Wow, I can't believe how many reviews are negative on Vol. 3.  It rocks!  Maybe it's because I'm more of a Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne fan but it has all of their trademarks--strong rhythm section, great production, rock steady drumming (and just okay lyrics).  I would stack Vol. 3 up against Petty's Full Moon Fever (produced by J. Lynne)--if you love that album, you'll love Vol. 3.  If your feet aren't tapping to this music you just don't love rock'n'roll.
B000P2A24W|5.0|This new CD is great!  It's better than the last few they have released.
1594489505|5.0|Upon finishing this novel, my thought was \\"This guy (the author) astounds me.\\"  This 2nd novel is another excellent work by Hosseini.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|Story - acting - music - vocals. Each of these elements one their own is outstanding, and when they are put together it creates a phenomenal movie. If you haven't seen it yet you are denying yourself a great experience.
B000066744|5.0|Trust me, this is something you have to OWN because it's compulsive viewing that requires watching over and over again and be delighted to find new things each time afresh.    This is not a romantic love story that some reviewers had us believed.  The strength of the story lies in the human journey of life, the poetic script and the delivery of lines, the hauntingly beautiful music and cinematography, the strong acting of a fine cast, the thoughtful production and vision of the director- all the elements we come to appreciate in European films as opposed to the pedestrian Hollywood box office stuff.  It's an Italian production directed by Giuseppe Tornatore and made in Rome.     Tim Roth shines. Don't miss his stunning performance.    The story begins with the touching scene of Max, a down and out talented musician selling his trumpet at a pawn shop for next to nothing to buy a decent meal.  He begged to play his trumpet one last time and began to play the music created by a \\"nameless\\" pianist known as 1900. The indifferent pawnbroker was at once moved by the music and curious about the story behind.    Max reminisced the past on how he got to know 1900 when he played on the luxurious ocean liner, Virginian.  His first meeting scene with 1900 is absolutely mesmerising.  He was so sea sick that 1900 showed him the way to cure his misery - the now famous piano ride scene- with 1900 playing magical music on a moving grand piano (with brakes taken off).  It's an amazingly breathtaking scene that completely captivates the audience with the piano surging backward and forward to the rhythm of the rough sea, crashing everything in the way and landing them in trouble with the ship captain.  While being punished to shovel coal in the engine room, 1900's story was told.    He was a newborn foundling in a lemon box on top of a grand piano in the first class cabin discovered by an engine room coal stoker.  Hardship and harshness of life had not diminished his kindness of heart and yearning for love so he raised the boy to avoid the boy's doomed fate of an orphanage.     Audience will be moved and enjoy how 1900 still talked about people would be locked up in an orphanage if they don't have children as his adoptive father told him once in jest when he was little. This is 1900's own quiet way of coping with his private grief and keeping his adoptive father's memory alive.    1900 knew little beyond the confines of the ship and was innocent and naive of the ways of the world.  His communication and interaction with people were through his music which he created instinctively to express himself and in response to his immediate environment through his keen observations of people and the world around him.    He was born to make music on the piano with magical fingers which impressed the ship captain and others so much that he was allowed to stay on board to entertain after his adoptive father died in an engine room accident and was adored by all. But there would be lonely moments when he and his music were left abandoned by the adoring crowd after the ship docked and passengers flocked ashore to their respective lives and then he was all alone again with his piano.    Through some lovely and thoughtful piano recital scenes for both first and third class passengers, the director shows us how unaffected 1900 was and how he was totally comfortable mixing with the rich and the poor unconscious of class distinction.  He was as relaxed with the rich in his tailed tuxedo in first class cabin as with the poor immigrants in the third class cabin who would utter some incomprehensible notes and asked 1900 to play a tune that reminded them of the home they left behind. 1900 would make magical music just on hearing a tune once, to the delight of the crowd.    The three landmark episodes of his life were played out in the following poignant scenes:-    1) His humble response to the ostentatious King of Jazz's bully and challenge to a piano duel. Watch out forhow they use a cigarette to prove who has the lightest butterfly fingers whilst making the most earth shattering music and how he plays as if he had two pairs of hands.    2) His gentle, brief yet profound encounter with the girl, a third class passenger, the power of which lies with the director's deliberate intent to leave an indelible mark on the audience through the unsaid, the unspoken and the unrequited love.     3) His trust and friendship with Max culminating to the bittersweet ending of the story through his most endearing and enduring soliloquy about his fear of life not so much because of what he saw but what he didn't see -\\"Where the whole thing came to an end...how do you just choose one woman, one house, one piece of land to call your own, one landscape to look at ...one way to die...you don't even know where it all comes to an end...it's a voyage too long, perfume too strong... I can't get off the ship (his reality); at best, I can step off my life...\\"This is some powerful stuff that could easily be uttered by anyone of us in our eternal search for our reality and the meaning of life.    This sums up the tragedy that's his and ours.    I am just typing off the top of my head after I saw the film and can't wait to share with you.  I can certainly fine tune and improve on it given more time but in the meantime, enjoy.
1594489505|5.0|This is a very emotional and heart-wrenching book, as was \\"The Kite Runner\\".  Khaled Hosseini writes from his heart and is able to keep you turning the pages right up to the very end.  After reading this book, one again realizes how fortunate we are to be living in America.
B000P0J024|5.0|I always loved George Harrison and seeing him in the DVD that came with this compilation was awesome.  How can you go wrong with Jeff Lynne, Bob Dylan, Tom Petty and Roy Orbison?  They are having such fun and enjoyed playing together - it comes across in the music.
B00005JPFC|4.0|Ratatouille isn't Pixar's best movie by any stretch, but it is still entertaining nonetheless.  The animation is superb, especially the broad scenes of Paris and the city skyline.  The voice acting is dead on.  The story is . . . well, perhaps not excellent, but at least very good.<br /><br />This is an animated film for older kids and adults.  It is what it is, regardless of any inappropriate marketing.  It seems in many people's minds that animated films \\"must\\" be geared towards young children.  There are no song and dance routines (thank God!) and the dialogue is definitely over the heads of younger children. So what? That doesn't mean the movie deserves fewer stars, it just means it has a different audience.<br /><br />The only reason I give the film four stars is that I do agree with some critics that there should have been more humor.  It's just not that funny a movie unfortunately.  Still, it is worth watching if you're into quality animation, cooking, or just plain good movies with stunning visuals.
B000QFAJ7S|4.0|I am glad Kelly got this album produced.  It speaks to the hurt that so many of us feel when love goes wrong.  The lyrics linger in my head and I identify with about 10 of the songs.  I can feel what she must have felt as she wrote the words because they are my emotions too.
B000AP04OM|5.0|Great movie, wonderful songs, gorgeous scenery, romance, reverance, drama, life lessons, values like courage - loyalty - friendship, the list goes on....
B0009HLDFU|4.0|I have every CD from Foo, and although the first one, with Grohl doing all the vocals and instruments, is my fave, this one is great.  Foo is hard to beat in this genre.  They are original, but still appeal to mainstreamers.  The rocking tunes are way better than the \\"softies.\\"  One star lost for the Norah Jones tune; I skip it every time I spin this disc.  Should be on HER album, not Foo's.
B00008AWOG|5.0|I don't know if it is possible to crank out another BWP, but this album is still worthy of 5 stars. This is right in line with Opeth's other dark albums. This band is one of the most talented bands out there, when speaking with regards to instrument playing; would rather see them stop the demonic screaming and just focus on the singing.
1594489505|5.0|A breathtaking journey into the tragic lives of two amazing women who somehow triumph despite war and impossible circumstances.  I couldn't put the book down.

B000000OA6|4.0|This was the last album released by Queen during Freddie Mercury's lifetime.  The album was a big success in most parts of the world, but not so much in the U.S., where Queen wasn't as popular as they once had been.  No songs from this album charted in the U.S., but four of the songs were U.K. hits: \\"Innuendo\\" was a #1 hit, \\"Headlong\\" peaked at #14, \\"I'm Going Slightly Mad\\" reached #22 and \\"The Show Must Go On\\" topped out at #16.  Overall, it's a very good album, although American fans may not enjoy it that much because there are no recognizable U.S. hits.
B0002EXH54|5.0|\\"Peace Sells\\" happening to be my second favorite Megadeth album (Rust in Peace gets #1) and the only reason that I am writing this is to comment on the remastered version. Something just doesnt sound right. It seems like the songs were played around with to much. Its almost like it was re-recorded. When I go back to my copy on cassette, even though the sound is horrid, the songs seem to sound better when they are less polished. Sometimes lousy production does an album justice. I love remastered versions of most albums, but I only like it when they get more volume and a crisper sound with less hiss. When things are played with to much (such as Ozzy's horrid remasters of him re-recording certain parts w/ different musicans, or the remasters of Pink Floyds Dark Side of the Moon, which they ruined, but hey that sounds best on record.) Maybe its just me, but I would love to hear other comments from other Megadeth fans that own the orginal and see if it is just me. \\"Killing is my Business\\" seems to have the same problem, but besides the remastering problem, its still one of their best!

0316067598|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. If you are at all interested in the military or the events that have transpired during this war that we're living through, this book is for you. It's the saddest, most interesting and inspiring tale of modern-day heroism and triumph I could imagine. Also, Marcus writes to you as if he is talking to you, very easy read, and a lot of parts are very funny! I laughed, I cried, it was magical! :) I think it's great that people can finally read something positive and heroic about our military overseas and the trials they go through in the name of freedom.

0316067598|5.0|I enjoyed this book immensely especally about the Afganistan tribal living and customs. Not to mention the code of conduct our military has to operated under.      Need to let our military do there job that they were trained to do and go all out to win a battle or war.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|One of the best science fiction films ever. Dark -- very dark -- in tone, but with hints of hope and humor scattered throughout, this film projects present-day social, economic, and environmental concerns forward twenty years. Clive Owen is completely believable as EveryMan, shaped and scarred by a horrific future, yet who finds inside himself the strength to do what he must on behalf of all humanity.    Employing a gritty slice-of-life directorial style and immaculately-conceived sets, Children of Men is not overwhelmed by Hollywood's usual whiz-bang approach to speculative future films. The motivation and acting of the cast is completely believable as ordinary people who find themselves in extra-ordinary situations. The CGI effects are minimally apparent and tastefully done. There is one scene in particular that is utterly life-like and if you aren't moved to tears by this scene and what it represents then you haven't a spark of humanity in yourself.    Please, please, please -- see this film. Heed its warnings. Embrace its hope.
B000002UTT|5.0|This is maybe the best pop record from the late 80s, containing a whole bunch of hits.  Per and Gisele both have good vocals and wrote most all of the lyrics and music.  This is very much their work.  They do the high-energy pop/rock stuff [my favs] with a lot of vigor and can do slower/ballad stuff with feeling.  One of my favorite CDs.  The really good songs:    The Look  Dressed for Sucess  Sleeping Single  Paint  Dangerous  I Could Never Give You Up  Listen to Your Heart
6305388458|5.0|This film is a great satire on the human race.  No other film seems to sum up the hysteria, naivety, prejudice, suspicion, gullibility and sheer aching ignorant stupidity of the human race!  Set the film in contemporary times and everybody would relish its accuracy and laugh fit to burst at our folly.  However, set it in biblical times, say around the time of Christ's ministry on earth to the ignorant masses - and there are charges of it being sacrilegious?  Let's not forget that Jesus' life on earth was abruptly terminated by those sensitive types who were irritated by his teachings and did not see anything amusing about him in any way.  See this film for what it is - a gentle satire on the human condition and laugh until you ache!
B000FVQM2Y|4.0|Far-fetched as this may sound, \\"Buffy, the Vampire Slayer\\" kept popping into my head when I saw \\"Brick\\". Think about it: both share the same basic conceptual premise, i.e. the improbable crossing of very specific film genres with a high school universe, both have larger-than-life, charismatic and virtually unstoppable protagonists, and both are propelled by fast, sharp, intelligent dialogue. They also raise similar problems concerning suspension of disbelief, of course, but Rian Johnson and Buffy's creator Joss Whedon deal with those very differently.    In \\"Buffy\\" the conflict between the supernatural and the prosaic not only isn't disguised in any way but actually highlighted for humoristic purposes, and self-deconstruction is even a trademark of the series. Not so with Johnson's work. Although obviously conscious of the film's lack of \\"realism\\" the director never lets his guard down, and these extremely articulate, focused, serious and animally elegant teenagers remain strangely believable throughout. There are a couple of buffyesque moments, like when the mysterious villain's mom prepares a  nice snack for the boys and the \\"noir mood\\" just switches off for a few seconds, but the film simply returns intact to its previous intensity.     \\"Brick\\" has a definite dreamlike quality to it. Incongruous and unbelievable as most dreams, the film has the same ability to hold the viewer's attention regardless. In fact, one could even see \\"Brick\\" as an intricate, vivid dream by a Raymond Chandler loving, high school misfit who's just lost his girlfriend and is unconsciously dealing with it in his sleep. The almost complete absence of teachers, parents or any other grownups would be just a reflection of how he sees the world. And, returning to \\"Buffy, the Vampire Slayer\\", weren't the vampires and monsters that she fought simply metaphors for her growing pains?
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is one series that we all love to watch together - no matter what our age, sex, or interest.  The scenes are too awesome to describe.  I recommend this to everyone!
1400032717|2.0|SLIGHTLY INTERESTING PERSPECTIVE FROM A YOUNG BOY'S VIEW, BUT AT THE END I WAS LEFT FEELING THAT I'D WASTED 2 DAYS OF FREE-TIME & AM STILL WONDERING WHY THIS WAS GIVING SUCH HIGH REVIEWS...
B000000W5P|5.0|Something about this album is very different from other classic Stones albums... such as Sticky Fingers or Exile. More than likely, it was the influence of the city of New York and the musical genres of disco and punk. But it also seems like there was a whole different attitude. While albums like Exile on Main Street rarely ever lost the Stones' trademark snarl, Some Girls seems to dwell on the two extremes... from surprisingly soft (\\"Beast of Burden\\") to a thrashing sound reminiscent of early Clash records (\\"Respectable\\").     All in all, a really good record. It's also one of the best sounding Stones CD's. Although it can still get hard to hear Mick sometimes, the guitars come in loud and clear, especially on the hilarious \\"Far Away Eyes\\".
B000PFU7OO|5.0|Although the movie \\"Once\\" is not very well known, I am recommending it, followed by purchasing the CD to all my friends.  I play it all the time and because I saw the movie I think the emotionality of the music comes through loud and clear.  It's a great CD and I look forward to hearing more from Glen Hansard and Maketa Irglova.
0451191153|3.0|I'm just going to say, Don't read it. It's not worth it. The first four hundred pages are fantastic; Ayn Rand describes the characters beautifully, as well as the places, their feelings, everything. The dialogue, though, gets to be a little unrealistic...But I didn't live in the thirties, how would I know? It seems, though, that during the last half of the book she just began to give up. Everything becomes glaringly obvious and a giant sermon for Objectivism, complete with lengthy monologues from the characters that span over several pages...  The characters were well developed, and the story too, but it's just a slow downward crawl to the end; it was hard for me to finish.

B00005JPLW|1.0|...the better, I do feel obligated to say a few things about 300's self-aggrandizing disquisitions. To organize my discussion, I suggest that we take one step back in the causal chain and embark on a new path towards change. What I mean to say is that I have a tendency to report the more sensational things that 300 is up to, the more shocking things, things like how it wants to call evil good and good evil. And I realize the difficulty that the average person has in coming to grips with that, but while it insists that we have no reason to be fearful about the criminally violent trends in our society today and over the past ten to fifteen years, reality dictates otherwise. Actually, if you want a real dose of reality, look at how as far as being namby-pamby is concerned, none of 300's devotees holds a candle to it. Do I blame society for this? No, I blame 300.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Joss Whedon hit it out of the park in creating the Firefly universe.  An engaging believable storyline, an amazing cast of very talented actors, and writers that just rocked.<br /><br />Joss's characters speak like human beings.  They're mythic, yet they're not.  They have our flaws.  They speak our language.  And you can fully engage with each and every one of them on a personal level.  A combination of fantastic writing and fabulous actors really brings us into this world.  I can't believe FOX so screwed up by moving the TV series all over the 'verse as regards time slot.<br /><br />This is, by far, better than Buffy or Angel.  And I totally adored both of those series.<br /><br />The movie, Serenity, ties up most of the loose ends of the series.  But it is its own movie.  It helps to fully understand the characters and their motivations.  You'll be much more invested if you watch the series first.  However, the movie stands on its own.  A complete story.  The independent, rebellious, aware good guys against the corporate, conformist, AWARE bad guys.  Truly a tale for our time.<br /><br />Love, love, love this.  I've watched it at least four times and expect to watch it at least 30 more times over my lifetime.

1400063515|2.0|I really wish this were a good book, because the basic idea behind it is original, important and clever.  That makes Taleb's careless handling of his topic all the more disturbing.    The rock-solid foundation of this book is Taleb's insight that the most important events in history, and presumably to come in the future, are essentially unpredictable; they can't be forecast using the information we have prior to their occurrence.  That's a huge point and Taleb goes on to offer some compelling evidence that it is indeed true.  He uses the analogy of a Turkey deciding that humans must have his best interests at heart because they show up every day of his life to feed him a good meal, he projects that - based on all of his evidence - this will continue.  This works great until a couple of days before Thanksgiving.  Suddenly his predictions have failed him catastrophically.    Great idea, and - I believe - true.  But Taleb undercuts his own thought baby with shoddy writing, poor research and personal opinion masquerading as evidence.      The writing: A well-written book allows a reader to flow naturally from one paragraph to the next and from one idea to the next, even when the subject matter is complex.  Taleb's writing is tough to follow and slow to get through.  Beyond that, you really struggle to comprehend what he is trying to get across to you for huge portions of this book.    The research: When Taleb used examples to back his ideas that came from fields with which I was unfamiliar, I felt pretty good about them.  However, whenever he used examples from areas where I have deeper knowledge, I noticed that his knowledge was lacking badly (being a trader comes to mind).  This started to make me question all of his supporting evidence.    The opinion:  Taleb leans heavily on the idea that most of what happens in the world is luck, even when we try desperately to ascribe some sort of tangible cause to it.  At one point he uses the example of Mac operating software being far superior to that of Windows, but Windows being dominant in the market.  He chalks it up entirely to luck!  I'm sure he'd say I'm falling prey to a logical fallacy, but Apple and Steve Jobs had a huge head start on Microsoft, but refused to let anyone else run their operating system - so to run it, you had to buy a Mac.  Microsoft let anyone run their operating system and consequently took the dominant share of the market.    This book is really a shame.  The idea is just too good to be used this poorly.  It made me sad to read this thing.  Taleb the thinker deserved a far better writer than Taleb the author.  What a waste.      You might still try reading this to understand Taleb's idea, because it's a huge insight, but watch all of his other content because it's riddled with holes.
B00005JPPL|3.0|After seeing the trailer I had expected the movie to be good. I wasn't too far off the mark. It was a good movie, but not a great one. I think it had the potential to be a very good movie, but unfortunately the whole terrorist plot just didn't seem the best way to show off the talent that Cage had in the movie. And the ending, although surprising, just left me feeling a little cheated. The CGI looked bad... so bad that you actually tell what's real and what's CGI during action sequences. I had expected that to be better in a movie like this...

0375701427|4.0|It is a convenient fiction among upper-middle class Americans that life can be managed and maintained in perpetual tranquility: just do the right things, consult all the right experts, associate with all the right people, etc - although it is more an assumption than a well thought out philosophy. Swede Levov, a non-practicing, Jewish third-generation owner of a factory making gloves in post-WWII Newark, was the epitome of that belief system. He was an unassuming star athlete, who married a Miss America contestant, and became the father of a precocious little girl Merry living on a large farm in semi-rural NJ.<br /><br />But that idyllic life started unraveling, as his daughter developed a stuttering problem blemishing  the perfect family, began associating with political radicals at the young age of fifteen, and finally blew up the local post office killing a beloved local doctor. The narrator, Nate Zuckerman, a younger classmate of the Swede, knew little of this when he met the Swede at a restaurant some 27 years after the bombing. He only discovered that his assessment of the Swede as being utterly bland and non-reflective was terribly wrong after running into the Swede's younger brother Jerry at a high school reunion.<br /><br />The book proceeds from that point from the perspective of the Swede. The Swede constantly assesses and reassesses his family's life trying to find the triggering event(s). In addition, he has to contend with the turbulent times of the late 60s, such as the riots and destruction of Newark, as well as the slow deterioration of his marriage. The book is a very deliberate examination of the awakening and anguish of a once blithely contented man, who comes to understand that much of life is illusory, unknowable, and fragile.<br /><br />The book does stall in places and is short on answers, such as about Merry. She almost seems more a device to tweak the Swede than a fully explored character. Nonetheless, the book is thought provoking.
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer never really ceases to amaze me but there is something about this album that speaks to me. Maybe it's because it's really relate-able.<br /><br />Why Georgia, Neon, Your Body Is A Wonderland, St. Patrick's Day and City Love are all great songs but John really shines when he tells a story in 83 and 3x5. And No Such Thing is still one of my all-time favorite John Mayer songs. It's one of his few upbeat numbers.<br /><br />I don't rate a 5 to many products here, but this one deserves it. It was really good when I first heard it, then I played it after some time and didn't like it as much. But then I bought it again (don't know what happened to the original) and fell in love with it all over again.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00004TJKI|5.0|Even though I was a criminal defense lawyer at the outset of my career, I haven't much to add to the plaudits here, other than that it felt realistic to me.     However, I did notice at the outset the standard \\"pan and scan\\" statement that the film had been reformatted to fit your screen - which means it was filmed in a widescreen format.    Why hasn't this film been released in a widescreen version? It's one of the all time classic films - it deserves it. I'll also bet that with Duke Ellington providing the score, there must be a stereo master of the music available, so a stereo mix shouldn't be hard to create - voices and sound effects are not that hard to isolate and locate in a stereo or surround sound field.

B00004Y6NP|4.0|One of the biggest selling CDs of its time, partly due to being the first CD issued in England, and partly due to the once-inescapable dreck of the song \\"Money For Nothing\\", this is for the most part a genuinely great album, don't let \\"Money For Nothing\\" turn you away. Mark Knopfler's beautifully clean, precise playing can never be faulted, for starters, and this includes one of THE most soothing, beautiful songs ever, \\"Why Worry\\". Other highlights are \\"The Man's Too Strong\\" (which has the most thunderous guitar parts; truly a brilliant use of dynamics); and the title track. If you do not have any Dire Straits CDs, I recommend first getting \\"Making Movies\\", their finest moment; I recommend that over any best-ofs, in fact; but you could do far worse than to get this fine album.
B000P6YNSE|4.0|lost is still a great shows with puzzles and mysterys, but it is not keeping up with season one and two. some of the new idea they are putting into the show is making it now as fresh as the other seasons. but one hint, once you get to the final two episodes, you will not forget them.
B000MP0XIW|5.0|I have edited this review because it has since been given a proper Region 1 release. Any comments regarding my former review about the Mexican release should be disregarded.  This set is impeccable. The picture quality is amazing, the sound is fantastic, and I could not possibly imagine how they could have made it better. All 3 of the original Pilot movies, the complete first season, and a handful of very excellent and well done bonus features. In short, this is the SMDM set we have been waiting for, and I am glad Universal finally got their head out of their collective asses and gave us what we have been waiting over 30 years for.  No one needs to be told what the show is about, as far as I'm concerned, the concern should be about the quality of the product, and they really delivered. I'd buy the whole set collection if I could afford it, but at least it's worth buying. If you have even a passing interest in the show, this is the best ticket.

B0000VD04M|4.0|RE: audio commentary. Absolutely uneven and atrocious. There is nothing here on the late Ed Wood, either.<br />they could have included a special doc on the man himself, etc.<br /><br />Granted, Martin Landau (and the entire supporting cast) is terrific. Depp does fine, but the writers really should have included more of the story. Wood's marriage to Kathy was not smooth sailing at all, but the way it is presented here they would have you believe that it was a cake walk, etc.<br /><br />There is so much more to the Ed Wood story...and wish someone, someday does it. Ed Wood was a war hero, a purple heart recipient, and the author of dozens of paperbacks.<br />Also, towards the end of his life, due to having been ripped off left and right by unscrupulous distributors (& other entities), heart-broken as a result, pretty much defeated...he drank heavily and died at the fairly young age of 54.<br /><br />Burton and his writers give you a fairly decent and dignified version of Ed Wood's life, although it may contain more than just a pinch of sugar.<br /><br />Still, after all--I have to recommend it.<br /><br />Lastly, read NIGHTMARE OF ECSATCY by Rudolph Grey--if you want the whole, heartbreakingly tragic tale.<br />R.I.P., Eddie--wherever you are. You suffered for your art. Some of us, very few of us, will always love that about<br />you.

B000OQF6N6|1.0|So Billy Corgan and Jimmy Chamberlin are back and the Pumpkins have reformed. Um, not quite. Corgan and Chamberlin were in ZWAN (the band Corgan formed after the Pumpkins disbanded). So now those two are back, still without James Iha or D'arcy Wretzky and somehow they are the Smashing Pumpkins again? How is it not obvious to see that ZWAN bombed and Corgan is trying to attach a more proven and marketable label to his new band ( which I refuse to call the Smashing Pumpkins ) purely for marketing purposes.<br />Zeitgeist is a bore from beginning to end. A collection of generic one dimensional songs lacking in the signature sound Corgan was once known for. Don't expect the brilliance of previous Pumpkins records to shine through at all here. Like a prize fighter past his prime stepping back into the ring, the result is a sad, tired display of a once great band who's unique sound captured our undivided attention. 90's rock is not back. It's 2007. re-heated leftovers aren't anything to be excited about. Instead of desperately trying to cling to the days of your youth, take a step forward and discover something new<br />( Mogwai, Kinski, Sophia )<br />At least the Pixies admitted they needed the money.
B000E97HIA|1.0|I normally do not comment to other reviews, but Tammy La Grace's review was so bad and misguided that I was compelled. First. the fact that she calls prince a \\"black Beck.\\"  How insulting is that!  Prince created several genre's of music before Beck was even out of grade school.  Your comment that \\"All-out weirdness for one. Edginess for another. And a fine-tuned sense of how to combine the two to create some of the decade's most vital music for a third.\\"  Frankly, those statements are plain dumb and meaningless. Think about, \\"combining\\" weirdness and edginess makes prince a black beck.  That's like saying Jimi Hendrix is the Black Jimmy Page because both where great guitarists and both pushed the boundaries of music--that's dumb.  Again, your statement is insulting to the artist and fan base and you should reconsider your comparison.

0393061310|5.0|According to the author, he was asked by a native Papua New Guinean why they do not have as much cargo as the white man. By that he meant as many goods. The author spent several years trying to answer this question. According to him, it's all about Geography, and not biology. It is not that the white men are smarter than the native Indians in the New Worlds. \\"History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves.\\"       Civilization started from the Fertile Crescent, the area north of the Middle East, today Lebanon and Syria, because ample food was present, the soil was fertile, and there were a variety of animals to domesticate. This allowed people to live together in larger communities, which in turn made innovation richer (more minds to solve a problem or invent a solution), and more people free to pursue other careers. The people of the Fertile Crescent later moved to Egypt, and into Europe. The Geography of Europe allowed this new civilization to reach them. Europe also had animals it could domesticate, giving food, and thus bigger societies. In Papua New Guinea, on the other hand, the island did not have animals to domesticate, and food was scarce. This forced the Papua New Guinean to live in smaller communities (since large communities cannot be fed). Smaller communities meant less people thus less brain power. This also meant no people were free to pursue other careers than hunting and gathering food. In larger societies, people were free to pursue those other careers which allowed them to discover steel, which led to guns, and eventually the domination of the world.    The large societies created from the Fertile Crescent meant more domesticated animals to provide food (meat, eggs, and milk), transportation (horses) and work (animals working the fields). This meant closer contact between humans and animals. This is what eventually caused thebig outbreaks of diseases, such as smallpox, that killed millions of people (according to the author, most if not all major outbreaks came from domesticated animals). However, the Europeans eventually built immunity to such diseases. When they reached the New Worlds (The Americas and Australia), the natives there, living in small communities because of lack of domesticated animals, were not immune to such diseases as the smallpox and influenza. These diseases, it is estimated by some, wiped out 90% of the American natives. Guns killed the rest.     So the central thesis of the book is this: Europeans came to dominate the world due to their favorable geographic position. Europeans had the benefits of highly fertile land and animals that could be domesticated, while the native peoples of Africa, the Pacific and the Americas did not have these assets. As a result, Europeans had a \\"head start\\" in the development of their civilization. If the natives tribes of the New Worlds had lived in Europe, says Diamond, it would be they, not Europeans, who would dominate the world today. This book makes the point that geography is what made the Europeans the superior race.    However, not all historians and scholars agree with Jared Diamond. Checking the reviews on Amazon.com, I found many readers giving a one star rating. One reviewer stated, \\"The native Indians of North America lived over land that is very fertile, and yet, despite their favorable geography, did not progress as European nations did.\\"    Another reviewer writes, \\"He expects his ignorant readers to assume that sub-Saharan Africa had no domestic table animals and plants, something that almost made me fall out of my chair with laughter. Sub-Saharan Africans live in the richest area of the planet, from minerals to fauna! The entire region is teaming with multitudes of plants and animals that would be easily domesticated: sorghum, millet, yams, and rice; guinea fowl, elephants, buffalo, giraffes, zebras, and wildebeests.\\"     Another reviewer writes, \\"On p. 92, he states that: \\"the availability of domestic plants and animals ultimately explains why empires, literacy, and steel weapons developed earliest in Eurasia and later, or not at all, on other continents.\\" That statement is false, since written records of the Ancient Egyptian (African) language have been dated from about 3200 BC, making it the oldest and longest documented language. The Sumerian language, as Diamond claims is the oldest language, developed around 3000 BC.    One reviewer writes, \\"What Jared has missed is natural selection... that 5,000 years of living in a more complex social environment has meant that the Europeans advanced genetically as their environment advanced. The Europeans who survived, were the more intelligent, the more social, more politically Machiavellian and the more immune ones.\\"    Another reviewer writes, \\"One hundred years of research has established that East Asians and Europeans average higher IQs than do Africans. East Asians, measured in North America and in Pacific Rim countries, typically average IQs in the range of 101 to 111. Caucasoid populations in North America, Europe, and Australasia typically average IQs from 85 to 115 with an overall mean of 100. African populations living south of the Sahara, in North America, in the Caribbean, and in Britain typically have mean IQs from 70 to 90... The National Collaborative Prenatal Project on 53,000 children by Sarah Broman and her colleagues showed that head perimeter at birth significantly predicts head perimeter at 7 years - and head perimeter at seven years predicts IQ. It also shows that Asian children average a larger head perimeter at birth than do White children who average a larger head perimeter than do Black children.\\" This reader is suggesting that it is biology, and not geography, that determines the superiority of a race.    One reviewer writes, \\"He dismisses the work of the psychometricians whose data, in spite of the taboos of our current state, reveal in hundreds of studies that people's intelligence vary by racial group. He throws out this data, incredibly, based on his own assessments of personal experience with different peoples. In fact, he baldly states his belief that Stone Age peoples such as New Guineans are actually on average more intelligent than white Europeans.\\"    Another reviewer writes, \\"Civilizations are built on intelligence, and where intelligence is not then, perforce, civilizations do not grow. People may be reluctant to swallow that bitter truth.\\"    One reader asks why are so called third World countries, like Middle Eastern countries, so much behind today? They are rich countries, with big cities, lots of food and domesticated animals, yet behind in all the sciences. According to this reader, it is the freedom given by the European nations to its people that made them superior to other races.   Finally, one reviewer states, \\"If east-west trade routes and available plant and animal life were all there were to it, why then civilization should have risen in Europe a billion years earlier!\\"    This book is a fascinating read and very convincing. Also watch the DVD documentary based on this book.
0316067598|3.0|The story in this book is gripping and important. As a wife of a retired military member, I read what I always feared for my husband and his friends.

0743420373|4.0|Millionaires don't spend as much as we think and don't live a lavish life. That's why they are millionaires. Most drive second hand cars or drive the same car for over 10 years. They live in middleclass neighborhoods and don't wear expensive clothes or jewelry. One must be frugal to become a millionaire.    This book will show you how to make a million, and keep it! There are some simple rules to follow, such as to live well below one's means and choosing the right occupation. According to the authors, anyone can accumulate wealth. All that is needed is discipline, determination, and perseverance. And above all, to be frugal!    But we are all going to die one day, right? So shouldn't we enjoy our lives? Sure we have to save money for our retirement and for our kids' schooling, but we can easily do that by not being millionaire! Just a thought.    I did enjoy reading the book and found it to be scholarly written. But to be honest, I gave up reading it about two-thirds of the way through. It was too repetitive; the message is the same. To be a millionaire you must save more and spend less. I will start saving more, but not too much more. Life is too short to be a miser with one's self.
B000MR9D5E|3.0|You may be wondering why I didn't give this beautiful work 5 stars. This is because I'm objectively reviewing its educational value. As a life-long avid fan of the BBC nature documentaries and all things Sir David Attenborough, I will be reviewing Planet Earth in a more historical context, comparing it to previous releases:    Overview: Planet Earth attempts to cover the rich natural variety of the planet by focusing on one type of habitat/region per episode and displaying both the landscape and wildlife that occupy it. The venerable David Attenborough narrates (but is only partially involved in the writing this time) with his incomparable and dependable blend of warmth and objectivity. The BBC crew, as always, take their technical know-how to new heights, filming in high definition with all the advancing technology at their disposal to create another beautiful series.    This conceptual approach is not new for the BBC and has been covered already by The Living Planet (TLP) and will therefore be compared to it. Also, the heavy emphasis on spectacular hunts has been covered in Predators, as have the specific topics of penguins (Life in the Freezer), oceans (Blue Planet), birds (The Life of Birds) etc. and in much more depth.    Scope: The habitats covered overlap the ones in TLP but also cover new 'exciting' areas such as caves and mountains, skipping some of the more mundane but basic territories of grass-lands and coast-lines covered in TLP. Therefore this release is somewhat complementary to TLP in this regard.    Focus: Planet Earth is somewhat weak here, seemingly unable to drop beautiful images and stop exploring specific animals that it finds, all to the detriment of the theme of the episode. TLP managed to show only what is necessary for the topic, quickly skimming over many examples and varieties, and yet also provided more depth and information.    Structure: Very weak, even pathetic. TLP progressed logically from small to big, from simple to complex, and followed the timeline and progression of the features/animals it  explored comprehensively. Planet Earth, however, feels almost random, in love with its beautiful images, slow-motions, and whimsically exploring very specific animals for many minutes at a time.    Educational value: Due to all of the above and its lack of depth, Planet Earth obviously suffers in comparison when it comes to making you feel educated. It focuses more on exotics, sensationalism, exciting hunts and kills, rare animals, wonders of the world, grand vistas, big dangers and huge numbers rather than bombarding us with information on the relevant facts and necessary details as in TLP.    Presentation: Obviously, Planet Earth is miles above TLP in terms of image quality, the rarity of things they managed to capture on film, and its style. But is that all we need?    David Attenborough: I miss the more intimate era of TLP where he used the planet as his classroom.    Summary: This is a sensationalist companion piece to The Living Planet. It gives a good feel of the riches of the planet, both overlaps and complements TLP in its scope, but is much less educational and well-structured. If you want screen-saver images, amazing footage and beauty, grab it. If you emphasize educational value, I suggest starting elsewhere first.      Side-Note: This release makes me think...what's next? I mean, Blue Planet and Life in the Undergrowth covered the last two obvious gaps in the BBC nature documentary repertoire. Planet Earth is their first 'remake'. Are we to expect more of the same? Will they start scraping the bottom of the barrel from now on? Will there be only more beautiful but mindless repetition? Or perhaps they will just keep seaching for new exotic things we haven't seen yet? Obviously there is always more to learn and see with nature but it feels like they covered everything systematically and the era of the fascinating introductory overview series is over. Perhaps more in-depth documentaries is the way to go but given the trends and where the money is, i doubt they'll do that. I'm apprehensive - is this the beginning of the end?
006054094X|5.0|Did the Chinese discover America in 1421, a century before Columbus? Not only does the author believes so, but he also convincingly argues that the Chinese were the first to circumnavigate the world.    The author argues that all great European navigators, such as Columbus and Magellan, had maps in their possession that already outlined the continents of North and South America, as well as Cape Horn, before they ever set sail there. This proves that someone else must have discovered those continents first. According to the author, it was the Chinese.    During the Ming Dynasty, the Chinese emperor Zhu Di ordered a fleet of over one hundred ships, some 400 feet long (much bigger than the ships of Columbus) to be built for the purpose of both exploring and intimidating the world. A Muslim eunuch led the fleet.    This is an exciting and very convincing tale.    The author argues that many European explorers later said that they encountered Chinese settlers in both North and South America. DNA testing has shown that Indians in the Americas are very close in DNA to Chinese. Archaeological remains were found pointing to Chinese settlers in the Americas.    However many scholars debate the author's theories due to the fact that not much evidence on these voyages comes from China. When the survivors of this great fleet returned to China, the Emperor had died, and the new Emperor, wanting to shield his empire from the outside world, ordered all documents relating to the discoveries of the fleet to be burned. All maps and logs of the fleet were burnt!     Also, if the Chinese did visit the Americas first, they would have infected the indigenous population with disease such as the flu, which would have wiped out a big percentage of the population, but would also have immunized the later generations against infectious diseases when the Europeans finally came. This of course did not happen.     Why did the Chinese not visit Europe on their way to the Americas? This is a puzzling fact. There are also no European record of the Chinese fleet.     This is a compelling theory, and the book reads like a novel. If the author's theories are proven correct, then history will have to be rewritten. I highly recommend it.

The special effects are sufficiently advanced and the acting is fairly good (as it was in the whole series).  This is not high-brow entertainment, but if you want a fun story that moves fast enough and requires enough thought to keep you interested, this movie qualifies.  The movie also ends the series with enough tied up loose ends to more or less satisfy, but also leaves open the possiblity that more will come (and hopefully it will.)
B00003CXSM|5.0|One of my very favorite movies. I had to have my own copy. Amazon always sends things so quickly.
B00005K3OT|5.0|This movie is very fun to watch.  Probably more of a chick-flick, or maybe a date movie (if you have a tolerant guy), but very well acted, and the story is a lot of fun.
B000QUCNP4|5.0|ZODIAC is an excellent film and well-worth watching.  However if you are interested in viewing the extras only, as was I; be aware that they will not be coming out until the \\"Director's Cut\\" is released in 2008.
B000T9OP7G|4.0|Caught this on the net, pretty good for TV. Eager for more now. Story was sound and effects were good, endoskeleton, gun fights. Hopefully it will be picked up and be successful. Picks up from T2, ignore T3!  Lena does a good job, the Queen from 300. Well worth a watch.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Can't really say enough about this Super Show.  You can't get better than this. Clapton was incredible in his playing and singing. I thought the number by Jools Holland stole the show. I did hope that Paul & Ringo would team up with Julian Lennon and Dhani Harrison for this, but I guess that is asking too much.
B000LE0THO|5.0|I still remember this album from when it came out. I remember the tv ad with two teenagers making out in a car and all of a sudden a flash of light. \\"What's that?\\" she asks. He replies \\"Why it's the new album from the Electric Light Orchestra\\" while pulling it down from the roof of the car. This album starts with the big hit Turn To Stone and already you can here the disco influence that would become more prevalant on the band's Discovery album. Still, it is a good song. It's Over has always been one of my favorite ELO songs and it's never sounded better than on this edition. Back when this album came out, I couldn't stand the hit Sweet Talkin' Woman but it really doesn't sound as bad now. Across The Border is fun. Night In The City and Starlight are both nice enough. Jungle, Believe Me Now and Steppin' Out are great songs. Jungle is fun. Believe In Me Now and Steppin' Out show Jeff's Beatles influence and are better for it. What used to be side three is Concerto For A Rainy Day and is/was the most consistant side of the old album including the third big hit, Mr. Blue Sky. Sweet Is The Night is nice. The Whale is another great song. Birmingham Blues is only ok and Wild West Hero is better. The unreleased bonus tracks are short but good. It is to Jeff's credit, that unlike most two record sets at the time, there are no real terrible songs on here. As far as the packaging of this one, I don't currently see what all the complaints are about. First of all, the Joe Gastwirt version came out in 1987 and not 1990 and as far as a few brief dropouts, those are on the master tapes. Most albums recorded in the late '70's have this problem as the tapes actually fall apart and need to be \\"baked\\". I like the fact that they went for a version that actually sounds like the master tapes which makes this sound more like the original release and not overly remastered(IE new mixes, erased parts and stuff like that). My first copy of this was from 1977(without dropouts) and in 1982 I bought a fresh copy but by that time the dropouts were already there. The Gastwirt version was from a cleaned up vinyl copy and the dropouts are on there too as well as the box set versions of the songs. As far as the box, I've gotten cd's that have been worse packaged than this one including a couple by ELO. I would suggest putting a wrapper around the box to help keep it from getting too dinged up. I like the fact that there's a mini version of the put it together spaceship that used to come with the lp and I like the interview with Jeff Lynne. I should add that the other new version comes with an edited booklet and doesn't have the nice stuff that this one does.ught a fresh copy but by that time the dropouts were already there.

B000OYC3J8|5.0|For the longest time the White Stripes were my guilty pleasure. Saying their name around musicians is like uttering the name Charles Darwin among Christians or George Bush among Democrats. However, the Whites seem oblivious to outside praise and criticism. They are an anomaly: A two piece band who reduces genres to their bare essentials to see how many ways they can twist, hammer, and shape it into something viable. They do this without an ounce of flash or technical abilities. Jack's near juvenile guitar playing, and Meg's \\"trained monkey on drums\\" abilities are among the worst in all of music. The Stripes are essentially an exercise in maximization through minimalization. The variations and nuances they're able to saturate this simplicity with is extraordinary. The results are endlessly surprising and rewarding.    They also seem to alternate - album wise - between interpretations on traditional forms (rock, pop, folk) and experimentation: Although these two sides - the traditional and experimental - are almost always integrated, the focus usually remains on one. De Stijl was their most traditional blues/pop album, with Elephant being a logical progression on that concept that expanded the overall palette. White Blood Cells is perhaps their quirkiest, as it leaped into vast new territories and styles, with Get Behind Me Satan being a focused, refined, near perfection of that stylish mishmash. Now to Icky Thump: At once a return to tradition and complete perfection of it. The spiritual precursor to Icky is Elephant - not the experimental Get Behind Me Satan. The first three songs epitomize this concept:    The title track is monumental, crushing rock. Featuring a towering riff from Jack White, A pulsing \\"thud\\" beat from Meg. Along with a vocal delivery that teeters on the edge of manic breakdown and complete control, spitting venom the entire time. \\"You Don't Know What Love Is\\" is a foray back to De Stijl and pop in its purest form with no excess. It's also perhaps(and I say this tentatively) the  best pop song Jack has written. From electric and eclectic to calm with aplomb (bad wordplay, I know) we get to \\"300 M.P.H. Torrential Outpour Blues\\" (I have to gasp just saying it!). This song evokes Bob Dylan like nothing else I've heard from the White Stripes or anyone. The reiterated acoustic lick is absorbing in its meditative restraint. The electric breaks only provide a contrast rather than a driving force to the track.    Then we head into the experimental grasp of Jack again. \\"Conquest\\" is pounding and incessant, with its horn flourishes evoking a definite Mexicano vibe. From Mexico to Ireland (or Scotland) we get \\"Prickly Thorn, But Sweetly Worn\\". An acoustic, Irish (Scottish?) clog dance that's as charming as anything Jack has done. \\"St. Andrew\\" provides a kind of epilogue to \\"Prickly Thorn' with its accelerating rhythm being lead by a lively bagpipe and miniscule female vocals. \\"Little Cream Soda\\" continues the 'Little' tradition, returning to the metal tones of \\"Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground\\" with a distortion drenched riff from Jack that's as good as any he's produced. \\"Catch Hell Blues\\" features a tumultuous slide riff that's vaguely reminiscent of \\"Little Bird\\" from De Stijl, but more hellish and electric. Jack also hasn't lost his sense of humor. Both \\"Rag & Bone\\" and \\"Effect & Cause\\" are as whimsical as anything he's done. The former being a rhythmic, comical take on requesting people's unwanteds and the latter being a country-esque romp on refusing to accept the consequences of one's actions.    What catapults this album above the previous Stripes' efforts is Jack's transcendent leap in his lyrical and vocal stylings. I normally don't care for lyrics, but Jack White forces you to pay attention to his due to the inventiveness at which he writes and the originality in which he delivers. The title track being a prime example: At first it sounds akin to a rapper's delivery as Jack rhythmically blurts out variations on \\"ump\\", while expanding on this concept throughout. Jack wrenches, bends, twists and distorts syllables; emphasizing serpentine rhythmic drive over melody. This is similar to The Beatles' most experimental vocal work, and Dylan's flow of delivery. Jack's variety of emotive abilities are among the best in all of modern music. If the idea of song is the fusion of music and words - where one acts to enhance the other - then The Stripes may personify that idea better than any other these days.    This album only 'fails' - a better term would be \\"fail to surpass previous efforts\\" - when Jack doesn't push himself. Reverting back to comfortable territory. \\"Bone Broke\\" is an attempt to return to their punkish, garage days - but it is no Fell In Love With a Girl. Both \\"I'm Slowly Turning Into You\\" and \\"A Martyr for My Love for You\\" are decent, but lacking in the freshness the rest of the album permeates. However, their inclusion is welcome as they're too good to be considered filler.     If any Stripes albums could truly be called serious, then Icky Thump is the furthest away from that definition. Rather, this is Jack and Meg at their most playful and fun. Confident in what they can do, they produce songs that effortlessly fit within their respective abilities. As always, variety is key. Acoustic, electric, and ultimately eclectic, Icky Thump isn't a radical departure for the Whites, but just an assured, adept execution of their wealth of styles and ideas. It's the nuances that reward repeated listens. This isn't musically dense material, but it's subtle music all the same. Perhaps the only other fault is that in the Stripes' refusal to strive for eminence they may also never reach the heights of albums like Highway 61, Sgt. Pepper, or Born to Run (insert your applicable favorites). If Icky Thump is their peak (and it may be), then I only wonder where they go from here.    The White Stripes have transformed me from a hesitant supporter into an avid one. If Get Behind MeSatan was my acquiescence, then Icky Thump was my revelation. No longer do I consider them my great \\"guilty pleasure\\". I could solely appreciate the fearlessness at which they tackle everything. Most bands walk on eggshells afraid of failing, but The Stripes seem apathetic to the notion that they could - with any misstep - ruin their popularity. Instead, they seem rather insouciant about the entire thing - likely wondering how a quirky garage band ended up being hailed as the 'saviors' of pop music. They seem to belong to a bygone era. One in which bands pushed themselves into uncharted waters - daring themselves to improve - growing and evolving in the studio instead of behind closed doors. Perhaps, most importantly, they seem to produce everything with a real sense of passion and honesty, completely lacking any of the contrivances and pretenses in modern pop and rock music.     In the end, I can only echo what Steve Vai (I believe it was) said about them: \\"Out of tune. Out of time. Beautiful.\\"
0812975219|4.0|Taleb warns you at the outset that the book is like a conversation or essay, instead of a self-help or a treatise book. With that in mind, I found it extremely readable - finished it at one go - and I'll never look at every day statistics the same way again.
B000F48CD8|4.0|The Raconteurs mesh together so many influences on their debut that it's easy to lose track of how many there are in a given song much less throughout the CD. Aside from the bands like the Beatles and Led Zeppelin, whose influences you can hear everywhere, I even pick up bits from such divergent sounds as Queen, (A little \\"Keep Yourself Alive\\" riff in \\"Hands\\") and ELP (Opening organ on \\"Store Bought Bones\\") and they make it work for them. This is not a White side project (as if it could be with Benson's participation) but a fully realized band with a great sound. Hopefully, this is not a one shot deal and The Raconteurs continue to record. I would like to see them further develop this sound, leaning a bit less on the past and taking a few more chances.
B000O75F7C|4.0|Fear of a Blank Planet by the band Porcupine Tree neatly picks up where the band's previous outing, Deadwing, leaves off.  This CD openly owes a lot to bands like Pink Floyd, the later King Crimson (Robert Fripp is a guest guitarist on this CD) and The Police.  Leader Steven Wilson is still hard at work here with his bleak lyrics and bleaker vocals, but always there, moving the music along, is drummer Gavin Harrison.  This work is a bit more driven then Deadwing and while the cuts My Ashes and Sentimental let you up for air, these songs are in no way comparable to the tune Lazarus from Deadwing.  The title tune is great, but very dark.  Maybe the weakness here, if any, is that the Thrash Metal direction the group seems to be taking is puzzling.  But, another good and consistant work is Fear of a Blank Planet.  Progressive, neo-Psychedelic, whatever, fans of the group will not be disappointed.  Give it a try if you are not a fan, I think you will like it.
B000GY729M|4.0|SAM'S TOWN immediately hits the listener with a sound that is significantly different from HOT FUSS. If it wasn't for the vocals, it would be fair to say you were listening to a totally different band. This type of change is risky in a new band; the fear being that fans will be alienated. Personally, I love when bands continue to evolve and search for new sounds and themes. It keeps things from becoming boring and it prevents that, \\"Didn't I hear this before?\\" feeling.     The question is it successful? The answer is, \\"Yes.\\"    Hard driving anthems relating to genuine emotions triumph over artifice and The Killers pull it off very well here. Flowers' voice strains for creditability when pushed, but he pulls it off and while lacking the force of many other rockers, his vulnerability makes the songs that much better. While they don't all come off with the same power , the songs hold up in their new settings and  the total package comes together. While still not a classic, this is a worthy effort from The Killers and I hope they continue to push themselves to make music worth listening to.
B0009A40ES|4.0|the director who made this maybe by choice(hopefully not though)left out so much from the book that helped the story hit home.bale plays bateman to a t,but he should've been allowed to get..well....MORE psycho! the part in the book when he crucifies his ex-girlfriend should've been in there,but who knows--low budget,bad taste,anything could be the reason. the dvd on the other hand is great with zero manufacturing flaws and a great transfer.
B000E6UK32|4.0|This collection contains most of Blondie's best with a few exceptions, most notably, \\"X-Offender\\" and \\"I'm Always Touched by Your Presence, Dear.\\" Hardcore fans have noted different versions here, but the casual fan will be satisfied with this set. Blondie has always been about style over substance, but definitely has influenced such artists as Madonna and Gwen Stefani. The range of music they cover from rap to reggae also demonstrates rock's amazing ability to encompass many different sounds and this demonstrates Blondie's impact on popular music.   The DVD has a different effect. While the music has a timelessness that will hold up, the videos are like a time capsule showing how much this art form has changed and now ends up being a curiosity. For the most part they are lip sync performance clips with a few very dated effects. You'll watch it once and then forget about it.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|The statement above can be argued, but Stranger Than Fiction is for sure one of Will Ferrel's best films. Like what the Truman Show did for Jim Carrey, Stranger Than Fiction has taken an actor who is mainly known for comedy and has proven that he can also be believable in serious drama roles as well. Not to say that this film doesn't have its funny moments, but there is also a lot of depth in the story and it is easy to feel for the characters.<br /><br />Needless to say because of the star power in the film, the acting was equally as impressive. Dustin Hoffman, Queen Latifa and the list goes on from there. There were moments in the movie that had me laughing a while after the jokes was done, and there are scenes that are so emotional, it made me want to tear up and cry. I definitely see this as a stand out movie of the year and you definitely can't go wrong watching this movie.
B000QUCNP4|5.0|Absolutley riveting film. Unparalleled performances.<br /><br />Downey is best, Ruffalo is top of his game, and Gyllenhaal is quite good. And John Carroll Lynch delivers several of the most intimidating moments in a small role you might ever see. Was never sold on Brian Cox as Melvin Belli (he's OK, but seems uncomfortable in the role) and there are several actors today who would have probably brought it up a few notches. (He appears to have stolen Brando's Jor-El wig from 'Superman').<br /><br />But it is the pacing, the timed release of certain bits of crucial information, the red herrings, and the look and feel of this film that make it work.<br /><br />Wait for the Director's Cut, to be released in 2008, before buying.<br /><br />Lastly --  people, please, stop with the whining about \\"it's too long.\\" What is so important in people's lives that they can't even let a film playout the way a director wants it to? \\"Too long\\" is not a review. It means you think you have something better to do. Well, go do it, and leave the great, long stories to the rest of us.<br /><br />Best film of 2007, so far.
B000002KKS|5.0|Ozzy's gone, replaced by Ronnie James Dio from Rainbow, resulting in an ambitious theme with some of the very best song lyrics in tmy extensive Rock collection, with music to match.    Underappreciated by a market that was hoping for more of the same, maybe they should have changed their name?  You know, people feel very stongly about religion, even if it's apathy, so this was about as much risk-taking as any group will EVER take.      Obviously, I think it worked out - it's nearly 30 years later and I'm still quite taken with the lyrics.  At least try \\"Children of the Sea\\", where the symbol-laden lyrics aren't merely the best in my entire collection, but may be deemed of historical significance in future religious history.  It's not merely an important album, but great Rock!  The finest piece of art I'll ever own.
B00000IFP6|5.0|With 46 reviews already posted one can be brief. New editions of the symphonies plus the skill of Zinman and his orchestra result in the best Beethoven symphonies I have heard. Joyful, heroic, crystal clear.... Beethoven was a great orchestrator, and its great to hear the woodwinds, in particular, with such clarity.  Five stars easy.

B00005JPLW|5.0|OK....I admit it - I only went to see \\"300\\" w/ my husband to be a good sport.  [He and our sons are fans/critics of graphic novels, comic book officianados/collectors/commentators who had anxiously awaited the film's release; I am \\"just\\" an English/literature educator w/ a love of history and good artistic interpretation of both.]  HOWEVER, I was absolutely stunned by this movie.      It is captivating, artistic, motivational, and NEVER dull.  Of course, Gerard Butler and his army are easy-on-the-eye, but the sheer choreography of this movie throughout makes it worth viewing multiple times.  Myriad artistic elements - sensual as well as visual - mesmerize the viewer; many \\"stand up and cheer\\" moments prevail - not only during battle, but for the people: brave - STRONG - women (\\"we bear Spartan warriors\\") undaunted by formidable foes or standing up for their convictions; men who do not shirk insurmountable odds, death, or facing its prospect; children taught to believe in what their culture holds dear, true, and of moral value.  I anticipated the blood baths, but was not put off by them because of the digitalization; the \\"slo-mo\\" sequences, with the graphic novel effects, especially complemented the film's genre and delivery; the comic effects were adequate exaggerations without being \\"comedic\\" in any way. The whole presentation was a work of art, w/ a masterfully rendered musical score contributing even more to the emotion of each scene - right up to the end...how could you not leave feeling a chord deep inside your soul had been struck?  The portrayal of dignity and peace, even in death, was phenomenal.    While I do know enough of ancient history to understand there were deviations from the truth, it was opportune that the History Channel chose to air the \\"real\\" accounting of events of Thermopylae/the 300 several times during the premiere week, so it was an excellent way to set the record straight in my mind.  Nonetheless, I feel the movie's portrayal of these ancient warriors and this particular battle does nothing to diminish the idea that they were noble beyond compare.    All that to say that I will purchase the special edition when it's released - for ME...and maybe I'll share it with my husband! :-)
B000OQF6N6|4.0|Upon first listen, I was disappointed.  Not much on this album reached out and grabbed me as \\"This is Pumpkins!!!\\", but it did enough so to keep me listening.  After a few spins through the album and a review of the rest of the SP catalog, it began to grow on me.  In all, it is a good listen, but may not satisfy some die hard fans or casual listeners.      I suspect several singles will get airplay, including \\"Tarantula\\", \\"That's the Way (My Love Is)\\", and \\"Bring The Light\\". \\"(Come On) Let's Go!\\", which would be MTV bound if they still played videos, is among my favorites along with others that seem to have all the SP elements, are \\"7 Shades of Black\\" and \\"Bleeding the Orchid\\".    If you want something a little different, but catchy and upbeat, sample \\"Starz\\".  There is obviously some political content amongst the tracks, like the anthem \\"Unites States\\" and \\"God and Country\\", but Corgan's lyrics are so fractured that it's easy just to enjoy it for the music, or make up your own meaning!  (Sorry Billy, I just ain't buyin, so stop tryin)      I am really enjoying this album now, and find myself far less boring and depressing than the odd ballads of Mellon Collie.  I'd say this album is a good blend of Siamese Dream and Mellon Collie while showing some growth in most elements, if not lyrics.
B000PWQPAC|4.0|I might rate it higher if I got to watch it. It began skipping at 10 minutes in on my main DVD player. While it didn't skip at 10 mins on another player, it did have the Ch15 skip (an earlier reviewer had mentioned) on all my players. I am currently in the process of getting a replacement through Amazon, hopefully it won't have the errors.    Edit: There was a recall of the first pressing of this disc. The replacement was fine, and the movie was good. Not as good as the original, and perhaps not as good as SAC (but that was a series), but still pretty good (on par with \\"2nd Gig\\").
B000P2A256|5.0|While I have never really considered myself a big Maroon 5 \\"fan\\", I have really enjoyed \\"Songs About Jane\\" and was looking forward to this release.  Upon hearing the first single \\"Makes Me Wonder\\", I was wondering 'should I even bother taking the chance'.  Honestly, I wasn't going to buy it, but iTunes had a great deal with presale concert tickets, so I took the plunge.    After more than half a dozen listens, this album has REALLY grown on me.  I was hoping for something like \\"Songs About Jane\\", but this was something really different, yet distinctly Maroon 5.  I have heard the comparisons to some of the smooth-rock/pop icons from the 70's and 80's, and I totally agree, in a good way.  This album is a bit more Pop than SAJ, every song still carries the signatures of Maroon 5;  groovy bass lines, a good hook, angst vs. love lyrics, and beautiful harmony between the lyrics and music.  Of course not every song is gold, but I think there is something here to satisfy a variety of casual and die-hard fans.    There's enough here that I finally have to declare myself a true fan.
B000006TRV|5.0|What else can be said about this album.  I was ten when \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\" hit the charts.  This was one of the first albums I ever owned.  Went through a cassette, two copies on vinyl and this was my first CD I purchased in the late 80s when CDs hit the market.  Absorbed the movie (the movie box covers became my notebook cover in high school) and everything Pink Floyd I could.  It was the defining album of my youth, Waters capturing that anguish and angst of maturing in a cynical world.       I grew out of it over time and it has become something of a memory machine, revisiting the past and the intensity of that time as I sought meaning in life.  It has no relevance on that level anymore.    However, I stumbled across \\"Pink Floyd: Under Construction\\" which contains  demos of the process by which The Wall came to be.  Apparently, Waters, in the late 70s, came to the band with ideas for The Wall and what would become The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking.  The band thought the material for The Wall had potential and began to build on it (though there are traces of The Wall material in the Hitchhiking album or vice versa).    Though for the most part it is the same album, there are some subtle and significant differences in the songs as we know them, mostly in the lyrics.    Comfortably Numb originally began for Gilmour's first solo album but made its way into The Wall.  Gilmour brings the melody; Waters adds the lyrics.  However, imagine these lyrics in \\"Comfortably Numb\\":      \\"Wake up now, pull yourself togeather  Get out and meet new people (Scream)  I'm sure they'll understand  Come on, put away the shotgun,  Here have another blue one(Scream)  Have your fingertips gone numb?\\"     Or these for \\"Mother\\":    \\"Mama's gonna check out all your girlfriends for you  Mama won't let anyone dirty get through  Mama's gonna burn all your pornography  She'll watch what you see and watch what you hear...\\"    It's fascinating to listen to these demos after knowing the albumso well.  It's as if I'm hearing it for the first time and it is mind blowing this time from a more historical, archival point of view rather than as music that defines my emotional life.    You'll find the song What Shall We Do Now? in the film but not on the album, though the lyrics are on the inner sleeve of the original album.  The song is on the Under Construction disc.  Young Lust is just an instrumental.  This is a fan's dream.  It's like being there as the creative process unfolds and you can see the roll Bob Ezrin played in bringing this to its finished form that we all know.     Hunt down a copy of Under Construction and really, really appreciate just how amazing this album really is.    You can also get hints of Roger Waters taking control of the direction of the sound and how it would culminate with Floyd in The Final Cut, the trajectory Waters taking climaxing with The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking (also very recommended).
1881273156|5.0|This book provided great insight into why so many people, including myself, are insecure in relationships and constantly feel like they are failing.  The old cliché of poor communication is brought to new light by examining the communication of emotion.  The \\"Love Languages\\" are broken down into 5 basic categories, but the book is so much more than that, you really must read it.  The advice really covers relationships of all kinds, though most examples are of married couples.  I would suggest this to everyone who interacts with others (um... yeah, everyone).    The reading is fairly light and not too clinical.  While there was obviously some research done, this book is not all about facts and studies or survey responses, just some wisdom based on study and experience backed up by some counseling principals.    For anyone worried that this is a \\"Christian\\" book, it is.  But it is not a beat-you-over-the-head-with-verses book.  Anyone should be able to appreciate the principals of human interaction in this book, regardless of your background, beliefs, or convictions.  The \\"God talk\\" will help Christians put everything in context, but others can read around it without losing much.
B000056JYB|5.0|All I have to say is that this is one collection of musicians who can truly label themselves \\"Supergroup\\". The entire 2 CD set with previously unreleased studio and live tracks is strong all the way through, and the two versions of 'Can't Find My Home' are incredible examples of separating acoustic from electric to create two completely different sounds for the same song. I suggest this item to anyone who knows and appreciates rock music even in the smallest way - this CD set is that good - so get yourself a little something that you won't ever regret.
B000P2A24W|3.0|The scarily large hair and outrageously tight trousers may have fallen by the wayside, but Bon Jovi are back with their tenth studio album, and it's a surprisingly country-influenced record.<br /><br />Lost Highway hasn't lost any of the huge sing-along choruses that has made Bon Jovi one of the largest stadium rocking bands in the world, but to their credit, they are trying something a bit different at the same time as giving their fans what they want. They have always flirted a bit with country/cowboy symbols in the past (''Wanted Dead Or Alive'', anybody?) but this time have got down and done the dirty on an album described as 'a Bon Jovi record influenced by Nashville'.<br /><br />There are tracks here that are disappointingly pedestrian, such as Summertime, which you just want to end as soon as it starts, but then comes ''We Got It Going On'', a song stuffed full of classic Richie Sambora talkbox action, extended guitar solos, gravely vocals, name checks for Jon, and Richie, and the immortal line `we'll be bangin' and sangin' just like the Rolling Stones'.<br /><br />''(You Want To) Make A Memory'' and ''Seat Next To You'' are definite lighter in the air moments, but ''Everybody's Broken'' is a real stadium classic with lyrics like `when you wonder why you're breathing/know you're not alone/it's so hard to believe/when it's easier to doubt'. You can almost hear Dolly Parton singing, sorry sangin', the words.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Bon Jovi then there is nothing here that you won't like. For others, it certainly won't blow you away, but it won't make your ears bleed either. However, if you're after the likes of the classic 80s Slippery When Wet album, you won't find it here. Think big guitars tempered with country stylings, lyrics of emotional turmoil and ordinary people striving for something better, and you'll be about there.

B000QFAJ7S|4.0|Are you on Team Kelly or Team Clive? It seems like everybody chose sides before even hearing My December, Kelly Clarkson's darker, more personal, riskier third CD. There are those who see her as a bird escaping a gilded cage, co-writing her entire album and bravely forsaking the hitmakers Clive Davis assigned to 2004's five-times-platinum Breakaway. Others view Clarkson as a spoiled brat, so impressed by her success that she's telling the industry's most established father figure to take a hike.<br /><br />Recent management changes and her canceled tour have furthered the assumption that December must be a train wreck. It's not. There's real artistry blossoming on this, the boldest and best effort ever by an Idol star.<br /><br />That's not to say that Davis was off his rocker when he purportedly didn't hear a hit, because the disc does lack even half as obvious a smash as ''Since U Been Gone.'' There was subversive fun to be had in witnessing America's sweetheart using ''Never Again,'' the he-done-me-wrong first single, to reinvent herself as a banshee (wishing gangrene on an enemy, no less). But she's not playing to her strengths when paying pissy homage to Jagged Little Pill, even if she is channeling Alanis Morissette by way of the octave-spanning Pat Benatar.<br /><br />Where Clarkson hits us with her best shot is in the confessionals in which she ditches the blame game and draws her own blood. She's not as close to catching up with her songwriting idol, Patty Griffin, as she is to her belter heroine, Benatar. Nonetheless, Clarkson's most vulnerable moments are accomplished and affecting -- from the frisky pleadings of ''Can I Have a Kiss'' to the near-suicidal despair of ''Irvine.'' If you ever wondered what Sarah McLachlan would sound like with an extra set of lungs, check out ''Maybe''; it's a great slow build of a ballad in which Clarkson fantasizes about how the guy who got away would really understand her, if only she had another chance. The sentiment reeks of desperation, but with vocal willpower this indomitable, you're surprised her ex hasn't been sucked into the studio by song's end.<br /><br />But just when you think Miss Independent has morphed into Miss Misery, Clarkson unleashes some lighter pleasures that (take note, Team Clive!) would make dandy warm-weather singles -- much more than ''Never Again'' or ''Sober,'' the moody second release. ''One Minute'' percolates with electro-pop energy; ''How I Feel'' is a one-woman new-wave revival; and the funk-rock ''Yeah'' suggests that she's an R&B sex bomb waiting to happen. Still, basking in the winter of My December's greater discontent isn't such a bad way to chill this summer, either.t with vocal willpower this indomitable, you're surprised her ex hasn't been sucked into the studio by song's end.

0784010188|5.0|It is interesting to watch this fifteen years later and see how it holds up. This was the movie that ushered in the era of digital sound, it also showed morphing, environment mapping and these things that were already present in much shorter form in [[ASIN:B00005V9IL The Abyss (Special Edition)]] during the water creature sequence.    From the plot standpoint, this is the only Terminator movie that could have worked without Arnie. And maybe this is not a coincidence, it probably was conceived that way. If Arnold would have demanded too big a paycheck, this probably would have become \\"Sara and John get chased by the T-1000\\". And it probably would have been almost as good. That being said, it is great to have Arnie back, because when the first part had him act like a (pretty scary) machine, here he is in a way more human than in most of his other roles where he plays actual humans.    One could almost be a bit nostalgic for the time when Hollywood could still produce carefully thought-out blockbusters that rocked and even had a bit of wit. Watching \\"Die Hard 4\\" a few weeks ago was a good reminder how deeply the American film industry has fallen since then.    As far as the extra features on the DVD are concerned, I am grateful that James Cameron did not include that horrible sugar-coated coda in the theater version. It would have single-handedly wiped out the whole movie, it is so cringe-inducing. (Yes, even more cringe-inducing than Arnold's acting and the occasional bad SFX.)    In \\"Terminator 2\\", Cameron gives us great action scenes, punctuated by slower, more dialogue-heavy scenes. The film is long because it takes its time to draw its characters, and it does not rush to its conclusion but lets us savor it.    A few things look a bit ridiculous of course, like the obvious puppet of Arnie when he walks towards the cops at Cyberdyne while being shot at and that determinedly downtempo synthesizer music in some of the action scenes sometimes is a little embarrassing.Most cell phones can probably synthesize better sound today. But that does not detract from the accomplishment of the movie, which is built on character, situation, and a solid understanding of pacing.
B000N3ST7K|3.0|Well, I can't say this is the best Tarantino soundtrack, the assembly of songs is not very homogeneous, and I don't like them all. Some are quite good though like the one from Ennio Morricone, and the Coasters.
0815411839|5.0|Donald Spoto, a very well respected biographer, has written what is probably the best biography of the 50s icon. Contrary to a previous review here, he does not spend that much time on her death; what he DOES do though is give very plausible facts from inside sources that make sense. The hysterical theories and ravings of conspiracy loons that abound out there are not to be found here, and Spoto easily strips away their credibility. Spoto has obviously interviewed people that actually knew Marilyn, not fans who have one snapshot taken with the star that they turn into a career. Get this book--it is the one to refer to.

1594489505|5.0|I didn't just enjoy this book, I was deeply affected by it.  Housseni is a gifted writer and pulls you into the world of his characters with such skill that you feel their pain, happiness, frustration and fear.  The book's impact is deepened by the fact that as you are reading it, you know that, while it is fiction, it could very well be true.  I have recommended this book to everyone I know and can't wait to read it again once I get my copy back.  A beautiful, deeply moving book.  Bravo.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|This album is fantastic!  It's a far cry from her first album, and more mature than her second.  It's got a bit of an organic, blues-rock sound to it, which I absolutely adore.    There's been a lot of negative press about this album, but in my opinion it's all completely unfounded.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|This is an EXCELLENT CD. Congratulations to Kelly for trying an edgier sound and pulling it off. Not one bad song on this CD. This girl will be around for a long time. Beautiful and talented. AND SHE CAN SING. Highly recommended.
B000E0WJIC|4.0|After listening to this album I'll hook you guys up with a review.  These guys really aren't the best metal musicians becuase of really simple guitar riffs.  Even though they are simple they have a catchy tune and good song writing.  Matt Tuck (lead singer) should sing most songs in their future beucause the other singer just gets annoying with his screams in the backround.  I don't listen to most new metal bands but this band really has talent.  I would rank them above any metal band that came out in the 2000's.  This album really doesn't have a bad track except for \\"her voice resides\\".  Hope you guys like my drunk review and give me a good rating.  Buy or download this album!!!

B000RIHBIE|5.0|Sum 41 returns with a bang, and it seems like they have their pre-Chuck sound back. Not that I didn't enjoy Chuck, because it had some great, highly underrated songs. Sum 41 seems to transition nicely in this album, obviously showing they can mature, but still hold onto their roots. In \\"Underclass Hero,\\" such songs as Underclass Hero and March of the Dogs are political, but I don't mind it since I am too. A lot of people are comparing them to blink-182 or Green Day, but I disagree, even though some familiarities are present. They retrain their old rocking, high-tempo beats. The lyrics in \\"Underclass Hero\\" are unlike their earlier albums. The lyrics are very mature, and nicely written. Deryck Whibley outdid himself with this album, and I recommend it to any Sum-41 fan.

B000MRAAJW|5.0|My wife and I just finished putting in a new home theater and were looking for movies/videos that would maximize its' capabilities.  We found it in this magnificent BBC Series.    We had some friends over to watch portions of it, and there was a lot ( I mean, a LOT) of oohing and aahing over the sheer beauty of the world and the spectacular way that it is presented.  We also have a teenager who was unimpressed with the idea of watching a nature video instead of something like, \\"Batman Begins HD-DVD\\".  After watching some of Planet Earth for 15 minutes or so, he suggested that we schedule family nights where we can watch the entire series together.    Believe me, as virtually everyone else here (who owns the necessary HD-DVD player and not a regular DVD player) has noted, this is an absolutely, positively, wonderful video to see and own.
B000Q6GUTI|3.0|This is a fun action flick with lots of cool toys.     Mark Wahlberg does a good job as the \\"retired\\" Army sniper but his character gets way too many breaks, for example; a fat, corrupt and drunk NYPD officer shoots him twice with a pistol but an army of highly trained mercenaries with fully automatic weapons miss every time.    If you enjoy picking apart movies, there is a ton of material in this DVD to throw stones at. They use a wide variety of weapons but the capabilities are overblown.   The goofs generally do not detract from the movie.   An easy one is near the end when Kate Mara (Sarah) empties a 15rd Beretta after firing only 4 shots.    All of the current \\"talking points\\" of the left are present and accounted for: Abu Ghraib, No WMD's in Iraq, war for oil, evil \\"red state\\" politicians and government is corrupt and powerless against corporate interests.  Almost felt like somebody was sitting in the director's chair with a checklist to make sure they covered everything.  On the positive side, there were no \\"gun control\\" points made but that would have been hard to do since the hero was a heavily armed survivalist.    Overall it's a fun movie. I had to hit the stop button and go over several scenes in slow motion to figure out what they were doing or what they were carrying. I like movies that make me do that. Good Saturday night popcorn flick.
B000R9J3XE|4.0|...or Shirley Manson rules, and we missed it. When \\"[[ASIN:B000001OAA Garbage]]\\" first debuted in 1995, this crew of rock pros fronted by the fiery Manson hit like a ton of bricks. Melding the snarl of The Pretenders with icy new wave, \\"Vow\\" laid it all on the table. \\"I can't use what I can't abuse,\\" Shirley sang over chunky guitars and industrial beats. Superproducer Bruce Vig and the other two members has spent enough time in the alt-rock backstreets that they new how to make that sound mean something. With the outsider anthem \\"Queer\\" and sneering put-down \\"Stupid Girl,\\" Garbage had the ingredients all in place.<br /><br />The following \\"[[ASIN:B000006NZV Version 2.0]]\\" was almost as good. But the fact that Garbage was so blatant about their homage sometimes dulled the coolness of songs like \\"Push It\\" (swiped directly from Salt'n'Pepa) and \\"Special,\\" which has Manson singing the hook from \\"Brass In Pocket\\" over the fade. The singles were great, but the seams were showing.<br /><br />Perhaps it was that sameness that inspired the band to stretch out on \\"[[ASIN:B00005N75T Beautiful Garbage]]'s\\" moody and atmospheric material. \\"Androgyny\\" (not included here) flirted with R'n'B, but \\"Cherry Lips/Go Baby Go\\" was exactly the kind of amalgam of styles that made the best Garbage great. On the other hand, the lack of immediacy made it a commercial drop-off from the first two albums. The band went on hiatus.<br /><br />When 2005 rolled around, \\"[[ASIN:B0007Y8A06 Bleed Like Me]]\\" sounded like a return to form, even if that sound was no longer all too relevant. Still, the slamming \\"Why Do You Love Me\\" found Manson deliciously waffling back and forth between anger at the cheating boyfriend and the angst of the chorus \\"Why don't you love me? It's making me crazy!\\" Putting a pretty pout to the title track, Shirley Manson taunts us with \\"you should see my scars.\\" Indeed, we get a band that sounded both battle weary and resilient.<br /><br />This best of caps with a new song, \\"Tell Me Where it Hurts,\\" which sounds hot. There is also a remix of \\"Bleed Like Me's\\" \\"It's All Over But The Crying,\\" plus the soundtrack singles \\"#1 Crush\\" ([[ASIN:B000K7VHLY Romeo & Juliet]]) and the James Bond \\"The World Is Not Enough.\\" The disc does flesh out its running time, so I really can't gripe about songs I'd rather hear. But I will: \\"Bad Boyfriend\\" \\"Androgyny\\" and \\"Silence Is Golden.\\" Other side, if you never picked up any Garbage albums, \\"Absolute Garbage\\" will fill in the hits for you.nds hot.

B000002HRE|5.0|In the truest sense of the word, \\"die hard\\" to me has always meant that no matter what other people will say or what skewed perspectives they may hold, one does not waiver and continues with his or her own path.<br /><br />I guess I'm a die hard Metallica fan.<br /><br />The first album I heard from them back in 6th grade was obviously the self titled. Even then it was beyond my comprehension how heavy music could be. Years later it was Justice, then Kill Em All et al until I had their entire collection. Needless to say, every single album impressed and continues to impress me.<br /><br />Yes, I even mean Load, Reload and (gasp!) ST. ANGER.<br /><br />*ducks to avoid gunfire, arrows, Molotov cocktails and hatemail*<br /><br />YEAH, I SAID IT! St. Anger was more of the same in the sense that it was completely different from Load/Reload, which after so many albums of change seemed only natural and logical. The only two albums that sound somewhat similar are Lightning and Master, and the differences are undeniable.<br /><br />Some of the self-proclaimed \\"old school\\" fans will say Metallica really jumped the shark on St. Anger, because it sounds like they tried too hard to be tough or something. I don't think they tried to do anything but rock some good music, man -- and although my opinion counts for naught, I say it's good music.<br /><br />I guess I'm just cursed to put up with the perpetual onslaught of \\"Awww, dude, you're a f**, everything after Justice SUCKS!\\" from an alleged legion of \\"true\\" and \\"dedicated\\" metal fans. Nevermind that I'm a death/grind/doom/power metalhead, I'm a sellout because I like a metal band that decided to do blues rock (and then changed it up again... who wants to hear the same album year after year, anyway?)<br /><br />But I can dig on the good old fashioned hard blues jams, rock n' roll fury and swagger from tracks like \\"Devil's Dance,\\" \\"Better Than You\\" and \\"Bad Seed,\\" or the moodier and darker pinings of \\"Where the Wild Things Are.\\" And that is what makes this album (along with Load since they're basically the same musical divergence from previous material) yet another solid collection of music -- from start to finish -- from a band whose trademark it has been to do so.<br /><br />For those who've not experienced it and those who have but immediately discarded it, I cannot urge you enough to listen to Load et al not with a discographical bias, but with patience and understanding. If you must, imagine it's not Metallica at all and ask yourself: if you'd never heard of this band before and just heard this music on the radio, would you like it or not?basically the same musical divergence from previous material) yet another solid collection of music -- from start to finish -- from a band whose trademark it has been to do so.

0143036556|5.0|This book effectively analyzes the development and subsequent success or failure of a number of societies in amazing detail.  It draws no judgments about the types of government or cultures involved but instead draws clear lines of cause and effect between behavior and consequences.  It's a very careful step-by-step review of decisions several societies made and how those choices lead to survival or devastation.  The relationship of these societies to our modern world and the events happening today is expertly displayed.    It's the most significant book of it's kind since Silent Spring, and every bit as powerful.

For the amount of time they put in between alblums they should release with a better product.  The only reason this gets two stars instead of one is because it's by linkin park.

His magic system is fascinating, especially the art of naming which is a well handled update of an old idea that I normally don't care for: the power of names.  Rothfuss makes it work really well, makes it seem wondrous.  As a writer, Rothfuss is conversational and familiar, with characters that are alive and believable. Kvothe, as narrator and as a character in the frame story, is fascinating, and Rothfuss makes even the characters in the frame story ones worthy of curiousity.

B00003L2I0|4.0|This eccentric Irish singer-songwriter was a regular visitor to the upper reaches of the UK charts in the early 1970s. Three of these songs made the top ten in the USA: the poignant Claire, Alone Again (Naturally) and Get Down. He specialized in the mid-tempo ballad, although Get Down was a real rocker with a catchy hook. Other UK hits on this compilation include Ooh Wakka Doo Wakka Day, No Matter How I Try, We Will, Ooh Baby, Nothing Rhymed and I Don't Love You But I Think I Like You. What's In A Kiss was a solitary stray hit from the late 70s when his time had passed. The music is not profound but charming enough with its often clever lyrics and decent tunes.

B000J10ERO|2.0|Let's start with the positives:<br />1.) Brandon Routh does a good Chrisopher Reeve impersonation.<br />2.) Kevin Spacey & Parker Posey were pretty good as Luther and Kitty.  I think they captured much of what Hackman and that chick had in the original Reeve movies.<br />3.) The retention of John Williams' Superman theme.<br />4.) Luther's yacht was pretty cool.<br />5.) Luther was bald. I was always disappointed that Hackman wasn't (except at the very end).<br />6.) It was widescreen.<br />7.) It was in color.<br /><br />Ok, i'm grasping at straws now.<br /><br />Now on to the negatives:<br /><br />1.) Brandon Routh was too young to play Superman ...especially a Superman that's supposed to be 5 years older than Reeve in Superman 2.  He looks like he's in transition from SuperBOY to SuperMAN.<br /><br />2.) Kate Bosworth was TOTALLY miscast as Lois.  She was waaaay too young.  She didn't have the right look either.  She had NO personality.  She was boring to watch, and brought nothing compelling to the character.<br /><br />3.) The story. Do i really need to tread this again?  It was tired.  Although it technically hadn't been done already, it sure felt like it had. Lex luther trying to take over the world...AGAIN. In fact, isn't it kinda the same as Superman: The Movie? How about bringing in some of Superman's famous super-villians from the comic books?  In 50 years of live-action Superman offerings, that has almost NEVER been done.  And we have the effects technology to do it very well.  Hey, how about doing an adaptation of the HUGELY successful comic \\"The Death of Superman?\\"<br /><br />4.) In addition to this feeling like a re-tread of an old story, i thought the special effects kind of got in the way. To some degree, the effects almost had another-worldly aspect to them, and i felt as though i was in some far-off land, as opposed to a big American city.  Someone compared this to Terry Gilliam's Brazil.  Some of the imagery i found a bit pretentious, as well.  It seems like the filmakers really enjoyed showcasing the effects, without working on the story enough.  When they did break from the effects to talk about plot, i didn't care, as the writing was dull, and subplots were uninteresting.<br /><br />5.) Plot holes...for one, if this kid can hurl a piano across a room, why can't he punch out two henchmen?  And frankly, i'm sick of this notion that because Superman loses his super powers, he suddenly becomes a total wimp, who can be taken down by street toughs and old truckers in diners (Superman II).  I mean he IS afterall still a muscular 30 year-old with years of fighting experience behind him.  Uggghh.<br /><br />6.) Ned Beatty.  Luther needed a dumb hechman like Otis.<br /><br />I wish Bryan Singer (the director) had finished the X-Men trilogy and directed the last film. His first 2 were great.  Yet he threw it all away to do this. And now because of his decision, TWO movies have suffered.  I'm sure i'll get reamed for writing this, but how about Spielberg?  He offered to direct the Star Wars prequels, but Lucas turned him down.  Think of how much better THOSE would have been with Spielberg at the helm.  Lucas makes FANTASTIC epic pictures when he lets someone else direct (Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi, all 3 Indiana Jones films).  Not that Lucas was involved with Superman, but...well, anyway.  I would love to hear other people's suggestions for who would have done a better job with this movie.<br /><br />All that having been said, was it worth seeing?  Of course it was.  Any Superman is worth seeing, especially in the theater.  To be able to see that red cape flapping in the breeze, and John Williams' theme music is worth the price of admission...particularly in the theater.  But to OWN?  Go rent it.  It's worth a rental.

B000KB6D0A|5.0|This is my favorite SAXON Lp/Cd ever released by the band<br />This is Saxon at their finest and they were strong here, They still are in 2007, however this era has a special place in my heart as this LP was one of the earliest lp's that really played NWOBHM at its finest<br />Its a must buy for any hard rock fan
B000Q6GUT8|4.0|Swagger must join the CTU and team up with Bauer!!!<br /><br />Nice plot. I also enjoyed the detail givin in the making of \\"the shot\\". The best scence is Swagger taking a shot at the charecter holding his former partners ex wife at gun point. Swagger takes the guys hand off that is holding the gun and then follows it up by removing half his arm. The shot is taken at a great distance and makes the novice appreciate the skill required to pull off such a feat.
0722533942|2.0|Who knew Valkyries were such bores?  I was expecting another great story with a great message such as \\"The Alchemist\\" but I think that book may have been Coelho's one hit wonder.  This one was rambling, whiney, self-absorbed and way too full of itself.
1594489505|4.0|This novel is defintiely worthy of the hype surrounding it, and is destined to be a crowd pleaser (and hopefully a movie!)     I started reading Mr. Hosseini's second novel with diminished expectations, as I never expected it to be on the same level as \\"The Kite Runner,\\" but it was in every way its equal. As with his earlier work, it allows the reader to experience life \\"behind the veil\\" in Afghanistan from the 1970's to the present. This novel, moreso than \\"The Kite Runner,\\" focuses on women living in Islamic societies, and under the Taliban regime- their interrelationships, expectations, the violence they experience and the utter valuelessness of their lives with respect to their society. It is truly horrific that women are treated this way, especially in such recent times.     The book is not only an easy read, but a fast page-turner, that will likely leave the reader with tears and a heavy-heart. It would be an excellent book-club choice, and would be a prudent choice as recommended reading for anyone taking classes or with an interest in: religious studies, global studies, history, women's studies, legal studies, or cultural anthropology courses. I highly recommend this wonderful novel!
630469654X|3.0|Though I am not a great lover of fantasy films, I watched this movie after not seeing it in several years recently.  I try to watch movies that I have not seen in many years, thinking that maturity and experience since the last time I had seen it will change my perspective.  All in all, it was a good movie without being too overtly cheesy and hoaky like some modern fantasy movies are.  It was also in an age before special effects and animation had completely taken over, giving it a unique and somewhat antiquated charm.    A young Matthew Broderick plays a theif named Phillipe, who gets by on his wits and comic timing as a somewhat happy bumbling fool.  He escapes from the dungeons and certain death from Aquilla, a harsh town ruled by the iron fist of the Bishop.  Staggering through the world, homeless and desperate, Phillipe comes into the service of a lone warrior named Navarre, played to perfection by Rutger Hauer.  Cloaked in black astride a black horse, he has a hawk with him as his companion and guardian.  As night falls, Phillipe meets a mysterious woman named Isabeau whose protector is a black wolf.  The two are living under a curse cast by the Bishop.  Jealous of their love, he cursed the two to never assume human form together.  Isabeau lives as a hawk by day, Navarre as a wolf by night, the two never together.  With his help and the bumbling antics of a priest who betrayed him, Imperious, Phillipe helps Navarre break the curse and distroy the Bishop.    The love story is quite nice, actually, if not original.  Phillipe acts as their go between, as he tells each in human form of how the others longs for each other when they are living as poor dumb creatures.  He is the lover and poet for the both of them, living under the chaste, obsessive medevil love famous for the Middle Ages.  The religious aspect is also interesting, in that the Bishop did not overcome his human foibles enough to lead a truly asthetic life.  He is the evil force, drunk with power, making others bow before him as his word is absolute.      Critical words?  The music score.  I am not always looking to observe the music score in movies, but this wasn't appropriate.  Disco?  Probably the worst choice possible and underminded a lot of effort for effect.
B000MXPE7O|4.0|Ambitious, star-studded, and lengthy, The Good Shepherd purports to give us a sense of how the CIA operated during the Cold War and how it affected those who devoted themselves to the cause.  So it is that, via a series of flashbacks, we meet an intelligent young Yale student named Edward Wilson (Matt Damon), watch as he is recruited into the service of American intelligence, joins the O.S.S. during WWII, helps found the nascent CIA in the 1950s, and goes about doing the thankless, extremely difficult job of keeping America safe through foreign crises, particularly those involving Castro's Cuba in the 1960s.  It's not an expose on the CIA - which it actually deals with quite even-handedly, especially in today's day and age - as it principally focuses on the personal story of this one individual and what might be called his dehumanization at the hands of his sometimes sinister career.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there is a major (but not fatal) flaw at the very heart of the film.  Obviously, a man in Edward Wilson's position must be a cold and calculating man, but his characterization ventures far beyond stoic into the realms of the robotic.  Even the personal glimpses intended to get us past the emotional wall that defines him lack insight and feeling.  We see through his eyes, but we never really get a sense of his inward self.  I also had a problem seeing Wilson as the experienced, upper level CIA man he became because no effort seemed to go in to making Matt Damon appear any older as his character aged; he looks the same in the 1960s as he did in 1939.  Come on, put a few grey hairs in there or something; it takes more than a fedora to make me believe he's a quarter of a century older.  Damon just never looks the part of an older Edward Wilson, and that really impacted - and not in a good way - my perspective of the entire movie.  Additionally, even though this is not a factual account of CIA history, the film's attempt to deflect any blame from John F. Kennedy for refusing to grant air support to the otherwise sitting ducks storming the beaches at the Bay of Pigs really rubbed me the wrong way.<br /><br />I think it helps to have some knowledge of the historical and political background of events touched upon in this movie, especially the dark stain that is the Bay of Pigs fiasco.  That is really the lynchpin of the film's story, as one of the reasons for the failure slowly causes Wilson's personal and private lives to collide and truly test his mettle - with more than a little help from the helping hands of a formidable KGB intelligence officer.  What should be an excruciatingly painful decision dredges up virtually no emotion in the man, however - although the same can't be said of Wilson's sometimes boisterous wife (Angelina Jolie).  The ending doesn't pack much of a punch either, further pointing out the film's quite obvious deficiencies in character development.  Personally, I found the movie pretty interesting throughout, but that was largely because of my interest in intelligence operations and Cold War history.  If you could care less about those subjects, you probably won't enjoy the movie at all because it simply fails to forge any kind of emotional bond between you and the characters.g to grant air support to the otherwise sitting ducks storming the beaches at the Bay of Pigs really rubbed me the wrong way.

B00000DGRX|5.0|Back in 1972 when this album was first realeased, I had no idea it existed.  I got my first \\"hi fi\\" around 1975, and by then this album and it's legendary \\"Smoke on the Water\\" song was already part of the FM hard rock canon and considered a classic.  I came of age cranking \\"Highway Star\\" and \\"Space Trukin'\\", but I wasn't a \\"hard rock\\" fan per se so I never actually purchased this album or even listened to it all the way through.<br /><br />Fast forward to 2007, and I've got this thing in my CD drive at work just rockin' out and being productive at the same time.  Even the songs whose titles I didn't recognize sounded like old friends, and the historical notes included in this deluxe anniversary edition put a historical context around the music, which made it all interesting even on an intellectual level.<br /><br />Then there's the bonus disk!  The same think only different, and different in a really cool way!  I think I listen to the bonus disk almost exclusively now when I haul this jewel out of my CD drawer.  All that's left to do now is to remember to bring it home and crank it up on my main stereo system.  What a find!

0618680004|4.0|I don't know whether Richard Dawkins was ever an angry young man, but he is certainly now an angry old academic. So bitter, so full of anti-religious bile is he that one has to wonder whether he is actually the illegitimate product of a dirty old priest and a tender young thing, conceived during a particularly intimate and enthusiastic confession, and he's now getting his own back. No academic, namby-pamby, fence-sitting, weasel words for him. He comes right out and says exactly what he means. I mean, how could anyone match this description of the God of the Old Testament?<br /><br />\\"...arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully\\".<br /><br />Whether or not you agree with it, it's truly magnificent - one can hear the determined strength of the hammer blows as the flag is nailed to the mast, and in the background one can hear the guns being run out. And this is immediate notice of one of the major points of this book; that one of the big problems with God is that God is not at all like Richard Dawkins. Were He so, Richard Dawkins might deign to notice Him. Or not. (Probably not). Had God been like Richard Dawkins (or even better, has God been Richard Dawkins) from the word go (known in astronomical circles as The Big Bang), things would have been better organised. Would the Divine Dawkins have forbidden worship of Him? We'll never know. Pity.<br /><br />Professor Dawkins stands for truth pure and unsullied - no temporising, no softening of sharp edges, no accommodation for weak-willed, compromisers for him. If anything, he despises such folk much more than he does the literal, young-Earth Bible believers - whom, in some ways, he resembles.<br /><br />The funny thing is that, when people turn nasty to him, he finds this hard to comprehend. At the start of Chapter 6, he reproduces some of the vicious letters he's received (usually from US \\"Christians\\", wishing him a happy time roasting in Hell, that sort of thing). \\"I find it difficult that a mere difference of theological opinion can generate such venom\\". Huh? What about his description of God, quoted above? Dr. Henrik Verwoerd, the architect of South African apartheid, was well known for speaking volubly (and endlessly) on what he believed (sorry, knew) to be correct, but for cutting off immediately anyone who thought otherwise, because, as they disagreed with him,  they couldn't possibly be right, and were therefore not worth listening to. Professor Dawkins appears to be from the same mould, and is perhaps even mouldier.<br /><br />Professor Dawkins makes no bones about it; in his view, religion in all its many guises is a blight on humankind, a totally counterproductive and negative, indeed wasteful and destructive, activity deserving only of contempt and extermination, not necessarily in that order. As a result, Professor Dawkins writes (and he writes very well indeed) with a perpetual sarcastic sneer, in a tone that says right out, \\"I can't believe that people can be such suckers\\" and with the strong implication, \\"I'm so much cleverer than you\\". This is no measured academic tome, this is an evangelical tract of a different kind. Its theme song could be John Lennon's \\"Imagine\\" (\\"...and no religion too...\\") and it more or less says with Lennon \\"I hope one day you'll join us, and the world will live as one\\". Even his photo on the back flap has a look of burning, inspirational, evangelical fervour, and, as an evangelical Christian book might end with an address list of churches and other organisations that may be useful to the new believer, Dawkins provides the same service for the new unbeliever.<br /><br />Much of what Professor Dawkins says is undisputable - organised religion HAS brought untold misery and calamity on the world, and there IS an enormous amount of religion-related unadulterated hogwash produced. However, Dawkins goes several steps further, to say that religion is simply no use at all. So, all charitable works, all arguments that religion has something to do with the setting of moral standards, are summarily dismissed. Moreover, \\"moderate, reasonable\\" religion is dismissed as the progenitor of \\"extreme\\" religion, a sort of child-is-father-to-the-maniac argument that Sigmund Freud would have loved.<br /><br />Although he attacks all religions, he concentrates his fire on the two current opposites, which are yet so very alike, militant Islam and the loonies of US evangelicalism. However, while the almost certifiable rantings of some parts of the current US religious right positively beg for criticism, Dawkins goes a bit far in taking the \\"God hates faggots\\" Fred Phelps and his Westboro Baptist as typical examples - even right-wing Americans are embarrassed by them.<br /><br />There is much interesting discussion, for example, the question \\"Why religion?\\" and the evolution of a moral code in evolutionary terms. What Darwinistic advantage do these confer? Dawkins also makes several forays into philosophy. I'm no philosopher, but to me his philosophical dissertations are not terribly convincing; indeed, he seems to protest too much. An argument is no more persuasive for being shouted through a megaphone rather than spoken quietly. Dawkins on science is much better, capturing in lyrical, elegant prose much of the wonder and splendour of a subject he clearly loves (whoops, nearly said \\"worships\\" there).<br /><br />However, on the central issue of whether there actually is a God, Dawkins is, to me, less than completely persuasive, unless one is committed to his particular way of thinking. This can be summed up very simply - what we can observe and deduce by the tools of scientific research and philosophical reasoning is all that there is. If there is a God, he or his works should be observable and identifiable by direct observation or indirect deduction. As this is not the case, there is no God. Q.E.D. It does not allow the possibility, however slight, that there could be something (or Someone) beyond the reach of space and time and not really prone to analysis by human logic. And, in a way, Dawkins's logic bends back on itself. Consider the description of that Old Testament God previously quoted. It reminds me of Neils Bohr's classic \\"Your theory is crazy, but not crazy enough to be true.\\" Could it be that the very unlikeliness of this God, totally unlike any other God ever devised, makes him more likely?<br /><br />In short, this is a book that will make few, if any, converts. It will confirm in the rightness of their thinking those who think as does Professor Dawkins, it will convince the other pole of opinion that Richard Dawkins is the devil incarnate and I'm not so sure that it will persuade many of those still wandering in no-man's land.

The movie was a bit long, but kept me on the edge of my seat for the entire 2+ hours.
1869505301|3.0|I purchased this book after visiting New Zealand.  Specifically, the area where Rohan was set up.  I would not have bought this book otherwise, but it became a nice companion when i wanted to remember the lay of the land and the challenges one only experiences in New Zealand.  To get to this place, one must walk from a road, across a cow field, through 3 rivers (ice cold and too wide to jump, mind).  So for me it was worth it.  If you don't have an unusual love for the films or another big reason to get this book, you're probably wasting your money.
0307155102|4.0|This is a LARGE book, like 12 x 14 inches.  So the pages are pretty big, a little unwieldy for small kids, and mine are 18 and 32 months, they have already torn a couple pages just because it's hard for them to flip the big pages.  They loves the Richard Scary animals though and like me to read it to them.  It is a busy book, lots to see!  Took me about 30 mins to read it to them the first time.  Great book - I had this one when I was little, but in smaller binding!

B000ROALCG|3.0|Mark Anthony is probably the best salsero we have now in 07. Hector was one of the best we had in the 70's. Hector Lavoe did his thing, he did it his way, the way it was hot back then. Now we have Mark Anthony repeating the exact same music the exact same way. I like this album because Hector Lavoe was a great salsa singer.He is one of my personal favorites. Mark Anthony on the other hand is also a great salsa singer but with alot more vocal range. It's a good album not a great album. I think Mark Anthony should have been more creative and made it his own, using that awesome range of his.He should've went all out. He was working with some really great songs, I just think he should've gave it 100% of Mark Anthony, not just trying to make it sound like 100% of Hector Lavoe. I do understand that he is in the movie acting as Hector Lavoe, and he is obviously trying to be 100% of this character. I'm kinda split between he shoulda woulda coulda. But overall it's good. I personally prefer listening to the original stuff from Lavoe himself.

0345457692|3.0|As a pulp thriller, the story is tight and well paced, and it hits all of the points that a reader would expect from a pulp thriller.    As cyberpunk sci-fi, it's hopelessly cheesy and poorly thought out. It became clear after the first several chapters that the author is not well versed in his chosen genre or in the underlying technology, fictional or otherwise. Some tech described in the story is advanced beyond recognition, while some seems unnecessarily stunted and mundane, and the cultural context doesn't fit any of it.    Unfortunately, the plot of the thriller depends heavily on the described technology, so the story never comes together like it should. The characters' choices and motivations simply don't make sense after a while, given the social and technological options that *should* be available to them.    The book is good enough for me to finish it, but not good enough for me to pick up the next.

A riveting novel with tears at the end of each chapter.
B000R9J3X4|5.0|While having the basic Greatest Hits album all by itself is still a wonderful treat for any Garbage fan, the extra few dollars it will cost to buy the Special Edition of Absolute Garbage is well worth the bonus \\"Garbage Mixes\\" album. It's got some great remixes on it.    This is a must-have for any Garbage fan.
B000RIHBIE|5.0|I remember reading an article where Sum 41 claimed their band was more like All Killer No Filler than their previous two albums. Then I heard \\"Underclass Hero\\" which albeit is a catchy song it sound way too similar to \\"Fat Lip\\" from their first album.    So today I bought the album with some apprehension. I feared that with their last album, Chuck,  receiving poor sales and reviews (even though I loved that album) and Dave leaving the band they would revert to their old sound in an all or nothing attempt to be MTV friendly and gain some mainstream appeal.    I am glad I was oh so wrong about my assumptions for this album.     Normally I would never review an album without giving it four or five listens, but I was lucky enough to have to make a six hour round trip with this album playing about 5 times before I finally switched CDs.    Its as if the track \\"Underclass Hero\\" is a joke track to fool us all into believing they are trying to make All Killer No Filler 2. Then \\"Walking Disaster\\" pops up and hits you like a punch in the gut, and the rest of the album grabs and doesn't let go.     What makes this album so great is that there is a confidence and maturity to this album. Lyrically they have never been better, and their music has never been this varied, while also remaining somewhat simplistic. They do this by using a more varied and diverse take on their old pop-punk sound, a sound that many bands use currently to pollute the airwaves (I'm looking at you Paramore).     Will this albums skyrocket their fame? Maybe. I think there will be a lot of petty complaints against it. For one their will be people who will be angry that this ISN'T All Killer and No Filler 2 (even if it is something much, much better), there will be people who despise them simply for the fact that *GASP* they have a handful of politically charged songs, or the really ignorant idiots will complain that ballad style songs like \\"Best of Me\\" and \\"So Long Goodbye\\" will like TOTALLY mean they sold out, even if those songs are incredibly well done.     But I think \\"Underclass Hero\\", along with Yellowcard's \\"Paper Walls\\" will prove to many people that pop-punk didn't die with Blink-182's break up, it CAN be mature AND keep the uplifting energy of punk music generally displays, all while being more diverse musically than the punk sub-culture allows.     To sum this review up (no pun intended) \\"Underclass Hero\\" is a truly wonderful surprise of this year music-wise for me and I highly recommend this album. It's easily their best.
B000K7VHQ4|2.0|I generally like Ed Nortons work and look forward to his new films. This one was kind of fun but quirky for a<br />time. Not great, not terrible, run of the road movie...until the end.

But Sophie was annoying at times. I wish Michael was Marco, the kid in the movie, he was much cuter. The book is boring and wasn't as creative as the movie AND the ending of the book was HORRIBLE. Everything was rushed. The author like crammed up everything..it was like she was sick of the book and just ended it because she gave up on it or something...it was the worst ending ever, it wasn't even worth reading like...so abrupt. The whole book was all suddenly concluded in like 1 chapter.

B000SQFC18|5.0|I must admit, upon first glance of the trailer, the only thing that caught my attention was the title, \\"BABEL\\". The word was one I am quite familiar with considering the story of The Tower of Babel was in mind. However, taking a sudden random interest in seeing the film just a month before it came out, I found out the story was much more complexed and original. Hailed as a recreation of the Academy Award winning Crash, which I had little to no interest to see, I considered Babel to be something that was being pushed below of what it actually could do with the limited release and already being ridiculed by people who hadn't even seen it. Blocking out all skepticism, I made the effort to see the film in the only theatre in my area where it was showing. I have no regrets of doing so.     When an American woman traveling on vacation with her husband and a group of tourists in Morocco is suddenly shot, a chain reaction begins. Suspecting terrorists, the American and Moroccan governments take action. Little do they know it was a small local family living in the mountains. The two sons, who had the rifle, were supposed to be protecting the family's herd of goats with it but instead began aiming at cars and also the tour bus. In Japan, deaf and mute Chieko, who's father once owned the gun, is having problems of her own communicating with anyone of the outside world, let alone does she make any real effort to do so. Not only this, but Amelia, who is the American couple's Mexican nanny, takes the couple's young children across the border to attend her own son's wedding when the couple does not return in time, only to find she may not be able to get them back. Along the lines, these six people will find they didn't have their world as well planned out as they had thought.     The cast was absolutely phenomenol. Filled with first-timers and world-class talent, each person is able to show their abilities. Adriana Bazzara shines as Amelia the maid. She was the most sympathetic out of all the characters, and her portrayal of an insanity set in by not being able to make it back to the life she left behind in America is absolutely incredible. Barraza's own level of commitment is also insurmountable. Because the screenplay called for her to talk the majority in Spanish, this may have enabled Barraza to bring out her full potential. I admit, she was my favorite actress out of the whole movie if not THE best.     I must also admit that I think this was my favorite movie Brad Pitt played in. I can't say I would own any films with him in it, but just the idea that he was playing a character that was not the lead (nor were there any leads except for the principles) was what also made me want to see the movie more because playing a supporting is usually more difficult. He did not shine on screen which was ultimately good. Usually when people go to see a movie, they go to see the star. This was not his case, however. They were actually seeing the character of Richard and not just Brad Pitt which I was amazingly shocked he could pull off without pulling his usual stints in the process. Well known actors Gael Garcia Bernal and Cate Blanchett also did the same. Both are of high-stature in hollywood and in their home countries, but ultimately make room for the unknowns, who end up being just as good (or in Barraza's case, BETTER) than the super-stars. Koji Yakusho should've been given more time than he was, but makes a nice supporting star in the film in the simplicity of his role.     I will give a lot of notification to writer Guillermo Arriaga and Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu for their bold and straightforward displays of the story that Babel puts forth. The atmospheric setting and the different sides of the world that are quick to make acusations, and how hard life is anywhere outside of your home country, even if you are only traveling, which are obvious nods to the Mexicans and the Americans in the movie. Though I can see a lot that could'vebeen left out of the graphicness in the story of the deaf and blind Chieko, such as the full frontal nudity (which could've been done just as well with just implied nudity), the rest of her story, and the others are perfect in their complications. A lot is displayed in the 2 hours and 23 minutes the film runs, even giving you the idea that life runs slower than it really is.     The key element, which is not pushed out into the obvious but played along for the audience to figure out, is that all the characters are trapped in a world in which they cannot communicate with the people around them, hence the title BABEL. This was another thing that lured me in on account of we pass this by everyday without even knowing it. In Albuqueruqe, New Mexico where I live, it is very difficult to speak with people because the majority of people here speak spanish, while about 1/5 of the population ONLY speaks Spanish. Babel touched home with me on that aspect. I know Spanish, but I can only imagine what it must be like for people who don't. You could almost think of it as an innocence of ignorance as with the issue all the characters in the film experience. I'm sure with a lot of people Babel touched home, but I hope it picks up at the box office soon.     On the $25,000,000 budget, which the producers spent thoughtfully and and worthfully, the fruits of their passion on a six month shoot has brought us this amazing work of art to the world which should be noted to all kinds as a message that needs to be heard. Babel will feel as reality because it is a lesson in arrogance and hubris on many fronts. If you are a person who takes the time to experience reality daily as I did, you will feel for these people. If not, do not waste your time. It is very difficult for anyone of the routine world who cannot take the time to realize the little things in life such as being able to understand one another that could never understand a film as complex as Babel. Go in with a skeptical mind and come out feeling refreshed and waiting for life to meet you. I guarantee you that you will get something back.
0316018953|1.0|If you've always wanted to become a Connelly reader but never managed to work up the energy, Overlook is an harmless and amiable way to start.  It may be his most lightweight outing but still there's enough to give you a sense of what to expect (and look forward to) in his best work: graceful prose, intricate plotting, a magnificent sense of how a romantic loner (Hieronymous [no kidding] \\"Harry\\" Bosch) navigates his way through (and around) interdepartmental politics and interagency rivalries, and a colorful gallery of warhorse characters (Harry's on-and-off partner \\"Kiz\\" Rider, who prefers girls; FBI agent Rachel Walling, Harry's on-and-off again bedmate; and Irvin S. Irving, a departmental bureaucrat who puts one in mind of the Dickens novels). What's MOST exciting in the best work (Angel's Flight, Trunk Music, The Closers) is the way Connelly gets so many balls juggling in the air and brings the act to a close so gracefully.  In the later work he tends to settle for neat and tidy solutions, and he lets situations drift increasingly toward the preposterous (The Poet, The Narrows, Chasing the Dime). Still, for the uninitiated, his novels can serve as a useful guidebook to an actual geographic L.A.--the Overlook at that  former place of Madonna's is a real place and is expertly described.

1582701709|1.0|This reads like a self-help book written by an individual with attention deficit disorder.  Its message is simple and is based on a philosophy that \\"like attracts like\\" and that you need to have a positive attitude and imagine the things you want (or would like), and then they will happen.  I have not seen the movie (neither the book nor the movie interest me as a recommendation for anyone).  The book contains nothing deep yet its message is charming.

B000H6SXMY|5.0|I received all the friends episodes in 40 discs, all runs well and the packaging is amazing ! the dvd prints are very good. I'm highly satisfied.
B00005QJDG|5.0|After having listened to this triple CD masterpiece all the way through for about the 6th time, I am starting to believe that this could be the best rock live CD of all time. For starters, Scenes from a Memory is a sensational album - and of course DT does the entire album to open up their set.  The last couple of songs from SFAM spill on to the 2nd disc, and then they continue with the almost four hour show by going right into their classic \\"Metropolis\\" track from Images and Words.  The rest of the second disc is very good (highlighted by another great I&W track, \\"Another Day\\", and the unbelievable Jordan Rudless keyboard solo track).  Then comes the epic 3rd CD, opening with a trio of songs from Awake (called \\"A Mind Beside Itself\\" as a group) - the kickin' instrumental \\"Erotomania\\", \\"Voices\\" and one of my top 10 DT songs, \\"The Silent Man\\".  But wait ... they still have more to offer us!!!   They \\"appear\\" to close the show with my personal # 1 DT song, \\"Learning to Live\\" (another classic from their groundbreaking Images & Words CD) ... but, of course, they are called out for an encore.  Does DT give us a good encore - no, they give us a GREAT 25 MINUTE ENCORE - my personal # 2 DT song, the never before released live uncut version of \\"A Change of Seasons\\".  BTW, I am a HUGE Yes fan, and in my opinion \\"A Change of Seasons\\" more than holds its own with the great 15 minute plus masterpieces that Yes has given their fans (e.g., \\"Close to the Edge\\", \\"The Gates of Delirium\\", \\"The Revealing Science of God\\" and \\"Ritual\\" from TFTO, \\"Awaken\\", and the very underrated but excellent \\"Endless Dream\\" from Talk).  There are certainly other great live rock albums that have a claim to being \\"best of all time\\" (Led Zeppelin's recently released \\"How the West Was Won\\", Kiss's \\"Alive\\", The Who's \\"Live at Leeds\\", of course \\"Yessongs\\", Deep Purple's \\"Made in Japan\\", The Rolling Stones \\"Get Your Ya Ya's Out\\", and Rush's \\"Live in Rio\\" are some examples), but the more I listen to Live Scenesfrom NY, the more I become convinced that this is the cream of the crop.  BTW, the triple live \\"Score\\" DT CD released in 2006 is also very good (I especially love the 2nd CD with the full uncut version of \\"The Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\\" and \\"Sacrificed Sons\\").
B0000CEB4V|5.0|\\"Concert For George\\" is a passionate and moving tribute to George Harrison, filled with memorable highlights.    I was taken by the captivating \\"Arpan\\", written by Ravi Shankar especially for this concert. It's earnestly conducted by Shankar's daughter, Anoushkah, who also turns in her own amazing sitar performance.     Also memorable is an appearance by the members of Monty Python, who puncture whatever pompousness may have been in the room as they reprise a couple of their classic routines.    But the show really takes off when the \\"gang\\" comes out - George's favorite musical friends. They rock the house as they perform with an obvious love and respect for George.     Every song in this DVD is a gem. Every performance is worthy. Highlights include Paul McCartney's rendition of \\"Something\\" (featuring a great duet with Eric Clapton), and Clapton nailing it on \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\".     Beyond the music and performances, what makes this concert special - as another reviewer noted - are the small moments. And seeing Dhani Harrison (George's son) play right alongside the older pros is quite touching.     Highly recommended.
1881273156|5.0|'The Five Love Languages' is, in my humble opinion, the most important, the most understandable, the most marriage-enhancing book ever written.  I say that with great empasis having read many, many books on the topic of marital relationships.  In this volume, Chapman explains WHAT the five love languages are, HOW to identify them (for yourself and your spouse) and WHY knowing and filling the needs of your mates love language (instead of trying to fill your mates needs with your own love language needs) will revolutionize your relationship.    I read this work many years ago.  In a crisis time in our marriage, I asked my husband to read it.  His reading, understanding and applying the principles in this book was not only an 'AH HA' moment for him, it revolutionized our marriage!   Over the course of years, I have given this book to many, many others.  I always keep a 'give away' copy in my bookcase. This book ought to be required prenuptial reading.  My recommendation for you: BUY IT!

B000002JOH|5.0|Vulgar Display Of Power (1992.), Pantera's second recognised studio album (their sixth if you count their four album releases during the 1980's which the band now totally disregards)<br /><br />Every  so often with any genre of music, a band comes along and shocks listeners and critics alike with a new trademark style of playing. Pantera are one such band. After tossing aside their glam metal roots from the 1980's, the band began to play their music heavier and much more mercilessly than before. The band's major label debut, 1990's `Cowboys From Hell' was a godlike display of powerful, intense riffing and brutal rhythms. It was a debut masterpiece that took the thrash style of 80's giants such as Metallica and Megadeth and blended it with a much more hardcore style. Indeed, Pantera were one of the heaviest bands around at the time. The question was where would Pantera next go with their pioneering groove metal style?<br /><br />Pantera's second trip to the studio was one which produced phenominal results. With `Vulgar Display Of Power', the band get heavier and much more brutal than before. For me and many other fans, it is this album which truly defines the groove metal style that Pantera were all about. The songs on the album are generally slower than those on `Cowboys From Hell' however there is much more focus on heaviness and groove. Dime's often downtuned, insane riffage is pure power throughout the album (it is less high pitched than on Cowboys). He further establishes himself as a guitar god with some more amazing, varied solos and with some excellent changes of style and rhythm. Furthermore the signature sound that Pantera fully developed on this album includes some blistering rhythm section work. Vinnie Pauls drumming is aggressive, intense but highly creative and his impressive double bass work throughout the album adds a great backdrop to the Pantera sound. Rex, on bass, again is fantastic, providing some great undercurrent rhythms to Dime's riffing. Also, his basswork below the solos is able to keep the heaviness to the music, without the aid of a rhythm guitar! Phil Anselmo's vocals are much more hardcore on this album. His style on `Cowboys From Hell' was very akin to the vocals of James Hetfield of Metallica (he does a great job on that album IMHO); however on this album, his vocals are much more aggressive, distorted, screamy, deep and powerful. Phil may not go down as one of the all time great vocalists however he adds a massive amount of power, vitriol and intensity that works perfectly with the musicians in the band. All in all, `Vulgar Display Of Power' shows a band keeping their foot on the accelerator - man this is f*cking hostile stuff!!<br /><br />`Mouth For War' sets the perfect tone for the style of the album. An endless barrage of strong Dime riffs and barked vocals from Phil make this an intimidating opener full of strength and groove. The exit riffs and chords are especially earth shattering. `A New Level' speaks for itself as a song - Phil Anselmo screams `A new level of confidence and power' in the chorus; it says everything about the band's music on this album. This is anothern really intense and impressive song. Next is perhaps Pantera's most famous song, `Walk'. A slow sludgy riff powers its way through a song full of anger and aggression. Dime's solo on this one is brilliant. `F*cking Hostile' is a short, thrashier follow up with express riffs and cutting rhythms. `This Love' shows Pantera expanding their style. The intro and verses are acoustic in style and with Phil singing some excellent, clean, baritone vocals creating an expectation that the song is about to explode. Indeed it does for the choruses, with heavy riffs and yells alike providing a great contrast. `Rise' is a continuation of the intense groove style on the album, with a whirling chorus pounding out the mix.<br /><br />`No Good (Attack The Radical)' has some excellent melodies from Dime coupled with plenty of punching chords.His solo on here is a rapid display full of ingenuity. `Live In A Hole' has a great mix of wah-wah riffs and a strong `Fear, Grips!' chorus. Dime's trade off solos are excellent, as is Rex's bass work underneath. `Regular People (Conceit)' is a slow, intense gallop with more battery-like drumming from Vinnie Paul. A mellow verse line adds a great contrast to the song. `By Demons Be Driven' is my personal favourite track on the album. This is a beast of a song which fades in which machine-like riffs. A dark, foreboding song full of atmosphere. `Hollow' is a excellent finisher. The first half of the song is very melodic with Dime's guitar work and Phil's vocals both being done in clean style - it is very much in the vein of `Cemetery Gates'. That is until the song melds into darker tones coupled with acoustic lines. The song races to an blistering finish with all of the band showing off their musical skills.<br /><br />`Vulgar Display Of Power' is a milestone both for Pantera and metal in general. With this album, the band step up the ante and add new levels of heaviness and intensity to their music previously unexpected at the time. Eventhough this is not my personal favourite Pantera album (that for me is `Cowboys From Hell'), there is no doubt in my mind that this is the album that defines Pantera and all that they stood for. A template for many bands in the last 10-15 years, this album is a timeless classic, full of strong songwriting and style. Pantera would further develop on this style but it was this juggernaut of an album which immortalised them! Highly Recommended!<br /><br />R.I.P. Dimebag Darrel<br /><br />MY RATING: 9.5/10<br /><br />NOTE TO AMAZON: The editiorial review for this product contains an error. `Vulgar Display Of Power' didn't actually go to number 1 in the Billboard Album Chart, it was the follow-up `Far Beyond Driven' which did. `Vulgar Display Of Power' actually only reached number 44 however it has gone on to become Pantera's biggest selling album, shifting 2 million copies in the USA alone.splay full of ingenuity. `Live In A Hole' has a great mix of wah-wah riffs and a strong `Fear, Grips!' chorus.

A dark, foreboding song full of atmosphere. `Hollow' is a excellent finisher. The first half of the song is very melodic with Dime's guitar work and Phil's vocals both being done in clean style - it is very much in the vein of `Cemetery Gates'. That is until the song melds into darker tones coupled with acoustic lines. The song races to an blistering finish with all of the band showing off their musical skills.    `Vulgar Display Of Power' is a milestone both for Pantera and metal in general. With this album, the band step up the ante and add new levels of heaviness and intensity to their music previously unexpected at the time. Eventhough this is not my personal favourite Pantera album (that for me is `Cowboys From Hell'), there is no doubt in my mind that this is the album that defines Pantera and all that they stood for. A template for many bands in the last 10-15 years, this album is a timeless classic, full of strong songwriting and style. Pantera would further develop on this style but it was this juggernaut of an album which immortalised them! Highly Recommended!    R.I.P. Dimebag Darrel    MY RATING: 9.5/10    NOTE TO AMAZON: The editiorial review for this product contains an error. `Vulgar Display Of Power' didn't actually go to number 1 in the Billboard Album Chart, it was the follow-up `Far Beyond Driven' which did. `Vulgar Display Of Power' actually only reached number 44 however it has gone on to become Pantera's biggest selling album, shifting 2 million copies in the USA alone.

B000RO9PXC|3.0|Live In Boston is easily the weakest live Doors album yet.  Jim is drunk and his performance seriously suffers.  I was able to tolerate (and even enjoy) most of it, but I would not be surprised if someone shut this off after a few songs.  Sadly, Jim only gets worse as the show goes on.  A lack of pro-recorded shows and the ability to market this as \\"Jim Morrison at his wildest!\\" are the only reasons why this show is being released.  If you have all the previous live Doors releases and don't mind hearing a very rough performance, go ahead and check this one out.  I've enjoyed listening to it, but I'm sure it wont become a favorite.  There is much better live Doors material out there.    If you don't own any Doors live albums yet, start with Live in Philadelphia or Live in Detroit.  Both of those shows are vastly superior to Live in Boston.
B000ROALCG|5.0|I think Marc Anthony did a very good job considering that you can't really sing all out to Hector's songs. Hector did not have a very powerful voice or a big range like Marc does. So you can tell Marc is holding his voice back. Marc does not really sound like himself. So he did a good job on this cd of not sounding like himself but trying to sing in more of Hector's syle.
B000O59AFC|4.0|Mission Impossible: I is the first movie of the three mission impossibles and it is by far the only one worth watching.  True, the second one has crazy explosives and flying karate kicks but that's not what true espionage is all about.<br /><br />Then there's the third one, the most recent, and it's more espionage than the 2nd but it too relys too heavily on explosions and big names to give you any real value as a movie.  This movie is the bread and butter of \\"didn't see it coming\\" espionage spy movies!<br /><br />That said, I'd like for you as a viewer of reviews to check out the DVD reviews of this Movie and get more of a feel for what it has to offer, Here in the \\"Blu Ray\\" Review I just want to tell you whats improved or not improved, for that matter, on the blu ray version.  I currently have the Onkyo TX-SR805 receiver which decodes True HD and DTS Master HD audio formats NEITHER OF WHICH ARE SUPPORTED ON THIS BLU RAY DISC.<br /><br />The best audio that is offered on this Disc is regular Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1 which sounds great, but does not live up to the standards that are trying to be set in this next generation of home entertainment.<br /><br />So I was disappointed in not getting the HD audio I would expect it does look fantastic in HD, there's a lot of contrast in black levels and the details in face shots are phenomenal but I wouldn't replace my Old Mission Impossible DVD with a Blu Ray Version (I rented it from blockbuster online to see the difference)<br /><br />Hope this helps you as a consumer  Cheers.
B000NA77YO|5.0|If you like the classic Sabbath with Dio then this is a no brainer to purchase. You get the remastered classics plus 3 new songs. I would have paid the 10.99 just for the new songs. They are very good. I wish Sign of the Southern Cross and Country Girl had been included on the CD.
B000OCXMAE|3.0|Honestly, I respect the band's decision to branch out for something new. Everyone comes to a moment like that in their life and most of the time more than once. However, that being said, I did expect more than this. With a band having as much success as LP has, of course the 3rd release is going to carry on expected hype. The new sound doesnt stick quite as well as LP had wished and it's evident in the feedback from the masses. I saw them at the Bamboozle festival in NJ right before the release. Their live show is still one of the best in mainstream American rock you can find. As far as recorded material goes, something tells me the guys are going to be headed back to the studio to do SOMETHING a lot faster than they expected. With the lackluster response to Minutes To Midnight, LP wont survive another 3years gap in between releases.
B000RIHBIE|5.0|Once I got through half the album it dawned on me! this album resembles Green Day's American Idiot, which is not a bad thing at all! Catchy! Poignant! and an album with a purpose! A nice blend of pop and punk... this song is def. a great addition for this summer's rock albums! about time they released a cd that delivers like their old ones did. Kudos

B000QUCNP4|4.0|There's nothing quite like a mystery.  Lately, we have gotten a lot of films involving investigative puzzles.  (`The Davinci Code,' `Inside Man,' and `National Treasure,' come to mind.)  Such is the case with `Zodiac,' except this film is a true-to-life crime story about a serial killer who stalked victims in Vallejo and San Francisco, CA starting in 1969.  It was unprecedented at the time because the police success rate was good until then, and the \\"Summer of Love\\" was a not-too-distant memory.  Gripping at times, the whole movie becomes an illuminating account of heinous crimes by a clever killer who managed to slip out of investigators hands for years.       Starting in Vallejo a mysterious hooded stranger stalks a teenage couple who are parked at Lovers' Lane on the Fourth of July.    In a separate car he stops by and harasses them briefly before returning to the scene.  Using a gun with a flashlight attached, he mercilessly shoots and kills both of them in the car.  There are other similar acts that follow scattered from that first murder, but he refuses to remain completely anonymous. Thriving on publicity, he calls the police to announce his crimes--briefly, but precisely identifying his cruel acts with his victims.  He also sends letters to `The San Francisco Chronicle' with code work meant for them to decipher. Similar confidence appears as he announces their cruel fate to loved ones and sends letters with no code, written in handwriting hard to trace.  Nicknamed \\"Zodiac\\" he terrorizes the people of California, leaving clues like a morbid real-life Riddler.  Having skeletons in his closet and a fascination for the short story, \\"The Most Dangerous Game,\\" Zodiac remained mysterious, yet committed to his mayhem.       Most of the drama zeroes in of the investigation, which is two fold.  For 'The San Francisco Chronicle' columnist, Paul Avery (Robert Downey, Jr.) and political cartoonist, Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) are at odds with one another, but seeeye to eye enough to share drinks and some of the investigation together.   In another part of town, Inspector Dave Tocchi (Mark Ruffalo) tries to piece it all together.  He's smart and thorough, but has many difficulties.  As the years go by, we see suspects come and go and how little pieces of the puzzle fit together to find a composite portrait.  Obviously, it is not a labor of love, given the scope and energy required for the project, but one of the ironies of the story is Graysmith's persistence with the case.  Having an inquisitive and ambitious nature himself, he doesn't have the sensibility to throw in the towel.     `Zodiac' is not only fascinating, but is laid-back enough to give us a true-to-life drama.  All of the actors only magnify the account by their grasp of the humanness of their characters.  The three stars Gyllenhaal, Downey, and Ruffalo especially keep it real.  Thanks to director David Fincher and screenwriter James Vanderbilt, we are transported to a troubled time and place with expert detail.   It is suspenseful at times, but the understatement along with some old newsreels only adds to the authenticity.  Their weariness and the problems they face make it all the more human.  Both journalists grapple with ambition while they juggle their responsibilities and their personal lives.  Both Paul and Robert are contacted by the killer and the repercussions quietly take their toll.  'Zodiac' excels at method and execution, retracing the steps of ordinary people trying to solve an extraordinary crime.

0595440096|5.0|This book is a haunting journey into what must be baby boomers' worst medical nightmare - the inexorable deterioration of the mind.  Even more compelling than watching the progress of this vibrant woman's descent into the ultimate loss is sharing her own heartrending awareness of her fate.  Yet this is not just a well-told story; it is also a primer for non-professionals on Alzheimer's: what it is, what it does and even what avenues might open in the future.  Alice's story is a must-read for anyone who values the mind, both their own and those of their loved ones.  Can't get her out of my mind...
0312305060|1.0|I was unable to get past page 49 of this incredibly tedious novel. It must be what optimistic publishers call a \\"literary\\" novel, if one defines \\"literary\\" as \\"unreadable\\".   Nothing really happens after the opening, which is a vignette of Virginia Woolfe's suicide. (I have little idea of who she was other than that she was popular with my mother's generation, but even then, I recall no book of Woolfe's in my mother's extensive collection of books from that long ago period.)  The writer merely wiffles on and on .. .. and on, describing people's ordinary lives in three different times and spaces. Hell, if that's all there is to writing a book, I could have written a hundred myself by now, instead of the handful I actually have written. Let's see:    Page 37:    Mrs Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself.     For Lucy had her work cut out for her.    (Isn't this a perfect example of the horrible lack of proper grammar that your Junior High English teacher would have criticised? Note that the second sentence isn't a proper sentence, it is a disaster.)    The doors would have to be taken off their hinges; Rumpelmeyer's men were coming. And then, thought Clarissa Dalloway, what a morning -- fresh as if issued to children on a beach.    I find myself irritated not only by the crummy sentences but also by the odd, non-standard, punctuation. the hyphen above has no spaces in the book, not even \\"hair spaces\\" between \\"morning\\" and \\"fresh\\", as if to make one compound word, 'morning-fresh'. In other words it is presented as a dash except with the length of a hyphen.    This is the kind of \\"writing\\" that pretty much anyone could do. E.G:     Sandra goes into the kitchen. That pan, she thinks, that saucepan sitting over there, on the stove. Its Teflon surface reminds her of Richard's conscience as he sits in the office rejecting manuscripts.    - and so on, and on, and boringly, on.   This book, an advance reading copy that has somehow come into my hands, is going into the garbage.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|First time I saw it, I couldn't watch it all the way through. I felt it was boring & pointless. After my teenage son insisted I watch it in it's entirety, I realized there's more here than first meets the \\"mind\\". I saw it about 7 times & it became funnier every time I watched it. The music really was fabulous & the characters were really a piece of work. I bought the CD & watched it over & over. It put me in a fantastic mood & was a nice break from the normal violence we usually see. Someone, of whom I have no idea, borrowed it & never returned it. I fretted until I finally reordered another copy. That's how good it really is!
0618871713|4.0|My general complaint with comics and graphic novels is that great art or simply the fact that it is a visual medium hides the often weak writing associated with it. The comic boom of the 1990's and its sudden decline is a perfect example of the mass-produced and clone-like quality that comics took and the backlash of fans and readers. Luckily, the past few years has seen a growing movement of people to comic book stores and of people buying up graphic novels to the point where they now occupy sections in major bookstores. Bechdel's \\"Fun Home\\" is a perfect example as to why comics are cool to read (and why people like me don't have to hide our love of them). Using diary entries from her childhood, Bechdel really exposes her formative years and how difficult they were in a family life that was less than ideal. Her father continously cheated on her mother with boys with young boys he would pick up any which way, they lived in a house that was a throwback to another era, and the normal intimacies associated with family such as touch and other expressions of intimacy were absent. Bechdel explores her relationship with her father and the gender-flip that takes place as she ages and comes to the realization she is a lesbian. The narrative moves back and forth and with each pass, readers are given more details into the daughter-father relationship. The tragicomic appelatiion is appropriate as questions surrounding her father's death add an even sadder feel to the story. Bechdel's artwork fits extremely well with the story and her pacing is reminiscent of some of my other favorite writer/artists such as Alex Robinson and Derek Kirk Kim. What really stands out for me is her literary achievements within the text and the way she draws on so much \\"stuff\\" out of legends and fiction. I read this in one sitting and plan to do so again in the next day or so. Great work that should not be missed.
0553565915|5.0|I re-read this book after 8 - 10 years.  It was wonderful then, and even better this time.  I believe that God gives us information, but only when we are ready.  Like Algebra:  You have to learn one concept before moving on to the next.  God gives us information as we are ready.  With all of the similarities between all of the near death experiences that have been documented, I find in impossible not to believe Ms. Eadie.  There were a few ideas that were so new to my way of thinking that I found myself doubting.  But, God gave Ms. Eadie a very extensive look at life after death.  It took her many years and encouragement from others to write this book, so there is bound to be some loss of memory.  So, I am willing to cut her some slack on this.  This book renewed my hope and reminded me of what is most important in life.  A great, quick read that will really stick with you!!

B000OQF6N6|4.0|I liked and still like the Smashing Pumpkins with their albums Siamese Dream and Mellon Collie, which were hits and had their own sound. So when I picked Zeitgeist up, I was anxious of what they would sound like. The result wasn't all bad, just different. Billy Corgan seemed to change his guitar from piercing riffs and blazing solos to a kind of muddy \\"wall of sound\\". Also the absence of James Iha and D'Arcy Wretzky is definitely noticeable.     1.Doomsday Clock- One of their first singles, it's pretty catchy and rocks hard. 8/10  2.7 Shades Of Black- The verses in this song are pretty catchy, but the rest of the song gets kind of repetitive. 7/10  3.Bleeding The Orchid- An OK song, mellower than the first two, but not really a standout. 6/10  4.That's The Way (My Love Is)- My favorite song off the album, it's extremely catchy and has a more upbeat melody than the rest of the album's seemingly darker tone. 10/10  5.Tarantula- The album's first single, it has a faster beat and catchy lyrics. 8/10  6.Starz- This song is almost eerie and has a dark tone. Not really a standout. 6/10  7.United States- Billy Corgan dives into politics with this song, which has a cool jamming second half, but is kind of boring in the beginning. 7/10  8.Neverlost- A very good song with a light melody, it's a breath of fresh air from the muddy guitars. 8/10  9.Bring The Light- This song has kind of an atmospheric feel to it, but gets repetitive pretty fast. 7/10  10.(Come On) Let's Go!- This song has catchier guitar than a lot of the other songs, and leaves more of a lasting impression than \\"Bleeding The Orchid\\" or \\"Bring The Light\\". 8/10  11.For God And Country- The last two closing songs kind of fade out and leave more to be desired, like this one. Overall just boring. 5/10  12.Pomp And Circumstances- This is better than the previous song, because it has an oddly light melody and sounds like something off of Mellon Collie. 7/10    Overall, Zeitgeist has some songs that kind of blend together, but the ones that stand out are worth it. The Pumpkins' comeback was definitely interesting, whatever way you put it.
B0000000LI|5.0|Passionate. That is the word I use for this album and DVD. My wife keeps this in our car cd player always. Santorini is my favorite track and I am listening to it as I write this. I am not a great fan of New Age music, being a hard rock fan, but this simply moves me. It is one of the few things I can listen to and feel really inspired. I love to listen to it and play orchestra conductor at the same time. This is a really moving piece of music. I highly recommend it to anyone who needs to be uplifted.
0060763892|2.0|At every twist and turn of \\"The Judas Strain\\" I keep wondering where I've read something similar before. Clive Cussler? Dan Brown? Matt Reilly? Suzanne Brockmann? And I just can't put my finger on it. But it's there.   There is the ex-elite forces outfit (Clive Cussler; Suzanne Brockmann), the symbolism and the process of deciphering the mystery (Dan Brown), the restored car (Clive Cussler), the ex-elite lone wolf with parents (again Clive Cussler, but also Brockmann), the water setting (once again Clive Cussler). And may I add that even Mr. Cussler's love-interest scenes have enough character development in them to make them believable and integral to the story even though romance isn't his genre at all.    Whoever advised Mr. Rollins to come up with an ex-elite forces concept with a whole lot of symbolism in an international setting thrown in, should be fired!!!!    This is a great, superb author who's written incredible novels. But the Sigma Force series does not do this author's talent justice.     Please go back to writing books such as Subterranean. Please?

B000Q6GXW2|5.0|I can't wait for this to be released on HD-DVD. I really feel sorry for the blu-ray only crowd. Considering you can purchase an hd-dvd player for 1/2 the cost of a blu-ray player, I don't see why they don't purchase both.    With 300 on hd-dvd, you get better audio (a lot of blu-ray players can't decode Dolby TrueHD) and interactivity features the none of the blu-ray players can do. Also since the picture will be the same (I've read they used the same video encode for both), there really isn't any reason to buy this on blu-ray. If you do, your just telling the studios and blu-ray manufacturers that it's o.k. to sell you incomplete hardware and software.    Combo discs mean you can play the disc in any player in your house. Unless you want to either replace all your dvd players with a PS3 ($500-$600 per unit) or purchase every movie twice (one blu-ray, one dvd), combo discs are the way to go.    As for quality, every movie released on both formats have been virtually identical in reviews. Mostly the difference is noted when the blu-ray gets stuck with Dolby Digital because some of the players can't support the advanced audio. Studios release to the lowest common denominator, which is pretty low in blu-ray's case.    I take anything Sony(betamax) or PS3 users say with a grain of salt. There are many reasons why HD-DVD is a smarter purchase.    1. Players are significantly cheaper. Blu-ray players are hundres more expensive.  2. All hd-dvd players support available features. All current blu-ray players have drawbacks of some kind. Examples: can't play cd's. can't decode advanced audio codecs, can't play picture in picture, can't access internet, the list goes on. Blu-ray players have been out for over a year and still haven't caught up with hd-dvd's features.  3. Quality - I have the 1st gen HD-A1 (hd-dvd) unit and a 2nd gen BD-P1200 (blu-ray) and I've had vastly fewer problems with HD-DVD. Other than booting slower than my blu-ray player, the menu's are faster, remoteis faster, I can fast forward and rewind without locking up the player, ect.    Don't settle for BLU-RAY, demand the complete HD-DVD experience.
B00005JPLW|3.0|Last time I saw a film that had massive hype from the internet people was Snakes on a Plane, the Samuel L. Jackson vehicle that turned out to be nothing more than a decent way to have some entertainment for an hour and a half. But in 300's case, it wants to be entertaining yet have depth and emotion and pathos too. Problem is everything kind of lessens it since it's made in a videogame-like manner where its attempts at anything deeper is surrounded by fast visuals and graphic violence. Now some will probably disagree of course but personally, I wasn't a big fan of this.    Set in the time of Ancient Greek, King Leonidas of Sparta has been informed that King Xerxes of Persia wants to take over Sparta and expand his rule. Of course Leonidas doesn't take kindly to this and against orders and without a proper army, takes 300 of his best soldiers to fight against the coming Persian army. Meanwhile back home, his wife Queen Gorgo tries to persuade the council to send the army to help while dealing with a conniving man back home.    When I first saw this in theatres, I had to admit that I was quite impressed with the look of the visuals. Shot on a digital set where the backgrounds are replaced with CG, I thought the film had a great look. Unfortunately what it does with it I started to hate since much of the film uses slow motion to make things more \\"cooler\\" rather than use it sparingly and heighten the action. This is combined with the film's want to be epic and grand on the level of sand-and-sandal epics like Gladiator where orchestrated music plays in the background and characters stare at each other. Some might prefer this to just simply having fight scene after fight scene a la Black Hawk Down but it felt false to me.    As far as the acting, it's kind of appropriate. Characters say lines with words like \\"honor\\" and \\"victory\\" a lot, look cool and fight while showing off their muscle-y bodies. The one leading this is Gerard Butler and on 2nd viewing I liked him more when before he seemed like an action figure that's skilled in battle and yelled a lot. But this film wasn't meant to win awards but at least Butler does an admirable job. The other 2 I liked were David Whenham (who funnily enough is better at war speeches than Butler) and Michael Fassbender, otherwise known as the \\"and we will fight in the shade\\" guy.    Granted there is some great visuals here including a nice love scene, an oracle dancing to puffs of smoke and the landscapes of Greece but everything else I wasn't a big fan of. If you want to have MTV-style entertainment and outlandish cartoon violence then go that way like Snakes did but combining Lord of the Rings emotions didn't help. Disagree all you want but for me this is a film that wants to be more than what it is.
1416523359|2.0|I am a Steven King fan, but even by his standards, this book starts out real slow.  I had a hard time not putting this book down until I got through the slow moving, and far too chatty first half of the book.  The last half of of the book was better (although not great), but by the time I got to it, I was pretty much soured on the book as a whole.  If I knew what I know now, I would have never bought the book in the first place.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|I have always been very interested in Nature and wildlife, so naturally I was interested when I kept seeing previews for Planet Earth by the BBC in movie theaters. I watched the Discovery Channel as a kid every night for years, and even now at 21 I watch nature shows on PBS whenever I can, but Planet Earth trumps every nature show I have ever watched. To me, Planet Earth is the culmination of everything that I have ever thought or felt about Nature.    Planet Earth is just so great that I don't know where to begin describing it. Perhaps its most fulfilling quality is that some of the animal behavior that was filmed on Planet Earth had not ever been filmed before, and probably will never be filmed again, due to the nearly unbearable weather and demography of the locations involved. From the extremely rare snow leopard chasing a goat down the side of the Himalayas to a pride of lions bringing down and eating a huge elephant, Planet Earth truly does live up to its claim of showing \\"planet Earth as you've never seen it before. Several new species were filmed for the first time in the wild as well, like New Guniea's amazing birds of paradise.    As if all of the adventurous and breathtaking filming wasn't enough by itself, the whole series is filmed in HDTV, and is the first wildlife documentary to do so. Many of the views are so clear and fresh that at times you feel as if you are actually there. Also, the Planet Earth film crew used some pioneering filming methods, like filming the majority of the series in a helicopter instead of on the ground, flying in a hot air balloon over forests in Madagascar, and using satellite imaging to show certain areas and demographic features not visible or not nearly as detailed when seen with the naked eye. The film crew of Planet Earth really put their lives on hold to make this documentary the best wildlife documentary ever, and it shows. Another feature of this series that I love is that there is a 10 minute video at the end of eachepisode which gives you an inside look at the daunting, dangerous, and nearly insurmountable tasks the production and film crews had to face in each unique environment.    The scale of Planet Earth could also be said to be its defining quality, as it is the largest wildlife documentary in several ways. BBC literally spanned the globe in the filming of Planet Earth, visiting 62 different countries and 204 different locations. It took over five years for the series to be completed, and the BBCs production budget of $25 million U.S. dollars was the biggest ever for any wildlife documentary.    In the end, you should buy Planet Earth for the same reason  that the series was created - to become aware of the inherent beauty and value of Nature, and to see firsthand humanity's mostly negative impact on our Planet's wildlife. Planet Earth's main premise is that the more we see and learn about our amazing planet and its wildlife, the more we will want to protect and conserve it from global warming and other man-made problems that threaten or destroy wildlife and its habitats. Planet Earth shows us a planet that is fragile yet strong, beautiful yet harsh, explored yet unknown. Above all, Planet Earth shows us a planet worth cherishing and conserving.
B000R4SMCW|5.0|I am a retired prosecutor and found the film to be brilliant and riveting.  There is one plot twist and it's spectacular.  The screenplay is extremely well written.  Antony Hopkins was magnificent as the villain-defendant.  I am impatient for the film's release on DVD.
1594489505|5.0|A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini touches the heart with a compelling and at times gut wrenching  tale of two women who struggle to survive in the midst of harsh and cruel treatment they face from the world around them. The reader is constantly on guard as they encounter adversity, abuse, injustice, and betrayal from strangers, and at times from those who should be protecting them.     Once I started A Thousand Splendid Suns, it was difficult to put it down. Housseini has created believable,  human characters and placed them in the harsh realities of a nation that suffered many years of a civil war fueled by two super powers, only to find peace in the harsh reign of the Taliban. Throughout the reading I couldn't help thinking where I was when events of the story took place. Perhaps Housseini's great gift is his ability to construct a very personal bridge from the reader to the lives of the characters he creates.    A Thousand Splendid Suns is a great book. It inspires with the perseverance  of its characters and casts light on a world that is often hidden to outsiders. It should be read by anyone who desires to understand the realities many women face throughout the world today.
B00000AFFF|5.0|This magnificent album combines the wonderful talents of Burt Bacharach and Elvis Costello together to create something completely unique. Sure from the opening notes its clear who has had a bigger influence on the music (Bacharach) but Costello's input both lyrically and in some fantastic vocal performances is not to down-played.<br /><br />Bacharach's background as one one of the finest popular songwriters needs no introduction. However the journey that Costello has taken from 70's new-wave angry young man to frankly all-round musical chameleon is amazing. He's now married to a Jazz Pianist, reads music and has written his own classical music - including the score! At the time of this recording Costello was halfway through this transitional period, but was already writing at the Piano and indeed a large part of the music was written by Bacharach and Costello at two keyboards.<br /><br />On this album Costello pushes his voice to the limit and consequently puts in a number of astounding performances. His voice will not be to everybodies taste, but I love the emotion he puts into his singing and the vibrato he adds to any held note has become a trademark feature.<br /><br />Favourite tracks - well \\"Tears at the Birthday Party\\" gives Costello a chance great to demonstrate his vocal range. Perhaps not the most interesting track lyrically, but when Costello sings the chorus you can't help but become wrapped up in the whole thing. Likewise \\"God give me Strength\\" is another great performance from Costello.<br /><br />Another track I love is \\"The Sweetest Punch\\" which demonstrates Burt Bacharach's fabulous arranging and conducting skills. It goes without saying that all the songs are impeccably arranged, and the production is spot on.<br /><br />You know how sometimes you have to play an album quite a few times before you begin to appreciate it. Well not with this one, the first time I played it I new it was a classic.
B00007KQKM|3.0|If I did not know this was Ken Russel's work, I would mistake it for a run-of the-mill BBC mini series.  OK, but not exciting.  There is no chemistry between the lady and her lover.  Sir Clifford (the husband) is more likeable than Mellors (the lover) -- that should tell you something.  Russel's work falls especially flat after seeing a superb new French version of Lady Chatterley by Pascale Ferran.  For me, Ferran's is the ultimate interpretation of D.H. Lawrence's work, exquisitely filmed and peopled with passionate and believable characters.
B00005MP58|5.0|There don't seem to be enough good adjectives in the English Language to describe the beauty of this miniseries. I can find no fault in it. I usually hate movies where people talk in old English like this but this story is so well told the actors are so incredible, you will be hooked from beginning to end. This movie has some of the most memorable and quotable quotes. The love/hate that develops between Darcy and Elizabeth is played to perfection here by Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. It is not often that a movie leaves me completely mesmerized. I never wanted it to end. I watch it constantly. This movie should come with a warning  BEWARE: Once you start watching this you might never be able to stop.  It is that good!
0553381695|3.0|As I write this, I am 3 books through the 4 book series and will definitely read the 4th book (though I will borrow it from the library rather than buy it). I gave this book/series 3 stars ... does that seem credible as I devour the 3500+ pages of the series? I don't know, as I guess I am enjoying it ...    These comments are really general ones about the series, as the books do not really individually stand out. The best thing about book 2 was that I got a larger paperback version than normal, which was easier for me to read and handle.    Writing: On the plus side George R.R. Martin has created a detailed, fully imagined world, with at least 12 separate plot lines that he keeps going and intertwines as appropriate. Many of the characters have complex, conflicted motivations which he skillfully conveys.    On the negative side: perhaps I have been reading \\"young adult\\" pablum fiction with my son for too long, but the unremitting level of violence in the series becomes fatiguing after a while (early on it is merely shocking). I have never read a work of fiction with this level of violence. In fact Martin uses a plot device where, every time there is a chance of resolution of some major plot issue, he kills off the main character who would be essential to the resolution. Since this happens 2 to 5 times in each book, I found this predictable and manipulative. Plus no plot line has reached any sort of resolution by the end of book 3. Good way to sell book 4, I guess.    Another aspect that may be negative for some is the focus on complex relationships between the different \\"houses\\" in the novels. Each volume has 45+ pages of family tree information in an appendix in case you start to lose track of whose great grandson married whose cousin to forge an alliance between which houses. By the end of the first book I had stopped worrying about my inability to follow all these interactions. For me, the level of detail detracted from the plot.    So where does that leave me, as a net out for the series? I think the books are a monumental achievement, but in kind of the same way I think Wikipedia is a monumental achievement. My conclusion, by the end of A Clash of Kings, which was then confirmed in book 3, was that there were actually 3 series contained in the one series. If Martin had produced a 12 book series, with each book more focused and with a more cohesive plot line, I think he would be viewed as a peer and equal of Tolkien or Asimov (albeit with far more \\"adult\\" content) as an author of an ageless series.

B00008DDSC|5.0|Wonderful movie.  Some of our puritanical American viewers might get stuck on the sexual content and reject this film (probably out of a sense of their own sexual inadequacies).  This movie goes much deeper than raw eroticism.  It is a wonderful commentary on individuality and the psychology of individuality. This film celebrates the uniqueness of the individual human spirit.  This film screams about acceptance and appreciation of oneself -- and to acknowledge and honor the normal and quirky traits we all possess.  This movie is truly a great film.  It will undoubtedly go down as an important cult classic -- I would argue on the same par as cult classics \\"The Graduate\\" and \\"Harold and Maude.\\"  The performances by Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader are first rate.  These were likely too very difficult roles to pull off and they did it superbly.
0066620996|2.0|this book can be read just by reading the first couple of chapters, other than that its a waste of your time. this books took years of research and interviews to arrive at this conclusion? and a whole team of researchers at that? This book is no great break through, its just common sense and repeating of the main concept over and over and over and over and over again, the end.  You know how alot of books should be alot shorter, but they just fill it with[..]to make you fill like its a real book? this is that.
B0002IQEHI|5.0|One of the great movies of all time. One of Hitchcock's best. rather than go for the boxed set - which includes a few of his lesser lights - decided to cherry pick a gem. North By Northwest is a classic. AFI Top 100. Anyone who's a fan of Hitchcock - or just suspense in general - or great movies specifically - you cannot miss with this one.
0316166685|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel. While reading, I found myself going through the spectrum of emotions. The relevancy of the story to our own societal issues is what makes it so profound. The story catapults itself from the category of fiction into the realm of actuality in certain situations. You feel as though you are a witness to something substantial. I read this book a while ago but it still resonates today.  I look forward to seeing the movie although nothing surpasses using your own imagination.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I bought this series as a Father's Day gift for my dad.  He was only able to watch a handful of episodes when it was originally broadcast on TV and really liked what he saw.  The images and video are wonderful, and I plan on getting it in BRD or HDDVD when I upgrade my equipment!
B000IHYY52|1.0|Having read a review at Hi Def Digest saying that this looks better than any material shot on film ever will, I ran to buy this disc (along with Chris Botti's favorably reviewed BD). I do not know what these people were thinking? Music, performances and sound are great, but this looks awfull and not wothy of a Hi Def disc. Really, some upscaled DVD's are looking much better. Very disappointing...
B000002P5W|5.0|Amazing how well this album holds up. If anything it seems more creative and masterful forty years after it was released. When it first came out, this album astonished young and old guitar players alike. We could not comprehend how Hendrix was making the sounds he so effortlessly created. In the USA we did not yet know about the sound of an overdriven Marshall amp and a Univibe effect pedal. It is  ironic that Jimi, a professional R&B player with serious chops and road experience, had to go to London to be appreciated as a soloist. On this album he is confident, explorative, poetic and emotionally expressive. The dissipation and excess that mars some tracks on Electric Ladyland had not yet set in. Pure artistry and genius. Mitch Mitchells drum work reminds me of Keith Moon at his best. It is a shame he never worked with the Who after Moon passed. The engineering by Eddie Kramer is masterful and captures both the delicacy and drive of this trio. I suggest you skip over bass player Noel Reddings middling compositon \\"Shes so Fine\\". It detracts from the work.
B000002KCI|5.0|Heralded on its release in 1975 as a long awaited \\"return to form\\" by those yearning for another \\"Harvest\\", \\"Zuma\\" is a much richer and wilder album which, on the way, showcases Neil Young's music in all its mercurial, often brilliant but rambling glory. Veering from the heavy metal grunge of \\"Drive Back\\", through the searingly powerful, wonderfully controlled guitar-work on \\"Cortez the Killer\\", the bizarrely addled incantations of \\"Barstool Blues\\", the foot-tapping country of \\"Lookin' for a Love\\", to the perfect MOR harmonies of \\"Through My Sails\\", it exemplifies what's made him so good but so frustratingly difficult to follow. And, up there with any of his better recordings, it's not only essential for any Neil Young fan but an excellent \\"next step\\" for anyone wanting to explore beyond \\"After The Goldrush\\", \\"Harvest\\" or his \\"Greatest Hits\\" albums.     Four stars then? Well yes, but not enough, because in here is a hidden gem... an outstanding, perfectly formed track that sums up what makes Neil Young worth the effort. Rarely played and missing from virtually all of the \\"Best of\\" lists of his songs it is, for me at least, one of the most quietly beautiful, ecstatically reflective and unforgettable pieces of acoustic music ever made. \\"Pardon My Heart\\"... worth the price of the album on its own.
B000QUCNP4|2.0|This is a fantastic movie, but I thought it'd be useful to post this information for those who didn't know.  If you enjoy this film, just like Fincher's other movies (\\"Fight Club\\", \\"Se7en\\"), there is going to be a Special Edition release of this DVD.  In 2008 there will be a release with multiple commentary tracks and loads of extras.  This release here is the \\"bare bones\\" version.  If that's all you need, then fine.  But for those who don't want to get ripped-off buying the same thing twice; it's probably worth waiting for the 2008 disc.  I hope this helps.
B00005JPSL|3.0|Have you ever sat in the theatre and found yourself saying \\"Oh, I remember seeing that scene in this or that film before\\" so much so that you know and expect everything to come out just a certain way? Not that this is bad per se, but certainly NO RESERVATIONS is not original ideas brought to the screen!....A workaholic woman who needs some edges  chipped off and softened to experience the real essence of life (Catherine Zeta-Jones): a charmingly cute and \\"together\\" man to enter her too well ordered world (Aaron Eckhart): and an adorable orphan who needs love and has needs to give and receive(Abigail Breslin).This film seemed borrowed from the  characters of Charlotte Bronte, Jane Austen,THE COURTSHIP OF EDDIE'S FATHER and most in particular the Argentinian Academy nominated SON OF THE BRIDE and the German film MOSTLY MARTHA.There is nothing at all new in NO RESERVATIONS so have NO EXPECTATIONS.It is a formulaic,feel-good,all-works-out in the end film.There are the necessary touching moments that help you feel with the three characters, but there is really nothing here that has not been done so many times before and better. Abigail Breslin, fresh from her triumph in LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE, is the Dakota Fanning-Haley Joel Osment of the moment.Scripts will abound for her at her age and then we and Hollywood will get tired of her as she starts to mature. On the other hand, it is great to see Zeta-Jones back, but with none of the \\"meatiness\\" of roles like CHICAGO and TRAFFIC that allow her to be the multi-facted actress that she is.Aaron Eckhart seems typecast again in roles that keep defining his career as the breezy guy who defrosts lady's cold troubled hearts!.All-in-all, NO RESERVATIONS is a pleasant enough one time view,but there is not much that is tasty and tempting enough to reserve a table a second time!    Excellent companion film would be MOSTLY MARTHA which seems to be where this film drew it's inspiration.

0786158344|5.0|Three cheers for Harris, Dawkins, and Hitchens.  Brave atheists are finally breaking their long silence after 3,000 years of religious censorship.  Some day far in the future enlightened people will look back on our times and wonder how many people could be so ignorant, deluded, and foolish.  Reason and sanity are our only tools for survival.  The non-existent god cannot stop us from using our brains.  If you are tired of the same old religious nonsense, read this book.
B000OYC3J8|3.0|If this were an EP and the album ended after track 7, than I'd really enjoy it. The 2nd half of the album just sounds like filler. At least the price was right. It's a shame the music of today lacks the heart and energy of the artists in the late 60's & early 70's.
B000FTWB7G|3.0|Wasnt as good as the first one, but its got a few decent songs on it .
B000MV8AE0|4.0|It's not a documentary, and I doubt it attempts to be. Purists who have an encyclopedic knowledge of Beethoven's last years may find it hard to swallow, but it's a moving piece of film art which is in no small effort attributed to the music.    That the director and screen-playwright had certain agendas up their sleeves is nothing subliminal. It's afterall, a pro-feminist inquiry into an oft male-dominated territory and what more excitement to pit perhaps the greatest male composer who ever lived (and perhaps one of the most staunchly chauvinistic, though references have to be sought here) with an imaginary muse.    That Beethoven had many female muses throughout his life is known to most who know and have heard his music. \\"Fur Elise\\" is a case in point that requires no further elaboration.     The case here with Anna Holtz is a little different. In the film she does not challenge the titanic proportions of Beethoven's genius, but shares a glimpse of it through her daily interactions with him.     That she is really capable of doing so needs much more convincing (in lieu of her less-than-professional conducting, her decidedly facile compositions), but the merits of the show are still quite aplenty to cover whatever weaknesses in terms of credibility.     The show is an endearing caricature of Beethoven and the exploration of humanity that tries often to reconcile the man and the music. Anna is but a foil in the entire epic.    Ed Harris is quite irresistable as Beethoven. Diane Kruger is somewhat mild and unjustifiably put at a disadvantage by the fictitiousness of her character but she is, by and large, a competent actress and her role was emphatic not to say the least.    The period dressing was a little anachronistic for the ladies of the 1820s (backdated by about a decade); the men's were quite excellent (coloured, patterned cravats starting to become de rigeur) and Harris' wig quite very believable.     The scope is more focused than in Immortal Beloved; Harris' Beethoven is more lovable and though the ending was quite abrupt, I would recommend this film to those who are not familiar to Beethoven beyond his 9th, and even more so for people who have, before-hand, known that the entire character of Anna Holtz is pure myth, though a myth with a moral behind it.
B000053VAZ|5.0|I will keep this short and sweet. If you are a Johnny Depp fan, this is a must to add to your collection. It is a great story and as always, Johnny Depp is a great actor.
0316067598|5.0|The book tells a great and heroic story, it is a shame Marcus couldn't find someone who could actually write to tell it.
0684833395|5.0|Catch-22 is a brilliant story of logic and sense.  Chronicling bombardier pilot John Yossarian's years in World War Two Italy, on the fictional island of Pianosa, the story brutally satirizes war, politics, and a myriad of human flaws.  Heller blends a deep and complex narrative with sharp, intelligent humor to create a classic as thoroughly enjoyable as it is intellectually rewarding.  Catch-22 is a must-read, one of the very finest pieces of twentieth century American literature.   The story begins with Yossarian lying in a hospital bed, feigning liver disease in order to avoid flying on potentially deadly bombing raids.  He is charged there with censoring the letters sent between soldiers and their loved ones at home and amuses himself by altering the letters in creative ways, often completely changing their meanings.  Already the army bureaucracy is criticized, both for its questionable intentions in having the letters censored at all, and for allowing Yossarian to ruin them.  Soon a new patient check into Yossarian's ward, a Texan.  He \\"turned out to be good-natured, generous, and likeable.  In three days nobody could stand him.\\"  The patients' reaction to their amiable fellow sets the stage for a story full of such paradoxes and ironies.  At the heart of the confusion in this instance is the Texan's extreme patriotism.  The veteran soldiers in the room have become disillusioned with concepts like patriotism and honor and are repulsed by the Texan's reflection of their former naiveté.  As each soldier miraculously recovers and returns to duty, we laugh at the absurdity of their overreaction, but we also wonder at the idea of being so repulsed by an ostensibly good quality like patriotism.   The entire episode in the hospital, during which many important characters are introduced and recurring plot elements are brought into the narrative, is over in a few pages.  Heller's writing is dense, but reads quickly and smoothly, so much so that readers who revisit a chapter, particularly after finishing the book, will find much more there than the first reading uncovered.  In fact, Catch-22 practically mandates re-reading, as the story is often told out-of-order, from frequently changing viewpoints, and with crucial information revealed only after it is needed.  Though Yossarian is the book's central character, each chapter brings a new soldier, officer, or civilian into the spotlight, exploring events from his or her perspective as contrasted with Yossarian's relatively sane view.   The first character to receive this treatment is Clevinger.  Unlike most of the book's military characters, Clevinger is intelligent, well educated, and highly principled.  His unfailing optimism is frequently contrasted with Yossarian's outright pessimism.  Almost immediately after his introduction, Clevinger has tries to change Yossarian's dark outlook.  \\"They're trying to kill me,\\" Yossarian told him calmly.  \\"No one's trying to kill you,\\" Clevinger cried.  \\"Then why are they shooting at me?\\" Yossarian asked.  \\"They're shooting at everyone,\\" Clevinger answered. \\"They're trying to kill everyone.\\"  \\"And what difference does that make?\\"  Both men make perfectly rational arguments, and both truly believe their words, and yet they couldn't agree more.  Unfortunately for Clevinger, fate seems to prove Yossarian right.  Not long after their exchange, Clevinger is put on trial in military court, apparently for no other crime than being \\"smart,\\" (and therefore a threat).  The trial is perfectly absurd, and hilarious.  A bellicose colonel demands to know the exact time at which Clevinger didn't deny his guilt, but refuses to tell him with what crime he is being charged.  After much confused suttering, Clevinger exasperatedly admits \\"I always didn't say you couldn't find me guilty!\\" The colonel, finally appeased, says \\"That's much better, Mr Clevinger.\\"  The trial is side-splitting, but its implied accusations are frightening.  The blatant injustice in the military court goes entirely unquestioned by all but the accused.  Not a soul questions the court's completely invalid logic or its motivations in attacking one of the most sincerely good men in the camp without cause.  Yossarian's belief that the world conspires against the sane seems entirely justified as Clevinger searches desperately for some truth to hold onto, still unwilling to believe that Yossarian's worst fears might have been realized.  Yossarian begins to devote himself entirely to escaping the war when his squadron's commander, Colonel Cathcart, develops a habit of lengthening his men's tours of duty whenever one nears completion.  By raising the number of missions required of each man, he hopes to develop the best squad in the army and get promoted to general, but his absurd rule effectively pronounces a death sentence upon his men.  Yossarian in particular is horrified, but struggles to find any way around Cathcart in the military's virtual dictatorship of insane and incompetent men.  As the story progresses, Catch-22 darkens as Heller focuses on the facts of war and death.  Everything Yossarian sees in Pianosa convinces him further that his own countrymen are out to kill him.  The war becomes less and less of a reality as the men of the base gain a sense of the war's futility and the inevitability of their deaths.  While Heller's sharp wit remains about him, it focuses more on true insanity than the quirks and character flaws that originally defined his characters.  Each man on the island has his own battle with death and must decide what he believes, yet none of them can change the realities of their situation.  As death looms over the island, each man reacts differently, but always in extreme and exaggerated ways.  Many go into denial about their fates; others go mad trying to escape their combat duties.  Yossarian grows distrustful of everybody and tries one desperate escape after another, obsessed with saving himself.  Each character's fate has far reaching implications and serves to advance Heller's anti-war and anti bureaucracy crusade, but it is the result of Yossarian's quest for sanity that writes the final words on war, death, and sanity itself.
B000RIHBIE|5.0|\\"All Killer No Filler\\" was, without question, one of the most energetic and driving releases in all of 2001. A rarety in that it was way more \\"punk\\" than it was \\"pop,\\" the only issue with that album, and its predecessor \\"Half Hour of Power,\\" was that the sound they were going for was being attepted by hundreds of other bands at the time. In 2002, while most of the bands similar to Sum 41 were going screamo or eyeliner or whatever, they released the metal-influenced \\"Does This Look Infected,\\" which started out with a HUGE bang but ended with quite a few weak songs. By 2004, when \\"Chuck\\" was released, it appeared that the band had adopted the punk-metal sound permanently, which wasn't a bad thing, since the songs \\"No Reason\\" and the vastly underrated ballad \\"Pieces\\" were among Sum 41's best tracks. Problem was, other than three somgs or so, the album didn't develop a consistent hook or vibe, and began to sound strikingly similar to Metallica's new stuff, which is not good for anyone. So a change was in order, and change they did, taking two plus years to release \\"Underclass Hero,\\" not to be confused with Green Day's \\"Working Class Hero.\\" What sets \\"Undeclass Hero\\" apart from the rest is the band's raw ability to write energetic, absolutely blasting melodies and short riffs. Throw in Deryk Whibley's sing/shout/rap style, and POW! you've got a punk rock record. The album gets a little political on occasion on the track \\"March of the Dogs\\" where you can hear the phrases like \\"The President's Dead\\" over and over. On the single Underclass Hero, it is just pure melodic energy, \\"Dookie\\" times ten. No band has ever cooked up this much energy on a mainstream release, as many of the tracks reverberate with a freshness that inspires those who have become so tired of whiny emo trash and the redundancy and arrogance of hip-hop. Want a good album to blast in your car this summer with the windows down, and tired of all of the bands out there who follow the scene and come up short, then purchase this album today, it may be what the doctor ordered. It is plainly evident throughout this album that Sum 41 is back, and back to making the type of records that their fans love best.hen purchase this album today, it may be what the doctor ordered.

B0007Y08PQ|2.0|There have been a lot of reviews that discuss the fascinating effect or wonder scene of importance, etc., so I won't rehash it all.  Here's an easy way to decide if you want to own this film... ask yourself this question: \\"Did I like Star Trek 4: Save The Whales?\\"  If the answer is yes, then you'll like this ST:TNG version of ST4:STW.  If you found it intolerably preachy without enough of the reasons you watch a ST film (like I did), then this one will just piss you off (like ST4:STW did).    There, I just saved you hours of reading other reviews.  Thank me later.
B00003CXCD|4.0|The quality of this movie was great.  It's a movie that spans time and is great for all generations.
0307237699|5.0|This is an exceptionally well written book which serves two purposes admirably:    1) gain a deeper insight into one of the more fascinating, and unique individuals to emerge in the national spotlight in recent years.  After having listened to the Grammy Award winning, audio version of \\"Dreams from My Father\\", and reading this book, I felt like I knew Barack Obama much as I would a very close friend.  There is an honesty, and depth to his prose which is most rare in my experience, especially from a politician.  But clearly, he is not your typical politician.    2) gain a clearer understanding of our current state of politics.  Barack Obama's understanding of our country's politics, both past and present, is simply amazing.  He hits so many bull's-eyes as to what is both right and wrong about our country and its politics, especially where we stand today.    You can't fix a problem unless you first understand it, and well.  After having read the book, I was left with no uncertainty as to whether or not Obama understands what the main problems are.      I was most impressed by his even-handedness.  He does have a Democratic bias, and says so up front.  That said, it was so refreshing to see someone write with respect, and empathy for those with whom he might disagree.  He is clearly a uniter, and not a divider.  I can think of no one better equipped to help reverse the effects of years of divisiveness, and bring us back together again, to work on the critical issues that face our country, and the world today.    He's exactly the right person at the right time.  I think this book goes a long way towards explaining why.    I enthusiastically recommend it to anyone, regardless of political leanings, who cares about this country, and wants to learn more about the inner workings of its government.

B000058983|5.0|One of the great, inexplicably overlooked masterpieces of the 60s, Forever Changes is a collection of dreamy, ethereal pop songs with a dark, foreboding undercurrent. The music is lush and moody, soaked in atmosphere and dripping with dark color. The lyrics are pure hallucinogenic poetry, full of striking images and verbal mind games. The instrumrntation, although mostly accoustic, is as vibrant and nuanced as any Jimi Hendrix guitar solo. The arrangements include light orchestration, but the swirling violins and ominous horns don't sound out of place or pretentious. They mesh wonderfully with the songs, creating a series of dense, textured soundscapes that sound more and more engrossing with each listen. The end result is something akin to walking through a gorgeous and dreamlike meadow where the grass screams in agony whenever you step on it. In other words, this is a darkly beautiful classic, a unique and brilliant colection of songs that belongs in the posession of anyone who is even halfway concerned with collecting good rock music.    As far as highlights go, I've always loved the low-key catchiness and irrepressable menace of \\"A House Is Not A Motel,\\" as well as the icy, bittersweet \\"Andmoreagain.\\" \\"Alone Again Or\\" is a haunting portrait of loneliness, and an enticing soundscape that incorporates dazzling flameno guitars and a tense, ominous string section. There's also the stark, apocalyptic beauty of \\"The Red Telephone\\" and \\"The Good Humor Man Sees Everything Like This,\\" as well as the hazy, hifting textures of \\"You Set the Scene.\\" But really, every song here has something to reccomend it. From start to finish, Forever Changes is a truly great album, and one that you'd do well to pick up as soon as possible.

Indeed, it's fitting that the two albums were released ten years apart, at the ends of their respective decades- while 1959's Kind of Blue summed up the detatched, intelligent cool of 50s jazz, In a Silent Way encapsulates the experimental eagerness and broad emotional range that was coming to prominence in its decade. The album retains Kind of Blue's simple elegance, uncluttered musial frameworks, ensemble feel, and emotional resonance, while at the same time drastically revising notions of what jazz is (and what it can be). For one thing, the group itself is pretty unorthodox: There are no less than three keyboard players (Herbie Hancock and Chick Corea on electric piano, Joe Zawinul on organ), creating dense, amorphous clusters of sound and voicing dense, six-handed chords. They give the album a dreamy, shadowy groove that rings with mystery and tension. Electric guitarist John Mclaughlin swims somewhere in the mix, shooting lightening bolts of melody from in between the maze of keyboards. Drummer Tony Williams and bassist Dave Holland hold the improvisations together, lending the proceedings a steady, hypnotic pulse. On soprano sax, Wayne Shorter is a skilled counterpart to Davis, creating haunting, creamy strings of improvised melody. As usual, it is to Miles' immense credit that he never steals the show; he plays brilliantly, of course, but at the same time he knows that just because his name's on the front of the record doesn't mean that he's the only one worth hearing. He gives each player plenty of space to do his this thing and drive the session to new heights. The end result is that no one person dominates the proceedings, and yet everyone sounds wonderful. The comibnation of playing produces a beautiful, surreal, mesmerizing labyrinth of sound.    Perhaps the most notorious member of the sessions is the man who doesn't play a single note: Producer Teo Macero (along with Miles), assembled this album piece by piece, stitiching together various fragments, editing excerpts and brief runs into a cohesive whole. Although it is somewhat dissapointing to think that the two tracks on In A Silent Way weren't originally played as pieces, Macero's editing really is neither heavy-handed nor invasive. Each piece builds naturally, with an organic feel that lasts throughout the proceedings. This editing technique doesn't ruint the improvisational nature of the music, either; after all, the individual excerpts themselves were improvised, and that more than shows- there's so much excitement in the playing, a communal vibe that holds the group together and allows for some dazzling interplay.    The overall sound of the album is that of an inspired late-night jam session. The comparison to Kind of Blue seems especially apt in describing the playing itself- the music, as the title implies, is quiet, never spiraling into the apocalyptic walls of electric noise that would mark the later days of Davis' fusion period. The ephasis here is not on volume but on creating and sustaining a groove, a dreamy rush of rhythms and melodies that never lets its complexities overwhelm the listener. This approach is evident from the first, bubbling guitar patterns of \\"Shhh/Peaceful.\\" The track builds with slow, organic grace. Williams' drums fuel its sound, lending the music a steady, relentless rhythm and goading each player to construct his own little dizzying tower of sound. Miles' creamy solo and the keyboardists' dizzying webs of melody lend the piece ample atmosphere. The end result is something akin to riding past a beautifully lit city on a train in the middle of a cold, quiet night. \\"In A Silent Way/ It's About That Time\\" asends from a formless swirl of ethereal guitar notes to a funky, mesmerizing vamp.    It's a brilliant album, and one of the many towering achievements in the Davis catalogue.
0375836675|2.0|I was so excited to begin reading this book, but as I got farther along into it, I began to feel sick.  On every single page are several profanities and embarrasing sexual content.  There is a full range of colorful language.  Some are fairly mild, but others shocked me and made me feel greasy.  There is so much talk about sex that I wonder if the main character actually cares for his maybe-someday-girlfriend, or was simply overcome by lust.  I tried to get drawn into the story, but I just couldn't get past the language!  This is NOT a children's book.  Please be aware of this when purchasing this book.  I wish that Mr. Zusak had given more thought to his readers when writing this.  The storyline is excellent and his characters are well developed, but the entire book is marred by this one fatal flaw.
B00009ATKS|5.0|For my money, this is their best album. The big difference between this album and some of their others (which are very good as well), is that this album is more fan friendly, a lot of hooks. I can sit down and listen to this whole album any time. With some of their other albums, I find myself forwarding a few songs, not \\"Happy Songs..\\" So in conclusion, this band is outstanding, and this is their greatest album, in my opinion.
0316067598|5.0|This was a real eye opener regarding what is involved in becoming a Navy SEAL and the hardships our troop in Iraq are facing. They are in temperatures over 100 degrees, fighting the meanest people in the world, who hate us in way we cannnot even comprehend. I know one thing for sure after reading this book, the liberal media and the liberal politicians need to let our soldiers do the jobs they are trained to do. The troops are afraid of what the media will report and it interferes with their decision making. It made me want to find a bumper sticker that reads:\\" IF CAN'T STAND BEHIND OUR TROOPS....GET IN FRONT OF THEM!\\"
B000NVIGC0|4.0|Wilco is unquestionably one of the best bands of our time, and this is certainly worth a listen.    This is very different from Ghost / YHF in that the songs are much more direct, with less elaborate mixes / elusive lyrics than their prior two masterpieces.  Sort of hearkens to Being There, but with less of an alt-country sound.    One of the best of 2007 - but not quite as good as at least this fan was expecting (check out Cassadega for the best to date this year).
1594489505|4.0|Having read this novel for a book club I was at first not very enthused abut having to read this book. Upon reading it however I was found it to be very interesting and a joy to read. Khaled Hosseini does an excellent job tying all of the characters together. I also found this to be a very interesting personal story about all of the turmoil that has plagued Afghanistan in both the past and the present. Overall I found it to be easily read and easy to understand the meanings that the author was attempting to present.
0375831002|4.0|This book though classified as a book for pre-teens I am not sure I would let my son or daughter that age to read this. The book is about Liesl Memmer a girl living in Nazi Germany and what happens during a short part of her life. It starts out with the death of her brother on a train while her mother was bringing the two to a foster home. During the funeral Liesl steals a book (The Gravediggers Guide). At first she does not like her new home, but soon learns to love her father, her mother (who likes to cuss) and Rudi a next door neighbor. In the next few years Liesl steals more books, has a Jew hiding in her house and steals food with Rudi, all with the backdrop of World War Two. While there are some not sutable things in this part of the book the thing that takes a while to get used to is the narrator telling the story-Death. Very weird, powerful book.
0375758992|5.0|This book is a must-read no matter what one's preferred literary genre may be.  Alexandra Fuller has taken me to Africa where she has shared a most incredible childhood and family life.  Since reading, I've become completely fascinated with African culture, particularly the white farmers and their battles to make a life and home of this often brutal and merciless land.  I hope she continues to grace the world with her unforgettable stories and unique style of telling them.

B000P0J024|5.0|The Traveling Wilburys were one of the few supergroups that lived up to their promise, mostly because they didn't try to. Things started off simply enough when George Harrison, needing a B-side for a 1988 single, called on friend Jeff Lynne who happened to know that Bob Dylan had a studio nearby in L.A.. George's guitar was at Tom Petty's house and by that point they decided to do the group thing.<br /><br />The group was complete with the addition of Roy Orbison, acclaimed by many as \\"The Most Beautiful Voice in Rock n' Roll.\\"  Unfortunately, Orbison passed away shortly after the first album was released, but the Wilburys succeeded due to the genial camaraderie that is reverberates through both discs. What could have been a train wreck of ego, instead resulted in these guys having a blast, trading lead vocals and harmonies that shimmer with the affection and respect the members clearly held for each other.<br /><br />Harrison and Lynne's beautiful production make these records both listenable and memorable, particularly \\"Handle with Care,\\" \\"End of the Line,\\" and a breathtaking Orbison performance on \\"Not Alone Anymore\\". The CD's went out of print for about a decade until Olivia Harrison completed George's wishes to re-master and re-release the material, adding two rare tracks per disc as well as a DVD of music videos and a band documentary. The Deluxe package also includes a hard cover book of rare photos and a sticker.<br /><br />This is a comprehensive overview of a twice-in-a-lifetime project that, especially after Harrison's and Orbison's passing, will never be repeated.
0375831002|5.0|What a compelling story for  all ages!  I found this a book not to put down because of the story, but I was even more captured by the author's startling metaphors and unique descriptions which adolescents may miss or not fully appreciate.   Zusak very convincingly tells how the families continued \\"to live\\" and to  be hopeful in such a fearful time.
B00003CWNR|5.0|A courageous film dealing unemotively with; abortion... incest...racism,  - but with an underlying message that we can all take through life: beware the capricious \\"...

(too much?)<br /><br />A film to promote gentle reflection on the meaning of wisdom and a deeper humanity ~ well worth a look.
B000000WA4|5.0|I had the great fortune of being a teenager when this album first came out.  Many (too many) years later I still find this an incredible example of artistic creativity and sheer talent.  The Smashing Pumpkins' eclectic style shines more so here than any other CD (Siamese Dream was great but fairly uniform).  Some may complain of \\"fillers\\", but to be honest I do not think there is a single song on this double CD that would make the whole better by its removal (even James Iha's two entries--which I originally found intollerable, have grown on me as a pleasant and partially tongue-in-cheek break from Corgan's downpour of emotions and ideas).  After this album, the Pumpkins went off in new directions, never returning to the brilliance demonstrated in Mellon Collie.
B00005JPLW|5.0|an awesome action movie with outstanding movie effects. If you just want a movie with the good guy and bad guy going at it for 2+ hours then this is a movie for you. Insane amount of action and a nice lil twist in the plot near the end of the movie just leaves you going, \\"Wow!\\" Probably not a movie for the too serious. Its not a complicated movie to follow, and its a nice kick back movie that doesn't involve you having to piece together tidbits here and there to make sure your understanding it right. Like I mentioned before, just a nice solid action movie, can't really go wrong with it if you enjoy a bit of arse kicking.
B000GY729M|4.0|The 2nd album from the killers doesn´t dissappoint at all, it has 7 to 8 songs that easily could be picked as single, track 6 \\"read my mind\\" being my favorite. Sam´s town, When You were young,Bling, For Reasons Unknowned, Uncle Johnny, Bones, This River is Wild, all great songs, and above all this is not a carbon copy from hot fuss.
B00005RHGL|5.0|This movie should be considered a classic.  The actors as well as the characters portrayed are awesome and truly amusing.  I bought this for my husband, but I enjoy it too.  Unfortunately the audio is terribly loud.  You have to keep adjusting the volume to hear the actors lines, then turning it down as to not have the music blast you out of your living room.  What's up with that??  I've noticed it seems to be common in a lot of movies...  Anyway, great movie - a must see!!

I have given this book as a gift to my daughter and my best friends.  Cannot recommend it highly enough!!
0446693804|3.0|This book is both easy to read and simplistic,  thickly sentimental, and full of clich&eacute;. It was engaging enough for me to finish it, but I don't expect I'll actively seek out any more Sparks books.<br /><br />  I would, however, recommend this book to English language learners as supplementary leisure reading. One of its big strengths is the wealth of information it offers on US culture in the 1950s. Vocabulary and grammar won't present much of a problem - there probably isn't a single word you'll have to look up. And from a teacher's point of view, there isn't much in this book that could possibly be offensive, unless one is strongly averse to Christianity - or kitsch.
B000M06K5C|2.0|Don't tag this as \\"indie\\" or \\"alternative\\" There is absolutely nothing exciting or indie about this album.  The quirky, rough-around-the-edges, diverse songs of the first album have been replaced by top 40 radio wannabee garbage.  I think even the band members know how horrible this album is compared to the first.  They'll be opening for John Mayer or Matchbox 20 soon....
B000E5KJD4|5.0|I thought that the standard dvd was a good version and almost did not buy the HD DVD version.  However, after receiving the HD DVD, I am amazed at how much better the image has become.  I am seeing details in the scenery, backgrounds, and faces that I never realized were there.  On an HD DVD player, this movie is actually better than it was in the theater.  If you like this movie, when you buy an HD DVD player do \\"upgrade\\"!
0618680004|5.0|If you're an atheist like me, you'll love this book because it reaffirms everything you think is true, with the bonus of it having been written by a famous academic (or intellectual, whichever you prefer). If you're a religious person, you'll hate it because it attacks your belief system and undermines your faith, especially with that slight hint of condescension that pervades Dawkins' writing. That's really all there is to it because as another reviewer said, it's nearly impossible to read this book from a neutral, objective viewpoint.
B000O77SOK|5.0|David E. Kelley created \\"The Practice\\" to be the flip side of \\"L.A. Law,\\" the show for which he wrote 67 episodes and won his first Emmys.  Bobby Donell and his partners are not a prestigious law firm in Hollywood, they are scrambling to stay solvent in Bean Town and do it defending clients who are so obviously guilty it is painful.  The series lasted eight episodes before it morphed into \\"Boston Legal,\\" and the keystone for the series was how both sides were always passionate about their positions, and somtimes too passionate.  Cold logic is rarely the key to courtroom success in this series, which is just as well because you have clients that run the spectrum from \\"Free Willy,\\" who likes to expose himself in public, to Gerald Braun, who murders his daughter's killer with the approval of his rabbi.  Not surprisingly, these cases take multiple episodes to resolve.<br /><br />Pay attention to the fact that this is \\"The Practice: Volume One\\" and not \\"The Practice: Season One.\\"  The show was a replacement series that first aired on March 4, 1997, and the first season was just six episodes.  The second season was a whopping 28 episodes, so the first seven are included in this set of 4-discs.  That still leaves 21 episodes from the second season to make up \\"Volume Two\\" down the road.  This line of demarcation strikes me as strange because 20 episodes on five discs would seem to make more sense, but once we see the next volume the rationale should become clear.<br /><br />Watching these early episodes again it was interesting to see how Kelley takes advantage of what is a large cast for a \\"small\\" law firm.  Having a favorite is problematic because they might not have a case go to trial for a while (Eleanor always seems to be second chair early on).  But everybody pretty gets their chance to shine: Bobby defending Rachel Reynolds in the \\"Pilot,\\" Lindsey takes on the tobacco company defended by her law professor (\\"Part IV\\"), Eugene making a bet with a prosecutor on the case of Steven Frenault arrested for armed robbery (\\"Part V\\"), Jimmy with a little girl bit by a dog (\\"Dog Bite\\"), and Eleanor sued by George Vogleman (\\"Sex, Lies, and Monkeys\\").<br /><br />This is a show where the judges matter, with Linda Hunt as Judge Zoey Hiller clearly standing out along with Ed Asner as Judge Matlin Pratt in \\"The Blessing.\\"  One of the fun things is seeing familiar faces as judges, from Ron Glass to Armin Shimerman, but what the judges have to say about the lawyers (on both sides) is part of the equation.  Sometimes the clients take over the show, of which there is no better example than John Larroquette as Joey Heric in \\"Betrayal,\\" although I also remember John Carroll Lynch as Dr. Robert Larson in \\"Search and Seizure,\\" the final episode in this collection.  Obviously, those who caught all eight seasons watch these early ones knowing what is going to happen with Vogleman, Heric, and other memorable clients as well as with the lawyers who defend them.  Kelley made sure his shows were always watchable, but I have a slight preference for these early episodes when the cases were smaller and not always at the nexus of a whole bunch of issues.ault arrested for armed robbery (\\"Part V\\"), Jimmy with a little girl bit by a dog (\\"Dog Bite\\"), and Eleanor sued by George Vogleman (\\"Sex, Lies, and Monkeys\\").

0060872675|2.0|While I love Terry Pratchett's witty satire in his DiscWorld books, I think he is out of his element in this \\"children's book\\".  I have a two year old daughter, who like most children her age has a limited attention span.  I was looking for something similar to the simple straight-forward version in Thud, something maybe 10-20 pages long (if that) that kind of went through different animals and maybe a dragon or a wizard and finally a cow, so that the young reader can shout \\"that's my cow!\\"      What you get is an increasingly convoluted plot that tells the story of Vimes reading to his kid.  The illustration is an obviously computer-generated mish mash of busy images which do nothing to enhance the story.  So instead of becoming a household name in children's books like your Maurice Sendak's or Dr. Seusses, Pratchett appears to be a money-hungry author looking to capitalize on some cross-merchandising, which he has done before with all the companion books to the DiscWorld.    It seems to me a case of too many people involved in this project, and none of them stopped the process and said, \\"I think we're trying to do too much with this.  Let's remember who our target audience is.\\"    But Pratchett is one of my favorite authors, and I eagerly look forward to his next work of ADULT fantasy.

B000001ESP|4.0|I vacillated on this one, between 4 and 5 stars.  I went with 4 because the album just kind of falters some in the second half.  The first half is spectacular:  Tom Sawyer, Limelight and Red Barchetta are all awesome.  The Carmera Eye is good but too long.  The final tracks on teh CD are solid, but not up to the mark of the others.  Overall, the CD has a lot of punch for an album with compartively few tracks [tho it does log in at 40 minutes as a whole].  Strong 4 stars, almost got to 5.
B000NHG7BQ|4.0|Well, it doesn't get cold in Mexico, so that one is out.  The story is about a recently discharged Navy pilot (Kevin Costner) who travels down to visit an old friend in Mexico (Anthony Quinn).  The dude also just so happens to be a Mexican mobster.  Falling prey to a lapse in judgment, Costner's character falls in love with the mobster's eye-candy wife (portrayed by Madeline Stowe).<br /><br />So far, this sounds like a typical love-triangle film.  However, this one has some very violent & sometimes deadly twists and turns.  It contains a lot of raw sexual energy and violent scenes.  It is also necessary to forewarn people that it has some harsh and disturbing clips that detail violence against women.<br /><br />The whole movie pivots on the performance of Madeline Stowe.  Her character is the axis around which everything else in the film revolves around.  I will make no apologies in saying that I am perhaps Madeline Stowe's single greatest fan, and THIS is a movie that details why.  There are certainly a great many gorgeous women in the world.  Precious few of them can act, however.  Madeline is one of those few.  IF this film had starred a drop dead starlet with little or no acting skills, it simply would not have worked.  Period - I don't care if she was on the cover of every major fashion magazine.  This movie demanded a female leading lady who could act, and Madeline delivers.  She is a dynamic actress and she has a certain elegance about her which I find mesmerizing.<br /><br />The opening scene shows Costner's character on his last flight in the Navy, piloting an F-14.  Watching it, it is fairly obvious that the director (Tony Scott) also directed the widely acclaimed TOP GUN.  However, in spite of the aerial acrobats of the fighter and all of the guns and violence in the movie, the story has a subtle timbre about it which I find remarkable.  Stylistically, this is perhaps Tony Scott's best movie ever.<br /><br />As a bonus, the special features contain a retrospective by Kevin Costner, Madeline and Tony Scott nearly 20 years after the film's release.  All 3 offer insights into their take on the importance of the film and the respect they had for the project.<br /><br />So, if you are looking for a movie that is mostly a love story & a drama with a few elements of action flicks mixed in, REVENGE is worth checking out.  The characterization is intersting in that the hero falls well short of being a paragon of moral virtue.  There is also some interesting symbolism with his dog tags & flight jacket.  All in all, this is a story which I believe will strike a chord with both male & female viewers.stner, Madeline and Tony Scott nearly 20 years after the film's release.

0060574216|1.0|Well I had heard great things about this book so I finally decided to read it.<br /><br />I threw it away after about 3 chapters. It's stupid. It just keeps saying the same thing \\"Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus\\" 30 different ways. We all know men don't speak the same language as we do so I thought overall it was just stating what I already knew and did nothing to help.

B000AP04L0|5.0|This is probably one of the funniest movies I have seen ever.  What makes it even funnier is that it's a VERY accurate representation of what goes on the corporate world.  Anyone in corporate America can identify with pretty much everyone in the movie.  In fact a few weeks ago, I had to interview someone that had the same name as a famous singer and as soon as I saw the name I immediately thought of the \\"Michael......Bolton?\\" scene from this movie.<br /><br />If you work or have worked in the typical corporate environment then you pretty much know what this movie is about, from the early morning commute, lunch hour, leaving early on Fridays and department take over by consulting firms.  Even the office printer that is always screwing up shows up in the movie.  As accurate as the movie is, it does have an interesting twist in that the main character being fed up with his job gets caught in permanent trance after therapy session goes horribly wrong, and he ends up \\"not caring\\" anymore.  But instead of getting canned, he is actually given a promotion much to the chagrin of two of his co-workers who work their a***s off and don't get anything for it.<br /><br />I have seen this movie many times, and every time I see it, I still laugh like I am seeing it for the first time.  If you haven't seen this movie then if you could, I'm going have to ask you to go head and pick this movie up; that'll be greaaat... mmkay?<br /><br />A must see for anyone, especially people in corporate America.  No question, 5/5 stars.

0783226888|3.0|For anyone who is interested, this DVD (ISBN 0-7832-2688-8) does contain a commentary by director Michael Caton-Jones.  Why Universal doesn't put that information on the box is beyond me.  They've done it before(12 Monkeys springs to mind); have features someone might want, but not list them on the packaging.
B000N6TX22|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised at this movie. The cinematography was outstanding, and the acting was solid. The sense of hope springing up in the midst of utter desolation was conveyed in a very moving way. The storyline was not as far-fetched as some people might believe. Even now, Europe is suffering from the economic and spiritual effects of a demographic implosion, although unlike the movie it is purely voluntary. Would the world fall into slow anarchy if women became infertile, as the movie suggests? Its certainly plausible. What I found most refreshing about this movie is its originality. It seems all that Hollywood can put out these days are remakes of remakes, or dramatizations of cheap potboiler novels scribbled by untalented dilettantes.       Some reviewers have mentioned that the movie makes a political statement against conservative politicians in the way it portrays a ruthless authoritarian government dealing with illegal immigrants. Some of the imagery seem to be exaggerated portrayals of Abu Graib or the Holocaust. There is some truth in this, but note carefully that almost all of the violence seen on screen is carried out by the left-wing \\"immigrants rights\\" group, The Fishes. They are portrayed as fanatics willing to use any means to accomplish their political goals, including bombings, assassination, kidnapping and even a willingness to use a baby as a mere political commodity. One of the protagonists is an aging left wing, government-hating,  eco-hippy (played superbly by Michael Caine). Ironically, this character is cruelly executed not by the British government, but by left wing terrorists who are clearly the political offspring of the 60's campus radicals.
B000N6TX1I|2.0|I am scratching my head as to why so many critics jumped on the bandwagon promoting this film.  Until the very end, this is a slow moving film that borrows heavily from the Handmaiden's Tale and Soylent Green.  In the end, you're forced to coble together most of the character's motivations because the film spends most of its time on the chase and very little on plot. It's as if no had the time to write a complete enough backstory for this film. Consequently, you find yourself in scenes that hint of something more, but never really reach fruition. I suppose the filmmakers left it all ambiguous to seem smart, but the film becomes something of a patchwork at the end, leading you nowhere, literally out to sea.

B0009IW88A|4.0|This is a score, a good score, written for a film, a good film.  I didn't expect either to impress me as strongly as they did.  The film, for me, at least, takes a while to get going, but once it does, it's unrelenting.  The score is, simply put, exciting as hell!  Sadly, it is given to us in a truncated form.  This is a huge score, and even though about an hour of it is represented here, there is much more left behind.    One last thing:  Why two composers?  Both are perfectly competent to produce excellent scores on their own, and have (my tastes lean toward Howard, but no matter).  I don't know much about Hans Zimmer, but he seems to show up a lot in collaborative roles (\\"Pirates of the Caribbean: Black Pearl\\" comes to mind).    Whatever.  Four stars instead of five because I want more!!
0812932293|5.0|This is a sensational book.  Most autobiographies are boring and so full of only positive stuff about the person that you just know you are not getting the full picture.  In this book Branson openly admits mistakes and bad business decisions.  He gives credit to others acknowledging Virgin's success would not have happened without them.  He also included instances when he has been brought back down to earth for example when two tourists asked for a picture he thought that he was being nice and started posing for them until he saw their confused faces and realised they wanted him to take a picture of them.<br /><br />This book tells the reader everything about the Virgin empire from the first issue of Student magazine in 1968 to approval for their trains thirty years later in 1998.  Obviously a lot more has happened since 98 such as Virginblue in Australia but we will have to wait for the sequel for that.  This is a brilliant book which is as enjoyable as the great financial fictional thrillers like Harry Bingham's classic the Money Makers.  This is so mush more inspiring when you realise Branson is not a fictional character and these achievements are real.  This book will inspire you to get out there and make money. Buy it!<br /><br />Note - There is an updated version of this book to be released soon which will have the post 98 stuff in it.

B000P0J02E|5.0|I have always been a fan of soundtracks.  I really adore the works of Harry Gregson-Williams, Danny Elfman and, of course, John Williams.  I now can say I have a new composer that I can add to my list; Hans Zimmer, the composer for Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest, At World's End and he also Overproduced the score for The Curse of the Black Pearl.  Compared to past \\"attempts\\" I believe that Hans Zimmer has hit the jackpot.<br /><br />The CD \\"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End\\" is unbelievably the best CD of the three.  It contains 13 tracks including, one of my favorites, Hoist the Colours (the song the boy sings at the beginning of the movie, which becomes the back tone of the entire movie).  It is a must buy for all soundtrack, movie, Disney and pirate lovers.  I have never listened to a soundtrack this much since John Williams Star Wars Episode 1 Special Edition CD.<br /><br />But there is a draw back for me.  The CD is a Digipak.  A Digipak is a CD that has cardboard-like outside rather than a plastic cover like most CD's.  I don't `hate' them, I just don't like seeing things of mine getting ripped.  So if you don't want your case/album art warped, get it on iTunes.<br /><br />Overall it is a great CD and a must buy! \\" Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End\\" soundtrack gets 5 stars out of 5.<br /><br />My name is Amone. Adios!
B000002LK1|5.0|Depeche Mode are masters at synthesizers.  a-ha made pretty great music with sysnethizers, and Kraftwerk are on the of the most important bands in electronic music, but Depeche Mode can make emotional, beautiful, or cool music.  Depeche Mode put other electronic pop _____ to shame.  And this is the best way to start if your new.  Most people can enjoy Violator.  David Grahan (or is it Dave?) has one of the most unique voices in rock, sort of like a softer, less scary Danzig (who has a very cool voice).  Martin Gore and Andrew Fletcher excellent a the synthesizers.<br /><br />Personal Jesus, Enjoy The Silence, and World In My Eyes are essential Depeche Mode tracks, and they are all on the same cd (they have plenty of other great singles, if you are just interested in the singles, get the single collections).  Each of them are the catchiest songs on here, but that's not it.  Waiting For The Night has a ton of atmosphere (sounds just like the name), and Halo is a lesser known song, but it's still worthy of another great dance song.  Sweetest Perfection pales a little bit, and Clean closes off the album in a great way, but it's easily the least essential of the songs.  But don't let that fool you, because each song on Violator is a keeper.  THe whole cd flows together, and the interludes are cool.<br /><br />Nearly damn perfect, Depeche Mode will hit you depending on your mood.  Recommended for any music fan.<br /><br />9.5/10

It's been awhile since I first read the book and I still think of Alice.
B00005JPLW|5.0|If for some reason you went into this movie thinking that you were going to see a history of the  Battle of Thermopylae (and maybe a glimpse of the simultaneous Battle of Artemisium) as some people apparently thought, I believe you were actually looking for the History Channel's \\"Last Stand of the 300\\" (a most excellent show). Of course, how you missed the history channel and wound up in a movie theater or with this DVD is beyond me, but you would know how better than me. This movie was based on a graphic novel which was based on the legendary (not historical) version that has been going around for about 2487 years. To watch this movie you must leave your amateur historian tendencies behind and just enjoy what is a very good story, done in a very entertaining way. If you are going to nitpick about historical accuracies in stories that were never meant to be literal history, you are missing out on a whole world of great stories.
1594489505|5.0|I started reading this book shortly after finishing \\"The Kite Runner.\\"  Whereas \\"The Kite Runner\\" drew me in from the very first page, this one didn't.  Still it had Hosseini's deft style of writing so I stayed with it and I'm glad I did.  A little less than a third of the way through the book I was hooked, just as I had been with \\"The Kite Runner.\\"  Mariam and Laila - and their unswerving friendship amidst all of the turbulent changes in leadership in Afghanistan made for an unforgettable reading experience. It's another heartbreaking book by Khaled Hosseini - yet there's also optimism and hope throughout the book.  It's one of those books you don't want to see end as you've completely bonded with the characters and once the book is closed, you're no longer in their lives or they in yours.  As much as I loved \\"The Kite Runner\\" I actually loved this book more.   Definitely worth reading.
1594489505|5.0|Never thought he could do it again but he proved me wrong. A Thousand Splendid Suns in my opinion is better then the previous Kite Runner. Hosseini does have an agenda which I may not agree with but is still beautifuly written. The Best Book this year by fall.
B000QFAJ7S|4.0|I've always been a fan of Kelly Clarkson.  Since her much deserved win as the first Idol she has taken the music world by storm delivering heart-pumping pop-rock a la Breakaway, her second record which became one of the best-selling albums in recent history by a female artist.  However, after reading about the rumored rift between Clarkson and Davis (RCA's head man with \\"the golden ears\\") I was worried about the much-anticipated third release from this talented siren.  It was rumored Davis did not approve of the material Clarkson had co-written for what would later become My December, and had even offered her an astounding $10 million to replace four more commercial and hit-worthy tracks.  Let's make one point clear: I LOVED BREAKAWAY.  To me, it was the perfect combination of pop and rock elements all rolled into a delicious and extremely consistent full-length listening dessert.  So hearing Davis claiming that Kelly's new album lacked hit potential somewhat frightened me: Oh please, I begged, let him be wrong!  I had an inkling to pick up a copy of My December when it hit stores on opening day (solely for the fact I found its lead single, the charging angst rock tune \\"Never Again,\\" to be likable enough to merit the disc's purchase, and because I supported Clarkson's defiance against the Top 40 hit-making machine that Davis is), but decided to hold out from buying it until I made sure it was worth the price tag.  I had purchased via iTunes the song \\"Never Again,\\" and although I was a little disappointed after the first few listens, each subsequent one garnered new admiration from me for the song and Clarkson's newer, darker musical direction.  Then I streamed \\"Sober\\" and decided, heck, this song and \\"Never Again\\" are worth the price of the CD alone.  So, was Davis correct in saying it lacks as much commercial appeal as Breakaway?  Yes.  Though Kelly sounds terrific as ever and the album plays rather well consistency-wise, there are no real standouts on My Decemberlike its predecessor possessed.  However, that's not to say that it packs no potential radio-friendly singles: \\"Never Again\\" was a brilliant marketing move for Clarkson as she broke free from commercial radio's restraints and flew off on her own and in her own chosen musical direction.  The song is full of interesting lyrics, powerful choruses and great musicality.  The aforementioned \\"Sober\\" is also another highlight; although it is softer and less radio-friendly than other Clarkson ballads have been in the past, its raw sincerity and real emotion make up for its lack of an undeniably catchy hook (I recommend listening to the ending of the song when Clarkson sings her heart out and takes the chorus up an octave).  \\"One Minute\\" has a heart-pumping lyric with a catchy hook; the delightfully jilted \\"Judas\\" confronts a hypocrite and liar; \\"Irvine\\" (one of the most touching tracks here) is coffeehouse songwriting at its best.  Even though it's a definite departure from the commercialism found on Breakaway, My December is always a respectable attempt and chock full of great tunes even if not one song packs as much mass appeal punch as Kelly's previous release.  Clive: So you were right in some aspects...but you were also wrong.

If you watched the movie and ended a bit confused, watch the documentary included and then watch the movie again.  You'll enjoy it.
B0000009SF|5.0|I'm a big Zappa fan (actually saw the Roxy band in 1974 - eat your heart out).  Anyway, in my humble but all important and all knowing opinion, The Grand Wazoo (with its glorious 21 piece jazz orchestra) and Waka Jawaka simply represent the best of Zappa's material from the 70s. Ok, we can throw Roxy and Elsewhere and Bongo Fury in there as well.  Sure, Zappa had bands that sounded this good, most notably the Make A Jazz Noise Here band - but for some reason, this music just sounds more organic than that final touring band (which he regarded as his best band ever).  There are 5 tracks on Grand Wazoo and they are all great.  I have a  particular fondness for the title track and the closing track, Blessed Relief.  If you want to hear Zappa at his very best, you want The Grand Wazoo and Waka Jawaka.  'Nuff said.

0634049011|5.0|I found this book to be very through and I am able to move through it at a nice pace.  You can tell it was put together by a teacher with years of experience.  He has provided the tools and the explanations to go with it. I highly recommend this book to any guitar player that does not know the fret board.  I have been playing for 30 years and am finally learning what the notes are that I'm playing.  This book has provided the missing piece to my ability to learn songs much faster.      If you ever wanted to learn the guitar fretboard this book will get you there.  So bite the bullet and take a step back to move two steps forward, you won't regret it.  I wish I had done it 30 years ago, better late than never.

B0002EXH54|1.0|The incredible classic speedmetal opus \\"Peace Sells...\\", here re-mixed by Dave Mustaine, has been completely trashed -- vocals horrible, transitions to leads awkward and ungainly, rhythm tracks bastardized --  why did he do it?  It was perfect as it stood.  Anything \\"re-mixed\\" should carry warning bells and a red flag; I got fooled once by Iggy Pop's destruction of the also-classic \\"Raw Power,\\" now I can't find a copy of the *real* original (produced by Bowie).  These rock divas need to get a grip and stop erasing history, I don't know at all what their deal is, but it is not a good one.
1591841666|5.0|This is an insightful book for anyone who has ever been frustrated with a project they questioned for a long period only to produce mediocre results. In this book, the author discusses what it takes to be the best and how to get there by focusing on your niche.  Quitting can be a great tool if it leads to long-term success. The author does a very nice job of analyzing why people should quit at times and when it is time to push through the dip to achieve success.
B0000011AP|4.0|Originally released in 1971. This was the band's only album they had ever put out. Basically just good old school early '70's British hard rock. Tracks I was most impressed with were \\"Freelance Friend\\", \\"Sad Road To The Sea\\" (great vocals), \\"With A Minute To Go\\" and their previously hard-to-come-by B-side single \\"It's Going To Get Better\\". Personnel: Pete French-vocals, Mick Halls & Derek Brooks-guitars, Stuart Brooks-bass and Keith George Young-drums. Just might appeal to some fans of Cactus, Atomic Rooster, Free and Savoy Brown. Check it out.
0141182601|3.0|This book will give you a glimpse of gang violence (beating, raping, and killing by teens) in a futuristic time. The book explores the meaning of free will and the conflict between good and evil, which is often not apparent. It also poses the following important question: can a person be forced into being good, and is being good truly good if it is not by choice?     The main character in the novel, Alex (a 15 year old boy who is a rapist and killer), is injected by prison doctors with a drug that makes him experience nausea and headaches, and is then forced to watch violent flicks. He associates nausea with violence, and can stand violence no more! He is therefore restricted from his free will and forced to become good! According to the author, we all have a sense of what is right and what is wrong, so do we need to be forced into being good?    Interestingly, readers in America and the rest of the world will read different versions of this book. In America, the editors edited out chapter 21 all together, giving the novel 20 chapters in all. In Britain and the rest of the world (including all translated versions), chapter 21 is included in the novel. Readers in the rest of the world will therefore get a different ending. The movie version of the book by Stanley Kubrick was based on the American version of 20 chapters. I will recommend readers of this book to read the British version to get the ending the author meant for us to read.     Another interesting fact is that the author wished this book to go away - but obviously it is not, accumulating fans from all over the world since its publication in 1963. The book has been translated into many different languages, including Russian, Japanese, Spanish, and Italian, to list just a few. Many of the latter books written by the same author (32 novels in all) have not succeeded as much, even though the author believed them to be much superior. The book he believed would fail succeeded and the ones he believed would succeed failed miserably compared to A Clockwork Orange.     Many will find this book difficult to read and understand (me for one). The dialogue is quite unique but difficult to understand because it is slang, with most of it invented by the author (was the slang taken from the Russian language?).    The title, A Clockwork Orange is a cockney word meaning to the limit or hilt. For example, he is queer as clockwork orange (a saying often used). The author believes that we cannot be evil as clockwork orange; that is, pure evil with not an inch of goodness in us. Similarly, we cannot be pure good with no evil in us. We all live with a balance of evil and good, with some displaying more evil while others more goodness. And we all have free will to choose whether we want to be evil or good.    A lot of people have liked the movie more than the book. Read the book first though (the British version), and then watch the movie. You'll get a much better flavor of the book this way. And if you gave up reading the book, watch the movie. It might just make you want to give the book a second chance!

0060832819|3.0|Did you know that the distance between one rail track to another is exactly 4 feet and eight and a half inches? Is the distance between our relationships always such a constant?    The book is about the narrator's search for his missing wife, Esther. He seeks out Mikhail, the man who may be Esther's most recent lover and with whom she was last seen. Mikhail introduces the narrator to spiritual seekers and he embarks on a life changing journey.    The book is about love, marriage, and separation. Like other Coelho books, there is a lesson to learn. However, I did not find this book to be as good as The Alchemist or The Devil and Miss Prym, and certainly not as fast a read. However, people in relationships and those going through separation will probably relate more to the book and thus enjoy it more while picking up some useful lessons! There is no denying that Coelho is a great teacher.    An interesting fact of life he mentions is that many of us have died while living! This statement moved me, and each of us will find a different meaning in it according to how we have lived our life.
0142004235|5.0|This is my favorite book. Steinbeck brilliantly combines the biblical myth of genesis 4 and a story of two boys from the not so distant past to recreate the story of cain and abel in much more detail, depicting their struggles and fears, temptations and realizations, and seamlessly integrating them into the greatest book i have ever read.
B000009RC2|5.0|Okay, let's not kid ourselves here: this is more of an instrumental rock record than a jazz one, which explains why it is rather controversial among jazz listeners and quite popular among rock fans. Sure, it's much more intelligent than most other rock albums - other than Zappa, who wasn't just a rocker anyway, I doubt anyone in the rock world made use of the electric violin at all at the time, let alone made it an integral part of their group, and the band uses tricky time signatures on \\"Vital Transformation\\" and \\"Meeting of the Spirits\\". And sometimes the songs have multiple parts: check the shift in the middle of \\"Dance of the Maya\\"! The jazz influence (which is there, it's just more of a rock record), unusual instrumentation, heavy use of synthesizer, odd time signatures and shifting songs may make this seem like a progressive rock album - if so, let us just call it the best prog-rock album ever made, shall we? Sounds good. Because the songs here have a lot of energy, a lot of vitality that most prog is lacking (\\"Vital Transformation\\"; \\"Meeting of the Spirits\\"; the relentless \\"Noonward Race\\"; \\"Dawn\\"; \\"Dance of the Maya\\"), and the emphasis is clearly on rock - indeed, when the album doesn't rock out (i.e. \\"A Lotus on Irish Seas\\", an electric violin solo), that's where it falters. The best of the soft songs, \\"You Know You Know\\", switches the softness up with occasional blasts of McLaughlin's guitar. Speaking of McLaughlin, this has some of his best playing ever found on every song, so if you have even the slightest appreciation for the guy, I have to recommend this album. Drummer Billy Cobham overplays a bit, but that's okay because he's good (though not as good as Tony Williams) - the only real letdown on the album is the closing track, \\"Awakening\\", which is little more than three minutes of non-musical chaos
160024131X|4.0|I read the book in one very long day, and couldn't forget it if I tried. Luttrell's humility and humanity come through on every page, and Robinson knows how to tell a story (Read his submarine novels for evidence).  I've heard it said that SEAL training is so tough because the instructors hope that their SEALS will never face a real-life mission as demanding as their training.  Unfortunately for Luttrell and his 3 team mates, Operation Redwing was beyond even that.    It brought a lump to my throat as the author described in painstaking detail his team mates' bravery in their last minutes.  Equally inspiring is Luttrell's refusal to consider himself a hero, rather than just a soldier doing his job.  As a tale of American heroism and dedication, \\"Lone Survivor\\" is hard to beat.
B00004S35Z|5.0|This is a very moody album. Even \\"Smile Please\\", which you'd expect by the title to be this all-out joyous funfest like \\"Don't You Worry 'Bout a Thing\\", has a hint of melancholy. To say nothing of the really melancholy songs: the spiritual \\"Heaven is Ten Zillion Light Years Away\\"; the emotional \\"They Won't Go When I Go\\"; eerie love song \\"Creepin'\\" - two of the three songs concern death. Hell, even the funk-a-thon \\"You Haven't Done Nothin'\\" is a tirade against Nixon - it was a hit, and it's catchy, danceable, smart and easily a highlight, but I can't shake the nagging feeling that it sounds like \\"Superstition\\". Then again, \\"Superstition\\" laid the groundwork for all of Stevie's funk-a-thons, so maybe that's a moot point. Wonder's only genuinely happy in a couple spots: the reggae-funk hybrid \\"Boogie on Reggae Woman\\", a massive hit and it's a damn good time; the lovely \\"Bird of Beauty\\", and \\"Please Don't Go\\", with full choir singing backups. Not that I'm saying the only Stevie is joyous Stevie - come on, I gave Innervisions five stars! And the darker songs are among the best: \\"Creepin'\\" is my favorite outside of \\"Boogie On\\"; \\"Heaven\\" has interesting keyboards; \\"They Won't Go\\" is, like \\"All in Love is Tony Blair\\", therapeutically cathartic. I think the spacey \\"Too Shy to Say\\" is a bore, but that's it: this is another of Stevie's best.
B00009W0U4|4.0|I have recently gone on a search to find films that can actually shock me, even a little. This film did a good job. Thoug you can get annoyed with the overall camera angle and general gritty way the film is done, some how even that cannot over shadow the entire feeling.        The rape scene though terribly long and drawn out, is effective in its harshness. It is perverse to say the least but still I think it may be the first 10 minutes the of the film that onestly shocked me. I almost could not believe what I was seeing. Honestly these acts of voilence take a stronger hold as the film moves along. Though the rape scene is graphic it doesnt really \\"hit\\" you until several scenes later wen you get to know and even care about this free spirited women who seem to have a great deal to look forward to. That is the real shock and violence of the movie. If you just want gore then you are not looking deeper into this film's basic message.    This movie is not for kids and I would recommend watching it alone the first time to overcome the slight uncomfortable feeling the film can invoke.
B00004W510|5.0|A whole pile of great albums came out in 1969, and this is up there with every one of them. A bunch of powerful slices of Americana like the trucker's anthem Up on Cripple Creek (which is damned FUNKY - listen to that synthesizer! It's so cool!! AND it's my pick for the best Band song), the gentle, swaying anthem The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down, with an enormously catchy sing-along chorus and very vivid imagery; the down-and-out Great Depression worker's anthem King Harvest (Has Surely Come), which is an awesome folk song; and the backwoods jam Rag Mama Rag, which is just pure, joyous, unbridled fun. You know what else is fun? I'll tell you. Across the Great Divide, Jemima Surrender and Look Out Cleveland. Great, GREAT songs with great, GREAT vocals, solid melodies, and fun piano parts. Love 'em both. They also tackle weightier songs quite well, with two unbeatable ballads: the haunting classic Whispering Pines and more underrated When You Awake. I've seen the latter of the two criticized a bit, but I like it very much - it's not one of the album's absolute highs, but it's not an unbearable piece of crap either. And the vocals are very strong, very chilling, etc. Now, it's not without its tiny little faults - I'm not a fan of Rocking Chair, its nostalgic lyrics strike me as being close to parody (\\"Ragtime Willie\\"? Come now, Robbie, you can write some GREAT lyrics, but this isn't an example...). But that's one loser out of a bunch of winners. Easily my favorite Band album. Easily.
B0000009SG|4.0|This is one funny album. Totally tasteless, totally immature frat-boy/locker-room humor. But it's funny, so I could care less.<br />I have four absolute favorite songs on this album. First is I'm the Slime (oozin' out of your TV set...), which is a great protest against TV and the idiots who watch it. Zappa's satiric sense of humor is dead-on, and that's a great chorus! Another one I enjoy is Montana, with really funny, extremely weird lyrics that nobody but Zappa could come up with. Either this or I'm the Slime is my favorite song on this album, I'm not sure. Zappa gets a lot more raunchy with the X-rated riff rocker Dirty Love, with some disgusting lyrics (\\"A tacky pamphlet in yo' daddy's bottom drawer\\" is one of the milder lines), a great riff, cool backup vocals, and a hilarious ending that's totally perverted. NOT a song for family time. Neither is Camarillo Brillo, which takes on a similar perverted direction. I think this one would've gotten a lyrics sticker (lyrics stickers suck, by the way - so does censorship) had it been released today.<br />My issue with this album is that a couple songs don't get anywhere. The only tune I truly dislike (which translates to \\"hate with a passion\\") is 50/50 - vocalist Ricky Lancelotti ruins the song for me, because it's a mildly funny attack at budding pop stars otherwise. Zomby Woof is really a stupid song that gets nowhere, but it's not bad or anything: same goes for the infamous Dinah-Moe Humm, which has frankly offensive sexist lyrics that are not funny at ALL. But it's got a decent melody. And stupid sexist lyrics. The two cancel each other out, and we're left with a middling song. Zappa's band is, as always, dynamite, and the best lyrics here are a real trip, so while this isn't as great as the first few albums, it's a nice place to go when you've heard all of htem a million times over.

Everything just clicked for me with this release... great songwriting and musicians, extended instrumental passages, copious amounts of acoustic guitar, warm sounding analog synthesizers, and great vocals. Every song is excellent, not a dud on the disc.<br /><br />So how does the Rhino remaster sound compared to the original 80's Atco release? Different. The stereo mix is louder and the treble is exaggerated so at times the cymbals sound unnaturally splishy. Some instruments sound clearer, but the excessive treble drowns out other subtleties, and the warmth and fullness is missing. I'm sure over time I'll adjust to the new mix but no way will I retire the original disc. However, the the high end on surround mixes are not as bright as they are on the stereo mix. Rhino provides both a DD and DTS mix (thanks for the choices) - the DD is decent (loud and a bit harsh) but the DTS mix sounds smooth and fantastic.<br /><br />The DVD extras include three videos, a 14-minute 2007 interview with the band on their thoughts of the album, some stills, and the 43-minute \\"Genesis in Concert\\" filmed in 1976 with priceless footage of Bill Bruford on drums. Unfortunately, some of the songs are just snippets, for example, \\"Suppers Ready\\" part two, or \\"The Cinema Show\\" part two, and there is a lot of cheesy visuals included with the concert footage.<br /><br />Overall, this is a classic album that no music collection should be without, and the surround mixes and DVD extras make this a must have release.
B000002J1U|5.0|A rare group where original albums are the only way to go!  Plays like a \\"Greatest Hits\\"!  The very heart of my entire collection!  Do lyrics get any better than \\"That's the Way\\"?  Does blues get any better than \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\"?
B000002V0Q|5.0|Most people may construe my choice of review title in a negative manner, however in my opinion I don't consider the move to a more commercial sound to be a bad thing (though it gets blown way out of proportion in later albums). In fact I consider this to be in the top five of Deth's catalogue. The other's being Rust In Peace, Peace Sells, The System Has Failed and United Abominations/So Far so Good So What (Still Tossin up between the two). This album was released on the heels of the almighty Rust In Peace (RIP) album, and as such has a lot to live up to. This album and its follow up (youthanasia) are the one's which will separate the Megadeth fans from the Metal fans, as mustaine and company defer from the Complex, progressive sound of RIP (their most aggresive til United Abominiations in my opinion) to a more focused, groove based sound minus the pummeling riffs and drums. Most material offered on the album are shorter, less complicated songs following a verse-chorus format, opening the band to be received by a wider audience. The only offering bearing any semblance to the RIP era i.e. in style and speed is the last track being Ashes In Your Mouth. However, song themes remain consistent with what Megadeth has been known to offer, in fact I find these to be some of mustaine's best lyrical offerings overall, with lyrics aimed at politics (foreclosure of a dream), military activity (architecture of agression) and even dabbling in schitzoprenia (sweating bullets) and suicide (Skin O' My Teeth). In Short this album is a must have for the Megadeth fan and an essential not necessarily for the metal head but for those bordering the hard rock/metal edge.  Album Highlights - Symphony of Destruction, Architecture of Aggression, Foreclosure of a dream, Sweating Bullets, Ashes in Your Mouth.  Personal Favs - all of the above, This was my life, COuntdown to extinction and captive honour
B00000J6AG|3.0|Adds interesting diversity to my very mainstream Rock collection.  A curiosity item, I'm not familiar with the genre.  What I can tell you is I really enjoyed it!    I applaud Moby for taking full advantage of his opportunity by generously including 18 tracks, because I don't know that most of us are up for more than one Moby album in our collections.      Very creative, though.  I real keeper!
B00005ASHM|5.0|Some of the reveiws here in the place have seemed to not understand the reason why \\"Pet Sounds\\" rings abroad albums and is constantly in competition with various Beatle's albums as the \\"greatest album ever made\\".  It is important to realize first and formost that albums, after reaching such a selection process and being moved into the higher tier of \\"greats\\" can not just be appreciated for their pleasing sound.      \\"Revolver\\" for example, has what ive seen many on here say \\"Pet Sounds\\" has: about one great song and three good ones.  now this is true in terms of \\"sounding lovely\\" but in terms of musical masterpiece this is not the case.    when i first listened to Pet Sounds, each song started and i asked myself \\"why am i listening to this?\\".  but by the time each song was over i felt like a different person  the rich chord progressions illustrate the movement that words alone can not explain.  Take for example the infamous \\"God Only Knows\\".  It is a swirl of diminished verse with many inverted chords that keep the listener tagged through its bipolar verses... then the refrain of \\"god only knows...\\" is a rich set of major chords (A-E/G#-F#m7) followed by a m7 which is a major chord with a changed root.  If i was to post the chords in verse on here it would look like higher math.  this is what the \\"genius\\" of Brian Wilson comes to.  When a musician heres an album a lot more goes into play than the sound alone.  The technicality, a word oft thrown around yet seldom understood, is another window into the \\"what\\" of the song and sound and an explanation of the feelings.  Thus a song like \\"Thats Not Me\\" keeps it begging sensationalism not through its simplistic lyrics, but by balancing such simplisity upon a background chorus of percussive indecency... a strange combination that shows not only the narrator's desperation but also his frustration.    The only songs that shouldnt have been on the album from an outstanding standpoint would be the instrumentals...  not becausethey are free of genius or do not have a complex meaning... but instead because they do not fit the overall flow of the album.    my recommendation for anyone who buys this album:  you must listen to it more than once  the first time, other than a few songs, you will probably be wondering why anyone in the world would say this was the best album, let alone good.  but the more you listen the more you feel  the more the harmonies play the more you can understand    the lyrical meanings of the songs mean nothing when not compared to the harmonies beneath them...  imagine Wouldnt it Be Nice in Minor  that would change everything the song has ever stood for    also, Wilson's rythmic movement and enjambments should be noticed and the effect they have (such as in \\"Dont Talk\\") are astounding to the listening ear.    in conclusion  the reason this is one of the greatest albums ever, or possibly the greatest (i have yet to find few who compete) is because it is like a jazz album: it is a listening mans CD.  if you just pop it in and lolly around you get nothing.  Yet if you become involved with the music, past the normal level of casuality... a plea made by the BBs and the Beatles at this time... You will find what makes it the \\"greatest album\\" yet.  It touches more than the mind.  It touches the mind and heart, and will profoundly affect the way you hear things in the future.
B0002VKZL6|2.0|Loved Dire Straits, I was very much looking forward to this album.  Hate it, it plods and there's a dearth of interesting guitar work.  The second-worse album in my entire collection!  Bad enough to have kept me from buying any current original album for two years.    If you're still interest in Mark Knopfler solo, try the Dire Strait/Mark Knopfler \\"Private Investigation\\" - the second of the two discs is all Mark Knopfler, and a lot more interesting than this dud, although I'm still not a fan.  Better yet is the first disc - classic Dire Straits!
0765316978|5.0|Years ago, I used to look forward to trilogies.  It was great knowing that even though the book I was reading was coming to an end, there was more in the future.  However, lately I find my self avoiding trilogies.  There are a lot of reasons.  First is that often the plot becomes hopelessly detailed with just too much darn history required as you read more of the books.  Second is that the later books just weren't very good.  Happily this is not true of The Last Colony.    While you would certainly be missing out on a great deal if you didn't read the first 2 books, I think you could still enjoy the 3rd one.  For someone like me, it was comforting to not have to remember too many intricate details from the prior books.    The story itself was very good, not merely hanging on to prior successes in the other books.  Finally the ending was satisfying.  It didn't seem like a contrived way to bring the series to an end, but rather a sensible ending for the trilogy.    I very much enjoyed all three books.  I do have to say, though, that Old Man's War was definitely my favorite.
B00004BZ0V|3.0|Much has been written about this band being manufactured. Regardless, they still had/have a heck of a lot of more street cred than later gross outs such as Blink 182 (1999's Poison or Warrant, and not even good with it).<br /><br />This collection of singles by the band serves the same purpose as a best of and shows the band in a pretty good light. The inherent simplicity and bounce of the punk inflections inherent in the bands music blends wonderfully with their pop sensibilities. Which makes for a buoyant clutch of tunes perfect for chillin' with friends on a Sunday afternoon or cruising down the highway.<br /><br />All the hits are here from White Riot, London Calling and Rock the Casbah to Should I Stay or Should I Go. The fact that the latter two are still staples of more adventurous daytime radio decades after their release speaks volumes for their penetration of peoples musical psyches.<br /><br />In relation to this specific release there are a couple of points I'd like to raise for the benefit of novices to this band (of which I was one prior to buying this). Bits I found useful:- the inclusion of the hits to give me familiar reference points. The fact it's in chronological order to better enable the newcomer to track the bands musical development. For example listen to the first couple of tracks and then the last two. Release dates for each track are also an interesting anecdote. The downsides would be:- no liner notes - if the record ocmpany is going to make some money selling yet again tunes they've already paid for surely they could of gotten some rock scribe to pen a bunch of lines as it would of been more useful than a collage of phots on the flipside of the lyric sheet (nice touch that - the lyric sheet I mean..). Also a discography would of been good though admittedly that's less vital in the internet age.<br /><br />As a newcomer to this band I enjoyed this release as a useful grab bag of tunes to introduce me to this still talked about outfit even if it didn't change my world. At least I know what the fuss is about now!t least I know what the fuss is about now!

B000K7VHQE|5.0|In this era of big money, Hollywood blockbuster productions (\\"Harry Potter\\", \\"Spiderman\\" ETC.) it feels most satisfying to find a small, amiable, entertaining, film comedy like \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\", that seems to depend on nothing more than a good script and fine acting performances. To watch it win numerous awards and do reasonably well at the box office is even better!<br /><br />In \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" we are introduced to the harried, dysfunctional Hoover family, which seems to be just barely getting by. The Father, Richard (Greg Kinear) is a would-be motivational speaker, trying to make a big deal happen, in order get financial investors for his program. The Mom, Sheryl (Toni Colette) is dealing with the family's financial stresses, plus everyone elses problems. This includes her brother, Frank (Steve Carell) an academic, who has come to live with the family after a recent suicide attempt, over a gay love affair with a student. The Hoover's depressed son, Dwayne (Paul Dano) has taken a vow of silence until he gets into the Air Force Academy to achieve his dream to fly. The family's drug addicted, Grandpa (an excellent Alan Arkin) is an overly opinionated old man, who lets his expletive filled, tactless comments fly if you want to hear them or not. Finally, in the title role is seven year old, Olive (Abigail Breslin) a sweet little girl with a sunny disposition and an obsession with beauty pageants.<br /><br />The Hoovers recieve a phone call, that Olive has made the finals of the 'Little Miss Sunshine' Beauty Pageant in Rodondo Beach, CA. We watch as this eccentric family climbs into a decrepit, un-airconditioned, yellow, VW Micro-bus and make the 700 mile journey, which is filled with both big laughs, drama and tears. We watch as they try to follow their hopes & dreams and learn, that sometimes it just dosn't matter if you fit-in or not. In other words, sometimes you have to just let your 'Freak Flag Fly'!<br /><br />Co-Directors, Jonathan Dayton & Valerie Faris' have done a sure and steady job creating a wonderful film. Likewise, Screen Writer, Michael Ardnt's Academy Award winning script (\\"Best Writing, Original Screenplay\\") is filled with rich, well-rounded characters, witty, funny dialogue and a story that makes the viewer care.<br /><br />But the best attribute of the film is the talented ensemble cast of actors, who's peformances really made this movie. Toni Colette is a accomplished actress, who always seems to just disapear into her roles. She is just great as the stressed out mom, who keeps everyone together. Greg Kinear, who I havn't exactly been a big fan of in the past, does a terrific job as the frustrated, desperate Dad, who just won't give up on his goals. Alan Arkan won an Oscar (\\"Best Performance By an Actor in a Supporting Role\\") as the foul-mouthed Grandpa, provided some of the film's biggest laughs, while showing a lot of heart. Like-wise, Steve Carell's (in a pre-\\"Office\\" role) depressed, Proust Scholar is an excellent performance, providing dead panned laughs and loads of outsider wisdom. Finally, Abigail Breslin is a juvenile actress, who is in a star-making role and more than holds her own with her fellow performers. Bravo to the whole brilliant cast!<br /><br />\\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" really is 'the little film that could'. It's funny and moving, providing themes about being yourself and not being afraid to go after your dreams. Great Movie! Highly recommended!e and steady job creating a wonderful film.

0375831002|5.0|This story, narrorated by a color-obsessed rather depressed-sounding Death, is a roller-coaster.  It is a celebration of survival, literacy, and life is a world full of death, ignorance, and pain.  The characters seem alive and are worth reading about.  The plot provides a little-used perspective into WWII.  A good read that is hard to put down.    It is hard to determine whether this book is for adolescents or not.  There is quite a bit of swearing (mostly in German, but translated), violence, and heavy emotional material.  Still, the writing style is wonderful and I feel many age groups could relate with the characters and stories.
B000J10EQU|3.0|Where has all the charm an chemistry gone?  Han Solo had charm.  Han and Leia had chemistry.  The special effects weren't great (good for their time, but definitely not great) so the Star Wars movies depended on its characters' charisma and chemistry to carry the story.  Aside from Jar Jar Binks the lack of the aforementioned is what killed Lucas' episode 1-3 debacle. Sure the special effects and action were great, but what of the story?  Medichlorians??    That brings me to Superman Returns.  Reeve had charm. Reeve's Clark and Kidder's Lois had real chemistry! The special effects weren't great (good for their time, but definitely not great) so the movie depended on it's characters' charisma and chemistry to carry the story. Deja Vu?  Anakin and Padme had the flame of a wet rag and the same holds true for the new Lois and Clark.  Everyone seemed lost and depressed.  I can understand Lois being upset that \\"Superman\\" left, but our new hero didn't put much effort into winning her back.  Oh, gee lets go for a BORING flight and see if that works.  Is this the same couple from the roof of Lois' apartment?  \\"What color underwear am I wearing?\\"  WHAT ARE YOU DOING HOLLYWOOD?  Remember when Rock-N-Roll was fun?  Poison, Def Leppard, Bon Jovi?  The lyrics weren't deep, but they were fun.  Then along came Nirvana and the grunge days and depression and anger ruled the airwaves.  The same is happening in our movies!  Where's the fun?  \\"Don't worry miss.  I've got you.  If you've got me. Who's got you?\\"  \\"I'd rather kiss a Wookie.  I can arrange that!\\" Man, I sure miss the fun!    Please...SOMEONE BRING BACK THE FUN!
0679720200|3.0|A man is punished and persecuted for taking life at face value.  There's also a murder, and some beatings, and a really horrible case of animal abuse, but Camus's narrator takes it all in stride.  A fact, that in the end, could kill him.       Unfortunately, the main character's nonchalance translates into the readers' boredom at times.  There's nothing particularly astounding of fascinating in this novella, and some parts of it seem rather unrealistic.  However, the book does have some interesting comments on life and priorities- particularly towards the end.  And the narrator's eyes are an interesting pair to see through for a short while.
B00008PX8P|5.0|One of the top 3 music DVD concerts that I have seen. The photography is clear, the performances are super. It's too much to watch in one sitting. This made me rate Robert Plante over Mick, Jimmy Page over Eric, John Bonham and John Paul Jones as the best in their category. A must have for any rock fan
B000EGDAI4|5.0|Sonny Rollins is simply amazing and truly shows his tenor saxophone prowess. While not doing as many saxophonists choose to do and play notes without regard to phrasing or the style of song, Sonny Rollins builds amazing melodies that are enjoyable to listen to. Of course, at the center of all of these melodies is Sonny Rollins' bold, confident tenor sound. This CD is a must for anyone who loves the strong, bold sound of a tenor saxophone!
B000PFUA9G|2.0|This whole cd is bland compared to the previous releases.  There just aren't as many great guitar licks and the mixing doesn't sound as good to me.  On top of that, they lyrics are clever but too racy for my younger children.
B000NA77YO|5.0|Basically this is very good selection from the four Dio sung Sabbath albums, however, some of my favorites are missing. But the major advantage is the three new songs, which are just fabulous. Classic Sabbath tones, dark, mystical but also feels like the last Dio album called Dehumanizer.

0385333846|2.0|This is a much acclaimed novel by Kurt Vonnegut that is not a simple tale, but an intricate story of the life of Billy Pilgrim.  Billy Pilgrim is a man who is \\"unstuck in time\\" meaning his timeline goes back and forth in atypical order. The novel takes an anti-war stance relayed through Pilgrim's witnessing the bombing of Dresden and surviving being a prisoner of war. He is trapped in a marriage, trapped into a career and has also  been abducted by aliens from the planet Trafalmador.  According to the Trafalmadorians all life is happening simultaneously. Billy Pilgrim lives his life out of order, he never knows where in his life he will next awaken. Vonnegut's character  also relives the terrible times repeatedly, like many people caught in traumatic devastating times.  There is an oft repeated line in this novel, \\"And so it goes.\\"  Knowing that Vonnegut was a Pacifist this line seems to demonstrate the ability to just accept whatever comes your way with no hesitation or ability to question. It is this characteristic that \\"traps\\" Billy Pilgrim in his marriage, his career and in a world filled with inequitable situations, he just accpets these things at face value, no more important or less important than any other.  I know this is a modern classic, attaining cult status, but I am just not a Vonnegut fan. I am glad that I read it for the sheer experience of reading a classic. Obviously Vonnegut was a gifted writer with an innate ability to convey his thoughts, feelings and experiences through his many novels and he has a significant and devoted following, but he is just not for me.

B00005JLEU|5.0|A magnificent tale from perhaps the world's greatest living animator, Miyazaki's \\"Spirited Away\\" finds a bewildered young girl plunged into an alternate world a la \\"Alice in Wonderland\\". But Miyazaki's humanistic spin on this kind of through-the-looking-glass fable makes love the most powerful spell of all. With his gallery of fantastic creatures--a sludge-heap river god, a lonely No-Face monster, an octopus-armed boiler-room attendant--Miyazaki wrings magic, humor, and endless delights from every scene. \\"Spirited Away\\" will captivate anyone with a sense of wonder and a love for flights of fancy.
B000008ILJ|5.0|While I like both the blues and metal I've always preferred Gary the straight ahead rocker to Gary the bluesman or Gary the late-80s metalhead. So this and \\"Dirty Fingers\\" remain my 2 favorite Gary Moore Albums to this day. I had just about worn the album out so was very excited to come across an import CD 12-15 years ago. It was $25 but I was happy to pay it!! But $80?!?!?! Don't know about that, this thing must be really rare these days, though I have occasionally seen other copies in stores for the usual $15-$30 that imports go for. But I will say this; if you are a Gary Moore fan at all, and you don't already have this, your collection is incomplete.<br /><br />I've always considered this and Dirty Fingers to be almost companion pieces that wouldn't have been out of place as a double album. Released less than a year apart (both have the original release date as 1978) Fingers has the straight ahead AOR rock songs while Streets has the \\"lets show what we can really do\\" rock instrumentals that will be familiar to anyone who has heard his work with the GREATLY underappreciated Coliseum II. My personal favorite is the magnificent \\"Flight of the Snow Moose\\" but \\"Hurricane\\" and \\"What Would You Rather Bee\\" are also fusion standouts and all 3 would make any Jeff Beck fan stand up and pay attention.<br /><br />It also contains the original release of \\"Parisienne Walkways\\" and, with all due respect to the late great Phil Lynott, the greatest version of \\"Don't believe a Word\\" that has ever been released. In fact, it was after this that Phil had Thin Lizzy begin playing that song as a blues tune in their set. But...herein lies an almost insignificant, but at the same time great, mystery!!! On my original album, after the last vocal \\"Don't believe a word...not a single word\\" Gary very softly says \\"I might just say anything I want to\\" right before the guitar jam. On the CD......IT's NOT THERE!!! I never would have imagined such a small change could so drastically change a song and can't fathom why anyone would mix it out!!! But, I guess if you'd never heard the album, you'd never even know what was missing!!<br /><br />Other (vocal) tracks include the title track, Song for Donna and another Lynott penned song; \\"Fanatical Fascists\\". And they kind of offset the missing line in \\"Word\\" by adding a bonus track \\"Spanish Guitar\\" that wasn't on the original album. So......if you like Gary, try to find this!!! If you're filthy rich, pay $80 for it!! Either way it's definitely one of Gary's finest moments!!!om why anyone would mix it out!!! But, I guess if you'd never heard the album, you'd never even know what was missing!!    Other (vocal) tracks include the title track, Song for Donna and another Lynott penned song; \\"Fanatical Fascists\\".

B000C65Z1G|5.0|Adapted from John Le Carr&eacute;'s novel by the Brazilian director of \\"City of God,\\" this engrossing, high-stakes political thriller tackles the conspiratorial collusion of Western governments and pharmaceutical giants administering HIV treatment in Africa's beleaguered nations. Mereilles clearly wants us to identify with the downtrodden, and his visceral visual style and nonlinear storytelling grip us right from the start. Fiennes brings a dry gravity to his character's predicament, and Weisz couldn't be better as an antagonistic advocate who keeps her political activities a secret from her husband, a man content to shut out the world in his patio garden. Cynical and captivating, \\"Gardener\\" grabs you and never lets go.
B00005JMX6|4.0|This movie is full of surprises.  There is really never a dull moment, little bit of T and A in this.  You might want to curl up to your significant other and have a laugh, sure worth the 90 minutes..
B00003CXS4|5.0|Guy Ritchie's kinetic, ultra-stylish heist film is an amalgam of all the best caper films, rolled out with a punk attitude and bristling Cockney accent. The plot is outrageous but loads of fun (wait until a certain dog swallows a squeaky toy), and the ensemble cast--Statham, Graham, Del Toro, Ford, and Serbedzija--may not all be household names, but their cocky, fiercely funny performances will stay etched in your mind. Nearly stealing the show is Pitt, playing a crooked bruiser whose Gaelic brogue is hilariously incomprehensible to everyone. \\"Snatch\\" this punchy, black-humored romp through London's criminal underbelly--before someone else does.
B00005JPAO|5.0|Regardless of what really happened between Queen Elizabeth, her family, and Tony Blair during the days after Diana's death, this is a great, well-told story.<br /><br />Queen Elizabeth and Tony Blair meet as potential adversaries after his election to the post of Prime Minister.  He has ideas of change and reform; she intends to staunchly maintain tradition and protocol in the face of a changing world.  The public's reaction to Diana's death leads each one to challenge the other in often uncomfortable ways, yet through this challenge, each learns to bend without breaking.  They come to a place where they can indeed work together for the good of the country.  The director, Stephen Frears, makes us feel that we are witnessing the real behind-closed-doors conversations whose results play out in both the public and private arenas.  The changes wrought in the two main characters (the Queen and Blair) are subtle, and never presented in a heavy-handed way.<br /><br />We, of course, can never know what was really said and done in the days following Diana's death.  We don't know if Charles was really as sympathetic as he appears in this film.  We don't know if Prince Phillip and the Queen Mum were really as callous and hard-hearted as they are presented here.  We do not know what exact words were exchanged between the Queen and Blair.  But the story that is told is intricate and compelling, and if it isn't an accurate depiction of the historical event...it should be!
B0007Y08QA|5.0|Anderson's eerie psychological thriller is an intelligent study of guilt and repression featuring a disturbing lead performance by Bale. Talk about dedication: the actor dropped a shocking 63 pounds to immerse himself in the role of Reznik, a \\"living skeleton.\\" It is hard to see the hulking star of \\"American Psycho\\" so gaunt and sickeningly starved, but it serves the character's sympathetic, soul-annihilating psychosis. Leigh and Sanchez-Gijon provide excellent support, as does Mr. Clean look-alike John Sharian, playing a demonic, scarily deformed factory worker who may or may not be a phantasm. Filmed in metallic blues and grays for added effect, \\"The Machinist\\" is a paranoid, memorably creepy puzzler.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Beautiful, poignant in that our world's geography and its wildlife are magnificent....yet in such peril.  The photography and the narration were creatively and woven together to provide both intellectual insight and emotional wonder.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Adapted from a Steven Millhauser story and set to a lilting score by Philip Glass, Neil Burger's fanciful tale of love and deception in turn-of-the-century Europe is an intriguing and highly entertaining art house gem with Hollywood-style production values. Norton is mystifying, Biel is ravishing, and Giamatti holds it all together with a fine performance as the inspector whose respect for Eisenheim nearly outweighs his official duty. Drenched in sepia tones that evoke the Victorian atmosphere, \\"The Illusionist\\" is a murderous bluff that never shows its hand--until the final curtain.
B000P2A24W|4.0|I am really enjoying this CD.  After reading the reveiws I didn't think I would considering it was supposed to be Bon Jovi version of country music. I am a huge country fan and I believe this is more soft rock than country.  No matter how you label the music style; I love it!!
B00005JPAO|5.0|Stephen Frears's wry, compelling docu-drama follows Blair's strenuous efforts to help the hapless Windsors avert a major PR disaster in the wake of Diana's fatal car accident. Oscar winner Mirren, whose uncanny channeling of Elizabeth's stiff-upper-lip airs is one of recent cinema's grandest performances, flawlessly captures the Queen's eerie old-world reticence. But she also makes her a sympathetic, even intriguing figure. By turns tense and touching, and consistently engrossing, by all means bow down to \\"The Queen\\".
B000QFCD2W|3.0|I must say it took me about 2 songs to get into this one, but by THE CELLAR, I was hooked. LaRoque shreds on this album similar to the glory days of 87-93, but I hated the fact KD didn't give us the grand falsetto that I feel we all miss.    That being said, it's still a great listen. Second best of KD's this decade with THE PUPPET MASTER way out in front. But you'll love this one as well. Keep rocking KING!
B000LC4TJ0|4.0|This Figaro is musically intriguing and vocally very strong.  What a great cast.  Not only are the singers superb, they bring psychological depth to their characterizations.  As a result, some of the old cliches are done away with.  I was especially amazed at Bo Skovhus' Count who is not a one-dimensional tyrant with entitlement issues.  His Almaviva is so much more complex and interesting to watch.  The same is true of all the singers down to a really sexy young looking Antonio who really SINGS the music.  When was the last time we heard Antonio's music SUNG and not barked?<br /><br />Despite all this, the director's concept is not always inspired by the music.  The color scheme of the production is monochromatic.  The addition of a mute cherub to clarify the subtext of the characters is gratuitous and annoying.<br /><br />With a less superb cast, this director would be in deep trouble.  By I still found the production compelling.
B00005JPKE|2.0|The movie drags from the very beginning.  The action does not start until about half way through the movie.  The movie is boring.  There are many better war movies out there than this one.  I would not suggest buying this movie, if you must watch it, you should rent it and save your money.  The movie is much worse than the trailer, don't let the trailer and the reviews fool you like it fooled me.  Now I gotta find some way to get rid of the movie and at least get some of my money back.
B0009SOFFY|5.0|I recieved this, along with \\"The Stooges,\\" for my birthday very recently. I had had Raw Power for a while, and had enjoyed that. The first album I also like and recommend it. But this is certianly the best. Very rarely do I really like an album on the first listen, and I knew immediatly that this one was going to be amazing as soon as I heard the opening guitar part to \\"Down on the Street.\\" Every track is great. My two favorites are the opening track and \\"TV Eye\\" and I love the saxophone (being a sax player myself) on side two. And it all ends chaoticly with \\"LA Blues\\" which appealed to the side of me that likes experimental, psychedelic, fusion noise like Pink Floyd, King Crimson, and the Beatles \\"Revolution 9.\\" If you liked the debut album, you MUST own this.
B000BYA5GO|4.0|\\"Lord of War\\" is a companion to other recent fictional satires on the amorality of big business \\"Fast Food Nation\\" and \\"Thank You for Smoking\\".<br /><br />Nicholas Cage plays an international arms dealer Yuri Orlov who turns a blind eye to the evil consequences of what he trades in. Cage gives one of this typical sleepy/goofy performances and manages to make a potentially unlikable character somewhat sympathetic.<br /><br />The acting and the look of the film are excellent. The filmmakers have managed to go a long way on a modest budget with South Africa doubling for Liberia, Sierra Leone, and other parts of the world.<br /><br />\\"Lord of War\\" is an excellent, thought-provoking expozay of international arms dealing and should be commended for raising the visibility of this important issue.
B000002AP1|3.0|I bought this on a whim. I had read in my \\"1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\\" book that this was good and I was looking for some music that had more of an edge than to what I was normally listening too. When I put it into the CD player I was shocked at how dirty the recordings sounded. I'm a huge progressive rock fan and was used to very clean and polished music and was not used to this. After my intial shock, I found that I loved the tracks \\"Search and Destroy,\\" \\"Gimme Danger,\\" \\"Penetration,\\" and \\"I Need Somebody.\\" They're such great tracks. Unfortunatly, rest of the tracks aren't as good, but are not bad, and so I rated this album lower than the other Stooges albums. If you like this, then I recommend Fun House and, if you feel brave, the rare live albums, like Metallic KO (which I just purchased).
B000KQGX1Y|5.0|The Celtic Woman are some very special singers.  I think I could buy just about anything they put out.<br /><br />Gunner  July  2,007
B0009SOFGI|4.0|Raw Power is what got me interested in the Stooges. I eventually was able to listen to this album for the first time at my college's library. I was so bored I fell asleep. I thought it all droned on and wasn't very creative and all sounded the same. But for some reason I was drawn to it and so for my birthday I recieved this album plus \\"Funhouse.\\"    Knowing that I usually like an album more the more I listen to hit I wanted to give this another shot. During my second listen I came to realise that this was great music! It was simple, but fun. The songs that really stuck out were the first two tracks, \\"1969\\" and \\"I Wanna Be Your Dog.\\" I also like \\"Ann\\" and, unlike most people here, \\"We Will Fall.\\" All the other tracks, though good, all kinda sound the same to me.     The Bonus Disc is interesting, but I definatly think the bonus disc for \\"Funhouse\\" is much better.    If you like this I recommend \\"Funhouse\\" if you do not already own it.
B0002V7OI8|5.0|This was the 'closes to the real thing' story I've ever seen.It was very spooky in that respect. And the special effects will blow you away.I would recommend it to everyone in every age group. The acting is supurb and as i said I'm sure under the same circumstances the world may just react in the same manner. The human interest stories during the catastrophe were very believeable and all the actors did a really great job!!!  Kudos to Hollywood on this one...   Bern in Florida
B0002PZVHK|5.0|I've recently become a big fan of ambient music, due in large part to Brian Eno's work.  Although there are many fine ambient albums out there by Eno and others, I think this one is the best.  It's not because it's musically superior to other ambient works; in fact, it's not really music at all.  But it is the perfect instantiation of the philosophy that ambient music should be music that can be listened to or ignored, and is equally pleasant either way.  If you want a pleasant background to other activities you're doing, you can't ask for more than this.  Even my cat likes this album, and when I put it on I can often hear her softly snoring, which adds another dimension to the experience ;-)<br /><br />My only complaint is that I've listened to this album too many times; I wish there were 20 more like it.
0060578793|5.0|This is the kind of book that you want to own but hope never to have to use. If you could take only one book with you, this might be the perfect candidate, especially since there is also a pocket-sized, somewhat abridged version available.    That does not mean it is perfect, though. First of all, it is printed on fairly heavy paper and thus a little on the hefty side (thus the convenience of the pocket version). There are also a few errors such as wrong page numbers that give an impression of sloppy editing. And sometimes the text is too succinct on important topics and maddeningly unspecific like some Ancient Greek oracle.    Example: In the \\"Crossing a River\\" section it says: \\"Avoid obstructions in the water. ... Look out for submerged branches.\\" Well, D'oh, who would need a book for that kind of advice? The [[ASIN:1400053099 The Backpacker's Field Manual, Revised and Updated: A Comprehensive Guide to Mastering Backcountry Skills]] goes into far more detail in the corresponding section, for example: \\"Strainers are submerged branches that will hold a person swept against them -- a potential drowning situation.\\" It also has a nice conceptual map of possible river hazards and mentions that these strainers are typically to be found on outside bends of rivers. Aha, much clearer!    Another example: In the section on drowning, the BFM describes the difference between wet drowning and dry drowning. An important distinction you probably did not know about (and neiter did I), but John Wiseman does not mention this at all in his book. Shame on him! Because the CPR that may work for wet drowning might fail for dry drowning, as the larynx goes into a spasm in that case and has to be massaged first to, uh, un-spasm. I'd call that a fairly vital piece of information!    Maybe John Wiseman and Rick Curtis should get together and write the _truly_ ultimate outdoor book as a team...    The strength of the First Aid section lies in the fact that it does not skip those things thatare _not_ really First Aid, but more like desperate emergency procedures, e.g. the famous cut into the trachea with a ballpoint pen. Or childbirth. All these things where conventional First Aid texts like to tell you to \\"wait for the doctor\\", which is great as long as the doctor arrives in time. But if not, it is fairly important to have measures of last resort available to you.    The highlight of the book is unquestionably the part that deals with the indigenous flora and fauna in beautiful color illustrations and how to turn said flora and fauna into a nutritious meal for yourself. Gathering plants, recognizing fungi, catching fish, gutting animals, preparing organ meats, various methods of cooking, eating insects -- in culinary terms, the book is hard to beat and probably covers everything there is to know. As if Robinson Crusoe had written a cookbook. Somehow, even the termites sound mouth-watering as described by Wiseman: \\"termites are nutritious and tasty\\". Oh well, if he says so...    After reading this book, you will probably never again be able to look at a squirrel without wondering how to kill it, roast it, suck out its bone marrow, use the leftovers for squirrel soup, and, to add insult to injury, turn its fur into a poach, sewed with its sinews, and its skull into a pencil sharpener. The book is really that hardcore! I imagine the squirrels are not amused.    So at least you will not starve to death with this book in hand, provided you can bring yourself to do what it suggests to those poor critters that are unlucky enough to cross your way.    All in all, this is a worthy effort, even if it could be improved upon in some places. But in terms of information density (which is probably the deciding factor if you have to carry around a book in the wilderness) this work is definitely a winner.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|i really enjoy this concert, and this dvd has a extraordinary features, you could see a Cher telling you her comments about the show, is really great. if you like Cher you probably could cry with this concert but it worth it, i`m not the best cher fan, but i always enjoy her music, i started to follow her since Believe cd, but i knew a lot of her classics songs, and this is the best of this concert she sings all the classics songs, and the songs who made her a true diva.<br />P.S.  the clothes is amazing!
B000PFUA9G|4.0|Normally doesn't listen to country, I'll have to say that I was pretty impressed with this album.  I heard a review of it on NPR one morning and as soon as I heard excerpts from the song \\"Online\\", I knew I had to have this album.  The rest of the album doesn't disappoint.  It doesn't sound like your typical stereotype of country, the lyrics are fairly intelligent and the music is pretty well written.    I give it 4 stars becuse I still a little biased.
0670034711|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much that I have already loaned it out to two people.  Ms. Gilbert has a steady, calming, inspirational voice.  I've never read a book with so much substance; so much so that I found my self re-reading some passages because my brain could not believe what I was reading.  She made me think and feel; most books these days don't have so much going for them.    She takes us on this journey with her; I could taste the pasta in Italy; feel the hard ground of the meditation cave in India and my heart lifted with hers in Indonesia as she finally found herself.  I recommend this book, it's wonderful.
032147404X|4.0|This is short and sweet read with plenty of quick tips on improving your shots in almost every situation.<br /><br />I really liked the \\"cook book\\" format- If you want this shot, then do this. It's great to pick up practical knowledge and see immediate results without diving into more technical explanations.<br /><br />That bad part is Scott Kelby's jokes and analogies. Sorry Scott!
0714843377|5.0|This is a highly creative book about becoming more creative.  It is filled with provoking thoughts and exercises.  I recommend this book very much to anyone seeking to expand, enrich, widen their personal creativity.  It could easily be a supplementary textbook for many courses in high school and college.
1594489505|5.0|I picked up this book at the airport and was done with it by the time I got home. Khaled Hosseini knows how to paint sadness like no one else I have read.  A very powerful read that depicts the struggles of every day life in a war torn country.  The sad thing is that it is all true.  I would like to say that it ends happily ever after but I cannot.  I enjoyed the ending because it is real life.  So poignant and yet so filled with intricacies of what these people endure each day.     Another amazing story by the man who must have experienced it to write like this.
B000BRBA8S|2.0|I cannot understand those who give more than 3 stars for this film.  It is the most disappointing film from Wong Kar Wai. Visually, the film looks stunning. But there is really no plot or storyline and the characters are boring. The story doesn't really go anywhere. It is almost like an exercise in aesthetics.   Maybe not having a written script is not a good idea for this film. It might have worked for his past films but certainly not with this one.  And my personal fave of WKW would be In the Mood for Love, which I recommend highly. It is such a beautiful film, from the visuals, the storyline, the acting, the set, everything is perfectly done. Even the smoke from the cigarettes creates a certain mood/nostalgia.  Also, Happy Together is another film from WKW that I like.  But this one is a total mess. It was pointless.
B000GFLEAY|5.0|This movie was one of five that we selected as a bonus for buying a new HD-DVD player. Thinking that it was just another race track circuit movie, it was the last one to be viewed. Wow, blew us away!<br /><br />The movie begins at the turn of the 20th Century and illustrates the impact of the industrial revolution visa vie the development of the automobile and assembly line production, into the great depression and up to the early 1940's.<br /><br />The three main characters are developed and come together and we quickly bond with each of them. The story of Seabiscuit the horse could easily have been called \\"Cinderella Horse\\". The movie will take you through the full gamut of emotions with several edge of your seat sequences.<br /><br />This is the best movie that I have seen for some time and found myself going to sleep thinking about it and waking up thinking about it. The cinemaphotography is outstanding and the period vehicles are a treat. Don't miss this gem!
B000U0F7RG|5.0|As excited as I was to hear that the seventh and final season of \\"Gilmore Girls\\" will be coming to DVD on November 13--just in time for the upcoming holiday season--the fact that this deluxe full-series edition is being released on the same day is more than a little bit frustrating. As a fan who started loyally watching at the beginning of Season 6 and has quickly caught up with every episode since then, I think that this new collection--with the fancy cover art, more efficient packaging, and a slew of little extras, including a complete book of \\"Gilmore-isms\\"--will be pretty tough to pass up. Oh, but what's a Gilmore junkie to do when she has already purchased the first 6 individual seasons? Yes, unfortunately, these are the exact types of appeals that these companies present to mess with our minds and make an even larger profit. It's a pain, for sure, and yet here we all are, adoring this series and debating whether or not this investment is worth the money.    Setting all that aside, if you have not yet obtained the current DVD's and/or are thinking about introducing yourself to the magic, this might be a good opportunity to do so. As another reviewer here has already indicated, this is a genuinely unique work of art that began as a mother/daughter relationship study and gradually evolved into several layers of subtle humor, poignancy, character flaws, and imperfections that manage to never cut down on what is most important in life. The show always succeeded in maintaining a contemporary edge, but those timeless values of family and community hold up strong, and there is perhaps no series that combines it all better than \\"Gilmore Girls.\\"     Most fans of the show will agree that the plot's true backbone belongs to the character of Lorelai Gilmore--a strong-willed, stubborn, occasionally selfish person whose heart is generous, sincere, and filled with everything that young people should strive for today. Getting pregnant at 16 and alienating herself from her straight-laced parents did not prevent Lorelai from creating her own life and being the best mother she could possibly be. When we meet her and her 16-year-old daughter Rory in the pilot episode, we get a glimpse of a genuinely successful young woman who works hard and provides well for her child, both physically and emotionally. As financial situations with Rory's schooling plummet Lorelai back into a world where her parents are part of her daily regime, we begin seven incredible years of bantering and conflict that any human being can relate to on some level.     As for the unforgettably bright and academically passionate Rory Gilmore, it is her and Lorelai's very connection that drew so many people into the plot in the first place. Going beyond the basic mother/daughter closeness, these two are best friends who essentially grow up together, experiencing everything from heartbreak to realizing their personal dreams. Their relationship radiates from the very beginning, and even as the superachieving Rory Gilmore grows older, heads to college and starts making her own way, you can see EXACTLY where her varying successes have stemmed. By the time she receives the payoff in the finale and tastes the glory of all her hard-fought efforts, it is not difficult to see how she got there, and for long-time viewers, that just makes it all the more heartwarming.    As I said earlier, this series has an overwhelming number of layers and would take hours to write in full detail. I could write forever, but since it's basically impossible to put everything about this show into words, I can only say that it is something of susbtance, quality, and true value for our world today. It starts out with a young woman living and enjoying life with her teenage daughter, and it deepens as a talented ensemble cast creates their warm, ideal, and welcoming town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut.     There's just something about it. It is an ongoing story that is sensitively told, complete with pitch-perfect acting (especially from Ms. Lauren Graham) and a solid script that is not afraid to show how these characters change, make some poor decisions, and come through it in a way that you can often admire. The messages are positive and sweet, yet even with its generous poignancy, you never feel like you are watching something too saccharine or unrealistic.     If you love this show as much as I do, then you know just what I mean, and if you haven't, then I hope you will pick up this set in November and give it a shot. The story is addictive in nature, and the writing is razor-sharp in wit during every single episode. As for this particular special edition set, well, I think I'm going to have to give in to it and continue enjoying my Gilmore Girls for years to come. It's still unknown whether or not this will include bonus features that are exclusive only to this boxed set, but either way, it's shaping up to be a pretty impressive collection that is worth the extra bucks if this is one of your all-time favorites. The 2007 holidays are coming up quickly (believe it or not), so go ahead. Save up your money, revisit the episodes, and treat yourself to a modern-day classic that certainly managed to become some of the most well-loved television of our time.
B000002AH1|3.0|It's too bad that this otherwise remarkable music is marred by vocals from the drummer, which ultimately make certain tracks unlistenable, in my opinion. Otherwise it would easily be 5 stars.  By the way, at this time, Amazon has the wrong album cover.  This is not Live at the Filmore, Amazon.  Too bad, because Live Evil has great cover art.
B000EQ4G5K|4.0|This is an awesome CD if you love pop and reggae. A lotta of the songs I've noticed have the same beat. SOS is one-of-a-kind though on the cd. I find it's great to relax n chill out to.There are some sad songs though like the popular \\"Unfaithful\\" and others such as \\"Million miles away\\" \\"Final goodbye\\". Hope this helps!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|it is an amazing documentary about our planet  wonderful hd pictures !!    it is so relaxing to watch such a beautiful documentary after work !
B000MRAAJM|5.0|There isn't really much more to say that hasn't been said by the other reviewers. If you really want to see how great HD is, get this!
1582701709|4.0|Although at times this book was a little bit off the wall, it is good for those who feel they need a little more direction towards a positive outlook. It carefully touches on the importance of each individual without going into religious depth, which is what I liked about the book. I guess it appeals more to everyone this way. The law of attraction does have it's ring of truth but for those who are skeptics, this book is still worth reading to remind you of how special you are. I felt refreshed and optimistic after reading it.
B000RIHBIE|3.0|Your view on this album will be determined by four things: (a) What you expect from Sum 41,   (b) How much you liked American Idiot (c)how much you liked the last two Blink 182 albums and (d) how much you miss pop-punk. Now that this is in the clear we can move on.    Ok, even after moving on to all the Rancids', Nofxs,'and Black Flags',   I still held on to this band because they were catchy, fast and fun.   The later albums progressed in terms of subject matter and musicianship,  but seemed to do so at the expense of the fun and catchiness, which I guess from an artistic standpoint, is an even trade. So here we are, album number 5 and the band is definitely going back to the pop-punk sound old old while tackling a rather popular topic-politics. Does it work? Well it does if you never bought American Idiot and Enema of the State. I know that Sum 41, has always been influenced by Blink and Green Day (as a lot of pop punk bands from that era are) but this time, the comparison is a little too much. The marching bands, the megaphone, the sudden blasts of speed, the Billy Joe fake british accent, I mean this album is draped in American Idiot-isms. But for the fans that can overlook the blatant comparisons, you'll love this one. It's full of energy and is pretty speedy. For instance, \\"Underclass Hero\\" one of the best song they've put out ever, even if it is very similar to Fat Lip.    So I'll leave it at that. Pop-punk albums a few and far between these days and it's always a welcome when the bands we grew up put something out. So hey if you need a speedy fix then this is right up your alley. Otherwise, just dig out your old Blink and Green Day CDs.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This production was a once-in-a-lifetime experience.  I've seen each segment over three times and every time, I see something I think I've missed.
0800141806|5.0|This is the only movie that I have watched this summer and has impacted me in such a positive way. Being away from Philadelphia has made me realize that I do have some love for the city and I wanted to see a movie that dealt with individuals living ...(read more)in the city of brotherly love. I saw it at blockbuster and rented it. The movie is awesome right from the beginning, where there is a display of different snapshots from the different communities in Philadelphia and Bruce Springsteen's song \\"Streets of Philadelphia\\". The movie not only depicts a very accurate picture of the city's atmosphere but also informs its viewers about the gay community in the city, something that I feel is not as present in Philadelphia compared to larger cities like Chicago or New York. The best part of the movie is that the film is based on a true story. The only reason why I did not give the film five stars is due to the fact that most of the movie takes place inside of a courtroom and after a while I became frustrated when the problem would not get resolved. I was also a little confused by the special features. I was not sure if the special features on the individuals protesting outside of the courtroom were real protestors or not. The extra feature made it seem like they were, but I was just confused. I recommend this film to everyone, but I also believe that it will be even more appreciated by those who have lived in the city itself. Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington also give great performances.
B000OY8NII|5.0|I happened to stumble upon this show last summer (2006) when SciFi ran a repeat of the pilot.  While I had seen a few of their promotion spots, I had no idea what to expect.    I could barely believe my eyes (or ears).  Here was a show that was interesting, well-acted, intelligently written and funny and yet a) had no gratuitous sex or violence, b) managed to be humorous without being lewd or crude, and c) unlike the vast majority of scifi, didn't take itself too seriously.    Thanks to my recently-acquired DVR, I was able to record and watch every episode of Season One, and, while there were one or two that weren't the greatest, overall I thought the first season was a huge success and was thrilled when I found out SciFi had chosen to pick the series up for a second season.    Since I hate commercials as much as anyone, I'm planning to break into my piggy bank very soon and order the set.  In the meantime, I highly recommend the show to you and encourage you to catch the first episodes of Season Two.  The first episode is rather dark and sinister (overly so, in my opinion), but things have lightened back up quite a bit since then.
B000OCY7JE|5.0|This was such a beautiful film. Breathtaking! The best part was watching it with my movie buddy Sandra Zhao! I cannot wait to see it again. I truly felt like the movie had taken me on a trip to Denmark. I have still not watched the Lives of Other's which beat Pan's Labyrinth and this movie for Best Foreign Film. Can't wait to see it.
B000MQC9H4|1.0|Unbelievably bad.  So, I'll admit, the Rom-Com genre really isnt my thing, but hey, my wife gets half the Netflix, so we settled down to watch, and unfortunately waste our time on, this movie.  I can't get that hour and a half back folks, and I'm pretty mad about it.<br /><br />Its as if the creators of the Not Another Teen Movie/Scary Movie films got together and decided to make Not Another Romantic Comedy.  Every single bad romantic comedy cliche is in there:<br /><br />You've got the solo-singing.  You've got the angry, throwing-objects mood swings.  You've got the too-good-to-be-true swinging single-dad bachelor.  The cheating boyfriend.  The \\"crazy\\" supportive friends.  I've seen this movie before, just not all at once, as it is truly a formulamatic representation of all that is bad in this type of movie.<br /><br />...and we are supposed to suspend reality and believe Jack Black is a mild, tame, abused romantic?  Who are you, and what have you done with the insane half of Tenacious D?<br /><br />Avoid like the plague.
1416914285|1.0|Before I begin my review, I want to go into a brief back-story.  I did not pick up this book of my own volition.  The only reason I bought it was because I was told that the author, who has some kind of fame in the HP fandom, had gotten this book published and I wanted to be able to discuss it with my friends.  That being said, I give this book one star because I cannot be objective about it.  And also because [...] does not allow no-star reviews.    City of Bones was not a bad book.  If I overlooked the character inconsistencies, the purple prose, the unoriginality of some of the plot twists, and the leftover editing mistakes, it was an engaging book that had me reading from start to finish.  Since I was not a fan of Star Wars, nor have I ever watched Buffy, the characters seemed very original to me, although they all had their problems (and, no, I don't mean the necessary character flaws).    The main character, Clary Fray, was the biggest problem for me.  She is a Mary Sue, which means, essentially, an unbearably perfect character who easily overcomes all obstacles, discovers that she has some amazing powers that she can wield better or equal to people who have been trained in it for years, and ends up with the love and respect of most if not all of the other characters no matter what she does.      At the beginning of the book, she is a 'shy' girl in a nightclub with her best friend, Simon.  By the end of the book, she knows how to use a variety of runes, she's discovered that she's daughter to the Big, Bad Villain, and, despite the fact that she broke Simon's heart and almost indirectly caused Alec's death, both characters have forgiven her by the end of the novel with little or no effort on her part.  I won't discuss the Mary Sueish ties between Clarissa Fray and the author because this review is about the work, not the author, but I will mention that they are there.    The other problem for me was Jace, not because he wasn't a perfectly nice character, but because of the lack-of-objectivity I previously mentioned.  Coming from the HP fandom, I can recognize fanon!Draco when I see him.  For those who don't know, the Draco of fanon is sophisticated, exasperatingly arrogant, and always has a sarcastic quip on hand so that he can make himself look better and wittier compared to whomever he's speaking to.  This description fits Jace to a tee and I don't think it's a coincidence that Jace's physical appearance is identical to that of fanon!Draco.  I think this might have been intentional, to give fanon!Draco a life outside of fanfiction, but it's in no way original and, for someone like me who is familiar with fanon!Draco and doesn't wish to see him renamed and reproduced in what is supposed to be an ORIGINAL NOVEL, it's also irritating.    Clary's appearance is like that of Ginny Weasley and Simon's is like that of Harry Potter, if one wants to go so far in drawing parallels, but I found their personalities different enough from Ginny and Harry's for me to ignore that.      A third, more personal problem I had with the book, was the two instances in which Clary mentioned things obviously not original to Clare.  The first instance was her suggestion that Simon go out with a \\"Jaida Jones\\" who apparently goes to their school.  Once again, if you are familiar with the HP fandom, you will recognize Jaida Jones as being a real person, another famous member of the fandom.  The other instance was when Clary and Jace were riding through the city, and Clary notices two homeless kids whose descriptions match those of Val and Luis from Holly Black's VALIANT.  Someone before me said it best: I found myself wishing that Clare would just write the novel instead of taking the time to wave to her friends.      It wasn't until after I'd finished City of Bones that I was notified that the great plot twist - that Jace and Clary are related, both children of the villain, Valentine - has been done before, in Star Wars.  Exactly the same way, too.My final nitpick with the book was that it was unnecessarily full.  I know that Clare painted a picture of an entire Downworld in which existed fairies and vampires and werewolves and other things that only exist in stories (\\"all the stories are real\\" seems to be an accurate tagline for this book), but was it really necessary to put so many of them in one book?  Clary and company go from eating in a café filled with fairies and such to attending a party thrown by a warlock and containing phooka and other creatures to infiltrating a vampire lair to being chased by werewolves.      I just felt that half the creatures that made an appearance in this book, no matter how brief, were unnecessary and could have been saved for a future book in the series or not been mentioned at all.  The vampires, I thought, could have been written out entirely as their only purpose seemed to be to introduce the flying motorcycles that were ripped from Harry Potter (though, now that the series is over, what WON'T be ripped from Harry Potter?)    I give Clare a lot of credit.  She brought this story alive for me and set it in Manhattan, my favorite city.  She gave me three loveable characters, Alec, the introverted protector with unrequited feelings for Jace, Magnus Bane, the flamboyant, glittery warlock with a thing for Alec, and Simon, the painfully ordinary geek who, like me, finds this whole magical world \\"awesome.\\"  Without any outside influence, the story can be enjoyable.      However, since, like I said, I came into this without an objective viewpoint, my one-star review still stands.  I hope others, outside of fandom, get more enjoyment out of this book than I did.
B000OYC3J8|4.0|I don't believe Icky Thump tops the previous White Stripes release but in it's own right, It is a great CD.  New listeners and established fans will find themselves singing to song genre's they would not otherwise have.
B0002S943O|5.0|Devotional is the dvd that started my collection. This is the most mystical and the most sensual of all the albums, and this aura comes through so well on the dvd. I have SOFAD permanently installed in my cd player, and on the last note of 'Higher Love' I turn the stereo off-- nothing is worthy enough to follow! I have been a devoted fan since '81... for me, there has never been any other music that can compare.<br />My first concert was the 'Exciter' tour... which I found to be as electrifying and perfectly performed as any other! It was at the Gorge in Washington State... perhaps that makes a difference?! We have been to every other local concert, including Dave Gahan's 'Paper Monsters' in Seattle. And by 'we', I mean three generations who 'just can't get enough'! It is SO great to have Grampa dancing and clapping along with granddaughter! We are ecstatic that another tour is planned!<br />People who talk about DM in the past tense amuse me... check out the size of the crowds in any of their videos, and you'll know that Depeche Mode is still here, still vital, and still producing the most incredible music and performances. And the true believers will always be there to support and enjoy them.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|I have never seen such excellent photography of nature in general, and such wonderfull close-ups of animals in the wild. I don't know how many of the scenes were even possible to be photographed. Everyone that worked on this remarkable project are worthy of the highest praise and awards for such fine work. A strong knowledge of animal behavior, by those engaged in the actual camera work, and the harsh conditions that nature can provide, make every scene a joy to all who get to see such remarkable footage of our great earth and all of us that that inhabit it.    I am well pleased to have paid so little for such a great BBC production, even the cost of a new HD-DVD player that I bought to enable my veiwing, was money well spent, I look forward to many future HD proudctions in the future.

B000055Y0X|5.0|Though played seriously, this is one of the funniest movies ever made. And, what's more, a funny movie about 'the' dark theme of our times - atomic/nuclear war.     Classic, funny lines throughout. First-rate performances from all, especially Peter Sellers (my favorite of his three roles is the president...), and George C. Scott.     Buy and watch this film!

B00005JPHT|5.0|Once again Michael Moore has opened Pandora's box with his new film Sicko. This time he shines a light on Americas broken health care system. Having lived over seas for the better part of ten years (7 years in Italy and almost 3 years in Japan) I can say that in almost every corner of the industrialized world has better health care system. I still can't fathom that America is barely above Slovenia in infant mortality. (WTF!?) I don't even know where the hell Slovenia is! Fox news lambastes France for being almost communist with there dirty liberal socialized health care system. Funny they seem to have the best system in the world followed closely by Italy. Now I will say that medical technology in America is un-surpassed, as long as you can pay for it. We perfected the MRI and digital X-rays. We came up with the AIDS cocktail, yet we can't figure a way to provide adequate health care for working Americans. I don't even care about getting free health care, how about affordable. I think Michael Moore is a great American in that he is using his right to free speech to bring this ugly truth to light. See this movie.
6303305520|1.0|Akira: Most certainly NOT the most superbly overrated, pseudo-philosophical brain fart, piece of garbage to ever be splattered on the screen.    So, I watched this movie and at first I didn't like it, but then I talked to fans of the movie and I was informed that it was not only impossible to dislike this film, but it was also practically criminal. Phew! I was this close to writing about how this was an incomprehensible jumble of idiotic nonsense with poorly developed characters whose actions seem to be decided more by dumb luck and lousy writing rather than genuine character development. Now, however, I've been informed that I'm not allowed to dislike this film; thanks Akira fans!    From the very beginning of this excellent movie, things start off strong and never let up. There's this intellectually deep and thought provoking scene wherein the characters are riding around on motorcycles and beating people up. This is obviously social commentary on modern obsession with celebrities. Suddenly, government officials kidnap a biker named Tetsuo and give him telekinetic powers, all for reasons I'm sure are just too advanced for me to grasp. Tetsuo breaks out of the secret government facility very easily because that makes perfect sense and is a very smart way to advance the plot. Once free he seeks out his biker gang friends, who are all so nondescript as to be interchangeable which symbolizes how the youth of today wear strange clothes.     After a few scenes of bike races, violent schools, attempted rape, and Tetsuo hallucinating himself tearing his gut out in graphic and therefore good detail, Tetsuo passes out and is picked up by the government who conveniently happened to be passing by.  Then comes the sublime artistic maneuver of having elderly looking kids attack Tetsuo with giant teddy bears that bleed milk. Tetsuo realizes the full extent of his new powers, learns of the being called Akira who caused massive destruction years ago. Tetsuo follows the logical course of action and decides to go on a random killing spree while tracking down this Akira with a motivation so deep that it isn't even present in the movie. Which I believe to be a form of commentary on the Rorschach inkblot test.    The last portion of the film is every bit as poignant and moving as the first, which is to say very, very much so. Tetsuo continues his rampage across the city  killing all his friends in the process, save one. This one remaining friend then resolves to kill Tetsuo, he picks up a laser gun off of one of the soldiers who died fighting Tetsuo and despite the fact that he has no formal training and is not a professional soldier he manages to survive encounter after encounter after encounter with Tetsuo whereas whole armies were swept aside by the unstoppable youth. The realism and dramatic tension of these battle scenes surpass any work by such two-bit hacks as Shakespeare and Hemingway, additionally they are also numerous and satisfying, comprising what must be at least a third of the film. This movie, unlike weaker degenerate movies made by the pig dogs at Disney, has not just one or two climaxes, but has several climactic moments which have been stacked one on top of the other making it seem as if the movie was twice as long as it actually was. Remember, you can never have too much of a good thing!    Some hippies think Tetsuo is Jesus or something and then get killed by him with no explanation. Phenomenal!    The enigmatic titular character Akira turns out to be dead. Sensational!    Tetsuo transforms into a giant meatloaf for no appreciable reason. Mind-blowing!    A giant ball of light appears out of nowhere and sucks in Meatloaf Tetsuo. Stupendous!    The few cast members left standing survey the carnage and nonchalantly comment on how they think Tetsuo isn't really dead as if it's a good thing. Amazing!    The camera flies through a tunnel of light and Tetsuo says \\"I am Tetsuo!\\"  from off screen. Unbelievable, fantastic, exceptional, splendid, vivid, exciting, magnificent, wonderful, spectacular, outstanding, and it's good too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    Akira is most certainly not one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life, and it is entirely plausible that people like this film because it was good and not just because they are pressured into it or it was the first anime they ever saw. In fact, I did not find it such a terrible unwatchable piece of crap that I hold it in the same regard as Read or Die: The Movie, another excellent film!!!!!!!    Originally written for the Anime Sucks Foundation.
B00003CXD5|4.0|This movie isn't an action movie, it's a drama.  I happen to love dramas as much as action movies, but part of me wanted just a little more action in this movie.<br />The acting is amazing and the story draws you in, but you don't have anyone to root for and you find yourself just watching things unfold without any emotional attachment.<br />That said when it is all said and done; this is a darn good movie.  At the end when everything comes full circle the journey was worth it, but you just can't help but feel like you should have had more fun watching it.
6305181810|1.0|I am sorry to go against the tide, but had I not read the book, I would have nothing at all good to say about this movie, in this format. It was choppy, disoriented, and failed to develop any of the plot points. It is like a series of promos, loosely glued together, without even a good time line to enable a viewer to determine what has occurred. Since my spouse watched it with me, and has never read the book, we are both convinced that we saw this movie before, and that it was longer, with much more detail. In this version, Birdie and Donnie could have phoned in their parts, as could Ms. Black. Very little in the way of part development for anyone except Danny DeVito, and even that was abridged. Am I wrong? is there not another version out there somewhere?
B000059HB7|5.0|This is classic John Wayne and Howard Hawks.  If you love John Wayne movies you'll love this one.  Now personally I enjoyed El Dorado better than this one and sure they are basically the same movie, but they are different enough that you can watch them both and enjoy them for different reasons.<br /><br />In Rio Bravo, unlike El dorado, Wayne is the sheriff and he is definitely the law.  This is a powerful man that knows his job.  Dean Martin is his drunken deputy, Dude, who fell apart over a woman we never meet.  Part of the fun and drama of this movie is Martin becoming the man he used to be while he and Wayne keep guard over the murderous Joe Burdette played by a smug Claude Akins, while dodging bullets and threats from Nathan Burdette (Joe's wiser brother) played by John Russell.<br /><br />Along for laughs (and there's plenty) are Walter Brennan playing the old crippled jail hand Stumpy and Pedro Gonzalez Gonzalez as the hotel owner.  Of course there's the love interest for Wayne as well, and although done ok, it really isn't the reason to keep watching this movie over and over again.<br /><br />Rio Bravo isn't Wayne's best movie, but it is one of my favorites and one I can continue to watch year after year.
B000TFINY6|5.0|While at first glance, this may seem a bit pricey, let me assure you, it is completely worth it.  The experience of BLu-Ray for the wonderful show LOST is truly amazing.      Plus, Season 3 of LOST was fantastic.
B00006ADD5|5.0|Although this movie isn't a completely accurate depiction of Lawrence's life, it is a great movie about life.  This movie depicts the struggles of a man in a foreign world that became one with both the people of that land and almost the land itself.<br />This movie is long and even when you think it's done it isn't even close.  The nice thing is you don't mind, because there is so much more to tell.  I hadn't seen this movie until I bought it.  I never do that, but I figured it had to be good since it won best picture and I love war movies.  Well I found out that it really isn't a war movie.  Now I'm not saying that there aren't any battles.  There are, but I'd say both in time and atmosphere that this is more a journey movie about a man going somewhere both physically and spiritually.<br />I highly recommend this movie.
B000127LW2|3.0|I wish I could afford to spend $100 per season. What I don't understand though is why the same set, but region 2 dvd, is the equivalent of $60 from the UK version of Amazon.. (amazon.co.uk). You use the same log in and password as on Amazon and it can be shipped internationally.  So if anyone has a multi-regional DVD player get it from there, even with shipping it's got to be cheaper. The series itself is 5 star but the price sucks.<br /><br />Update 5-28-08: Finally this comes down to a much more reasonable price :) Love it!
6305754969|5.0|This is Wayne and Hawks' redo of Rio Bravo and although that movie was great fun and didn't need to be redone, I'm glad they did.  El Dorado is better in my opinion for a few reasons, but I'll stop there at comparing these movies because they are both great.<br /><br />This is a fun comedy western with great action, drama, and dialogue.  There are some really cool characters here that you just love to watch.  John Wayne of course is the star and he does his usual hard as nails with a caring core weapon for hire, Cole Thornton, who just happens to be at the wrong or right place at the right or wrong time (depending on how you look at it).<br /><br />What's unusual about this movie is that John Wayne's Cole Thornton isn't at the top of his game anymore, and he knows it, especially due to a nerve problem sustained from a gun shot earlier in the movie.  Yet he must go against the best anyway and he uses his brains not just his bravado to win the day.<br /><br />Robert Mitchum plays the drunken El Dorado Sheriff J.P. Harrah that Cole Thorton must aid.  This is where Rio Bravo and El Dorado become one in the same, but this time they have the main bad guy in jail and not his punk brother.<br /><br />Arthur Hunnicutt is Bull Harris, Mitchum's sidekick, deputy, and good friend, and James Caan plays Alan Bourdillion Traherne (Which is a mouthful so they just call him 'Mississippi'), Wayne's sidekick.  Both of these characters have back stories of their own though minor and are not only great help to our two main characters, but loads of fun for us viewers.<br /><br />And then there's Charlene Holt as Maudie.  She's the love interest for someone???  It changes as the movie develops, but she does a good job tying up story lines for John Wayne's character as we follow his adventures away from El Dorado for a while, and although Bull could have done that for us, it's much more fun to see Wayne with Holt.<br /><br />And then there's Michele Carey who plays Josephine (Joey) MacDonald, who is probably the sexiest cowgirl I've ever seen, and she's as tough as she is beautiful.  She is Caan's love interest, and interesting she is.<br /><br />This is a classic Wayne Western.  Good action, great characters, good comedy, just a little romance, and a great showdown at the end.  I highly recommend this and Rio Bravo for John Wayne movie lovers.  Two of his best or at least two of my favorites.r seen, and she's as tough as she is beautiful.

B000N6TX22|5.0|This is an amazing film, with top quality cinematography, a good cast, and an original story (based on a book). I won't bore you with a plot synopsis, its in the future and it stars clive owen. That all you really need to know. There are some parallels with V for Vendetta (near future, world in choas, england prevails), but this is a more mature look at the subject matter. There is clearly a deep social commentary presented in this film, with some very serious implications. I wouldn't call it an action movie its more like a drama, but when there is action its pretty intense.<br /><br />In terms of the HD-DVD version, the quality is fantastic. The picture looks real nice and sharp on an HDTV, definitely one of the better releases. Some people have complained about playback issues with the initial run of disc. I have the Xbox360 HD-DVD add-on and I had no problems at all. Don't let a few faulty discs scare you away from getting one of the best films on HD-DVD to date.
B000RIHBIE|5.0|I have read way too many negative reviews on this cd. I read a review earlier today saying that the album is 5 parts Blink and 1 part Green Day and that the band is becoming more and more unoriginal. I almost died laughing. Underclass Hero is Sum 41. It's almost like an amazing mix of all the sounds they have come up with in the past decade all rolled into one. From Pop, to Punk, to Punk-pop, to Heavy, to Emo. I honestly have never heard such a great collaboration from any band. Unorginal, no, more original than ever. It's a great album and truthfully one of the only ones I can actually listen to straight through without skipping a song. I'm a musician. That's very hard for me to do. 5 Star tracks include: The Jester, Best Of Me (written to Avril), Speak of the Devil, and Count Your Last Blessings.

From page one the story drew me in and I stayed there until the last page. I'm looking forward to see how the story develops into the next two sequels (I already have them wishlisted!).    I have to say I think it's suitable for teen and adults. It's something that everyone can enjoy reading.
B000QUCNP4|5.0|Decipher:  A great movie, in my opinion it's one, if not the best of David Fincher and one of the best of 2007 thus far.   To have all that info and put it all together in a way to not just keep the viewers attention but have us become mildly obsessed ourselves for the 2 hour and 37 minute run time that for me flew by.  At first I analyzed Zodiac a bit, when Robert Downey Jr.'s character Paul Avery let's Jake Gyllenhall's Robert Graysmith in on the fact that maybe the Zodiac wasn't responsible for all killings being linked to him, and he said to Robert you look disappointed.  I thought to myself here is a lonely divorced guy bored with his job and a serial killer is filling some sort of void and for him he sees adventure.  I abandoned that though, definitely all the crazies pretending to be the Zodiac obviously are desperate troubled people but I don't think Robert Graysmith.  In my opinion this bored divorce e saw this as a way to do something in his life, something important and make a difference, the light bulb went off for Graysmith when he again visits Downey Jr's character, which i felt was a less trippy version of Johnny Depp's character in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, and he say's to him what have you done?  The movie has great suspense and the killings are not bloody but done in an eerie effective way.  Zodiac is also witty and funny when it is supposed to be.  For example when Paul Avery (downey) gets a Halloween card via our killer everyone at the station wear buttons that say I'm not Paul Avery including him.  This is again a must see.

B000LXH0AE|5.0|Film has the power not only to entertain, but also to educate and move us.   Stranger than Fiction is just such a film - a fantasy, a metaphor and meditation about life; the film asks us to examine our own lives, and comforts us while doing so.    Will Farrell is Everyman, Emma Thompson is the Creative Process;  Maggie Gyllenhaal is Love,  Dustin Hoffman is Reality, Queen Latifah is Assistance, Tony Hale is Friend - all playing their roles to perfection.      With a thoughtful, clever script, (and excellent cameo roles by Linda Hunt and Tom Hulce), who could ask for anything more?

B000LXHK2C|3.0|The critic's may have panned it but there is much to enjoy wrapped tightly within this film.  There's warmth and humor as well as beautiful chemistry and scenery.  Crowe, while not delivering a Maximus-sized performance still delivers a charming and appealing performance.  In fact it's that charm and dedication that makes this film more than just fluff.  Crowe is one of if not our finest working actor, and his dedication to his roles make it undeniable to realize.  Even when playing a character that could come across generic and stock he breathes new life into a tired character and delivers to the audience.  And don't forget the amazing chemistry with co-star Marion Cotillard who is just amazingly beautiful and so charismatically elegant that one can't help but understand the mutual attraction despite Crowe's characters apparent arrogance.<br /><br />The film differs quite a bit from the novel of the same name as some have made mention.  Just a little inside information, Ridley Scott and Peter Mayle are friends.  The original concept for the novel was Scott's and it follows this film perfectly.  Upon writing the novel Mayle changed the entire concept.  So, Scott isn't destroying Mayle's creation, he's merely staying true to his original idea.  I personally prefer the film version over the novel, but that's my humble opinion.<br /><br />That said, the film follows Max Skinner, a stuck up British stock broker who learns of his dear Uncle Henry's death and of his sizable inheritance.  Max immediately decides to sell his Uncles villa in France but has to travel there to make the arrangements.  Standing in his way is a young beautiful American claiming to be Henry's illegitimate child.  If this proves to be true then the villa in turn would belong to her and Max could not sell.  The film follows Max as he grows as a man, realizing his stubborn and selfish ways and finds what truly makes him happy.  It's a very familiar story with really nothing new to the bag of tricks.  It plays out like many movies before it.  Max eventually changes and everything is right in the world.  He gets the beautiful French girl played by the beautifully amazing Cotillard and he finally lives for himself and not for his job.<br /><br />What makes the movie worth the price of admission is the scenery, the chemistry and the natural delivery.  The script may be plain but the way Crowe delivers his lines is brilliant.  He's amazing to watch.  The scenery, that beautiful French countryside, is a character all its own and is matched only by the beauty of its stars (Crowe and Cotillard make for a delicious couple).  The entire cast, from the stars to the supporting players like Abbie Cornish and Freddie Highmore (who plays Max in flashbacks), are all fantastic and natural.  Albert Finney is brilliant as usual and plays Uncle Henry with so much enthusiasm and charm that you fall in love with him instantly.  I personally LOVED Archie Panjabi who plays Max's assistant Gemma.  She has some of the best lines in the film and is so naturally sarcastic and witty; she's like the British Wanda Sykes.<br /><br />The film succeeds in putting a smile on your face.  That's all it really needs to do.  Is it perfect Oscar bait, no.  Is it a really good time, yes.  It's a film that shouldn't be judged to harshly.  It's nice for actors as brilliant as Crowe to do a film that's all about the audience and not all about the awards.  It shows that even when he's not gunning for the Oscar he still puts in a decent performance that connects with the audience.  He does that here.  Comedy is a hard thing to pull off, but `A Good Year' turns out to be a good laugh and a warm smile.It plays out like many movies before it.

B0002Y69NG|5.0|If you are a Sci-Fi geek, you will love these movies.  If you are a comic book geek, ditto.  If you are into Philosophy and/or Religion, ditto the ditto.  On top of all this, you get six, count them six, bonus discs.  Behind the scenes for each movie, behind the scenes of some of the CG and other whatnots, but my favorite, the disc of the Philosophy of the Matrix and the Science Behind the Matrix.<br />I shall not bore you with the synopsis of the movie, I do consider this one movie in three acts, as since you are looking at this you are familiar with the plot.  I do believe it was a wonderful idea to do what they did with the commentaries.  You can philosophize with Cornell West and Ken Wilbur, or you can sit through the critics' commentary.  Both are equally good in their own right; I personally dig the philosophising.<br />At any rate, this is well worth the purchase, regardless of whether you bought the movies individually or not.  Start with disc one and burn away a weekend enjoying that which is the MATRIX.
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|Edward Norton, Jessica Biel, Paul Giamatti, and Rufus Sewell all do yeoman's work in \\"The Illusionist,\\" a visually lush love story/thriller set in Vienna.  These four actors are the high points of a movie that is also well served by its visual style, a fun paean to the grainy silent movies of yore.  A solid movie to be sure, but not one that stays with you long after the movie is over.<br /><br />\\"The Illusionist\\" tells the love story of Eisenheim the Illusionist (Norton) and Sophie (Biel).  Eisenheim wasn't born an illusionist, of course - he was the child of the cabinet maker who made furniture for the nobility, including Sophie's family.  But kids don't understand the caste system, and the two kids become childhood sweethearts until the adults discover their secret and break them asunder - Sophie is destined to marry a great lord.<br /><br />Eisenheim departs to wander the earth, and he comes back to Vienna 15 years later as one of the most famous illusionists in Europe.  His act thrills the Viennese public, including Inspector Uhl (Giamatti, perfect as always), who is also an amateur prestidigitator.  Uhl convinces his lord, the Crown Prince (Sewell, looking shockingly like Jude Law) to attend a show.  The Crown Prince does so, and brings his (reluctant) fiance, who just happens to be Sophie.  And thus are Sophie and Eisenheim reunited, and they learn that old flames still smolder.<br /><br />What follows is a romantic struggle where Eisenheim and Sophie try to break free from the Crown Prince, who is one of those classic movie villains who insists on marrying the heroine even though she will have nothing to do with him.  Sewell plays his part well, but unfortunately the Crown Prince comes off as little more than a spoiled brat and doesn't really rise to the level of a great foil for Eisenheim.<br /><br />Another unfortunate aspect of any movie featuring magicians is that the real magicians are already working in Hollywood special effects.  So while Eisenheim's audience may be dazzled as Eisenheim makes an orange tree grow on stage, or have two butterflies carry a handkerchief, or even conjure up shades of the dead, these scenes just aren't that thrilling to the movie audience.

B000A6T1KE|1.0|This movie is a cheap-looking travesty, with low-energy performances, pointless digressions, and tedious 'action' scenes.  Witness the fact that it effectively killed the Next Gen movie franchise, and resoundingly terminated the 'odd/even' pattern of quality.  Yecch.
B000OLGCHA|4.0|This is far from the best film score I've heard, and it's not even the best Harry Potter film score (my vote there goes to Williams' Prisoner of Azkaban score, which is brilliant). Nevertheless, the score for this film provides drama where it's needed, pathos where it must be, and a nice harmonization with the film overall. Hooper also composed music for the computer game based on this film, and that is very nice, some of the best game soundtrack I've heard, in fact. He recycles Williams' music with taste and good effect, and adds his own touches that support the action of a fast-moving film.<br /><br />So, is Hooper's work the equal of Williams' in the first 3 films? No, and if I have my way, Cuaron (director) and Williams will be back together for movie 7, which seems like it was made for film. But for 6, it looks like the producers have already committed themselves to Yates and Hooper, and I wish them well.
075640407X|5.0|On many levels, the story of Kvothe is a familiar one. Gifted orphan goes off to magical school and becomes a hero. I know I've heard that plotline before. And some of the events of the book were a bit predictable as a result. But this isn't a book you read to discover what's going to happen; you read to discover *how* things will happen, and to appreciate Rothfuss' storytelling.<br /><br />As you read, you're immersed in Kvothe's world. The cultures and geography and characters and details, everything is amazingly well developed. If you're a worldbuilding junkie, you should enjoy this one.<br /><br />While the book is basically one big flashback, we do get bits of an approaching crisis in the present day. These glimpses, brief though they are, show us how much Kvothe has changed, how different he is from the young Kvothe of his own story. I wish I had seen a little more of the present, but I'm assuming I'll get more answers in the next books.<br /><br />While plot-oriented readers might complain about the pacing, I had no problem at all. If I had to point to a weakness, it would be that some of Rothfuss' antagonists feel a bit two-dimensional. Kvothe's foes at the University are nasty, petty, and often a little dim. The Chandrian are a more interesting antagonist, but we don't really see enough of them in this book for them to feel completely real yet. (Which is appropriate, since they're creatures of legend.)<br /><br />Overall, this is a very good book. The fact that it's Rothfuss' first novel is even more impressive.

B000002JR8|4.0|Far Beyond Driven (1994.), Pantera's third recognised studio album (their seventh if you count their four album releases during the 1980's which the band now totally disregards)<br /><br />Pantera's emergence as a major force in the world of heavy metal in the early 90's a very much right `in your face' affair. The band was able to breakthrough into popularity with an amazingly powerful and brutal style which got people listening without fail. Pantera's distinctive groove metal style that incorporated the heavy thrash metal of the `80's with elements of hardcore and some punk was defined to perfection on the band's second album `Vulgar Display Of Power'. The uncompromising and technically brilliant riffing of Dimebag Darrell, the screams of Phil Anselmo and the brutal rhythm section of drummer Vinnie Paul and bassist Rex were winning over more and more metalheads day by day. However, how much further could Pantera go with their ultra heavy music. In 1994, upon its release, `Far Beyond Driven' debuted at number 1 in the Billboard 200 album chart...<br /><br />...And never before had an album quite so heavy and powerful flown its way straight to the top of the charts. `Far Beyond Driven' catches Pantera exactly where their previous album `Vulgar Display Of Power' left off. It is very much the album which consolidates Pantera's definite brand of metal with pure heaviness, plenty of downtuned riffs and intense grooves. It is overall, a very strong album with plenty of great arrangements. However, this album is weaker than its two predecessors which I find are more impressive the songwriting department. It is a testament to Pantera's strength and depth as a band that this is the weakest of their first three albums yet it is still no short of excellent. As said the album backs up the innovations of `VDOP', it just occasionally lacks that extra spark on some of the albums songs meaning the album is not quite up to the 5* quality of its predecessors. Still, all of the band members are in fine form throughout the album. Dime (who from this album onward actually is referred to as Dimebag Darrel as opposed to Diamond Darrell) is masterful as always both with riffs and solos. Some of his finest riffs and melodies are on here - who can forget the main riff to `I'm Broken' or the opening melody to '25 Years'! Phil Anselmo further develops his distorted, heavy styled hardcore vocals on this album giving greater intensity to the music. The production of the album is also top notch. I've found with all of Pantera's major label releases that they've always had great production - all of the instruments and vocals sound clearly defined, energetic and crisp. As said earlier, this album was number 1 hit for the band and full credit to them for making such a level of impression. These guys achieved it without at all selling out and they always stuck to their own direction. I salute you!!<br /><br />Pantera's third serving of intense groove metal opens with `Strength Beyond Strength'. It is a high energy and low pitched opener with some express paced verse lines. The middle section is slower with a powerful grinding feel; Dime plays out some great melody lines. `Becoming' is one of my favourites off the album. An excellent opening riff with shrieking guitar notes paves the way to a bloodcurdling chorus with crunching chords. `5 Minutes Alone' is slower with some great instrumental melodies. The verses are classic Pantera with low punchy chords coupled with Phil's aggressive growls! `I'm Broken' contains one of Dime's best riffs setting up a great song. Dime often makes himself sound like two guitarists in harmony during his solo. `Good Friends And A Bottle Of Pills' is an interesting experimental track - it is a bit fillerish but still has some nice bass and drum grooves. `Hard Lines, Sunken Cheeks' is a sprawling epic with plenty of abrupt tempo changes. Theres some atmospheric moments although I feel as though the track could do to be a little shorter than its 7 minute run time.<br /><br />`Slaughtered' opens with some scratchy riffs and classic Vinnie Paul double bass kicking. An uncompromising Pantera staple. '25 Years' has a brilliant intro melody which caught my ears instantly. This long song is a moody affair with plenty of mellow riffs and grinding bass lines; an excellent track. `Shedding Skin' has some great catchy rhythms and some unusual clean guitar interludes. Phil Anselmo mixes up a good mixture of hardcore vocals with some powerful cutting whispers. `Use My Third Arm' is another good track with lyrics about the police and the law misusing force. It contains more deep riffs with some surprising dissonant chords thrown in. The band often fly into some racing sections with thrashing beats. `Throes Of Rejection' opens with a signature Dime guitar melody over pounding bass. The chorus on this one is especially floor shaking when Phil screams `REJECTION!' The band then decide to round things off with a Black Sabbath cover `Planet Caravan'. I personally love this Sabbath track and I think the band do a fantastic job with the cover.<br /><br />`Far Beyond Driven' continues Pantera's brutal metal style excellently. Although not their strongest work, this is still a great album with plenty of stellar songs I'm sure you will want to play back again and again. After keeping the aggression at full pelt with this album, the band would then go on to experiment a little and get even heavier! with their follow up `The Great Southern Trendkill', an underrated Pantera album which I would really recommend. That aside, going back to this album, `Far Beyond Driven' is further essential listening from Pantera. Like all of their other albums, I couldn't recommend this one more highly!<br /><br />R.I.P.

B000QUCNOK|2.0|I didn't even make it through the entire movie. All the noted, high caliber actors (Alan Rickman, Dustin Hoffman) couldn't save this stinker.    The acting was wonderful, but other than that, this movie was almost a complete waste of time. Not enough thrill to be a thriller but just disgusting enough to not be boring. Perfume is a mish-mash, poorly told story of a sociopath who can smell.
0618680004|5.0|The God Delusion is a must read for anyone who wonders why they believe what they believe. Richard Dawkins shows a tremendous level of knowledge of science and makes an excellent case against the faith-based notions of the creation of the universe and the origins of life on earth. He succeeds in his goal of trying to open the eyes of the millions around the world who have never been able to escape their generational childhood brainwashing by mindless, unthinking ancestors. His chapter on the Bible - how it was \\"cobbled together\\" and his expose` of some of the shocking stories contained therein - will surprise, I think, even the most dedicated Evangelist (for I suspect very few people who believe in it  really know very well what the Bible actually says).    While Dawkins is a firm believer in Charles Darwin's theories on natural selection and its explanation for the evolutionary development of complex life, he has great difficulty, in my opinion, when it comes to an explanation of the beginning of it all. But he doesn't try to fool the reader, either, about his or her obvious lack of understanding of such events that are well beyond anyone's present capacity to comprehend -- which by itself is a lot more than you can say for the True Believer.

B000QUCNP4|5.0|I bought this DVD as I like the actors, the director and the story of the Zodiac interests me. First of all I watched the only extra feature of the DVD, which are a few trailers. And guess what, the first advertisement was for the DIRECTOR'S CUT of ZODIAC! The DC apparently will be released next year and will include not only extended material but also a huge amount of special features!!! What a hoax! I could hear, feel and see the publishers laughing in my face!! I was so disappointed, that I really needed to decide if I should even watch the movie... Of course I did and I was not disappointed by the movie itself! Truly a great suspense movie, great acting, straight forward and in your face! Brilliant! But still, for releasing this DVD without any special features and without extended material, and then even putting an advertisement on the DVD for the Director's Cut should be punished with zero, nada, 0 stars!!! They should be ashamed of themselves!!

0141439688|5.0|And, who doesn't? She's my favorite author and has been for a long time. I first read this book about 7 years ago and of course fell in love with it. I re-read it for a book club next week. I very rarely read books a second time. I think this is only my 3rd time.<br /><br />It is a beautifully-written book, like all her others. In Persuasion, Anne Elliot is persuaded by a family friend to not pursue a relationship with Captain Wentworth because of his inferior place in society. Many years later, she is reacquainted with him and her love for him has not diminished. She is unsure of how he feels about her. He is now a prestigious and admired captain; his station in life completely changed from before.<br /><br />They find each other in the same social circles, but his pride and her uncertainty of his feelings prevents them from reuniting. At some point, it is believed that each of them is attached to another.<br /><br />The novel has its funny assortment of characters just like all of Austen's works. And, Austen saves the wonderful union of Anne and Captain Wentworth for the last pages, as in her other books. But, that makes it sweet as you finally read the happy ending. I actually cried as I read the touching letter he writes to Anne at the end.
B00028HBKM|5.0|This movie is simply a masterpiece. Everything about it is done to perfection. How the story unfolds; the beautiful cinematography; the wonderful acting displayed on screen, all equal sheer perfection.     Mel Gibson is to be honored for pulling off such an amazingly powerful and touching film basically all on his own. The hateful attacks that Gibson has had to endour, even to this day, because he dared to make this shining light among a sea of garbage, that is Hollywood, is a tragedy. The fact also, that this film was not recognized as the superb piece of art that it is by various award groups is also travesty. Frankly, it is understandable that Gibson may be bitter at some groups of people who were the biggest critics of his film for translating the Chistian Gospels for the screen.     Everything about this movie is powerful and moving and if it doesn't have an impact or an effect on you then your soul must be dead. A magnificent achievement by Mel Gibson a true visionary and hero of our time. Bravo!

014100018X|5.0|Exquisite writing and wonderful characters made this  book by Joanne Harris her best. I've read other novels  by Harris (\\"Five Quarter of the Orange\\" was good, and  I actually did not care for \\"Holy Fools\\") but did not  read this one since I saw the movie. Of course, I  should have known it was even better than the movie,  as the books usually are superior.    I finally got around to reading \\"Chocolat\\" because I  heard she had a sequel coming out. \\"Chocolat\\" made me  drool. Not only for the precise details about the  chocolate making process (Oh, how I would have loved  to have seen that Easter window!), but for the lyrical  writing and mesmerizing story and characters. Her  descriptions of the small French village  Lansquenet-sous-Tannes, the remodeling of the bakery  into a chocolate haven, and the personalities of the  initially aloof French villagers are detailed. I could  see the town and knew its inhabitants.      The story is told through two different view points,  the proprietor of the chocolate shop, Vianne Rocher,  who opens her establishment as Lent begins, and  Francis Reynaud, the priest of the parish. And  different view points they are as Reynaud initially  tries to woo Vianne and her daughter, Anouk, into  church, and Vianne stays firmly away. This sets up a  battle of wills and morality issues which pervade the  novel since each has a very different approach to  integrity.  Reynaud attempts to turn the villagers against Vianne  and her daughter, and Vianne's warmth and tempting  chocolate shop lure them into her sphere.     Beautifully drawn characters become very real. My  favorites were Guillaume, one of Vianne's first  friends and customers, with his failing dog, Charly;  and the rebellious outspoken 80-year-old, Armande  Voizin, who plans her own birthday party and disagrees  with most everything her uppity, self righteous  daughter, Caroline Clairmont represents. There are so  many delectable characters (Josephine, Roux, Armande's  shy grandson) that I would take up too much space talking  about them.    The story is an addictive treat, just like the  chocolate described. I couldn't put it down and was  constantly delighted by the imagery. There's magic and  romance in contrast to the darkness of the tale.  Perhaps this is her best because Harris writes about  what she knows best, having been brought up by a  chocolate maker and a great grandmother who was known  as a witch. I cannot wait to read the sequel, \\"The  Lollipop Shoes.\\"
1596912855|5.0|Jane, the main character, is like so many of us, some more admitting than others. We all have a small, meaningless crush on Mr. Darcy from Pride and Prejudice. Well, Colin Firth to be exact. For Jane, it was more of an obsession. Her relationships don't measure up to her expectations. None of her boyfriends can be Mr. Darcy, so she lives a bit in a fantasy land.<br /><br />A rich aunt leaves her an inheritance -- a vacation to England to live in Austenland, a resort that mirrors Jane Austen times. She wears period clothes and mingles with other guests and actors. They go on long walks, play cards, call on each other. By going along with the vacation, she hopes to rid herself once and for all of the Mr. Darcy obsession so she can go on to live in the real world.<br /><br />Along the way, she finds love. I really enjoyed the pretend scenes where they talked about matters and acted as you would in Jane Austen times. The characters were colorful and interesting. You find yourself relating to Jane.<br /><br />Best of all, it was a very clean book. No foul language at all. I highly recommend this book. It is such a fun read.

I loved their music, which amazingly seems to get better with each album.  Boxer continues this trend.      There are plent of comments above about the music, so I would like to comment on the lyrics, which I think demonstrate a far greater maturity than what one typically hears on the radio.  There's a focus on the mundane of everyday life and frequent poetic abstract imagery that makes it very fun to sing along.

0099439972|3.0|I found all the internal politics and workings of the Senate and such to be a little slow and boring at times, but it was interesting to see the formative steps leading up to what would be Valorum's Downfall in Attack of the Clones and what lead to the blockade of trade with Naboo in the Phantom Menace.    Sidious's machinations are the undercurrent of the entire book, even though he's really not the soul focus, but it's how he sets the wheels in motions and everyone's reactions to his plans, once set in motion, that is really what the book is about.    It was also nice to see Qui Gon have a good portion of pages dedicated to him as well in this book.  A really great character that, like darth maul, wasn't fully realized in the films.    As i said, I found the politics at times to be a little slow which brought the book down a little bit for me.  But overall, a solid Star Wars read.

B00005JP5P|2.0|While Sunshine has a generally great cast and excellent looking sets and effects, the plot is so unoriginal - it was frustrating with its overused plot contrivances and characters who suffer from the \\"stupids\\" (you know, a character that enters the dark haunted house when they shouldn't, or in the case, enters the brightly lit room without closing the shades).  You've seen this movie before and I would have thought Danny Boyle would have come with something new.  Just check the descriptions to this other films and you'll know exactly where Sunshine cribbed from.    Alien (1979) - When commercial vehicle Nostromo intercepts an SOS signal the multinational crew investigates. After a bad landing on the planet they discover a colony unknown creatures.  The crew does know the danger they are in until it is too late.    Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) - A horribly disfigured burn victim stalked the remaining cast member.  In spite of his injures, he can move with superhuman speed but is also so silent his next victim does not hear him until he's right be hind them.    Event Horizon (1997) In this film a multinational crew investigates the spaceship Event Horizon, that disappeared seven years earlier.  They finds it dead and deserted.  It turns out that the ship is really a space-age haunted house.    Supernova (2000) - Responding to a distress beckon, the multinational space crew responds with a near fatal, hyperspace jump.

B000FIHJLK|4.0|This show is, for the most part, really energetic and really great. Comparing this to the Dusseldorf 1976 recording, these are the main differences I can hear:    1) Kill the King is WAY more aggressive here. Faster, louder, heavier, and Dio's vocals sound better.  2) Ritchie's soloing is more inspired here. Mistreated benefits greatly from this, and even his diddling around before 16th Century Greensleeves and Catch the Rainbow gets the audience clapping along.  3) Catch the Rainbow is a little too up-and-down, though this may be partially because it's 17 and a half minutes. After the verses are out of the way, the band seems to go through cycles of catching fire and really sounding great for a few minutes and then suddenly sounding lost for a bit.  4) Long Live Rock 'n' Roll has replaced Stargazer. Don't get me wrong, it sounds great and Dio really gets the crowd into it, but still...would it have killed them to have put Stargazer in and trimmed down Still I'm Sad (which goes over 25 minutes) and/or the encore of Do You Close Your Eyes (almost 10 minutes)?  5) Still I'm Sad suffers from the same affliction that Catch the Rainbow does: it's a bit too long for its own good. Again, the band wanders in some places. Cozy's 1812 Overture drum solo is excellent.    I also own the Munich DVD and there are a few things to note. First, Dio's chatter with the audience is almost completely edited out, as is the introductory clip from \\"Wizard of Oz\\" with the \\"over the rainbow...\\" thing. Personally, I like to hear that kind of stuff. Maybe it wasn't feasible to have that and still keep the show in proper running order on 2 CDs. Whatever. Also, when Dio comes in very faintly on Do You Close Your Eyes (I think it's the first verse), it's not because the mic cuts out. It's because he sings into Bob Daisley's mic instead of his! Watch on the DVD and you'll see him with a \\"what the hell?\\" look before he realizes what's going on and gets his mic back.    All in all, this is a good release that no Dio or Rainbow fan should be without...and if you're a Deep Purple fan with no exposure to Rainbow, you should check it out as well.

With Hamid Karsai and the U.S. occupation after 9/11.<br /><br />The shame of a culture that subjugates women, girls. Denies them schooling, freedom. As young children, selling or giving them away in marriage, against their will, to much older men. Imprisoning them in the house, in the total covering, except for a mesh at the eyes, of the burqa.

1843532727|2.0|I cannot recommend this as a good travel guide to Japan, especially for independent travelers, as the book is not helpful with daily planning and navigation. I used it for a 25-day independent tour of Japan and found it so frustrating that I tossed it in the trash before I came home instead of keeping it to proudly display on my bookshelf with my other travel books. The maps are a complete waste of space: many streets are not labeled and the maps often do not appear near the narrative discussing the area, so you have to page back and forth. Maps for specific sightseeing areas such as Arashiyama in Kyoto are not included (where I really could have used a map and I noticed that Lonely Planet provided one), and the maps that are provided contain various errors. One of the main maps of the entire country has the locations of Osaka and Nara switched - an inaccusable error and one that leads me to believe that the book was not well edited. There are also various errors of omission. Fushimi Inari is not discussed in the Kyoto section, which I found strange, as it's one of Kyoto's most photographed and fascinating sites, it's easy to get to, and it's free. I rarely used the recommendations for places to eat as I found they were often not applicable for budget travelers and unrepresentative of local tastes and habits. For example, usually for every city one curry or Indian food place and an Anglo-style pub is recommended. I would rather the author's individual preferences not be so obvious and more precious space be spent on recommendations for what locals typically eat and enjoy. Similarly, the nightlife and cafe recommendations really miss the mark and are out of touch with Japan's more modern, hip, and youthful scenes. Too many run-of-the-mill gaijin haunts are suggested. I found the best places on my own. Honestly, overall the whole book seems geared towards travelers over 40. I did enjoy one of the sections in the back that summarizes Japan's religious life and historyand explains well what you see at shrines and temples, but incidentally, this section was not written by one of the book's main authors or contributors. This book might be OK if you are traveling with a group tour or staying with friends for most of the time and just want some supplemental information, but if you are traveling independently and relying on a guide book to get you around and show you the modern as well traditional heart of a place, I believe you are much better off with Lonely Planet.

0440238609|1.0|Parents beware!  The evil in this story is God!  I read the first book of this trilogy and enjoyed the fantasy aspects of it, although it seemed rather dark to be a children's book.  I became attached to Lyra, the protagonist in the story, and was anxious for her to continue her struggle with evil in the second book.  I was horrified, however, when I realized part way through the second book, that the characters Lyra had been fighting against, and I had been rooting against were God, His Angels, and His followers. Also, I am extremely concerned about children reading a series of books in which the main messages are....If it feels good, do it, and rules are wrong!  Cleverly, Pullman does not make the reader aware of these things until the reader is emotionally invested in the series.  With the movie, The Golden Compass, soon to be released, I fear that both children and adults will flock to read this series.  I enjoy all genres of literature and was a big proponent of series such as Harry Potter and the Chronicles of Narnia.  These books are not in the same league. They are filled with blasphemy, and I have to wonder and Pullman's point in writing them. I wish I could rate this series a zero!
B000RO9PXC|5.0|i've heard some of this cd.   live shows, come out rough sometimes and other times sounds like a cd.    i saw the doors in 1967 at uc irvine for $3.50.    they were great!
B00007KWHG|5.0|There is nothing in this world like the range of Frankie Valli's voice and this CD captures that range.  Known for his 3 octaves of precision, I am constantly amazed at how he hits those high notes.  The CD is a compilation of all his greatest hits that will keep you singing for hours and hours...but don't ever expect to hit those notes like Frankie does!
B000O1799U|5.0|Reading some of the reviews, I don't understand how anyone could give this movie a bad one.  It is very loosely based on the story of Florence Ballard and the Supremes.  Beyonce is not particularly believable as Diana Ross, but her voice is wonderful - clear and strong.  Jennifer Hudson steals the show as the downtrodden Effie (Florence Ballard).  I've never been a big Eddie Murphy fan, but his talent really shines here as does Jamie Foxx.  The movie is pretty much entirely singing and dancing so if you are not into musicals, you will not enjoy this movie.  If you are into musicals I recommend it strongly.  When the movie was first released in the theater, I had no desire to see it and thought it was all hype.  After hearing all the raves, I did buy the dvd and now wish that I had seen it in the theater.  Well worth your time and money.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|I want to preface this review by saying this:  I envy each and every person that will forever be able to pick up this set and experience the magic, whimsy, and zanyness of the Gilmore Girls fresh and anew for the first time.    `Gilmore Girls' which ran from 2001-2007 on the WB and CW networks is a show that is simply about a mother and daughter.  But it goes so much further than that.  This particular mother/daughter combo are best friends and separated in age by a mere 16 years.  Yet, more than the interactions between Lorelai and her daughter Rory, typically the zany towns-people are the characters that steal the show.  Their incredibly charm, matched with `the Gilmore Girls' wit, all set within the picture-perfect New England town of Stars Hollow, makes \\"Gilmore Girls\\" seem almost like a story book fantasy.    The series begins with Lorelai reluctantly starting to rebuild her relationship with her waspy high-society parents, after they agree to fund Rory's private school education.  Throughout the seven seasons the audience watches as Lorelai relationship with her parents start to blossom, as well as the bond that forever strengthens between her and her own daughter, Rory.  Lorelai was raised as a princess, but always hated her parents for the rules that society put upon her - hence why she ran away from home when she was 16 and pregnant.  Throughout the years as well, the audience watches as Rory grows from an innocent and naïve 15-year-old girl, into a mature and seasoned 22-year-old college graduate.    It's impossible to put into words just how magical this show really is.  And it is not the perpetual `chick-flick' that many write-it off as.  It is infact probably one of the smartest and best written television shows to grace the small-screen in recent years.  One would need several PH D.s in Popular Culture to get even 80% of the refrences that these girls throw around.  And beyond that the performances of the actors makes this show something special.  And, although the show started as a drama, the humor was always present and by the middle of season one the glimpses of the great comedy to come started to make themselves known.    My review my sound like a very proud grand-parent raving about their grandchild, but that shows the love I have for this magical series.  I watched from the very first episode at 14 years-old with my best friend until the series finale in my apartment during my sophomore year of college (with the same friend by my side, traveling 700 miles so we could watch it together).  I have loved every moment, and will buy this set in a heartbeat.    This DVD set includes all 153 episodes on 42 DVDs in their original full-frame broadcast video with Dolby Surround Sound.  Special Features include a \\"Welcome to the Gilmore Girls\\" documentary, deleted scenes from select episodes, pop-culture montages, a `gilmoreism' book, commentary on \\"I Jump, you Jump Jack\\" by series creators Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino, as well as several `behind-the-scenes' featurettes.
B0001HLVS2|2.0|First, are we supposed to be fooled that Russell Crowe's Australian accent was British?  The only reason I'm giving this film two stars instead of one was because of the art direction and costumes.  As for the rest, I've seen better on the History Channel.  Lucky Jack's obsession parallels, Captain Ahab from Moby Dick, but less interesting.  I wanted to like this film, but it just didn't engage me.  Surprising enough, it probably would've been a pretty good book.  Nah.  Overall: watch at your own risk.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|In the Fall of 1994, ABC premiered what Entertainment Weekly would eventual hail as \\"the greatest cancelled television series of all time.\\"  Airing for a total of 19-episodes, with the final installment airing February of 1995, \\"My So Called Life\\" not only jump-started the careers of Claire Danes and Jared Leto, but garnered young Danes a Golden Globe for her performance (she was the youngest actress to receive the honor).  Years after the show was cancelled ABC regretting their decision by trying to make lightening strike twice by producing similar series, yet ultimately known of them would garner the acclaim or magic of MSCL.  Eventually TV Guide would call the series \\"the sixth best cult show of all time.\\"     The premise of the show is simple enough, but yet complex enough to make it unique.  Premiering in 1994, right at the emergence of the teen-soap genre MSCL was a breath of fresh-air.  Unlike \\"Beverly Hills 90210\\" and latter \\"Dawson's Creek,\\" this series was grounded in reality.  Instead of glorifying every teenage rite-of-passage for film, the series seems to gloss over these moments in favor of the emotional outburst they produce: much like real life.  Many people don't remembers every detail or their prom, first kiss, and first independent car ride? Yet they remember exactly how they felt, and MSCL capitalized on these moments.    The show follows 14-year-old Angela as she tries to ultimately survive not only her freshman year of high school, but the highs (and lows) or first love, as well as becoming her own independent self - separated from the person she tried to be for other people in Middle School.  High School is a turbulent time for anyone from the Jocks to the Brains to the Leadership to the Outsiders.  Everyone has their ups and downs, just like Angela.  But she makes it harder on herself, and yet easier by befriending two outsiders, when she had always been part of the `in-crowd.'  The audience follows Angela's transition from quiet wall-flowerto her beginning to emerge from her cocoon sometime towards the end of her first year of high school.    While on the outside the show may seems like another \\"90210\\"/\\"The OC\\" teen-soap, but it really isn't. This is a rich, emotional, and movie relationship-drama that once it gets your hooks into you, you cannot stop watching. Unlike most shows of its genre its realistic and each of the major characters represents a person you probably knew in high school. Yet, they probably weren't the most popular kids.  They were the kids you were friends with, hung out with, the ones you actually knew.  It is a downright disgrace that ABC only allowed this series 19 episodes.  More than almost any other show I've ever watched I would have loved to watch these character bloom into full-grown adults through their high school (and possibly college years).    But what we are ultimately are given is just this one 8-month snap-shot into these characters lives.  But this could ultimately make this show the masterpiece that it really is.  There was no room for it go downhill, no room for error.  And forever it will be remembered.  It has been years since my sister and I sat up all night long one weekend watching horrible copies of these episodes on VHS, and I cannot wait for Halloween, when I will finally have a chance to watch them on DVD, almost anew.    This incredibly comprehensive box set includes all 19 episodes uncut (in their ORIGINAL full-screen presentation) on 6 discs.  The special features so far include:  Interviews with Edward Zwick/Marshall Herskovitz/Winnie Holzman (creator/producers), Todd Holland/Jason Katism/Scott Winant (Directors), Wilson Cruz/Paul Dooley/Devon Gummersall (cast); Audio Commentaries on \\"the pilot,\\" \\"Life of Brian,\\"  \\"So-Called Angels,\\" as well as additional episodes; Deleted Scenes; Promos' Book with tridutes from Joss Whedon, Winnie Holzman, and Janeane Garofalo; and more.
B00005JPD0|4.0|You can't tell me that Hollywood screenwriters aren't stealing from each other.  D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu, Lake House, Premonition and the television show Daybreak all hit the public about the same time.  At least D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu tried to explain how this phenomenon is possible.  Sandra Bullock's Lake House and Premonition didn't bother.  But we all know it's inhumane to keep beating a dead horse.  Denzel Washington continues to have an amazing presence on film.  And after playing so many cops and bodyguards that is an amazing feat.  The only creepy side to Doug's Carlin's investigation is his almost stalker like inclination to Claire.  I do have to agree the actress playing Claire looks a lot like Halle Berry.  Overall: this is an entertaining film and it is worth your time checking out.
B000QFAJ7S|4.0|(3 1/2 *'s) There's good news and bad news for Kelly Clarkson's new CD.  Romantically, there's almost nothing but bad news, reflecting on loss with glimmers of hope.  Musically, there isn't quite the variety or the immediacy of `Breakaway,' her breakthrough second album.   However, `My December,' does mix and master slow songs and  progressive numbers with a decisively delivered punch.  Drawing from power pop from her previous  efforts, she manages to garner extra texture, especially with the supple efforts of her supporting band.  Lyrically, she co-writes every song.  Needless to say, we all root for \\"Miss Independent\\" and her continuing grasp at the helm.  Truly her words are undeniably and ably delivered.  Yet, while it's great to get it straight from her hip and heart, the results are a mixed blessing.  Some of the fluidness doesn't match her predecessors, which isn't to say there aren't plenty of memorable moments this outing.   Indeed, there's much to recommend for her `...December'.      She begins with promise on her opener, \\"Never Again\\" showcasing the progressive alternative leanings she drew from songs like \\"Since U Been Gone\\" and \\"Behind These Hazel Eyes\\".   \\"I hope the ring you gave to her turns her finger green,\\" she bluntly sings.  If we ever doubted her genuineness, then we never will again.  A great departure from \\"A Moment Like This,\\" Kelly will only do songs her own way and for all the great musicianship and powerful singing voice, she refuses to be cheerful for our edification.  The mourning continues with the catchy and edgy \\"One Minute\\" and the propulsive, yet heavy \\"Hole\\".  \\"Sober\\" shuffles the deck with an acoustically textured effort that builds more tension than first meets the ear.  \\"Don't Waste Your Time\\" is pop perfect expertly elaborating the lines drawn for \\"Beautiful Disaster\\".       Following that effort is \\"Judas,\\" arguably the album's best.  With complexity that is matched by smoothly integrated lyrics, Kelly and company really shine.  Honorable mention should be reserved for \\"Hole\\" offering an edgy, fast forward appeal.   \\"How I Feel\\" slips back to polished pop with  New Wave resonance and one of the albums best lines, describing \\"him\\" as having \\"...trophy wives with little black books\\".  However, \\"Yeah\\" extends variety with the funky feel of \\"Walk Away\\" without as satisfying results.  \\"Maybe\\" is heartfelt, if not meandering, offering the telling confession, \\"I'm as confusing as hell.\\"  Continuing, \\"Can I Have a Kiss?\\" stumbles and lingers as much as the title suggests.  \\"Irvine\\" ends the album by giving her heartache a(n) (undoubtedly fictional) name.  Clocking in at 8:47, she manages to give us two fine songs.  The first rendition is a sweet and spare torch song, reminiscent of Peggy Lee.  The second half is soft, yet playful, ending with Clarkson laughing.  (As in she's the one to get the last one in.)      `My December' is uncompromising.  Kelly left the tryouts a long time ago, and now will only seek a continued career on her own terms.  While the lyrics occasionally lack the fluidity of previous efforts, you get the unvarnished Kelly who comes off as the soul survivor for the mo(u)rning after.  Nevertheless, on this effort she comes off as much more than simply surviving.
0385522401|4.0|The New York Times Book Review in reviewing \\"Saturday\\" described McEwan as a \\"master clockmaster,\\" a phrase I feel that should have been reserved for this, his 13th book. In many ways, McEwan has reached a point in his literary development that sees him as a true master of the English language that now must find ways with which to push and expand his writing, and to a certain extent, modern day reading so as to take \\"literature\\" and \\"literary fiction\\" in new directions. I think anyone reading a journal or newspaper will see constant references to this man and with good reason - he is easily one of the most gifted writers of this generation. With \\"Saturday\\" we saw him look at a single day in the life of a neurosurgeon, but as solid a work as that was, it isn't until the single day in the lives of Edward and Florence that he successfully bridges what Woolf did with \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" and modern audiences. He takes the wedding day, or more precisely, the hours following Edward and Florence's wedding and somehow spins a wonderful and operatic tale that builds to a climax, so to speak - the consummation of their marriage. The year is 1962 and for the past year these two characters have fallen in love with one another, but although their emotional love grows with each passing day, Florence's repulsion of physical and sexual contact keeps them just out of reach. The wedding, which was supposed to finally bring their physical relationship on par with their emotional one, marks the driving point of the book. McEwan, in what amounts more to a novella than a novel, somehow crams in a lifetime of events for these two characters - their childhoods, how they came to find one another, their wedding, and what follows. There is such a steady and almost infuriatingly beautiful pace to the language that the hours that McEwan focuses upon and then departs from so as to give us greater detail into Edward and Florence's lives blend into one without you being distracted or losing track of where you are in the story. The writing is on par with Woolf and eary Joyce and I find myself already eagerly anticipating his next novel. This is simply a marvelous read that can be read and reread countless times.
B000RJO578|5.0|Doreen and I recently saw this during a cosy night-in with a couple of rented DVDs and a generous plateful of Findus Cripsy Pancakes. Of the two, 'Gandhi' was a more polished production and on a far more expansively ambitious scale. Neither Simon Pegg nor Nick Frost puts in a performance that could honestly be compared to the powerfully moving work of Ben Kingsley. Also, despite its age, I felt that 'Gandhi' has a far deepeer and more relevant message to convey to a contemporary audience. That said, 'Gandhi' is rather short on laughs, so 'Hot Fuzz' just about has the edge.
B000MTDRKE|5.0|Hi,    Great CD. Quite progressive  overall (not in a metal sense because there are many styles in the CD, but more in a classic progressive way... long songs, complex music structures, complex rythms, changes, then repeating again a melody that you heard 15 minutes before... well, you know...), so maybe it is not for everybody's tastes (my wife couldn't stand it!) but for me, this is one of the best releases in the last years. Awesome vocal and instrumental parts, with melodies! And, probably, the most beautiful guitar solo in recent times by Paul Gilbert in \\"The Door\\"... yes, you have to wait 27 minutes for the solo... but the rest of the song is great too!    If you can stand a 30 minutes song, then this is definitively a CD for you. Neal Morse has an immense creativity.    Regards,  Fran

6305910340|4.0|I was happy to see this movie released on DVD so I could add it to my collection.  SFBF is an endearing tale, based on a true story, of the discovery of a chess prodigy (who was otherwise a very normal kid) and his learning about the harsh realities of competition.  Joe Mantegna does his usual excellent acting job, lending a particular humor and humanity to the role of the father, but the young actor they sourced for the role, Max Pomeranc, is an acting prodigy.  He's a cute kid, no doubt, but he evinces a certain pathos not normally seen in children his age.  He steps into the role very well.  Primarily a drama/slice of life movie, there are some excellent bits of comedy throughout as well.  The chess scenes are done quite well so you don't get bogged down in it, and even if you've never heard of chess you won't be lost in this movie.  Released in 1993, you'll recognize a lot of other folks in earlier roles (I'd forgotten Laura Linney was in it).  My only complaint is the \\"reality\\" of some profanity, but you can't escape that it seems, but be forewarned if you're showing it to your own kids who are Max's age in the movie.

B000OVLBEO|4.0|When director Mark Steven Johnson was lucky enough to be tapped to helm Fox's big screen adaptation of \\"Daredevil\\" he turned out to be an absolute perfect fit for the genre. Not only was he a fan of the comic, but he wanted to go against the Hollywood grain, and stay as true to the source material as possible. A move that was bold, but had proven successful several times over (\\"Spiderman\\", \\"Batman\\", and \\"Superman\\" are good examples), and the choice proved to work out well for \\"Daredevil\\" as well, resulting in big box office numbers and DVD sales. So, after achieving success with his first comic book adaptation, Mark moved on to a character even more obscure than Daredevil, and since he'd proven himself with great success previously, Sony gave him the OK to both write and direct what he hoped would be Marvel's next big franchise, \\"Ghost Rider\\" starring Nicolas Cage and Eva Mendes.    \\"Ghost Rider\\" is the origin story of Marvel's self-proclaimed 'Spirit of Vengeance'. After having sold his soul to the demon Mephistopholes (Peter Fonda) to save his father, Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) must become the Ghost Rider, a bounty hunter whose purpose is to send escaped demons back to Hell. As if being a demon hunter wasn't enough to deal with, Johnny is trying to rekindle a relationship with an old girlfriend (Eva Mendes), while trying to gain control over the entity within him. Now, a demon named Blackheart (Wes Bentley) along with his minions, have come to Earth in search of a group of evil souls that was hidden by a previous Ghost Rider many years ago, Mephistopholes summons the Ghost Rider to stop Blackheart before he gains control of the souls and destroys the Earth.     \\"Ghost Rider\\" was one of those movies where I wasn't sure how it was going to fare at the box office. I had hope that it would do well, but I was aware of the fact that the character was not one of Marvel's most popular or well-known, unlike Spiderman and X-Men, but then again Daredevil wasn't known of toomuch outside of the comic book medium. The biggest advantages that this movie had going for it was the fact that Nicolas Cage (\\"Con Air\\") was attached as the lead star, so fans of his work would surely turn out, Eva Mendes (\\"Hitch\\") is popular with guys so that would put some more butts in the seats, and the director had achieved commercial success with his previous effort \\"Daredevil\\" so he had garnered some faith amongst comic book fans. With these advantages \\"Ghost Rider\\" had a decent chance of holding its own at the box office and possibly spawning a future film franchise. But did it deliver the goods, or was it a film that should have remained in development hell where it had stayed for so many years.    I personally enjoyed \\"Ghost Rider\\", even though most critics hated it, I felt that it was a very faithful comic book adaptation, and a rather difficult one at that, since the history of the character has been tweaked over and over throughout the years at Marvel. Director/writer Mark Steven Johnson did a very good job of taking all the various histories of the character, finding the common themes among them and weaving them together to make a cohesive story that was full of terrific special effects, fights, drama, and even some comedy. He proved himself a very capable director for the genre with \\"Daredevil\\", and even though this movie isn't as dramatic as his previous effort, it was every bit as engaging and taking a character that is relatively obscure in the mainstream and making him popular is a tremendous achievement and one that both he and Marvel can be proud of.    The actors did very well with their characters, for the most part. Nicolas Cage was an excellent choice for Johnny Blaze, Cage's quirkiness as an actor made him ideal for such a far-fetched role. Eva Mendes was solid as the love interest, early on I thought her performance seemed a little off, but she rallied after her first couple scenes and made the character hers. Sam Elliott was great as Caretaker, his scenes with Nic Cage were used mostly for exposition, but he managed to make them fun, and actually stole the scenes away from Cage every time. Peter Fonda, though not in the movie a whole lot, appeared to be enjoying his role as Mephistopholes, imbuing every line with a hint of malice, and delivering a more restrained performance than most actors when playing a role like his. Which brings me to the weakest member of the cast, Wes Bentley. Wes played the role of Blackheart so over-the-top that he seemed almost goofy in places rather than scary, near the end of the movie he finally scaled back his performance and began to deliver his lines with much more realism and finally fulfilled the villainous role he was in. For the most part if the special effects team hadn't done some tweaking to his facial features and the sound team wouldn't have manipulated his voice, Wes wouldn't have been very effective as the villain, but their work saved his early scenes in the movie, giving his performance a little more balance, but not much.    However, with all the great performances, and even the weak one by Wes Bentley, \\"Ghost Rider\\" wouldn't have amounted to anything if it weren't for the outstanding special effects work that brought ol' flamehead to life. The special effects team worked hard to get the digital fire to look realistic, which is not an easy task given how random fire acts, and many times CGI created fire can be easily spotted when compared to real flames. But this time was different, the effects team not only made the fire realistic, but also managed to convey emotions using the flames, by playing with shadows on the skull of Ghost Rider, and also giving the flame a blue hue when he was calming down (a decision that is not actually scientifically accurate, a flame actually turns blue as it gets hotter not as it cools). The Hell Cycle also featured some CGI enhancements, specifically the flaming wheels. In the comics, the wheels were pure flame, but forthe movie the decision was made to have actual wheels be engulfed in flames to lend more weight to the motorcycle on screen. The effects for all the demons that Ghost Rider must fight and all the powers he uses to dispose of them were all excellently rendered and are truly top-notch in the field of CGI. The best looking effect sequence was the ride across the desert with Ghost Rider and his predecessor riding side by side, that scene alone is a prime example of how high the quality of the CGI was in this film.    Assisting the special effects wizards were the sound technicians who were tasked with the difficult job of creating sounds that could be passed off as being supernaturally created. In this task the techs succeeded brilliantly, the sounds were all very well crafted, all of the enhanced voices were very cool, most were only subtle enhancements (for Mephistopholes and Blackheart), but Ghost Rider's was by far the best vocal enhancement and the most involved. Every line Nicolas Cage spoke for Ghost Rider was enhanced through several filters to achieve the perfect sound that was described as being a 'deep, demonic, mechanical lion's roar' mixed with his voice.    As a side note, there are two versions of \\"Ghost Rider\\" available, the theatrical release and the extended cut. Both versions of the film are very good, but I would have to say the extended cut is the better version to watch, with approximately 20 minutes of footage inserted back into the film. This version of the movie contains much more depth, featuring several scenes that explain a few plotlines a little more, and just serves to flesh the story out a little better, making for a much more fulfilling movie experience.    All in all, \\"Ghost Rider\\" is a solid comic book adaptation, that stays true to its roots, delivering an entertaining ride that doesn't disappoint.    \\"Ghost Rider\\" is rated PG-13 (for both theatrical and extended cuts) and contains violence and language.

B00023B1LC|4.0|It is first of all an action film in which the whole action goes wrong because the agent did not do what he was supposed to do, he did not kill his target and he got shot at and he lost his memory. The story is unluckily not entirely clear. He forgot his identity. Fine. He did not forget his physical training. Fine because that kind of training has been ingrained so deeply that it has become an instinct of sorts. But how did he remember he had a bank account in Zurich and the number of the bank account, and what's more why did not the CIA close the account since the operation  had failed and the agent was supposed to be dead? This leads to more questions, but that is not really important for the action, though we like it absolutely clean. The message however is not altered at all. The CIA is able to train agents that have become plain robots and that can only succeed blindly in their mission or die or kill themselves if the first two options do not go through. These killing robots are in the hands of bureaucrats who are mostly incompetent and these bureaucrats are in the hands of  politicians who are first and foremost rotten liars. The objective is simple: control the world with puppets who can be anything, democratic tyrants or tyrannical democrats, no matter which or their reverses, provided they serve well, otherwise they die and the human killing robots get into the picture. When this film came out the US were starting to get engaged in the war on terrorism. The picture of this CIA is pretty terroristic to me. We know now, several years later that it was not that competent in gathering information, though it did gather some, but we also know that the politicians who used the information they got were pretty liars and making the incomplete information they got say whatever they wanted it to say. Is that very democratic? At the end of the film, when the politician is engaged in some new lie to the Senate, we are just relieved because the killing robot agent, Jason Bourne, has finally gotten out of it and has been able to trace the girl he dragged into the adventure unaware of what he was really dragging her into. But the story cannot be finished because the CIA cannot let him live just like that out of the goodness of their heart, for one simple reason: they do not have a heart. In other words, the cold war is maybe finished, but the terroristic spying agencies, politically correctly named intelligence agencies, are still thriving and well. We have not yet reached the country of perfect transparency and total democracy. And we pretend to give lessons to the barbarians who are not part of our club!<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonnen Bourne, has finally gotten out of it and has been able to trace the girl he dragged into the adventure unaware of what he was really dragging her into.

B000QUCNP4|5.0|Last time director David Fincher did a film about a serial killer, he made what's right in my top 5 favorite films ever with Seven. But instead of revisiting the genre with the same approach, Zodiac takes on a different mood as well as a more serious approach. Whereas films like Panic Room and Fight Club had visual trickery and cameras going into flashbulb filaments, Zodiac is more restrained, more depth-filled and in the end better because of it. It's just too bad he's not as prolific since he hasn't made a single bad film ever and Zodiac is just another great entry into an impressive career.    Taking place during the late 1960's and the bulk of the 70's, the film follows real-life San Francisco Chronicle cartoonist Robert Graysmith, fellow employee and friend Paul Avery and cops Dave Toschi and Bill Armstrong track down the mysterious and elusive Zodiac Killer, responsible for several murders. But Zodiac is different in that he actually writes letters to newspaper offices and leaves clues and strange symbols meant to be decoded. But trying to find out the identity, as well as determine the pattern is proving frustrating as Graysmith, Avery and Toschi find themselves more and more obsessed with figuring out who is the Zodiac.    With Seven, we followed 2 detectives who were always one step behind the killer but in the game long enough to know and decipher the clues so it became more cat-and-mouse. Zodiac on the other hand is more procedural and that it's more about that frustration when things aren't happening quick enough and the answers are nowhere to be found, let alone can be figured out. One might not like the shift though since at a certain point we see less murder scenes and less Zodiac appearances and it becomes more about the obsession that takes over, particularly strong with Graysmith. But it's often been said that the mark of a great director is when he's given a bad script or premise and makes it a good movie. Fincher, who in my opinion hasn't even made a dud yet (and yes I'm including Alien3 with this) has already proven himself but here he takes the idea of a serial killer movie, one of the most formulaic genres there is next to horror and romantic comedies and makes it fascinating the entire way through.    But a film is also in the hands of the actors and thankfully we have 3 great leads with all 3 of them being incredibly nuanced and strong in their performances. We also get cameos from John Carroll Lynch (the guy who get melted in Volcano, Frances McDormand's husband in Fargo) as Arthur Allen Leigh, Clea Duvall and Charles Fleischer, a.k.a the voice of Roger Rabbit, who has probably the creepiest scene in the entire film. One thing I should address as well is its length. No it's not near 3 hours since people exaggerate and assume many people don't hit the stop button when the credits roll. It's 2 and a half hours long but thanks to Fincher it never feels like it. But when it comes to long running times, there's 2 trains of thought: it's either too long for its own good and it's almost an indulgent length (the recent King Kong, the Holiday) and there's this film where it's long because it needs to be since there's so much story that needs telling.     The DVD's (besides the Game which STILL doesn't have a region 1 special edition) from David Fincher have always been stellar from informative commentaries to behind the scenes footage. So the double dip that will happen is all the more disappointing. Did they not get things done in time? Make more money by making you buy the completely bare-bones edition and the special edition next year? You wish there was at least something on this but save your money unless you absolutely have to have this.    Too bad it didn't make a huge dent at the box office but that's beside the point. Audiences know a good movie when they see it whether DVD or theatre and Zodiac is just as good a movie as people say it is and even a bit more.
B000MRAAJW|1.0|I was looking forward to this series and ordered the high definition set. We have a high def tv but not a high def dvd. I thought it would work any way but it did not. I then gave the set to my son-in-law because they have a high def dvd. He could not get it to work either and  so the whole set is useless. I think there should have been some sort of highlighted explaination as to what would work on all the dvd's out there. Now the set is useless and I am not happy.
B000008JUM|5.0|Awesome CD, used to have the cassette tape.  We decided we had waited long enough to here this grouping of music again....so bought the CD.  Especially as it was sold as a money raiser for AIDS.  Wonderful songs, fab groups singing them.  We love it.
B0000009SG|5.0|This album is an astonishing piece of work.  The arrangement, pacing, vocals, song selection, everything on this CD is rock music at its finest.<br /><br />Zappa was a musical genius and it shows in spades on this album.  The tragedy is that essentially none of these cuts received any amount of commercial air play.  Compared to most songs that get saturation air play every 10 minutes these seven are nothing less than golden nuggets of musical brilliance.  Zappa's lyrics are at times silly, intelligent, nonsensical and witty; also his timing is always perfect.  He seems to know exactly when the appropriate moment is to interject his legendary guitar play into various sections of these tracks.<br /><br />I own seven other Zappa CDs with this one easily being one of the best.  Of course he has such an eclectic catalogue that it's impossible to single out one particular album as his best work.  Over-nite Sensation is definitely in the top five.
B00003CXCT|4.0|This was the box set everyone was waiting for, sadly the added scenes realy dont do anything for the films.  I would have much rather they just kept the originals as they were and maybe just polished up on some of the film quality.  Ok some of the added scenes in the desert in both Star Wars and Return of the Jedi are not bad but they realy are not needed.<br /><br />The films themselves realy need no introduction so there is not much point going into that.  Obviously the sound quality is first class and there are the usual documentary stuff in the bonus disk.<br /><br />Great to have them all in a box set but would have much rather had the originals than this.  This box set realy is a lesson in keeping it simple.
B0000025T6|5.0|Because it just doesn't get much better than this Nebraska represents a peak in American music.  I was introduced to this tape (back then it was cassette tapes) when I was 14 years old in 1985.  Aside from \\"Wild, Innocent, E Street Shuffle\\" this is my favorite album by Springsteen.<br /><br />Much of the CD is done with an understated brilliance and a laid back feel.  Atlantic City and Highway Patrolman stand out as the key songs, but every song is quality stuff.  I've been listening to this album off and on ever since the day I first heard it over 20 years ago.  Each track tells a nominal story, and each is worth a thousand times what most pop songs of today are worth.<br /><br />Springsteen and Zappa dominate my stack of CDs (along with some 1970s R&B and some Miles).  Nebraska is certainly in the top echelon of that collection.
B00005JPD0|4.0|Yeh thanks for amazon telling us almost the entire plot!<br /><br />Good film, starts off with a terrorist attack on a boat full of sailors and their families and Denzel tasked to investigate it.  He hooks up with a suvailance crew who claim that they have cameras that set up at every angle can give a 360 degree veiw of events but only 4 days in the past.<br /><br />It is at this point you start to yawn and the old interest starts to go as a bunch of geeks are buisy spying on people you start thinking to yourself \\"You know its still early maybe I should have gone out after all\\"  When the twist in the story comes in 'time travel'<br /><br />Without going into too much of the story our Denzel jumps into action to save the day.  Does a good job and you are begining to thinnk to yourself \\"Is this going to be another 'man on fire'?\\"  But no, it has a pretty good ending to boot.<br /><br />Overall the acting is exellent and their is enough action in the film to keep you happy.  A good film well worth watching.
0440238609|5.0|I very much enjoyed these books.  They are filled with creativity, deep characters, intriguing ideas and an excellent story.  To me they are best books to come out since The Lord of the Rings.  I love the Harry Potter books as well, but His Dark Materials is much deeper.  It touches on some subjects that even some adults might not understand, but that doesn't mean children should not read these books.  In fact I would encourage parents and children to read them.  The higher level of thinking these books will undoubtedly produce, will help raise awareness and ability to not take everything for granted.    Many people have accused these books of not being appropriate for children.  Mostly they say this for the fact that these books do not look well upon Christianity.  So of course any parent that is unwilling to let their child think for themselves or is afraid that it may cause them to question their faith in religion, would not want anyone, especially children, to read these books.    But why should anyone, especially children, follow religion blindly?  There is more to faith than blind acceptance.  Many of those that grow up with that kind of faith come to question it later in life.    I challenge any parent that is of the Christian doctrines or any other belief system, to take a leap of faith and let their child read these books.  Let them make their own decisions as to their own beliefs and where their faith lies.      All around these books are excellent.  They have magic and adventure.  They empower the mind to think outside the box.  Heart and soul are not left out.  One begins very shortly to think about what one's Daemon might be.  The reader also finds that they cannot help but love Lyra, as you cheer for her on her quest.  I believe this story is wonderful for both adults and children.
B000LC4TJ0|1.0|So, I'm a mere 20 minutes into this Salzburg \\"Figaro,\\" and I can already tell this will be one of the all-time worst productions of any opera I wil ever see anywhere, live or on film.  In this latest example of the (Euro)trashing of the classic repertory, Strindberg meets Mozart in what can only be described as the stuff of opera parody.  By the time that poor Ildebrando d'Arcangelo has to carry the dead black bird across the stage in slow, stylistic Robert Wilson-esque movement, I didn't know whether to howl with laughter or rage.  What a waste of an extraordinary cast, each of whom looks palpably uncomfortable as he or she tries in vain to make sense of directorial misteps that really have to be seen to be believed.  (Or not.)  And to compound the stunning idiocies of the staging (including a cavorting winged figure representing -- oh, God knows whom), Harnoncourt's turgid tempi completely suck the air out of this most glorious of scores.  Pity the poor audience that actually had to sit through this performance live; I at least can turn off the DVD mid-note.  Which, if you'll excuse me, is what I'm going to do right now.
B000000OUJ|5.0|The title is true. Most of this album are battle raps--and it doesn't disappoint, at all. There's not a lot to say at this point, so let's break it down...<br /><br />We start off with the title track, which I think is one of the best RZA beats. The lyrics are so hard hitting. Its an addictive song, that's sure. And the intro...well, its weird, as most of the samples from the movie. Standout. 10/10<br /><br />\\"Duel of the Mic\\" is one of the best Wu-tang track with group members that's not on a group album. Again, a standout. 9/10<br /><br />\\"Living in the World Today\\" is a great track, but not really a stand out for me. 8.5/10<br /><br />We then come to \\"Gold\\", which is a spectacular song. Hard-hitting beat, rhymes and great flow from this GZA solo. 10/10<br /><br />\\"Cold World\\" is another RZA that's unskippable. GZA gives us an amazing verse with Inspectah Deck showing us why he can outshine someone. 10/10<br /><br />\\"Labels\\". Hmm...well, yes the song mentions a lot of labels, there's a lot of name dropping...its REAL annoying! WAIT WAIT...ITS ONE OF THE CREATIVE SONGS EVER MADE. \\"And if you ain't boned a mic you couldn't hurt a bee/That's like going to Venus driving a MERCURY\\" and \\"slave of a mental death MC don't panic/Throw that A&R n***a off the boat in the ATLANTIC\\" are just some of the many amazing lines that GZA drops...just stopping for a chorus or a hook--nearly 50 bars of straight sickness. Cannot be rated due to greatness/10<br /><br />\\"4th Chamber\\" is on the same note as \\"Duel of the Mic\\". But this time, its even greater with no chorus or hook. Ghost shows us why he was picked to be on OB4CL with Raekwon. Killah Priest shows us, even know he isn't in one of the greatest groups in hiphop, he can still spit some crazy lines. \\"Clutch they fists/ and throw up signs like a Crip/And throw all types of fits/I leave 'em split/like a** cheeks and ragged p***y lips\\". RZA shines and shows everyone he's more of a producer. 10/10<br /><br />\\"Shadowboxin'\\" is a song that you can either like or not. This was me when I first listened to it, but after awhile I fell in love with it. Great guest verse from Meth. 9/10<br /><br />\\"Killah Hills 10304\\" is one of the best from this album. Long intro, some thing you would see on a cop show(i.e. Law and Order). After that, once again GZA goes off into space and delivers one of the greatest verses in Wu-Tang history, with amazing flow and delivery. No hook or chorus, well over 50 bars. You WILL go back a few times just to catch what he's saying. 10/10<br /><br />\\"Investigative Reports\\" is an amazing song. Involving the best Wu member, Ghostface and his partner,Raekwon, for \\"their\\" later classic. Yet, GZA steals the show. 9.2/10<br /><br />\\"Swordsman\\" is another hit or miss. Its very hard hitting, both lyrically and musically. Really comes hard here. 8.8/10<br /><br />\\"I Gotcha Back\\", same as above. Hit or miss, the more you listen to it, the more you will like it. 8.5/10<br /><br />\\"B.I.B.L.E. (Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth)\\", when I first heard this track, the second the left and right channels hit the speakers, I was hooked. No this is NOT GZA, its the man who *almost* outshined 3 Wu members(tho he did this to Ghost),Killah Priest. He drops some amazing knowledge lyrics. I went back about 3 or 4 times WITH the lyrics just to see what he said. Amazing way to finish a great album. 10/10<br /><br />Closing Comments: No, its NOT better than Illmatic nor Paid in Full, but its a great album and debut. I didn't expect more or less, he showed us why he is a genius. Its his best album to date--though he still has great follow ups, they won't ever be nearly as good as this. Its a classic, but no masterpiece. 5 stars. Oh, and I think I'm going to have to check out the movie, \\"Shogun Assassin\\". Its the movie that's used as some samples as intros/outros in some songs.ed to it, but after awhile I fell in love with it. Great guest verse from Meth. 9/10    \\"Killah Hills 10304\\" is one of the best from this album. Long intro, some thing you would see on a cop show(i.e. Law and Order).

B000002UAU|4.0|I wish all Beatles Albums would get re-mixed and cleaned up. Love was a good start but it only for Boradway. Paul & Ringo & Yoko. What are you holding out for? Youth?
B000001GOZ|5.0|With Mahler performances, it's all a matter of degree.  Tempo, angst, symphonic color, orchestral texture, detail, instrumentation - what sound picture does the conductor bring?  In this very well recorded performance with huge dynamic range (albeit the dry \\"DG\\" sound) Boulez provides an interpretation with sensational color.  Tempos are mainstream, but color and detail abound.  There is a prevailing interpretive color Boulez brings to the entire recording.  The first movement march theme is not overdriven, but has weight and a raspy quality and nervousness; but nonetheless is more color than a relentless march.  The second movement is more \\"even keel\\" than that of say Sinopoli, Bernstein or Karajan' s typical ignoring tempos - but again is more of French modernism and lavish symphonic color via the VPO.  The 3rd movement in particular shows Boulez' find comprehension of Mahler with steady tempos.  I found 4th movement superb.  As the rationale and conductor to conductor performances differ so much in any one conductors' cycle -- mention should be made of the fact that I DISLIKED Boulez's interpretation of Mahler's 4th (among the poorest I've ever encountered) and I found Boulez Mahler 7th to be GHASTLY.  This 6th though, fits in to my Mahler collection based on it's French neo-classical modernism, Mahlerian color, the VPO ensemble and a new \\"symphonic color\\" alongside my Sinopoli 6th.
B000FIMG68|5.0|Some of this is pretty \\"far out\\" by my conservative standards, but rather fascinating and I eagerly await the next season!  The actors are, for the most part, very good.
B00008PW2D|2.0|The fifth season is ALL about Carrie, she seems so needy in this season. It sucks that we are forced to pay almost full price for half the episodes but, on the bright side its only eight episodes of her whinning incessantly. I only bought it to complete the set.
B00005JK8K|2.0|With the title \\"Windtalkers\\" you'd think it would be centered on the Windtalkers, those Navajo codetalkers in the Pacific Theater of World War II. I'd purposely ignored this movie until I had the time to watch it since I was interested in the topic and have a passing interest in the Navajo culture, having visited the Four Corners area several times and having read a bit about them.<br /><br />Anyway, I was hoping for a movie that focused on the Windtalkers - why they fought for a society that had conquered thme and now scorned them, what their motivations were, how their culture dealt with the seperation from the Navajo lands, the death and destruction of the war (briefly touched on) and so on. That would have been much more interesting and important.<br /><br />Instead, we get a movie that should be called \\"Messed Up In the Head Windtalker Babysitter\\" - a movie full of cliche characters and soliloquies that just does not work. For that matter, neither do most of the action scenes. The first rule of a war movie is to make you love the character and then put him in all sorts of dangerous situations so you can worry if he's going to die. It's simple - the viewer is emotionally invested in the story. It never happened for me in this one, despite the massive amounts of explosions. War stories are not about the amount of explosions - the great ones are about exploring characters (and by extension, you and me) during a time of extreme duress.<br /><br />I was glad to see Christian Slater get some work, though.<br /><br />This one will not be staying in my collection - it is just not good enough.
0312330537|5.0|Rarely have I encountered the novel that evoked dueling emotions within one paragraph, let alone on the same page.  I won't say that I read Shantaram, but that I experienced it.  Simply put, I love this book.  For the description of Bombay, for the depth of the humanity and love and pain found on each page, I love it.  It's one of the most relevant books I've read in a long while.  If you're thinking about buying the book, then you should.
B000C65Z1G|1.0|This is another one of those stories about good vs. evil in a third world setting.  Tessa takes up the cause of Africans whom she believes are being used without their knowledge to test a drug.  But no one asked her to do this.  A large drug firm is only interested in making money, and they may be unscrupulous in their quest.  So what else is new . . .     The Africans are shown as either inconsequential, faceless and nameless, or they are shown as cruel and inhuman.  Of course there are one or two who seem to be worth our attention, but for the most of them, this movie gives them a one-dimensional brushoff.  So why is Tessa so interested in them.  Is there nothing else in her life that would give her a sense of satisfaction.  And her husband, who follows along with her, albeit too late . . what is his motivation.  How naive on the part of both of them, that two people against an army of corporate interests will change anything.    This movie is predictable, trite, and in the long view, promotes a racist view of the unfortunate people it purports to protect.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This CD is Great! Its the first thing that a person should get if they're just discovering the beatles. A great example of the beatles
B00003CXN4|5.0|This story is very interesting and takes a look at the drug trade, and the drugs effect on people in all walks of life.  It starts out with grainy, yellowish haze to help enhance a scene in the Mexico desert.  Michael Douglas plays Bob Wakefield, a political figure whose position is led to stressful circumstances when his own daughter falls to deep in the very substances he is supposed to be fighting on a National level.  Outstanding cast also includes Dennis Quaid, Catherine Zeta Jones and Don Cheadle.  This is one of those stories that could be considered art on the big screen when it comes to telling an interesting drama that touches on a major issue within our world.
B000002UAX|5.0|This Cd ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!! It's my favorite beatles album. It has a different veriety of songs. For Some songs you just have to appriciate the music instead of the lyrics like \\"why don't we do it in the road?\\"  The Only one i don't like is \\"Yer Blues\\". It's Like their solo albums. The Best CD i ever herd!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JP5P|5.0|The sun eventually will burn out, so everyone kind of wasted time listening to Gore and this movie is a great example of that.  The sun dies out but these astronauts gotta go and fire it up again in the hopes of sustaining life on Earth.  We know this will not happen and in real life the sun will burn out, then anarchy will prevail and the only ones that survive will be the ones who were building bunkers and saving water instead of watching Al Gore comedy.  If you did like the movie Pitch Black you may like this movie better.  It would have been better to have Ridley Scott directing it and maybe have like, a Charles Bronson holographic message on the counter but we cannot win them all.
B000002TYX|3.0|It's not the best thing. there's a lot of fuzzy songs and short speeches it wasn't that good... a lot of short songs
0061259470|4.0|if you're looking for a book that has alot of adventure and action, and dont mind crazy stunts that you would only see in movies, then this would be a good book for you. the book moves very fast without losing any detail. james rollins does a good job of explaining scientific terms in his books and this book is no different. for pure enjoyment reasons this book should get 5 stars. you could easily finish this book in a few sittings, as i did.    the reason i gave this book 4 stars is because this book is flimsy and i had a few pages fall out which was annoying.     also, ive read all of james rollins' sigma force books and this book comes in 2nd after his last book entitled \\"the black order\\".
B000OYC3J8|5.0|I am going on my 15th or so listening of the CD and it has not yet become boring.  The different tracks are different in style enough so that you don't feel at all like you are listening to the same song over and over and yet it retains that White Stripes magic throughout.
B00005LB50|4.0|Neil Young and his overblown ego compiled this, so there are more Neil Young tunes and more variations on those tunes than anyone else. He was my least favorite in the band..I much prefer Furay and Stills.  Richie Furay seems to be the only one who is not totally full of himself and is appreciative of what the band had done to music and his friendship with the surviving members continue.  His book on Buffalo Springfield seems like a fair representaion of what went on and he is not one to place blame.  He always has a respectful view on what happened.  He is a Pastor now and a devout Christian..and if for some reason that puts you off...you should still read his autobiography.  He just seemed like the right guy to tell the honest story and he should have been the one to put this collection together.

Discussed in a narrative voice, all the events and feelings are dictated by Anthony Kiedis and provide a real world connection to these superstars. His individual story as well as the group as a whole is shared in a way that makes them seem so human and makes anyone wonder, \\"how are these guys still alive, sane, and still making beautiful, boandary pushing music together?\\"

B000002GKT|5.0|Woah! One of the BEST live albums of all time. I wore out the cassette I bought in college when it first came out after stumbling on a bootleg tape of Humble Pie AND falling in \\"like\\" with them in '69. Patched that live tape up so many times there were gaps in the songs and mangled parts garbling the sound. I thought I had died and went to heaven when I saw this in the CD store about 15 years ago. All the good memories came flooding back with the improved sound of the CD. Peter Frampton! Steve Marriott! God! Could those guys pump out the jams together! This live set has been one of my most favorite albums for over 37 years now! That is a LONG time to like something. You will like this too. I WANNA BE BURIED WITH THIS ALBUM.
B000RIHBIE|2.0|This is a pale, insipid version of Green Day's American Idiot (and other Green Day songs). Sum 41 chose some good material to rip off, then did nothing more than a poor cover. Absolute garbage. Go listen to Green Day and hear the obvious inspiration for this album.
B00004YA66|5.0|This overlooked film was only in theaters for a very short time, and most professional reviewers don't think that highly of it. For me, \\"Frequency\\" is my favorite movie EVER. If you're a father or a son and are not moved by the \\"Catching Up\\" scene, you've lost your heart. \\"Frequency\\" also has THE most wholesome love scene in any movie, when Frank (the father) comes home after the opening rescue scene and dances with his wife Julia in the kitchen. I've found a lot of (perhaps unintentional) depth to the movie, too - it's obviously about redemption (redeeming the past), but it's also about restoration and resolution (the son reconnecting with his long-lost father) and repentance (in the son's shouted line of desperation, \\"If you'd just gone the other way...\\"). Another reviewer said the switching back and forth between 1969 and 1999 was confusing, but I thought the movie did a good job of making this switching very clear. As the movie unfolds, watch carefully how the face of actor Jim Caviezel's character is transformed from a deeply troubled young man into one who is confident and far more fully alive - this is a brilliant acting job by Caviezel, whose subtle facial expressions change dramatically and powerfully - yet almost imperceptibly - over the course of the film. On a personal level, this movie helped me change my life, as Caviezel's shouted line \\"If you'd just gone the other way...\\" reminded me that there were things that I needed to change in my life and go \\"the other way\\" on, in order to help ensure a better future for me and my family. I've watched this movie 30-40 times and have yet to grow tired of it, and I've got the poster of the movie framed in my family den. OF COURSE none of us can change the past, but this flick is a reminder that there will come a day when every tear will be wiped away, when all accounts will be settled, when every wrong will be righted in the greatest reunion of all. Until that day, may we remember that it is stories like \\"Frequency\\" that help us stay faithful along the way. Blessings to all who read this!
B000PMGNK4|5.0|For those unfamiliar with the premise of the \\"ghost in the shell\\" franchise, it is based in the future focusing on the trials and tribulations of an elite crime-fighting group known as Section 9.    Solid State Society is a direct to dvd movie based on the \\"stand alone complex\\" TV series which, itself, was a spin-off from the original 1995 film.    I won't go into the plot details but i will tell you as far as anime films go this is one of the best around. With an intellectual story that incorporates numerous themes and action that, for it's modest budget, is quite impressive.    Finally, the DVD includes both Japanese & English audio in DTS 5.1. So if you are an anime collector, I'm probably telling you everything you already know. If you are yet to be introduced to the wonderful world of anime, this maybe the movie that gets the ball rolling....
B000ROALCG|5.0|I've been a fan of Marc Anthony's throughout the 90's before the Latin Pop explosion later in 1999/2000.  He has the most superb voice and always sings with a lot of emotion and smoothness.  You don't need to understand what he's singing about if you listen to the music and his voice - you can just feel what he's singing about.  He plays the role of Hector Lavoe in this movie - and he'd been wanting to make this movie for years.  While I haven't seen the movie, I've already fallen in love with the music.  It's beautiful.  I think he's done a really good job here to not exactly match the talents of Lavoe, but to get close to his talent and put his own take on it.  I really love Che Che Cole, El Día de Suerte and Aguanile.  I love the whole cd, but these are my particular favourites.  This cd is my absolute new favourite that went straight onto my iPod and into the car too so I can listen to it everywhere.  It's so amazing and you must do yourself and pick up a copy whether you are a fan of Marcs, Hectors or if you just love stunning Latin music.  This is great.  Can't wait to see the movie.
B000KKPN5C|3.0|PROS: Amazingly compact, great substitute for my D80's subpar built-in flash, when used in conjunction with a diffuser or an omnibounce cap - the performance is terrific, sure beats lugging around my SB-600 to casual events.<br /><br />CONS: NOT, and I repeat, NOT compatible with the D200's or D80's wireless lighting system. Once the SB-400 is attached to the hot shoe - the wireless commander mode is rendered useless and you can't fire off another SB-600 or SB-800 wirelessly at the same time.  I was hoping to use the SB-400 as a 2nd flash to go with the SB-600 to fire off wirelessly with my D80, NOT the case with the SB-400 - major disappointment. So the SB-400 is a \\"no-frills and just slap it on and shoot\\" flash.  No swivel capabilities which may be a problem for portrait/vertical shots (unless you have a diffuser on it).<br /><br />My reasons for only 3 stars are mainly because you get what you pay for. My D80's built-in flash is pathetic and not very strong at all. I don't mind carrying the SB-600 along but it's quite bulky.  If I'm going to a small event to shoot leisurely, the SB-400 comes in handy. If you have a D40 or D40x, this flash definitely works well with those bodies. But if you want more capabilities (mostly in the wireless lighting department), save a little more dough for the SB-600.
B000MR9D5E|3.0|In my rush, I was probably at fault in getting a version with the voice over done by David Attenborough rather than Sigourney Weaver.  He's good, but she she brings a freshness to the commentary.  Who could not be impressed with the wonderful video.  Truly magnificant.

B000002KLG|3.0|Many people like George Benson, for many different reasons. Some love his singing, whilst others crave his prowess on the guitar. I happen to fall into the latter category. This release (the first on the newly formed Qwest) was the first (and as we speak only) collaboration between Quincy Jones & Mr. Benson. Most people will be familiar with the vocal cuts on here (Love X Love, Give Me the Nights) but upon listening to the LP I came across some instrumentals that left me purring. First up, 'Off Broadway, which is an up tempo cut that is vibrant, energetic. Pure Class. But my favorite cut on here is 'Dinorah, Dinorah,. I normally let this song play on repeat on my MP3 player. George is on fine form here, on this mid tempo cut, broken up with the female chorus hook, violins. Heaven.<br />I like many am wishing that George will soon release a CD of Jazz Instrumentals, but until such time, I will catch them where I can find them, on CDs like this.
B00005RHGL|5.0|This release wasn't much different than the original-it still did not include all the cut scenes. The trailer even shows scenes that are not included. I was somewhat disappointed but it's nice to have for the bonus interviews/commentary. If you are looking to buy Tombstone for the first time, this release is the one to get. Tombstone is still the best movie I've seen. Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer are living the characters, bringing the story to life. I still get pulled in when I come across it on television.

0882847953|5.0|If you want to significantly improve your independence skills, buy this book and then find an instructor who can show you the more than 40 different ways to apply it to the drum set.     Alan Dawson used this book extensively with his students. Thankfully, one of his students has documented those 40+ ways. See \\"The Drummer's Complete Vocabulary As Taught by Alan Dawson\\" (Paperback), by author John Ramsay. Ramsay did a great job of identifying (and providing audio examples) of the numerous ways you can apply Syncopation.     An excellent precursor to this book is Jim Chapin's \\"Advanced Techniques for the Modern Drummer\\". That book will help you develop the basic independence you'll need to dive into Syncopation. Or if you already possess the ability to play the swing ostinato while playing swung eighth notes and triplets and sixteenth notes between your snare drum and bass drum, then you can likely dive right in.

B00005JODK|4.0|The original  John Waters movie \\"Hairspray\\" was one of the genuine unalloyed delights of the 1980's.  Since the material seemed tailor-made for the stage from the outset, it was only a matter of time before some astute dramatists (in this case, Mark O'Donnell and Thomas Meehan) would get around to converting it into a smash Broadway show - and, indeed, their creation went on to win the Tony Award for Best Musical of 2002.  Now \\"Hairspray\\" has come full circle, returning as a full-fledged movie musical that will lift your spirits and set your toes to tapping in record-setting time.  Needless to say, only a total curmudgeon could resist the pull of this film.<br /><br />The musical \\"Hairspray\\" stays true to the ebullient spirit, ribald satire and offbeat humor of the original film while adding a generous helping of original song-and-dance numbers that take the material to a new level.  Newcomer Nikki Blonsky assumes the role, originated by Ricki Lake in the 1988 film, of Miss Tracy Turnblad, the eternally sunny teenager with a heart as outsized as her fulsome figure and ceiling-scraping coiffure.  Obsessed with the fashions and accoutrements of early '60's pop culture, Tracy takes Baltimore by storm when she secures a spot as a regular on the Corny Collins dance show on local TV.  Once ensconced on the program, the naively optimistic Tracy, a true product of her time, spearheads the effort to bring white and black teens together on the dance floor, a radical proposition for 1962 that does not sit well with the bigoted station manager and major segments of the city`s population.  As such, the movie is what \\"Grease\\" or \\"Bye Bye Birdie\\" might have been had they been imbued with a social conscience.  Yet, even though this \\"Hairspray\\" is immensely enjoyable on any number of levels, we still miss some of the trademark subversiveness that Waters brought to the original (Tracy`s being thrown into \\"special ed\\" classes at school, for instance, has been summarily dropped).  For all its undeniable glory and charm, this is a softer, more user-friendly version of the story than we're used to seeing.  But the original's themes of inclusiveness, of breaking down social barriers, and of being true to oneself still come through loud and clear.<br /><br />As a crowd-pleasing musical, \\"Hairspray\\" kicks into high gear from its opening moments and never lets up.  Director Adam Shankman allows the innate energy of the material to burst out in any number of ways - be it the dazzling, high-stepping choreography; the gracefully gliding camerawork; the sharp, rhythmic editing; the bright, flashy color scheme; the clever, witty lyrics; or the nostalgia-inducing and humorously exaggerated hairdos and costumes.  There's even a wonderful scene in which Tracy's love interest sings a song to her framed picture - and the picture sings back!  This intense stylization allows \\"Hairspray\\" to exist in a never-never fantasy land where centuries of racial prejudice can be wiped away in the blink of an eye, and we never question the plausibility of it for a second.  It's a dream we want to believe in and, if it becomes a little self-congratulatory at times, well, who but the most dour party pooper is going to be complaining about that when the rest of us are having such a great time?<br /><br />Much of the credit for \\"Hairspray\\"'s success goes to the actors, all of whom do a splendid job capturing the offbeat, fun-loving spirit of the piece.  As Tracy,  Blonsky perfectly conveys the innate sweetness, wide-eyed innocence and boundless energy that make the character so tremendously appealing to the audience.  John Travolta, appearing in full fat-suit and drag, is a hoot as Tracie's supportive but supremely self-conscious mother, Edna, as is Christopher Walken as the devoted husband and father to the zaftig Turnblad clan.  Michelle Pfeiffer, Amanda Byrnes, James Marsden, Queen Latifah, Britanny Snow, Zac Efron, Elijah Kelly, Allison Janney and Jerry Stiller round out the spectacular, powerhouse cast.<br /><br />The score by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman is not only exuberant and catchy in its own right, but perfectly captures the rhythm and style of the music of the period.  I guarantee that your toes will be tapping quite a bit throughout the course of this film.<br /><br />In a summer in which audiences have seen one bloated mega-blockbuster after another crash and burn before their very eyes, it is a joy to be able to report that here at last is the genuine article - a perfect summertime entertainment that restores your faith in commercial moviemaking and will have you coming back for more.e cast.

B00004U8DV|5.0|Yes the album is inconsistent,and yes there is too much blues filler - but that misses the point. Unlike all the other previous Doors albums, which were over produced to varying degrees, this album gives you an unvarnished glimpse into a stream-of-consciousness Morrision as he teeters on the edge between pure genius and sheer madness.    Morrison warns us from the start in the Changeling that this this not going to be a TV-ready performance when he sings \\"I've never been so broke that I couldn't be stoned\\". A great rock screamer and a fantastic opening song. The title song is simply the Doors at their best - great lyrics and fantastic ensemble playing - especially the drumming of John Densmore.  It's wonderful to hear him play with an actual bassist. The WASP (Texas Radio and the Big Beat) is Morrison at his poeteic best, full of provoacative imagery. Riders on the Storm is one of the most uniquely ethereal pieces of rock music ever created. There's not much to say about the rest of the album that hasn't been said already.    In short - all fans of 60's pscyhedelic rock need this album. If you love \\"Tonight's the Night\\" or \\"The Madcap Laughs\\", this is your cup of tea.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|Im going to make this quick. I've been a huge linkin park fan since I first saw the video for crawling. After that I had to have all their tracks and I enjoyed every bit of their last albums. But I dont know what happined here! This cd sounded like a pop album with sad songs for chicks. Omg I couldnt believe what I was hearing. So I gave it another listen while on my way to work. And their were only about 2-3 songs that were ok. What I liked most about the Linkin Park sound was the rap/rock mix and chesters vocals when he screams. It used to send chills thru my back. Well thats all gone now. I wish I could ask these guys wtf happined dudes!? You guys were on a role! Well anyways So if you enjoyed the other linkin park albums you might want to skip this one. Because im telling you you wont like it! I just hope they go back to the old sound on their next album. I just hate having to wait again. -_-
B000E97HIA|5.0|I absolutely love this album. More than a year after its release, I am still bumping to 3121. It is a splendid mix of funk and soul with enough rock to satiate the diverse musical palates that Prince's music attracts. There are so many standout songs on this album - some hit you like Bernard Hopkins jab right out the gate and others grow on you over time. My favorite tracks are the slinky Black Sweat, the romantic Te Amo Corazon with its beautiful string accompaniment, The Word - this song is just awesome, Get On the Boat - the bass and drums just do it for me on this one, the lovely ballad The Dance and the sexy ballad Incense and Candles, and Fury the solid rocker that I love to blast. All in all, you cannot go wrong with this one.
B00009MGQL|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite Jeff Beck albums.  It kicks butt and keeps on kicking.  My favorite cut is \\"So What,\\" which ignites the album and sets the tone.  I can listen to this album over and over and over.  As in previous albums, he names many of the songs after garage talk, and the rev'd up music is as snarling as some of the cars he tinkers with.  \\"Grease Monkey,\\" \\"Hod Rod Honeymoon,\\" and \\"Trouble Man,\\" are all sizzlers.  I highly recommend this album if you want something to blow the cobwebs off your pipes as you fly down the freeway.  If you are looking for Rod Stewart, you've come to the wrong garage.
B000EMGJM2|4.0|This is probably the best album that no one heard last year. Between Van Hunt and Rahsaan Patterson, I don't know who is more overlooked.     This talented singer/writer/producer has been producing solid work since he penned Dionne Farris's hit \\"Hopeless.\\" Just like his much-overlooked first album, this one delivers and soulful mix of R&B, Rock and Funk. There are so many great tracks on this release, that there is something for everyone. Although Hunt mixes different musical styles, he still puts a cohesive stamp on it that makes them flow well together.     My favorite tracks are Priest or Police, Daredevil Baby, Being a Girl, At The End Of A Slow Dance, If I Take You Home, and Hot Stage Lights.     I can't wait for the new EP.
B000G75AE8|4.0|OK, I am pleasantly surprised by this album.  Slayer has been putting out junk ever since Seasons in the Abyss.

I enjoyed the CD emensely, which took me to the films that were available.  I have enjoyed Mr. Selleck in all of his films and this was no different.  It was if Mr. Selleck was made for the part.  The film held my interest as well, if not better, than the book.  Viola Davis played her part just as well.  If you're a Selleck fan the films are not to be missed.  Worth every star offered.
B000F39MAG|4.0|While agreeing with the appreciation of the singing expressed by other reviewers, I would like to add a defence of the staging. I think the setting is a lobby or back stage at the Houses of Parliament, where the MP's gather before and after meetings. Then it all makes sense, with Gruberova, as another reviewer has said, a stunning combination of Queen Elizabeth II and Margaret Thatcher.
B000OCY7JE|3.0|One can see why this movie garnered such praises. Beautifully filmed, knockout kids, excellent performances, and a glorious soundtrack brilliantly featuring Sigur Ros, the film looks, sounds, and feels spectacular. But it is thematically where it lost me, and lost me bad.<br /><br />I suppose we are to see contrasts between rich and poor, past and present. Money cannot buy everything. Yeah, OK, think we've heard that one before. But what this film is about is atonement. And it seems to say that money can indeed buy that. Jorgen wants to fund an orphanage to atone for his unnamed sins (unless the mere act of making money is a sin in itself.) 12 million dollars, even if they are depressed, buys a lot of hope for a lot of kids. Jorgen, apparently a truly and consistently good man in the world's eyes, is satisfied to do so. And garners praises. Jacob, sullied by a vile past, seeks atonement by serving the world's poor and desperate. Different path, same solution: works.<br /><br />But I don't think it is so easy. This is atonement for the non-religious, or karma-crowd. The good makes up for and outweighs the bad. Poof, all nasty stuff gone! Do a lot of bad, you had better do even more good to balance the scale. In a Denmark where the Protestant religion once flourished, but here plays no role other than officiating at weddings and funerals, this is the only moral scale to be found. But the old one, the one that says deeds cannot ameliorate what was done, seems far more true to me. Having characters scramble to fix their sins with actions, earning their way into (whatever--public acclaim, easy conscience, family respect, heaven...makes no difference) is the post-modern solution. And one that would make all the very rich, very-ugly-past Hollywood types jump for joy. \\"See! I can undo all the scuzz I did and illegitimate children I fathered!\\" I'll choose forgiveness instead.
B000002LUB|4.0|An excellent Sabbath album that didn't get the credit it deserves . Iommi once again comes up with the greatest riffs , Geezers bass pounds the hell out of your chest and Dio's vocals are as good as ever . It's sad that this cd didn't get any credit because songs like \\"Computer God\\" , TV Crimes\\" , \\"I\\" and \\"After All The Dead\\" are classic Black Sabbath. This cd is usually available very cheap , so do yourself a favor and get it.
0525457585|5.0|This book will take you away,,, to the neverending story.  I like how the book differenciates the story itself with different color print (the book the boy reads is in a different color) so you know which part is the story and which part is the book the boy in the story is reading!  Buy it in hardcover, it gives you a sense of permanence.
B00000IL67|4.0|This is a great place for any Alice Cooper newcomer to start . I have been a die hard AC fan for many many years , since about 1974 . To me , this is a great box set , but for a long time fan , I think I would have picked some different tracks to be on it . Dont get me wrong , these are all great songs , but I guess everybody that has been into AC for years would pick different songs to be presented here. This is 4 cd's crammed with classic Cooper . As usual , Rhino has done a fantastic job , the remastered song is great , the booklet is jam packed with interesting info , song by song comments from Alice himself . I recently read somewhere that Rhino will probably put out a box set of all the AC cd's that were on Warner Brother records in the near future , with tons of unreleased stuff as bonus tracks . I look forward to that .
1577312082|2.0|The actual material is interesting if you can stay awake long enough to pay attention to it.

B000NA77YO|5.0|To me Ozzy era Sabbath was the greatest band EVER ! Dio era Sabbath was (and currently as Heaven And Hell) is an awesome band . This compilation is great \\"greatest hits\\" of the Dio years. The Dio Sabbath albums were all very good . Heaven and Hell , Mob Rules and the very under rated Dehumanizer are all first rate classic metal . This Rhino cd , \\"The Dio Years\\" does a great job of representing those 3 albums . The only bad choice of songs on this cd (in my opinion) is the Live Evil version of Children Of The Sea. I think they should have put the studio version on here instead. There was no need to represent Live Evil , yes it was a decent album , but the studio version is much much stronger. The 3 new songs are all classic Dio era Sabbath songs . Get this cd !
1400064287|2.0|I just wasn't impressed. Well, actually, at first I was, but then the simple ideas the authors were so adamant about became repetitive, long-drawn paragraphs of useless information. They just seemed like they were pulling a \\"do as I say, not as I do\\" type of stunt..Their big concepts for making ideas stick:<br />1. Simplicity: The book was all BUT simple, it could've been a lot shorter.<br />2. Unexpectedness: Once you read the list of critical elements once, the rest of the book is quite predictable.<br />3. Concreteness: Too long, repetitive to be considered concrete.<br />4. Credibility: ok, it was credible since the authors have experience in this sector, and you assume an author knows what they're talking about.<br />5. Emotions: no emotions in this book.<br />6. Stories: yes, there are many stories of how previous \\"sticky ideas\\" were  developed, but in the end, I would summarize this book as \\"the secret to make a sticky idea is to come up with a new proverb\\", or at least it seems that's what the authors suggest to do.
0312370830|3.0|The theme and historical context of this book is certainly compelling and the moral issues raised by the story, though familiar, are still intriguing.  However, once the key elements of Sarah's story are revealed, the book looses steam and we are left with the banal life crisis facing our journalist narrator who comes off frequently as more than a little spineless, letting the people around her direct the flow of her thoughts and actions.  The angst of modern life over-shadows past tragedy.  Most of the author's characters seem stereotyped, merely cardboard cut-outs who are ill-suited to the task of explicating the difficult gray areas between good and evil.  When Joshua, Julia's editor, points out to her the fact that she has left out one whole side of Sarah's difficult story, he might as well be describing this novel.  It never really does address the issues of responsibility and moral culpability in any deep and meaningful way. When Sarah's voice disappears from the narrative, the book looses its psychological edge and Julia's subsequent quest seems to lack real purpose. The confrontations which do take place towards the end of the novel are not the one's a reader might be anticipating and ultimately, leave the reader feeling unsatisfied and disappointed.  Read this book to learn more about the Jewish experience in occupied France but don't expect to be challenged--this book doesn't take readers anywhere near the true tragedy symbolized by Sarah's key.
0316067598|5.0|This book is undoubtedly one of the best combat tales you will ever read.  Marcus Luttrell was born to be a Navy SEAL.  He describes his boyhood obsession with making the Teams and the rigors of BUDS.  But the heart of the book is the story of a mission in Afghanistan.  Luttrell and his teammates are inserted deep into Taliban country to find a terrorist leader.  The mission is troubled from the very beginning and the team is attacked by Taliban fighters.  The SEALS fight back in the face of incredible odds, but only Luttrell survives.  As I read this book, I was reminded of the books of LTC Dave Grossman (\\"On Killing\\" and \\"On Combat\\").  Luttrell's story is a great example of the combat mindset and refusal to quit fighting.  Strongly recommended.
B000QUCNP4|4.0|Ultimately, the fatal flaw in \\"Zodiac\\" is that the film fails to maintain the courage of its convictions. Given the impulse towards narrative completeness it is difficult to make a movie about a serial killer that has never been caught, and the tagline for this 2007 film comes up with an ideal solution with the whole idea that \\"There's more than one way to lose your life to a killer.\\" That appellation applies to a trio of characters in director David Fincher's film. Inspector David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) is the lead detective on the case and Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) is covering the murders for the San Francisco \\"Chronicle,\\" and they are going to devote years to the pursuit of the killer. Then there is Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), a cartoonist for the paper who becomes obsessed, first with the cryptograms the Zodiac sends to the \\"Chronicle\\" and then with figuring out the killer's identity.<br /><br />The trailer for \\"Zodiac\\" makes it clear that Graysmith is the main character in the film, and the screenplay is based on the book that Graysmith wrote about the case. But he really does not emerge as such until the second half of the film, by which time Avery has moved on to a different paper and Toschi has put the case on the back burner, mainly because Zodiac has stopped killing. Or perhaps he has only stopped boasting about it to the press and the police. Graysmith cannot let go and continues to investigate on his own until he thinks that he knows who done it. Since the suppositions are Graysmith's, the movie bends to his perspective. Without them, the film cannot pretend to come to any conclusions. However, this runs counter to the tagline that suggests we should view Graysmith's obsession as a bad thing. \\"Zodiac\\" tries to walk a thin line and have it both ways but in the end it cannot help but take Greysmith's views as its own.<br /><br />At first I was thinking \\"Zodiac\\" was comparable to \\"All the President's Men\\" in that the focus is on police procedure and investigative journalism, and you do not actually get to a resolution except in terms of the teletype or the end scrawl. Then I could see how in many ways the Zodiac can be viewed as the American Jack the Ripper, not in terms of the viciousness of his murder but rather because the case will never be solved, so speculation as to the murderer's identity is all we have and we get to run rampant with it. Both cases have website where you can debate who are or are not the victims and see the messages that the killers sent to torment the police. So there is also a sense in which \\"Zodiac\\" is attempting to answer the unanswerable question, much like \\"From Hell,\\" albeit with much more in terms of concrete support (or at least absent evidence to the contrary).<br /><br />The performances by the three principle performers forgives a lot of the faults here. Downey is one of the most mesmerizing actors around today, so it is hard to keep your eye on anyone else when he is on screen. Ruffalo turns in an effectively restrained performance, providing a lot of subtle shadings within the limited range he has hit upon for this role. Gyllenhaal is the one whose character has the greatest arc from start to finish as his obsession with finding the identity of the Zodiac unhinges his life and as much as finding the killer he needs somebody, whether it be Toschi, Avery, or his wife (Chloë Sevigny) to tell him he is right. Or maybe it could be something as simple as finally getting to look into the eyes of the Zodiac himself.<br /><br />Next year the director's cut of \\"Zodiac\\" will come out on DVD, and I suppose I will check it out. But I am inclined to doubt that adding to the film will make it better because all it can really do is expand the various elements and not add additional ones. There was never sufficient proof to warrant the arrest of Graysmith's prime suspect and the film's suggestion that fate allowed time to run out speaks back to the intrinsic need for narrative completeness more than hard facts (although the movie gets points for the character of Toschi sticking to the need for proof that will stand up in court despite the circumstantial evidence that Graysmith amasses by the end of the film). Still, this version of \\"Zodiac\\" is well worth watching, even if it proves to be unsatisfying on various levels. The \\"true\\" story being told does not allow otherwise.(although the movie gets points for the character of Toschi sticking to the need for proof that will stand up in court despite the circumstantial evidence that Graysmith amasses by the end of the film). Still, this version of \\"Zodiac\\" is well worth watching, even if it proves to be unsatisfying on various levels. The \\"true\\" story being told does not allow otherwise.

B000002KLP|5.0|After his second record, it was put-up or shut-up for Prince. \\"Dirty Mind\\" marks the spot where he decided to go for broke. Was pop music to go on being merely coy and suggestive or was it going to be explicit? Prince made that hard left turn on this record and the whole of pop culture followed along with him, hip-hop and all...    ...And none of it would have worked if the music wouldn't have been so convincing. Slick, greasy funk the whole way, yet Prince keeps it tight and concise. It's spiked with rock, just the way Sly, Rick and George had done. The difference with Prince was that the sound was kept close to your ear. There's no expansion to the sound, no jamming going on, it's not designed for a hockey rink. He's right in the room with you, not aiming for the cheap seats.    Lyrically, everything gets the bird. You got Prince color-by-numbered into your blaxploitation hetero freak fantasy? Not going to happen. (\\"When U Were Mine,\\" falsetto vocals.) Shunning politics for more immediate pop thrills? Nyet. (\\"Partyup,\\" \\"Uptown.\\") Sex within your frat-house range of soft-core taboos? Not today. (\\"Sister.\\") This record pushed all the buttons back then, and it's still astonishing for its nerve. Prince had balls, and this was the first time you got to hear them. Rick James, Schoolly-D, N.W.A., Eminem, and every lick-em-up-and-down R&B singer since has followed his lead.     But you don't care, really. You just want to know: is my butt gonna shake when I put this one on? I can tell you \\"yes\\" 'til I'm blue in the face, but you've got to drop the ten bucks and find out for yourself.
B000OQF6N6|1.0|Crap! This album sounds as if Billy Corgan tried to put out something truly aweful (like Zwan or his solo album) just to sit back and watch the long time pumpkin fans snatch it up and talk about how great it is, or different it is. I have not heard an album this bad in a long long time, well since the Billy Corgan solo attempt maybe.<br /><br />If you just have to hear it, at least don't pay for it!

B00005LK94|5.0|FLY AWAY HOME is one of my favorite movies. It has comedy, family, friends, of both the human and non-human kind, and adventure. It is about a girl and her father growing up and growing together. I will and do recommend this movie to anyone who loves nature, family and adventure.  It is fun, it's real (not just the story itself, but the acting too) and  it involves all of the cast - STELLAR!!!
0143038419|2.0|When a little girl learns to do cartwheels, she tells and shows anyone and everyone, all the time saying, \\"Look at me!  Look at me!\\"  My current perspective of the author in this book is an adult showing off her cartwheels all the while saying, \\"Look at me!  Look at me!\\"  She tells everyone (in great detail) the who what when where & why of her cartwheels, including each time she tried and failed.  Perhaps her voyage of indulging every whim will help others, but I don't think reading is how most learn to do cartwheels.
0385340559|2.0|Whilst this was an enjoyable book to read, I have to say that it was entirely linear in terms of plot, with not a single twist or blind alley for the reader to be hoodwinked into taking.<br /><br />This had the effect of making the whole story entirely predictable from start to finish. It was clear from pretty much the middle of the book what the denouement was going to be, and Childs did not disappoint !<br /><br />The opening of the book sets the scene where without ANY problem, thought or wasted time, Reacher finds Neagley. In the whole of LA, he goes straight to the right cafe and ... wait for it ... Neagley is there having a cup of coffee!<br /><br />Far too simplistic, and not a patch on some of Childs earlier work. I love Reacher, but this episode appeared formulaic, lazy and lacked any real tension.<br /><br />A real shame
0786177284|3.0|While the first four or five CDs are engaging and (as Feynman would say) very interesting, I found the second half somewhat tedious. His comments on physics decrease steadily throughout the book and the last half is taken up with his adventures in nightclubs and playing music in Brazil.    The voice talent is great -- he may not sound like Feynman but he reads the words like a highly intelligent 12-year-old boy, which captures Feynman perfectly.
1400064627|5.0|First off, the title is one of the best ever; and everything about this book lives up to it.  Not a story that is reeled out in a straight cast but payed out slowly- under and over stories artfully woven.  The character's names, the place, the times, the sounds of the train, the smells of all that fabulous pre-health conscious stuff frying on the grill.  Boy oh boy!  The hope of life against the odds. This is one classic book.

0316018953|2.0|This Bosch-series successor to the strong `Echo Park' is a disappointment. The misleading `terrorist connection' is a hackneyed theme in current mystery/thrillers.

I read this book in one day and I couldn't put it down. It is suspensful, and just keeps you turning the pages.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|A lot of people say that Al Gore's crusade against global warming is all wrong. Also, that this is a film promoting Al Gore. I disagree. Mr. Gore's passion for saving the planet is not to be taken lightly, and, whether you believe it or not, it's a valid theory to be taken seriously. Mr. Gore was never boring in his quest, or his exposition of the material at hand. I was amazed, and often amused, at Mr. Gore's handling of the material. The DVD extras are insightful. And, yes, Mr. Gore's losing that election was, indeed, an inconvenient truth. UPDATE: Mr. Gore just won the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts. Apparently, someone is listening, though maybe not the ones who make decisions...
0312867123|5.0|In 2009 a team of particle physicists pursuing the Higgs Boson, a theoretical subatomic particle, flip the switch at Geneva's huge new particle accelerator.  Suddenly Lloyd Simcoe, project leader, finds himself naked in bed with a stranger, an old woman whose body feels like \\"fruit gone bad\\".<br /><br />Horrified, he discovers he too is old, as if 20 years has disappeared. But before he can consummate some repulsive sexual act he is jolted back to his seat at the collider controls. Only to discover the whole world has been thrown into pandemonium - planes fallen from the sky, cars piled up on the highway, trains derailed.<br /><br />Every human on the planet lost consciousness for two minutes, and most catapulted into a vision of their future.<br /><br />The facility administrator, whose wife has yet to give birth, finds himself in an ugly confrontation with a surly, hostile son. Theo, Lloyd's young research partner, had no vision at all. He won't be around. His younger brother, an aspiring writer, envisions abject failure.<br /><br />Lloyd believes these future visions are immutable. Though he loves his fianc&eacute;e, Michiko (whose daughter was one of the accidental victims of the flash forward), there seems no point in marrying, since he will be married to another in 20 years. Theo, discovering that his death was a murder, becomes obsessed with finding his killer. Theo must believe he can change the future.<br /><br />Canadian author and Nebula Award-winner Sawyer (\\"Frameshift,\\" Factoring \\"Humanity\\"), is a crisp, incisive writer with a playful and keen imagination. He generates plenty of action from his psychological and paradoxical what-ifing. Excellent sci-fi which proves, whether Sawyer thinks so or not, that a glimpse of the future is a dangerous thing.
B000OYC3J8|1.0|I find this release to be no different than any other the Stripes have put out. There is really only a couple of works that are worthwhile, with the larger portion being there to satisfy the freaks that are satisfied by weirdness for being weirdness.

Jack should put out fewer albums, with more quality creation...he is obviously capable from the good stuff...what little there is...Jack White, or Jack WHAT?
068815333X|5.0|\\"The first time I met Karen Nichols, she struck me as the kind of woman who ironed her socks.\\" Dennis Lehane's sharp, humorous, pointed way with words lets us know, even if his Boston private detective, Patrick Kenzie, is at first bemused and beguiled, that there is something pressurized under all that gentility.<br /><br />He solves her stalker problem with ruthless aplomb and forgets about her, too busy to return a call some weeks later. Then Karen is dead, a suicide, having jumped naked from the Custom House. Wondering what upheaval could transform a woman's life so drastically, Kenzie learns enough about her peculiar Weston family, her boyfriend's odd accident and her downward spiral into homelessness and prostitution to enlist the aid of his ex-partner and ex-lover Angela Gennaro and his dangerously loyal friend Bubba.<br /><br />Together they track down a sociopath whose favorite MO involves destruction of the psyche - tormenting his victims into killing themselves - only to find he's already got the trio comfortably in his cold sights.<br /><br />The resulting game of wits and violence is nightmarishly thrilling, endlessly suspenseful, snapping at its own tail. Lehane's writing is gritty, witty and human, uncomfortably eye-to-eye with a Boston underside that lurks in the shadows of trendy coffee shops, hallowed landmarks and shady parks.<br /><br />Deft plotting, edgy dialogue and vivid, unsentimental prose place Lehane (\\"Gone, Baby, Gone,\\" \\"Sacred,\\" \\"Darkness, Take My Hand\\") among the very best.

0226264211|3.0|Overview / Review:  Milton Friedman, like him or hate him, is an essential economic theorist to tackle if one is interested in that field or in theories of economic justice.  Having a progressive bias, I disagree strongly with many Friedman's theories.  Having said that, for anyone interested in getting the essentials of his \\"liberal\\" (used in the older, more classic sense) economic views would do well to read this book.  Friedman is opposed to state intervention in individual freedom, so many see Friedman as a modern counterpart to Adam Smith.  Friedman advocates a free-market economy, with minimal taxation and government interference, because he believes the free market approach assures the greatest measure of freedom, justice, and overall affluence.  Many modern conservatives have echoed the arguments he makes herein.<br />Friedman is actually convincing in his review on a few counts - the abuse of licensure, the problems of tax loopholes, and the fact that there are frequent shortcomings of the well-intended social welfare state.  Having said that, however, Friedman does seem unduly biased in favor of a society so individualistic it is therefore almost atomistic, with little to no social cohesion.  Some of his arguments are more assertions and claims than full-blown arguments, and one wishes he had addressed major issues in more detail (perhaps he does elsewhere).  The book's virtue is that it is brief, but its weakness is also that its arguments are often too brief, and too compact.  Karl Marx for example, has many faults in his theory that can be found, but Friedman too casually blows off Marx in about one page of analysis (Chapter 10, p. 167-8).  Friedman's argument for a very limited government, and against socialism/communism, would have been more convincing if he had devoted a full chapter to Marx for one, and more attention to other matters of social justice, inequality, and oppression.<br />In a nutshell: this book encapsulates Friedman's \\"liberal\\" or laissez-faire approach to a wide range of issues on economics, government, and capitalism.  The free individual is given utmost importance, and government that governs best is that which governs (or interferes) least in his Friedman's view.  Not convincing from the standpoint of those interested in progressive social justice (Niebuhr's views on selfishness and power are more cogent), but essential to read and analyze if one is interested in economics and ethics.
032147404X|2.0|I recently purchased a Canon Digital Rebel XTi, and thought this book might help me make the most of my new camera.  Unfortunately, I found that its useful contents can be completely summarized as follows: Use a tripod, and spend the money for quality lenses and filters.  The rest of the contents were either not particularly helpful, or even more obvious than the above.  The author also injects a fair amount of bad humor which may appeal to some readers, but didn't to me at all.

He has not been around the block enough times to have a problem with the movie's profound lack of originality. I would have not been surprised to have a Wookie poke its head through the trees and I would have cheered if I saw Xena's chakram fly threw the air bouncing off of every knuckle-headed cliche and generally mixing things up. Alas, it seems not to be.    One star for me, five from my son. 6 stars in total ÷ 2 people = 3 stars.

Watching this movie,then seeing Star Trek,its easy to see where Gene Roddenberry got the idea for the light effects in his transporter sequences.The behind-the-scenes feature was as interesting as the movie itself.In fact it makes the movie more enjoyable. To top it off, there's a 3-inch model of Robby the Robot which makes it a super package.Highly recommended!!!  **********
B0008JIJ2E|5.0|In 1984 Columbia Pictures released one of the best teen movies of all time. These days \\"teen movie\\" has come to imply a brainless flick about brainless characters working their way through a brainless script. (Eurotrip, anyone?) We may call The Karate Kid a teen movie only in the sense that most of its characters are teens, the concerns it addresses resonate especially strongly with the young, and yes, it has a powerful message for those approaching adulthood.    Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) has just moved from New Jersey to California's San Fernando Valley. Almost immediately he falls for rich girl Ali (and considering Ali is played by a 20-year old Elisabeth Shue, who can blame him) which brings him into conflict with a group of bad boy karate students, primarily Ali's ex-boyfriend Johnny, leading to a series of bad beatings for Daniel. As Daniel pithily sums things up, \\"Problem is, I'm getting my ass kicked every other day.\\" In the real world, police would probably be called and assault charges pressed after some of the stuff these guys pull, but Daniel, young though he is, has that whole manly man, New Jersey tough guy I-don't-narc thing going, so that's a non-option.     One night during a particularly brutal beating, Daniel is rescued and his attackers soundly thrashed by an apparently unlikely savior: the middle-aged Okinawan maintenance man at Daniel's apartment complex, Mr. Miyagi. Miyagi works a deal with the karate student's arrogant, overbearing sensei: his students will lay off Daniel until a karate tournament two months hence, at which time Daniel will face them in the ring.    This leads to some of the most fondly remembered scenes, and unforgettable imagery and dialogue, in the movie as Miyagi begins to teach Daniel unarmed combat skills under the guise of household maintenance chores. \\"Wax on, wax off\\" immediately and indelibly worked itself into American pop culture. This has persisted into the 21st Century. Today, and perhaps forever, even people who've never seen this film recognize \\"Wax on, wax off\\" and \\"Mr. Miyagi\\" has become shorthand for a well-intentioned and highly skilled though somewhat pedantic and obscure person.    What The Karate Kid has going for it, more than anything else, is the chemistry between its two leads. Ralph Macchio and Noriyuki \\"Pat\\" Morita both fully inhabit their roles, as a childless father and fatherless child find each other. (Though Daniel's absent father is never explained, I suspect divorce.) Macchio was 22 when he made this movie, believably playing a mid-teen, and showed immense presence and acting chops, by turns brave and scared, stubborn and decent, with a level of good looks and talent that should have led to a more successful career than he eventually had. Pat Morita as Mr. Miyagi is just wonderful, grumping, huffing, spouting aphorisms left and right, and just generally creating an endearing, absolutely unforgettable character. Elisabeth Shue as Ali is amazingly beautiful (and, 20-plus years later, as anyone who's seen Hide and Seek can attest, gives persuasive evidence for the existence of a Fountain of Youth) and her character so sweet and thoroughly decent it's believable Daniel would fight against immense odds to be with her.    The karate tournament sequence is thrilling, although, I do have to say, the less you know about how such events work in the real world the more you'll probably enjoy it. Writer Robert Mark Kamen either knew very little about such things or chose artistic license and drama over strict adherence to fact. For instance, as badly and visibly as Daniel was limping after his knee injury there's no way on God's green earth that tournament officials would have let him compete in the final bout against Johnny. As soon as Johnny did that elbow strike to Daniel's already injured knee, he would have been not only instantly disqualified from the match but banned from the sport entirely. And so on. In this sense we just have to suspend our disbeliefand go for it.    Unlike the typical teen movie, The Karate Kid, without being preachy or overbearing, has many things to say. It's about the importance of family, and that we're not limited in family simply to that we're born into - we can CHOOSE our family. It's about finding the courage to stand up for ourselves, both morally and physically. It's about the power of self-discipline and love to prevail in a sometimes violent world.
B000RO9PXC|1.0|I was excited when I saw this CD set was coming out. I bought The Doors In Concert several years ago, so I was hoping this was more of the same. When I listened to this new release, I couldn't have been more disappointed. Jim Morrison is so obliterated through most of it that he mumbles lyrics and is totally out of key. I guess the surviving members of the band must be hard up for money to put something like this out there. Frankly, they'd have to pay me to keep a copy. Don't waste your money.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Title tells all: the best Bond movie ever.  All the thrills and excitement, but very real, less of the fantasy, silly Bond (ech... Roger Moore), and great insight to the character of Bond himself.  Daniel Craig was a surprising, but inspired choice. He equals Sean Connery at his best in every way, yet is completely different: grittier, rawer, more feral, less slick.  This is the movie that creates the depth missing from all previous films of the franchise.  Amazing performances from the cast overall (of course including the incomparable Judi Dench), great direction both for action and quieter moments.  The script at first viewing seemed a little jumpy -- from location to location to location -- but that's a Bond trademark, and on second viewing, it seemed necessary to the plot.  There are delicious moments for the Bond fan that establish how he went from plain Bond to \\"Bond, James Bond,\\" including a take on the \\"shaken, not stirred\\" mantra that will make any dedicated 007-phile laugh out loud.  This is the only Bond movie I own -- the only one that holds up to repeated viewings for something more than campy joke value.

B00064MW6K|5.0|I can not figure out why most of the other reviewers of this movie give it two stars and then proceed to write a review of how good the movie is.  This is just a great movie to kick back and watch and relax.  Halle Berry \\"slinks\\" and struts around in this movie in a way that I find totally provocative and sexy.

0060589469|4.0|The book is based on true accounts experienced by the author. The book doesn't really talk about Zen, but is more based on Western Philosophy. The author writes, \\"What follows is based on actual occurrences. Although much has been changed for rhetorical purposes, it must be regarded in its essence as fact. However, it should in no way be associated with that great body of factual information relating to orthodox Zen Buddhist practice. It's not very factual on motorcycles, either.\\"    The book is about the author's cross-country motorcycle trip with his 8 year old son Chris, which leads to a journey of self-discovery. It is an examination of the spiritual relationship between a parent and a child, and man's search for reason. During this journey, the author teaches us about life and the human condition in a profound and thought-provoking way. It is a terrific book about philosophy and life, albeit a difficult read. After reading this book, you might reevaluate the way you live, go on a personal quest for the meaning of life, and be interested in reading more books on philosophy. In my case, the book made me want to read more about Kant and Hume, and review some of the books I read before on Plato and Aristotle.    Some of the deep philosophical questions and conundrums raised by the author are:     (a) Before Newton discovered The Law of Gravity, was there gravity? Did gravity exist before Newton or is it the thought of Gravity that suddenly manifested the Law of Gravity? Is it the thought of something that suddenly creates it?     (b) The Arabs and Indians used the `zero' before the Romans and Greeks. Why did the Greeks not invent the zero? How did their societies function for so long without the zero? Could it have continued without the discovery of `zero'? Was the `zero' always there regardless of whether it was discovered or not?    (c) All arguments, solutions, and scientific `truths' have already been invented. We simply discover the best solution.    (d) How do we define the \\"present\\" when everything we're conscious of has already happened, and is already a part of the past?    (e) Which self is the real you?     (f) What is good and what is bad? The book opens with the following quote:     \\"And what is good, Phaedrus,   and what is not good--  Need we ask anyone to tell us these things?\\"    (g) \\"Astronomers would be telling mankind that if he looked long enough through a telescope powerful enough, what he would see is the back of his own head.\\"    (h) In life there is no grade, no pass or fail.

Plato and Aristotle, the author argues, conceived a system of thought in which beauty is severed from functionality. Functionality became less attractive to us than beauty. Plato and Aristotle, according to the author, committed a murderous act by this system of thought that is still carried out till today. \\"Quality\\" has thus been victimized.    The author went insane as a graduate student as he searched for the answer to \\"what is quality?\\", and spent considerable time at the asylum. He was subjected to shock treatments that wiped out his personality and most of his memory. He later realized that he was not really insane, but thought in a different level than most people.    Pirsig sees the problems in our world as the result of an overemphasis on beauty, when functionality is more essential. One reviewer puts it nicely, \\"...pure `function' has problems of its own. For example, our bodily organs carry out the function of allowing us to live, but one doesn't really desire for our skin to be translucent so we can watch these functions. In fact, we would have a revulsion to such a thing. Therefore, we have a combination of both \\"form\\" [beauty] and \\"function\\"; our organs work very well without our having to see them. This is the desirable state. This desirable state is called `Quality'.\\"     However, `Quality' is indefinable. It comes before thought, and before actions. Any attempt at describing it is useless, because as soon as you attempt to, you are only talking about one aspect of it.    This is one of those books that you either both understand and enjoy or you don't. It is really all about timing, your past experiences and knowledge, and your reasons for reading this book in the first place. If you don't understand it put it down and wait until the time is right. Don't throw it away!    Read this book slowly if you really want to understand it. If you like to read thought provoking and intellectually challenging books, you will love it!    To close, one reviewer wrote, \\"Many of the negative reviews are from people who had a preconceived notion of what this book was before they read it (either from the title or from a recommendation) and were upset that it didn't meet their expectations. It seems to me that these folks have received their Zen lesson...\\"
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Michael C. Hall has scored another hit with Showtime's \\"Dexter\\". The writing and acting on this show is superb. I watched Hall's work on \\"Six Feet Under\\" another show that displayed Hall's talent with dark comedy. I recently saw the complete first saeson of Dexter on videotape my significant other had taped these episodes. Hall's character walks the fine line between duty and vigilante justice. I hope that Hall gets the recognition he deserves come Emmy and Ace award season.
B00005JP5P|2.0|I wish I hadn't seen the trailer for \\"Sunshine\\" a number of months ago online. As soon as I saw it, I started to get worked up and excited about the new film from director Danny Boyle (\\"Trainspotting\\", \\"28 Days Later\\"), writer Alex Garland (\\"The Beach\\") and star Cillian Murphy (\\"28 Days Later\\", \\"Batman Begins\\", \\"Red Eye). This is clearly a case of my expectations exceeding the actual film.<br /><br />Also, \\"Sunshine\\" brought back some bad memories. It was a night over Thanksgiving weekend, some years past, when my friend Luci and I entered a theater in eager anticipation of the new Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney film. Two hours later, our faith in each, my friend is a huge fan of Clooney and I am a huge fan of the director, was sorely tested. A science fiction film in which the characters talk for almost the entire film? Or stare with little emotion at each other? It sounds even worse than it actually was to sit through \\"Solaris\\".<br /><br />\\"Sunshine\\" isn't as bad as \\"Solaris\\" but it is a pretty big disappointment.<br /><br />The Icarus II is just a few days away from fulfilling its mission. The crew of 8, led by Captain Kaneda (Hiroyuki Sanada) awake after sixteen months in a deep sleep, their complex ship traveling through space, a payload of explosives larger than Manhattan at the front of their ship. Their mission? To deliver this payload and detonate as it hits the sun; the sun is dying and Earth is getting colder and colder. They realize they could be on a death mission, but their lives are inconsequential in comparison to the fate of mankind. The rest of the crew includes Capa (Cilllian Murphy), the physicist in charge of the payload of explosives, Corazon (Michelle Yeoh), the botanist overseeing the eco system on board the ship, which also helps to provide food and oxygen, Mace (Chris Evans), an engineer, Trey (Benedict Wong), the communications officer, Searle (Cliff Curtis), the crew's therapist, Harvey (Troy Garity), the second in command and Cassie (Rose Byrne), the pilot of the ship. As the ship gets closer and closer to the sun, things start to go wrong and they discover a signal coming from Icarus I, a ship thought lost seven years before. Then, they make a fateful decision.<br /><br />Directed by Danny Boyle, the trailer initially looked so exciting because I know Boyle generally works with lower budgets than most mainstream films receive.  Watching the trailer I was amazed by the special effects and the hints at a story blending elements of \\"2001\\", \\"Armageddon\\" and \\"Alien\\". And the special effects are impressive, but the combination of various other science fiction films, something that initially seemed so intriguing, has, in fact, simply created a mess of a narrative.<br /><br />The best thing about the film is the look. Boyle and his team have created an interesting and unusual environment within the spaceship. They do a great job of establishing the size of the environment and the unknown quality of this type of vessel. As this is only the second vessel to make this voyage, everything is a bit of a crapshoot. They can take all of the technology they have and put it together and hope that it will help these astronauts get to their destination, but they don't know. And the earlier vessel, the Icarus didn't make it. Perhaps it was something on the ship? They don't know. But they go with their educated guess. There is simply no alternative.<br /><br />The ship is a mixture of ideas from other sci fi films. There is a bit of \\"Outland\\" to it, in the sheer size. There is a bit of \\"Alien\\" to it, in the fact there are many places to hide. It has a lot of \\"2001\\" to it, in the fact people are living on the ship, hibernating, doing normal activities. Unfortunately, it has more than a little \\"Event Horizon\\" in it as well.<br /><br />We also get a real sense of the sun, which may seem like a silly thing to say, but they are going to try to restart the sun, so we have to feel the presence of this star throughout. As the ship approaches, there is a terrific scene when the ship turns slightly the wrong way, damaging the shields on the outside of the vessel. Two crewmembers have to go out and fix it, but they have to turn the ship in the opposite direction, to give them some protection from the sun. Naturally, this isn't as easy as it sounds.<br /><br />Less successful are the characters. For a film like this to work, we have to get a sense of what the stakes are. They talk about how they have to restart the sun, but we don't see why. We know the Earth will not survive without it, and we know this only because they talk about it. We never see any of the effects of the dying sun. When the characters talk about things we could, should see, we have to wonder why the filmmakers didn't just mount a radio play or write a book instead.<br /><br />In one scene, Capa (Murphy) sends a video greeting back to his folks at home. He struggles with it, because it may be the last time they ever hear his voice. But we don't ever see them, and get a sense of what this character's personal involvement is in this mission. This is the only attempt made to connect one of the crewmembers to the outside world. No one else seems to have a family or people to come home to. In most sci-fi films, we see some sort of communication from Earth, a tearful goodbye from a loved one to the heroic astronaut, a child's plea for their daddy to come home. I'm not saying \\"Sunshine\\" should have included such an obvious clich&eacute;, but it needs something to give us a reason to care for these characters.<br /><br />As it is, the crewmembers interact with one another. And they don't seem to like one another, or perhaps the weight of the mission is weighing heavily upon them. Ace (Chris Evans) sports shaggy hair and a beard until someone tells him to get a haircut. Why did he sport this long hair? Corazon (Yeoh) is in love with her rain forest garden. She even seems to consider it a living breathing human being. But why? Searle (Cliff Curtis) seems to go a little crazy while watching the sun. But why?<br /><br />Because these things aren't explained, we really don't get a feel for these characters. Because we don't have a feel for the characters, we don't really care what happens to them.<br /><br />Also, \\"Sunshine\\" repeats a number of things. I'm not sure why this is done, perhaps to impart how important these various things are. But it doesn't work. There are a few scenes in which crewmembers are trying to correct something that has gone wrong. Naturally, they want to save the people involved, but then a crewmember solemnly intones, \\"We're going to do what we should do. For the good of the mission\\". I half expected them to stand in their superhero pose and lift their face to the sky, staring defiantly towards the heavens. So, we get it, the mission is more important than a handful of astronauts. There are millions of people on Earth who could die. Later, someone else makes virtually the same comment, and we get virtually the same message. Well, the third time, you have to wonder if the filmmakers were paying attention.<br /><br />And then the ending. It just doesn't make any sense. It seems like the filmmakers wanted to pay homage to one last great sci fi film from their past, unfortunately, they chose \\"Event Horizon\\", and decided to throw in a little crazy subplot. It might have worked. If they had established the motivation, the reason, the meaning of these actions.<br /><br />\\"Sunshine\\" is a big disappointment.e ship turns slightly the wrong way, damaging the shields on the outside of the vessel.

1599869470|5.0|If you are into this sort of thing; that is, self-development at all cost, even though this book was written in the early part of the 20th century, it is very much appropriate for people who are interested in self-evolution - self-development, in 2007.  It explains in very clear, concise terms how to go about getting what you want at a deep level in a \\"weekly lesson format\\".  As within, so without.  I have been reading and searching extensively for the last 30 years and I do not hesitate to recommend this book very highly.
B0002Y4TM4|5.0|If you're searching for another \\"Brave\\", look no further than \\"Marbles\\".  I actually prefer Fish-era Marillion to Hogarth, but the greatness of \\"Brave\\" cannot be denied.  With this release, Marillion has once again delivered an emotionally-driven concept album with beautiful lyrics and a tight progressive sound.  This recording was actually purchased by fans before it was even recorded, as the band was suffering from not being signed to a major label, and needed fans to invest their money and faith in the ability of Marillion to record an acceptable piece of music.    Hogarth is superb on this album; he sounds like Bono from U2 at times. (Listen to the only 'pop' song, \\"You're Gone\\").  At times Marillion is spacey on this disc such as in the beginning of the first track, \\"The Invisible Man,\\" and reminds the listener of early Pink Floyd or King Crimson.  At other times, it's Marillion's typical gut-wrenching, tear inducing musical bliss.  \\"Neverland\\" hits the listener like a gust of wind coming in from the ocean on a warm summer night, and is easily one of this band's most epic tracks of their entire catalogue.  I must also give kudos to Steve Rothery who puts together some nice acoustic guitar work on the track \\"Don't Hurt Yourself\\".  On the other hand, his electric performance is full of feeling and emotion and adds a powerful element to this release that propels it into the upper echelons of H-era Marillion.    Altogether, this is a fantastic album, and I'd recommend it as a follow-up to any fan of \\"Brave\\" or even of their 80's material.

B000PFUAO6|5.0|For the first time in a while, I truly believe Dream Theater has released an exceptionally written and recorded album.  It certainly caught my attention.  I've been a fan of this band since the early 90's and while I love \\"Awake\\" and \\"Images and Words\\", much of that material has lost its shine for me.  As opposed to bands that have sounded the same for last two decades (Iron Maiden), Dream Theater has always reached out and developed their sound.  For the most part, their evolution has made sense and I believe delivers fans with amazing music with few breaks in between releases.  I am absolutely astonished by all the negative reviews \\"Systematic Chaos\\" has received.  For some reason, rock and metal fans can't handle any kind of change in their bands, and it makes absolutely no sense to me.    After \\"Scenes From A Memory\\", it always sounded to me as if the band was searching for a new sound in an almost \\"learn-as-you-go\\" recording technique.  Because of this, the music suffered certain inconsistencies.  For example, while the entire second disc of \\"6 Degrees\\" was basically a masterful hour long medley of different influences and styles, I found songs like the 'stem cell song' to be the equivalent of garbage.  \\"Train of Thought\\" was a nice surprise with its dark, guitar-driven sound, but it seemed more metal than prog.  Again, a work in progress.  I've got to be honest with you - I thought \\"Octavarium\\" was horrible.  So with this up and down behavior I was reluctant to even buy \\"Systematic Chaos\\".  Boy was I wrong.    The price of this cd is worth the first minute of the first song alone, which sounds more like Liquid Tension Experiment than anything Dream Theater has written in the last few years.  Metal influences like Pantera and Metallica can be heard throughout this release but also progressive music ala Marillion or ELP.  For once, I feel like Dream Theater has achieved a healthy balance between their prog and metal sides. I'm not going to give a song-by-song review...listen for yourself.  I would just urge Dream Theater fans to stop using \\"Images and Words\\" as a point of reference as to what Dream Theater \\"should sound like\\".  Dream Theater should sound like they always have, and as they continue to sound.    As far as the musical performances go, my only complaint would be James LaBrie.  At times I think he tries to sound original and ends up sounding like a fool.  Other than that, a stellar release!
B000O178BY|5.0|I'll be brief. Every time I listen to this album is like revisiting the dark side of the US (and the world) in our times: pseudo-religious fascism, jingoism, savage capitalism, the need to belong to something (even if odious). I could go on. Mr. Reznor has given us another masterpiece, full of poignantly insightful lyrics and music that is at the same time beautiful and powerful enough to blast your brain to pieces. I love it.
0618680004|1.0|Ridiculous over-generalizations do not a case make.  Dawkins, eager to believe that all Christians are living and thinking in the 15th century, takes statistics to mean whatever he wants them to mean--so that, for example, when religious respondents predictably answer \\"Yes\\" to basic Sunday School questions, this somehow portends a theocracy in which all rational people are put to the sword, or something.  In which case, Dawkins needn't worry--rationality isn't his bag.  How else to explain a writer whose prose is packed with metaphors but who himself refuses to believe that parables and/or symbols can possibly possess any meaning?  Who insists, through twisted logic, that those arguing in the name of science are exempt from the burden of proof (when, in fact, most of the arguments issued by Dawkins and his fans don't have anything to with natural selection, the shape and age of the earth, the force of gravity, or our solar system's place in the cosmos).  In fact, most of the claims issued by this paragon of reason are sadly in need of evidence--take, for instance, the bizarre idea that most Americans would react with joy to any indication that the End Times have arrived.  Really?  Yes, I remember (and I'm sure you do, too) the cheering crowds that gathered following the 9/11 attack.  Who can forget the posters and banners reading \\"The end is here!!  Hoorah!\\"?<br /><br />In paragraph after paragraph, Dawkins reads the Bible as literally and broadly as possible, ridiculing and condemning it as idiotic nonsense, while, hilariously, holding moderate and liberal Christians to task for not remaining true to its word!  That is, by whose authority are moderate to liberal Christians \\"fostering fanaticism\\"?  By the Good Book's, of course.  A book which Hawkins doesn't consider fit for the lowest landfill.<br /><br />The logic doesn't end there.  We learn that conservative Christians somehow speak for all Christians, that ancient texts can be assumed to contain the moral and philosophical values of 21st-century believers, and that, again, since religion is so irrational and theology such a farce of a study, anyone who attacks religion is exempt from having to prove a thing he or she asserts.  (90 percent of Christians voted for Bush?  Cool!  Don't worry about proof.)  The Scientific Method According to Dawkins--assume no burden of evidence for your own claims while demanding, in the most egoistic fashion possible, that your opponent \\"prove\\" his spiritual claims as if they were empirical in nature.<br /><br />Dawkins is a classic bigot.  He ridicules and lowers his opponents while, simultaneously, portraying them as a grave danger to himself and all others in his rac... I mean, group.  Erase your foe by insulting him AND making him an object of fear.  Make it clear that any attack on his beliefs or behavior are, by definition, nothing to be concerned about, since neither matter.<br /><br />Of course, Dawkins insists that he's no bully.  And no fundamentalist, either.  Oh, no, he's a believer in science, which apparently means he's correct by default-presumably, even when he isn't arguing from science. But a fundie isn't someone who presumes he's right as much as someone who presumes he can't be wrong.

B000GPIPT2|5.0|Though the original FRANKENSTEIN is not particularly scary to a modern viewer and is more inspired by Mary Shelley's groundbreaking gothic novel than true to it this classic film is still very worth seeing.  Boris Karloff has no dialogue beyond a growl as the monster yet with marvelous makeup and expressive eyes we actually find sympathy with Frankenstein's poor addled creation.  Karloff's portrayal and its clones are the monster we envision when we hear the word Frankenstein.  The scene with Maria (the little girl playing with the daisies) is restored to what director Whale originally intended and in this context we see the incident as a pathetic accident rather than just a mindless killing.  I kept waiting for the scene with the monster and the blind man but that occurs in the also worthy sequel BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN.  This is a short film of a little more than an hour and a must see for anyone interested in the history of film or the horror genre.

B000DWMN2S|5.0|This is a review of the movie and not the dvd product.<br /><br />I have just finished seeing this great masterpice of cinema, it symbolic and mixed of magical realism. The photography is impeccable and the pace while is slow, its the slowness that makes you feel the levity of being, its density is packed with music so mystical, there is the violin playing the sad jewish melodies of a town that disappear,there are the mid-eastern voices, the almost latin rhythms of typical ukainian folk... the bizarre characters, with the russian or ukrainian dialogues mixed with a comic looking american fellow who can communicate through a even more hilarical ukranian who distort just about anything he says or hears.. this movie is poetry..<br /><br />I have seen the closing need of those who lived the holocoust, after so many years, they go back to Poland, Ukraine, etc I always wondered why?...this movie has made me understand that a bit, at the end we all belong to the earth that saw us born, we need to reconcile with what was abruptly taken...its the closing process that brings new life to the characters here, that unites them through an invisible thread that leads them to the greatest gift of closure: peace<br /><br />The most moving part to me, was when the old woman, who has lived in a time capsule since the WWII asked: is the war over?...<br /><br />Can we say the war is really over? will it ever be over?
0743454537|5.0|I had never picked up a Jodi Picoult book before, but after several friends recommended \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" to me, I thought I ought to give it a try.  From the start, the book was simply captivating. Even though it is more than four hundred pages long, I was done with it in less than 2 days. A real page turner.  I'm sure you know the subject of the book from the summary, but the ending is completely unexpected. Actually, the ending was really my least favorite part of the book.   At first, as the reader, you assume you are going to sympathize with young Anna, the third child of the family that was concieved to be a genetic match to her older sister. However, the author writes each chapter from another character's point of view, so you get everyone's side of the story. The way Picoult manages to adjust her writing style to fit each character she has created is amazing.  I would definitely recommend this book, as I already have to many friends. However, have tissues nearby because it is a tear jerker.

B000OCXMAE|3.0|This CD was okay.  It would have probably even been good if I hadn't been spoiled by their first two albums.  There was not a single song on either of their first two albums that I didn't absolutely love.  This album has a couple of really good songs and a whole lot of filler, which is typical of most albums out there.  I just expected more from LP than I do from most bands.    I like \\"Given Up\\" and \\"What I've Done\\" (over-hype and all), and the rest of the songs are okay except \\"Bleed It Out\\" - that one just reminds me of a square dance and I always want to jump up and swing my partner.  If you don't get distracted by the square dance beat, though, it's also an okay song.    Bottom line: this CD is not a total waste.  It's just not as good as I thought it would be.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|yeah, I know all the wannabe metalheads are gonna want to rip me a new one for calling this underrated, but all they can do is leave an immature comment on my review, so I'll just let em. Scream at your computer if you want. I'm sure it'll cry for you.<br />Most of the negative comments on this band/album are quite amusing, actually. Especially since most of the negative reviewers just say \\"DEY'RE NOT METAL\\" and repeat that over and over again. They probably have only heard Bat Country. And I don't see why fans of the first 2 albums don't like this. It's really not that different. So M. Shadows isn't screaming. So they're on mtv. So they won some \\"best new artist\\" award even though they're not a new artist. SO FREAKING WHAT? 2 of those \\"reasons\\" have absolutely nothing to do with the music, and as for M. Shadows not screaming, don't you think that was getting annoying? I sure thought it was. I'm not a big fan of Sounding the Seventh Trumpet mainly because M. Shadows is just screaming through alot of the songs. Hardly any melodic singing, and that's what I enjoy about him. If you guys don't like bands that don't scream, that's fine, but you don't have to be a gigantic jerk and take a dump on everyone else's good time.<br />As for my opinion on the album, I personally love it. I can listen to it because M. Shadows' annoying screaming is not present in this album. And the guitars may not be quite as heavy as before; boo hoo. People are always screaming out \\"A7X AREN'T METAL\\" but can never really prove their claims.<br />A truly great but underrated album by a truly great but underrated band

B000AM6OHQ|5.0|Okay, first I'd like to say this: a lot of people are going to tell you that this is the \\"last great Stones album\\". I personally disagree, and while my goal is not to twist anybody's arm into believing anything, I would advise anyone who has heard of the mid '70s albums without actually hearing them to give them a fair chance - Goats Head Soup, It's Only Rock and Roll, Black and Blue (which did grow on me, no matter what my rather weak review suggests) and Emotional Rescue are actually very enjoyable albums, though two of the four take a couple listens to sink in.<br />Anyway, let's talk about the album itself, shall we? Eighteen songs, not one of them even approaches bad. That's the mark of something good, you know? And most of the songs are ridiculously good, and not just the soul-tinged blues-rockers such as the total chaos of Rocks Out; the relentless boogie Rip This Joint; laid-back, sleazy, slide-guitar happy Tumbling Dice; the innuendo-loaded, horn-powered Lovin' Cup, with a great chorus; Keith's self-effacing vocal showcase Happy, the nonstop rocker All Down the Line, notable for its horn part; and the slow, riffy Soul Survivor. The genre experiments are just as good. They try country (Sweet Virginia, with a hilariously profane chorus; Torn and Frayed), and it works spectacularly. They do gospel (Shine a Light; Let it Loose; I Just Want to See His Face) in a stellar format - Shine a Light and Let It Loose are two of the group's most soulful, underrated ballads; they do blues (Casino Boogie; Hip Shake; Ventilator Blues; Stop Breakin' Down, with Mick Taylor playing an insane blues guitar solo) excellently. I mean, they even get away with a reggae song (Sweet Black Angel) - which may appear racist at first brush, but is really a tribute to Black Panther Angela Davis. It's not Bob Marley or anything, but it's pretty good. Okay, so MAYBE Turd on the Run is a bit of a filler, but even then Mick's harmonica works pretty well on the song, so hey. And did I mention that just about every single song on this album is a must-have, and even the ones that aren't are very enjoyable? That should be brought up, too.<br />This may be the greatest double album of all time (Hendrix's Electric Ladyland, the Allmans' Eat a Peach and Derek & the Dominoes' Layla are the only competitors that come to mind). Even if it isn't, your Stones collection is incomplete without Exile on Main Street. Hey, that rhymes! Ooh, I wrote it a crappy little jingle! How cool is that? Yeah, yeah, not very. Point is, go buy it if you don't have it, and give it a spin if you do.just about every single song on this album is a must-have, and even the ones that aren't are very enjoyable?

B00000G3PA|1.0|Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to ADD Theatre!    From what I recall of the press around this movie at the time it came out, there is not shot in this great stain on our cultural landscape that lasts more than five seconds. That might be fine if the shots that were in the film were of a higher quality. Alas, this is not the case.    This movie is loud, obnoxious, annoying and generally sucky. Its single redeeming virtue is that it's better than the American version of \\"Godzilla\\". Screening this film before detainees at Gitmo would likely constitute a violation of the Geneva Convention.    The SFX in the film are good, not great. The science is miserable. Not quite as bad as, say, having a shark roar, but bad. The acting is sub-par, which is really sad given the talent in this movie. The directing is about what you'd expect from Michael Bay. The man loves to use orange filters while shooting aircraft in flight. Don't even get me started about the overly jingoistic, rah-rah, Go, America!, nonsense at the end of the film.    This movie is a brutal, unforgiving, assualt on our senses and an insult to our intelligence. \\"Armageddon\\" came out at the same time as [[ASIN:B0002V7OI8 Deep Impact (Special Collector's Edition)]], a far superior film covering much the same subject matter. If you wanna see an asteroid movie, watch that. Ignore this.
B000AM6OKS|5.0|The Stones are cool. I'm praying you knew that going in, but if you didn't, this could make you realize that. In my opinion, this is the best album the Rolling Stones ever recorded - and, like its follow-up Exile on Main Street, a flawless collection of songs. The ballads really lead the way here, with my favorite song on the album being the heartbreaking country-rock classic Wild Horses - anybody who believes Mick Jagger doesn't have soul will probably change their mind instantly as soon as they hear this. It's one of the fifty or so best songs ever recorded. So is Moonlight Mile, another ballad, this one an orchestrated epic augmented by Mick Taylor's melodic, wonderful acoustic guitar playing and That Other Rolling Stone Named Mick's thoughtful, poetic lyrics - I know this sounds like pure hyperbole here, but it really is a drama about death and redemption with a not-so-subtle drug reference tossed in for extra measure. Again, if you don't think Mick's got soul, listen to this track.  The third out-and-out ballad is Sister Morphine, and while it isn't quite as good as Wild Horses or Moonlight Mile, that's all because those two songs are Wild Horses and Moonlight Mile, you know? A chilling tale of overdose coming from the Rolling Stones at arguably the height of their indulgences (though to be fair, they were ALWAYS indulgent when it came to drugs) propelled by Charlie Watts' drumming and guest star Ry Cooder's slide guitar. By the way, I'd like to give Ry a shout-out for his stellar playing on Love in Vain, too. Don't know a thing about his solo work, but now I'll have to check it out.<br />With all the ballads here, you may think the Stones have forgotten to rock. Oh no. Not at all. Rocking is not a problem for the group - the typical R&B influenced, typically sleazy, totally-not-PC Brown Sugar features an immortal riff and Bobby Keyes' best sax playing in the history of ever (okay, maybe Can't You Hear Me Knocking has that sax playing, but we'll get to that). The actually not sexist B*tch (if anything, that one's about booze and drugs) continues in that direction, and the horn section's playing is fantastic. So is Mick Taylor's. Mick Taylor rules, you know that? You can also catch one of his better guitar solos on Can't You Hear Me Knocking's Latin-jazz second half. Man, that part kicks butt! To think it only came about because someone left the tape running while Bobby Keyes was soloing after the song's hard-rock part ended (at least that's what I've heard). Well, it's one of their greatest moments, and if you need just one reason to buy this album (hell, you've got ten), buy it for the sax/guitar duel at the end. THAT is classic stuff. Anyway, let's get back to Taylor. Listen to Sway, which for some reason is not a radio favorite, if you want to hear that guy at the height of his powers. The guitar solos on that song... whoa.<br />Now there are three other songs, and each one is pretty different from the last. Dead Flowers one of the several undervalued gems you can find on this wonderful album, another one of their best country-rockers. Once again, it portrays drug addiction in a rather unflattering light (getting a little disillusioned with the rock 'n' roll lifestyle, are we Mick?) which I, a big supporter of the straight-edge life, have nothing but support for. More importantly, it's a great song with a catchy chorus and great piano fills and a fun pedal steel solo. I'm not a huge country fan, but I'm all for it when the Stones play country! Then there's the weird acoustic blues You Gotta Move (the album's lone cover), which I think is a pretty good song myself - especially the awesome \\"Ah-ha-ha-ha... ah-ha-ha-ha...\\" chant thingy near the end. A lot of people put the song down, and it does take some getting used to, and while I've heard a better, older version (not sure if it's Gary Davis' original or not, but it sounded good), this is quite a nice song in itself, and a good transition from side one to side two. I Got the Blues is another one people like to laugh at, but listen to Mick testify during the last ten or twenty seconds and tell me if that isn't pure soul. Oh, and the organ solo (played by none other than Mr. Billy Preston! R.I.P., man!) is amazing.<br />So yeah, there you go. Sticky Fingers is one of rock's all-time best albums - plenty of pure classics were put out in 1971, but this tops all of 'em. To the Stones, I say keep on rollin'! They haven't entered a truly stagnant period yet (though the '80s were pretty close), which is the sign of an immortal band.lues is another one people like to laugh at, but listen to Mick testify during the last ten or twenty seconds and tell me if that isn't pure soul.

B000E9910W|3.0|With a two CD set, there should be no radio edits. In fact, the CD doesn't say so on the back cover. It's only after you start playing the CDs, or load them into I-tunes, that you find out. What a rip off!      There is simply no excuse for not including the full version of the songs listed. None!  This mars what could have been a fantastic collection over two CDs.

My hope that a seemingly endless series of vignettes would build into something cohesive was never realized.  About five times during this oppressive dirge, I yelled out, \\"Direction!\\" A waste of time and money - wish I hadn't wasted nearly two hours of my life on it.
B000CSUUNC|4.0|Remain In Light followed the experimental textures of Fear Of Music, although here the polyrhythmic beats are more accessible especially on the awesome track Once In A Lifetime with its poetic lyrics and gripping hooks. My other favorites here are the funky dance track Crosseyed And Painless and Houses In Motion. The first is the apex of the first percussive and funky part of the album while the second has more in common with the last tracks like Listening Wind, Seen And Not Seen and Overload, where the tone becomes somber and introspective. Overall, the instrumental mix and the arrangements are most impressive and this album, though experimental, is more accessible than [[ASIN:B000002KNY Fear of Music]].<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0002IQMKM The Best of Talking Heads]]
B000007VCM|5.0|This album was without question one of the finest releases of the 80s.  I'm not sure what genre it belongs in but The Cult Love is perfection.  Its almost laughable that every track is just unrealistically awesome.  When you close a perfectly executed album with Black Angel you have entered the musical heavens.  This album stands the test of time as a absolute classic and deserves its ranking completely.  Electric and Sonic Temple are classics of their own, but they never topped this release (AND WHO COULD!)  Unreal.<br /><br />Honestly... picking a favorite song on this CD would be ridiculious and stupid.  Close your eyes and drop a finger on the track list.  You'll be right.
B00000G6PJ|4.0|This landmark album caused a stir more for its attitude than its musical worth. Not that the songs are bad, there's a lot of merit in the fast-paced ditties but it's the snarl that counts! The highlights are God Save The Queen that made no. 2 on the UK charts in the queen's jubilee year, Pretty Vacant with its hypnotic chorus that became a punk anthem and EMI, the vicious attack on the record company. These little rants spawned a movement and a thousand bands. The energy is awesome and the mood electric.

B000CSUUN2|4.0|Talking Heads' third album opens with the Dada poem I Zimbra set to a jungle drum beat. The music is quite experimental, having few of the accessible tunes and hooks that are found on the previous albums on songs like The Big Country and Take Me To The River or ground-breaking singles like Love Goes To Building On Fire. Instead, there are complex rhythmic textures throughout and the tone is rather ominous, especially on Life During Wartime. The only gripping melody is found on the oneiric excursion Heaven, a rumination on the nature of time and sequencing of events. Fear Of Music is thus their least accessible work.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0002IQMKM The Best of Talking Heads]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0747558361 Fa Fa Fa Fa Fa Fa]]

B000PKG6TE|4.0|Queens of the Stone Age is nothing if not consistent when it comes to their musical style (their lineup is a different story all together).  From the minute that \\"Era Vulgaris\\" kicks in, you know what you're in for, and you get it in spades.  Incredibly catchy, somewhat gritty quality, and a just plain groovy mood that gets orchestrated throughout the album's eleven tracks.  Witness opener \\"Turnin' on the Screw\\" which bleeds into rip-roarers like \\"Sick, Sick, Sick\\", \\"Misfit Love\\", \\"Make It Wit Chu\\", \\"3's & 7's\\", the instantly memorable and catchy \\"Suture Up Your Future\\", and the excellent closer \\"Run, Pig, Run\\".  There's not really anything here on \\"Era Vulgaris\\" that you haven't heard before from Josh Homme and co., but if you're a longtime fan of the band, this isn't a bad thing one bit.  As far as providing more than solid and inventive rock, \\"Era Vulgaris\\" delivers in all departments, and is yet again another wonderful entry in what is a very impressive and underrated discography.  All in all, whether you're a Queens of the Stone Age fan new or old, \\"Era Vulgaris\\" won't disappoint.

B00000GAIW|5.0|There are two irriating and related tendencies in Amazon customer reviews of rock music: 1) revisionism of a musical artist's legacy; 2) and the indiscriminate granting of the status of artistic greatness. Why is this? Because customer reviews of rock music are dominated by a band's fanatics. The result is the inflated greatness and revised assessment of musicans and their recorded output.<br /><br />In Amazon reviews, I have learned, for example, that Uli Jon Roth and Rory Gallagher are rock's greatest guitarists and that the usual suspects (e.g., SRV, Clapton, Hendrix, E. Van Halen, Jimmy Page) are all overrated due to mass ignorance of what truly constitutes greatness.<br /><br />In this set of reviews, I have discovered that Aqualung maybe makes the top four Tull albums but is, nonetheless, a \\"masterpiece.\\" If your part of those in the know, then you'd know this. If only you wrapped your ears around Songs from the Wood, then  . . . . Implied in all of this nonsense is more nonsense that Tull has generated at least 5 masterpieces. Tossing around the label of \\"masterpiece\\" as if it was a cigarette butt is neither attractive nor constructive.<br /><br />This is Tull's best album. I enjoy Benefit, Brick, Wood, etc. They are all fine works. However, this is a perfectly paced album with a solid, propulsive groove across 5-minute-average tracks that allow this the crossover necessary to make this a monument to Tull's artistic legacy to rock music. The album best represents Tull's blues-based, slightly classical-and-jazz inflected, hard driving, progressive rock sound and, therefore, the best showcase of the band's strengths.<br /><br />Tull fanatics might have other favorites. However, this is the one for those who simply want one Tull album and want to listen to one of rock's great albums. A \\"Greatest Hits\\" album simply does not justice to a band as album oriented as Tull.<br /><br />I deduct 1/2 star in this album due to the remastered sound, which may be due to a problem originating in the master tapes. While the sound is clean, it is remastered at an extraordinarily low volume and with a slightly diminished high end. While this is immediately noticeable and disappointing upon first listen, this may or may not have been the best way to optimize the album's fidelity.While the sound is clean, it is remastered at an extraordinarily low volume and with a slightly diminished high end.

B000IMUYJM|5.0|Bob Clark directed this 70s slasher gem and also directed the Christmas classic A Christmas story, along with other notable horror and comedies.  In this movie we know very little of the killer, allot of reviewers point out this adds to the mystery and the effectiveness and i would agree.  The 2006 remake fills in a back story of the killer and adds depth, but I, like most prefer this and my own imagination.  Perhaps this killer didn't get that proverbially red rider bee bee gun for Christmas and angered and unable to take out his frustrations with said gun he becomes a deranged killer.       Bad joke.    I consider myself a horror buff but this title for whatever reason has eluded me and I'm seeing it for the first time,(though if i review i watch the movie fresh anyhow) so I miss out on the effect it might have had on me as a younger kid.  Most horror films that are the scariest to us I believe stems from what we saw at a young and impressionable age, when our imaginations were at their peak.  However seeing this at 29 years old it still is a terrifying movie.  For me the part that grabbed me is when the older woman in charge of the girls says goodbye as they are going off with a search party leaving the old woman alone.  As viewers we know who is in that house, and I for a moment  thought of any late ominous night i had said goodbye to friends and was alone, leaves you with an eerie feeling.  In this horror film the killer isn't trying to get in to get you, he's already there so for us the scary part isn't don't go in the woods or who would go there it is when someone goes to bed, or friends leave then we feel the terror, I think we can relate to that terror.  For example think back to when your a child and you saw a horror movie, you really wanted to, you told your parents it's fine and it was.  Now it's dark out, soon it will be bedtime and we can't get those horror movie images out of our heads and we panic.  Maybe we have some friends over for a sleep over and we watch horror films all night, no big deal, then the next night there gone and were alone now those movies are scary, or even if it's daytime and we have to go into the basement alone to do laundry, maybe we sing aloud la la la calmly walking to put the laundry in then as if were tricking said ghosts we bolt for the upstairs.  That's the brief familiar feeling i got when they left for the search party leaving that woman in the house alone, that is where the movie for me got freaky and then didn't let up.  Some have pointed out how Halloween got some of it's ideas from Black Christmas, and that Halloween not Black Christmas is considered such a classic.  I would agree Black Christmas could've very well influenced Halloween, but i wouldn't say steal, Halloween is a classic and deservedly so and Black Christmas in any horror forum or discussion is also considered one by most.  However i would like to point out a movie i felt did directly take from this that i have not heard mentioned, When a Stranger Calls (1979).  Creepy phone calls, a traced call from police, and calls are coming from a second line in the house.  I mean now that is pretty specific, almost makes me like When a Stranger Calls less.  Also some things i thought noteworthy, the calls that come are very freaky the voice is reminiscent of the voices Regan would make from The Exorcist in one of her devilish outbursts.  Olivia Hussey is one of the sexiest sleepers.  The ending is top notch as well.  The only hole i wanted to say something about was the fact this guy is on a phone line upstairs screaming but nobody hears him in the house, however the good heavily outweighs the bad, this is a great horror film with good character development, this movie could even spark up a pro life debate.    The real horror is that Bob Clark and his son were killed by a drunk driver earlier this year April 4, 2007.

I think the movie is a tricky joke by the bald man with the half-hair on his face sides (is he the teenager police from Telemundo Jump Show?)  No movie would have a toaster in the bath.  Why does the half-hair face man talk out of the side of his mouth?  Why do they like riding horses that are not real?  This movie has silly hair and sneaky talkings; I would say not to watch with any animals, especially sleepy cat.

B000QUCNOK|4.0|Some believed that the novel titled \\"Das Parfum\\", for which this movie is based, could not be adequately translated onto film with any kind of satisfactory result. How does one translate scent and aroma into visual imagery, and attempt to draw the audience in to the mind of a murderer while displaying his particular flair for the dramatic and sensual experience of smell? The obvious answer would be that it is quite difficult.<br /><br />This film, however, pulls it off beautifully. Anyone who enjoys artistic film pieces would be able to appreciate \\"Perfume - The Story of a Murderer\\" for it's daring and visually stunning accomplishment. The tale of a young perfumer with an incredible sense of smell, who goes on to attempt to \\"bottle\\" the very essence of a woman (by murdering her in order to create his amazing perfumes) is a shocking mind trip, and ends up being quite disturbing, even while it is visually and cinematically beautiful.<br /><br />The sounds heard throughout the film, and the images flickering across the screen are combined to give the audience a distinct smell they are meant to interpret. It takes a bit of imagination to try to translate your own thoughts and feelings into an olfactory experience (the world has not yet invented a good smell-o-vision theatre, but if it did I believe this film would be one of the first screened).<br /><br />I enjoyed this film for it's artistic level, and it also doesn't hurt to be an Alan Rickman fan (who is mesmerizing in this movie, by the way). Anyone who enjoys period movies as well should be able to appreciate the story.<br /><br />Bottom line, I enjoyed it, despite it's distinctly disturbing nature at times.<br /><br />-- and just for anyone who's curious...the \\"ultimate\\" perfume seen at the end is actually just a mixture of Coke thinned with a little water...
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|I keep reading back through all of the negative reviews trying to understand what those reviewers didn't get from this release. I still can't figure it out.    I popped this baby in my cd player on the day it came out and it has not come out since. It is fantastic from start to finish and even after the 1000th listen, I still find something new in each of the songs, depending on my mood when I am hearing them.     I usually listen to the first 12 tracks straight through, and skip \\"Irvine\\" and the hidden track \\"Shivers\\". while those are both good songs, they just don;t seem to fit with the rest of the album in my opinion. They seem to end the whole experience on a \\"down\\" note. But the rest of the album moves me in ways that very few albums in this genre have in a long time. And just so you folks know, I was not a fan of Kellys when she was on Idol, nor a fan of her first album. I am not just a fan who will praise anyting she does, I listen and judge on a case by case basis. This is a fantastic album.    Just as a closing statement, \\"Sober\\" has to be one of the most powerful, poignant and moving songs I have heard in a while. The honest emotion that shines through gives me chills everytime I listen.     Bravo Kelly for making the album YOU wanted and that your heart was obviously put into. Ignore the haters and the fly by night fans who want you to repeat yourself over and over. If people want that, they have Britney and her ilk to turn to. Keep doing what you are doing. You do the music biz proud. We need more strong artists like you.

Plus, I absolutely hated their song \\"She Will Be Loved\\" from the last album due to overplay on the radio and because of the whiny vocals so I can't say why I bought this cd, other than I liked the cover and wanted something new. In any case, while I don't love it, I do like it. It's oddly upbeat for such normally depressing subjects (the usual I-lost-my-love or cheated-on-them teen angsty stuff) but overall it's catchy and inoffensive. I listen to it a lot at work. Not sure I'm going to be a long-term fan, because pop really isn't my style, but it's honestly not bad for what it is.
B000PMGS8G|4.0|If they remixed the audio to 5.1, there is one additional thing they should have added - a music-only track.

1400079276|4.0|I saw this on the bookshelves and bestseller lists and had been avoiding it for some time for a few reasons:    1. I'm generally not a fan of translations, especially from languages as different from English as Japanese  2. The whole surreal thing didn't seem that appealing  3. For some reason, the cover really annoyed me; It reminded me of the Frodo Baggins character in Sin City    Once I started reading, I was able to put all of that aside.  I got into the storyline, felt for the characters and ended up caring about the outcome.  The story is elegant, and although all the pieces don't quite fit together logically (at least to me), it ended up making enough sense.    My general advice is to read the first 30 or 40 pages before you decide the book is not for you.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|While I will try to say more about the movie than one previous reviewer who cautioned viewers to not read reviews before seeing this wonderful film, I am going to avoid giving too much detail.

I won't say what I was expecting so I won't give anything away. All I will reveal is that it is set in 1984-85 in East Berlin and concerns the surveillance of a celebrated writer by the state police who has not previously been suspected of any political disloyalty.<br /><br />Several things make this film stand out. The script is outstanding, with lots of twists and turns and surprises. But never do you get the sense that writer/director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck is ever being merely clever or that his intent is to build up the viewer's expectations merely to defeat them. Rather, he is telling what is a genuinely surprising story. Just as fine as the wonderful story, however, are the several great performances, above all that of Ulrich M&uuml;he in a magnificently understated performance as the officer in charge of the surveillance of the writer. It is a quietly powerful performance, but even though M&uuml;he expresses only the minutest emotion throughout, we never are left wondering what he is doing or what his motives are. It is a truly masterful job of acting. Very nearly as good as M&uuml;he is Sebastian Koch as the writer Georg Dreyman and Martina Gedeck as his actress girlfriend Christa-Maria Sieland. Though there are many other excellent performances as well, throughout I was constantly focused on three exceptional performances.<br /><br />The only thing negative that I can bring myself to say about this wonderful film is that I remain somewhat baffled that it won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film over PAN'S LABYRINTH. THE LIVES OF OTHERS is unquestionably one of the best movies made in the world in 2006, but PAN'S LABYRINTH will almost certainly be recalled as the one of the foremost films of the decade. But this has always been a category with curious results, results even more curios than those in the English language categories. CITY OF GOD was not even nominated for Best Foreign Film in the 2004 Oscars, even though it was far and away the most acclaimed film of the year. But I propose here that we take a more positive view of things. Although I believe that PAN'S LABYRINTH is the more unforgettable and moving film of the two, it is wonderful that two such remarkable films were made in the same year. At a time when American films continue to decline in quality, it was encouraging to see two foreign film that were both clearly superior to any of the five American films nominated for Best Picture. No one who loves movies should miss this great film.S LABYRINTH will almost certainly be recalled as the one of the foremost films of the decade.

B000R9J3X4|5.0|Just had to knock a few nanopoints off for not including other singles and hit tracks such as Androgyny, Run Baby Run, Sex Is Not The Enemy, and ESPECIALLY Breaking Up The Girl. But just a few nanopoints. Fact is, this is one of those \\"Not A Bad Track On It\\" CDs, and the quality of the tracks, the fine packaging and great liner notes, and the brilliant \\"Garbage Mixes\\" bonus disc are what makes this CD worth OWNING, rather than borrowing, ripping or stealing. Thanks, Garbage! I'll miss you, and hold out hope that we see you again for \\"Still More Garbage\\"! EDIT: I've been listening to the Mix CD all day today.... FANTASTIC!! Don't be cheap, drop the extra $2 for this \\"Special Edition\\" version, you will not regret it. More than worth it JUST for \\"Milk\\" remixed by Massive Attack. So hot.
B00006CXSS|4.0|Enough good things have been already said about this TV series so I am not going to dig into that part.  The flaw of this DVD set I am talking about is there is NO English subtitle available.  Yes, you got that right, NO ENGLISH SUBTITLE.  Only Spanish subtitle!  I have been lucky enough to get a Southeast Asia edition of this DVD box set and guess what, THE ASIAN VERSION HAVE ENGLISH SUBTITLE (along with 9 other different languages subtitle)!!!  Figure this out!  Since when do we become a Spanish speaking only country?  I have no problem with the Spanish subtitle being there, but why left out the English subtitle?  How are people with hearing problem who don't speak Spanish in this country going to watch this DVD box-set?

0451196716|4.0|Back when \\"Richard Bachman\\" was a pseudonym that really hid the identity of the author, Stephen King unearthed this malevolent dark gem from the literary graveyard of his college days. THE LONG WALK is a fearless (some may say tasteless) trek into mankind's tendency towards self-destruction. The story vehicle for this idea is a marathon in which 100 boys start walking--and never stop. The boys must maintain a continuous walking speed of four miles per hour. Monitored by a roving contingent of future-military-types, they may receive up to three warnings in a given hour before they are shot dead to the applause of their roadside audience.<br /><br />Enter Ray Garrity, the \\"hero\\" of the story. You follow his progress through the long walk as, one by one, his fellow contestants--many of whom he develops friendships with along the way--are unceremoniously dispatched. King takes you deep into the mind of this character, as he seeks to understand his own motivations for volunteering himself to this unholy contest. All the while, for seven dark and nightmarish days, he keeps putting one foot ... in front ... of the ... other.<br /><br />THE LONG WALK is not an especially long book, but it sure does feel like one, and in this case, that's a good and deliberate thing. King makes you feel the nightmare in drawn-out excruciating detail, leaving nothing to the reader's imagination .... until the end.<br /><br />I'm still not sure I understand what happened there, and I don't get the impression King fully understood himself. It's a flaw in an otherwise fantastically clear adventure into the worst in human nature. This is a great book that could have been brilliant if only it had had even a good ending.<br /><br />(This review has been posted by Marcus Damanda, author of the vampire book, TEETH: a Horror Fantasy.)
B000RIHBIE|2.0|Ok I don't understand the praise for this album. The songs are actually boring except for The Jester, March Of The Dogs and King of The Contradiction. I consider their last album Chuck to be their finest moment as the songs were more serious and alot heavier in message as well.  On this album they seem to have slipped back into the sound from their previous days which I thought was ok. They sound like Green Day and Blink 182 which isnt a good thing as those arent really GREAT Punk Rock bands. The songs are long as well, longer than usual for Sum 41 and the ideas arent really there.    I know this seems like a plug to diss this album but really folks its not that great
B00006RJHG|4.0|I like this stylish and atmospheric thriller by the director of A Christmas Story, but I didn't like it as I thought I was going too.<br />I guess I was too excited because of all the hype the movie had gotten.<br />Don't get me wrong though, I am not all disappointed I purchased it, and it's a masterpiece compared to the remake. I was just hoping for a more shocking film, I suppose.<br />P.S.-The remake is ok, but that back story is gross....

B00003CWPL|3.0|Well.....I was let down by this film. I loved Lynch's Muloholland Dr. and I remember liking Blue Velvet, but after all the hype of this mind-bender, I wasn't as impressed as I wanted to be. I love deep mind-boggling films that aren't supposed to make sense, but this wasn't as atmospheric and creepy like other Lynch films. What I can I expect though; this is (I believe) Lynch's debut feature lenghth film, and he definately improved his work on other films. I heard that this was Lynch's commentary on the birth of this first child. That makes sense; I guess he was frustrated with being a new parent, and it shows in this film. I'd recommend it only to true Lynchian fans who are curious about all of his work and to people who like ambigious, confusing films.<br />-Steven
0743201140|4.0|This book has been shared in numerous business environments.  From a large team to a small team, this book provides opportunities for discussion.  The book shares stories about invidivuals such as Colin Powel, Bill Gates, and Tiger Woods.  It is backed by the research of the Gallup organization and contains a code to an online feedback tool in StrengthsFinder.  The feedback tool is accurate and easy to use.<br /><br />While it does not truly tell you how to integrate your core strengths with that of another individual or, more importantly, your entire team...you have to pay much more money for their personalized or team course for that...it does provide direction on career development based on your identified strengths and shares insights on how managers can lead and interact with team members with particular strengths.  Good resource for a team or individual.  However, as with all assessments, balance good intent with common sense.

B00005AQE8|4.0|2PAC could have lived a story of success in the music world or in Hollywood, for that matter. Talented, presentable and above all else, Socially Conscionable. A tragic and forceful figure of the modern era able to put it all into lyrics. Prison term certainly adding the final touch, I think. 2PAC was not a congenial kind of guide to a lot of people and I am certain that is why he was finally killed. This guy was a \\"creative force\\" to be reckoned with, the language of the streets his most decisive weapon. His fertile mind his source. But the music sucks! If you take all the words out and just play the music this album is below par. A lot of sequenced sections, same notes played over and over with very rare exceptions. Rap is mostly a beat, I think I understand, and all it requires is the delivery of the words. Truly a world onto itself and God knows there are some monster rappers! But very few create their own music and play it with passion and skills. To the point that the music could stand alone if necessary if only to prove that music and rap can and should go hand to hand. How long can you repeat the same background music, or listen to drum machines before you start missing great sounds?! That said, 2PAC is undoubtedly one of my heroes for here is a man that had it going on and chose to keep challenging the forces that be. He could have sold out and age gracefully but he opted to be a Revolutionary! His Bros must be very proud of him and his enemies can probably kiss his ass for they were not the ones who were on the Spotlight! 5 Stars for his Talent but the music no more than a 3 Stars equals 4 Stars? PS Everyone in the album with him sounded so awesome, he must have been surrounded by Excellent Bros'!
B0000AQS0F|4.0|A taste worth acquiring. When my wife and I first sat to watch \\"Firefly\\" when it first aired, we were not sure what to make of it. It almost seemed like a cross between \\"Wagon Train\\" and \\"Star Trek\\". Was Gene Roddenbery's dream finally realized? No, Gene had nothing to do with this one, and Fox didn't seem like they wanted to give it much of a chance. Being fans of unusual SciFi like \\"Farscape\\" and \\"LEXX\\" we were willing to give it a chance. While we could my wife and I watched and thoroughly enjoyed the unusual characters, stories, and settings. I'm glad they were smart enough to make the \\"Serenity\\" movie as a pie in the face to Fox for cancelling this series. Great movie and great series. I recommend it to all, not just fans of SciFi. This appeals to a much wider group of people and beats the tar out of all the reality dregs the networks came up with at the same time. If there were more series like this and fewer reality shows, I think more people would be watching TV again. This reminded me a little of a future Western, and most of us wouldn't mind seeing a Western again after so many years of absence. If you think about it, if people were in fact colonizing new planets, they would in fact start out very low tech since they wouldn't have alot of money and it would be expensive and hard to get high tech equipment. I imaginge they would probably live very close to what is represented in this series. It is ashame the set only includes 11 episodes. It is good though to see three episodes that weren't aired originally. I still highly recommend it to fans of SciFi.
B000LXHK2C|5.0|A Good Year and a better life is what happens to Maxmillian Skinner in this excellent movie.  Sad to say some unneeded `bad' language, a little sex - no nudity.   The moral of this story is so well taught -  the values that come through in the end are life-changing - beautifully spread out before your eyes . . . almost like a fan.  Memorable. There is much to learn and take home in A Good Year. The lessons learned are great for all ages - seldom done this well.        Set in a vineyard in the south of France - Provence - wonderful setting (of course, you will want to buy a vineyard and live in France!) Beautifully done, clever script and the best flashbacks I have ever seen. The film score is brilliant - even if you don't like ALL of the music you will buy the CD. You will find it grows on you!  The music is actually amazing!    The clothes are wonderful - you will totally love the way Russell (Maxmillian) wears his Uncle's old collection of clothes - they do not fit at all but are reminiscent of boys wearing their grandfather's old clothing. It is amost a missed part of the story to many, I suppose.  Watch for the clothing!  Someone genius worked hard to make them a part of the story.     Again, I loved the flashbacks and you can see Russell Crowe's great sensitivity - which he always does so well - almost childlike in so many scenes - as he begins to discover WHO he really is and, better yet,  why he is, WHO he really is.      The supporting cast is wonderful - Albert Finney is a walk-a-way star in this beautiful film, not surprising! The younger boy, Max as a child, IS Max as a child.  Max even recognizes himself!  You will know for certain the boy is Russell Crowe as a young boy. The women are all lovely, very French and gorgeously charming!     The best part of the film (for me) is that the plot thickens - rather than weakens - throughout the movie - to the very end. I always like that - knowing that it can't end bad - it just can't - please don't end bad - butfor a brief moment you really think there might not be a Camelot.     There is not much Russell Crowe does in real life that pleasures me but his acting is always excellent. Too bad he doesn't imitate the men he plays in the films. I have now watched it three times and watched the playbacks once - all the way through.  I am glad I own the DVD!    I also love a film that makes me look at my own life and causes me to wonder where 'my' treasure is.

B000QFAJ7S|3.0|I am a big Kelly Clarkson fan, however, I found the CD overall to be somewhat understated.  There are a few good tunes, but I don't think this will be a big seller.  I wanted to love it, unfortunately, it was just an okay CD.  I hope the next one will be better.
B000OVLBIU|5.0|Entertaining, good visuals.
B000PMGNK4|4.0|Those who have been following the \\"Ghost in the Shell\\" film and TV adaptations know that \\"Ghost in the Shell - Solid State Society\\" follows the \\"Stand Alone Complex\\" narrative arc.  Unlike the two previous films (which belonged to an arc of their own), \\"Solid State Society\\", like the aforementioned television series, is extremely fast-paced, heavy in dialogue, and complex in plot.    For the average viewer, \\"Solid State Society\\" might pose far too much of a puzzle to be enjoyable: who is this character?  why does he matter?  what in the world is going on here?  who is this Puppeteer everyone keeps talking about?    But for the GiTS fan, especially a \\"Stand Alone Complex\\" fan, this film is extraordinary.  Picture, if you will, taking 4 full episodes of GiTS:SAC, giving them one solid plot with a beginning, middle, and end, and increasing the production value tenfold.  That's what this film is, essentially: like the \\"Star Trek\\" movies, it's not really much different than the series, but it looks, feels, and sounds far better than any individual episode.    LIMITED EDITION NOTES:    The Limited edition comes with a DTS audio track as well as the usual 5.1 track.  Definitely excellent sound if you have the audio equipment.  The second DVD includes a ridiculous number of extras, most of which I haven't bothered to watch.  But the great thing about the Limited Edition is the included Soundtrack CD.  It's very J-Pop/Techno/Fusion/Whatever, but it has certainly grown on me (and has a reserved spot in my car's CD set).    FINAL WORD:    If you like the \\"Stand Alone Complex\\" series, and have watched a majority of it, you ought to see this film.  And if you're a fan of the show's music, this particular edition of the movie is by far worth the extra cost.
B00008BRDX|5.0|REGGATTA DE BLANC is the second great CD in a row by the Police. It has some filler on it, but even those songs are better than most of the best songs by most bands of that era. \\"Message In A Bottle\\" and \\"Walking On The Moon\\" are superb examples of how guitarist Andy Summers uses his guitar to add texture and color instead of just doing lead solos, something novel for a trio at the time. Two songs here that are highly underrated are \\"Bring On The Night\\" and \\"No Time This Time.\\" Sting's opposition to Indonesia's trumped-up 2005 drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist makes this CD an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience.

B000QGEB12|4.0|Kung Fu Hustle is among my favorite films, not because I am a die-hard fan of Stephen Chow, but because I really liked the wild mix of comedy, adventure, crime caper and martial arts action. Most notably the excellent fight choreography by legendary Yuen Woo-Ping(who is also responsible for the fight scenes of  Kill Bill vol. 1, Fearless, The Matrix, Hero). As I said, I love KUNG FU HUSTLE and am very much looking forward for its sequel in 2008, so forgive me if I am a bit biased. (I will try my best not to lose my objectivity)<br /><br />The New \\"AXE KICKING EDITION\\" soon to be released by Sony is actually the REGION-3 Hong Kong release which I have. (I am certain)The Hong Kong release is still the one to go for if you have a multi-region dvd player. Since I almost know for certain that only fans of the film will be interested in this new edition, I will skip the plot summary. ( for those of you who haven't seen it, you may look up my review under the original U.S. DVD.)<br /><br />I will go straight to the differences between the previous dvd release and this new \\"Axe-kicking edition\\"(original Hong Kong release):<br />Mild spoilers ahead---<br /> Scene 1; The landlady throws her husband out of a window and drops a flower pot that ended up on the back of his head. The original cut showed a small pool of blood coming from his face, but the U.S. version digitally omitted it. The blood now appears as part of the film.<br />Scene 2; Sing heckles/insults the residents of Pig Sty Alley and gets hit in the tummy by a woman. The original cut showed Sing spitting up blood which landed on the woman's face, but the earlier U.S. version digitally removed the blood (though some still appeared around Sing's mouth). The blood now appears in this release.<br />Scene 3; This may be more offensive to others; it takes place on the eve of the big attack on Pig Sty Alley. The Hong Kong cut showed a man taking a d--p onto a piece of paper as the camera panned by, but the American version digitally removed the offensive feces. Now the paper is no longer blank. \\"Mr. Poo\\" makes an appearance!<br />Scene 4; Sing confronts \\"The Beast\\" in the casino, he gets hit hard on the chest twice. After the 2nd hit, blood sprays on The Beast's face and Sing is shown reeling backwards from the force of the punch with blood spurting from his mouth. The U.S. version PREVIOUSLY removed both of these sequential shots.<br />Scene 5; Also in the casino, Sing's head is hit on his face, hammered into the ground by The Beast. After the first hit, The Beast's bloody fist is shown emerging from the floor in slow motion...but the U.S. version removed this shot entirely.<br />Now for the DVD Picture and Sound quality--<br />2.35 Anamorphic Widescreen. The Picture is extremely sharp with solid Black levels. Colors are natural and enhancements are not noticeable. CGI effects suffer a bit of softness. But the transfer is clean and nice. It is the Hong Kong transfer from what I can tell.<br />Sound is in 5.1 Dolby/2.0 surround in English, French & Cantonese. I am a bit disappointed why Sony still didn't include the Cantonese 5.1 DTS track as in the original Hong Kong release. Why?!<br />EXTRAS: Stephen Chow interview--Bloopers/outtakes--Featurettes: w/ Yuen Woo-Ping, Oliver Wong(Production designer), Shirley Wong(Costumes)<br />Storyboard comparison--trailers--audio commentary<br />CLOSING: Kung Fu Hustle is one of the more entertaining (if not the most fun in 2004) imports. It mixes pop culture blends, over-the-top comedy, hard-hitting action while maintaining a profound respect for the spirit of Kung Fu. This new region 1 release is a bit confusing, while it contains the original cut of the film, it misses the original special features and the powerful DTS Cantonese Language track. I wouldn't advise a \\"double dip\\" for fans who own the first REGION 1 dvd, but for fans who doesn't own the movie, pick this new version up. However, the lack of DTS sound is a huge minus for this version. I STILL prefer the ORIGINAL Hong Kong region-3 release!<br />RECOMMENDED!! (Timidly)on.

1582701709|5.0|An awesome book, I would recommend getting it in CD format to put on your iPod for every day listening.  It is a simple concept,however being positive all the time is a bit exhausting but it is an everyday challenge and a good goal to have in a person's life....    It is so easy to go through your daily life and forget the importance of something so simple...it is a must read and it is definitely something worth having on your iPod or on a CD for your drive into work or out running errands...
1932907009|5.0|This is a no-nonsense, straight forward approach to constructing your screenplay. The suggestions are practical and based on his personal experience. It's amazingly accurate when you lay his structure up while watching a film.  He's absolutely right. Every successful film must have the elements he talks about. Structure is critical and he lays it out in workmanlike fashion.  Having taken numerous film writing courses and read like number of books, this is a gem. He provides an excellent outline as to how a screenplay needs to be structured, even to the point of what should happen on what page.  I was skeptical at first, but I tried following his advice and I have to say - he makes a strong case. He has an easy-to-read style that is both entertaining and understandable. I would rate this book as a must for anyone serious about writing a screenplay. Incidentally, I've met Blake and he is just as passionate in person as he is in the book.

B000QUCNP4|4.0|David Fincher knows how to go straight to the bone, whether that be by grisly effects or wearing down the psyches of his audience. In ZODIAC he traces the very long investigation of the serial killer in the 1960s and 1970s in the San Francisco area who was never found and has managed to mimic that interminably long yet fascinating exploration by taking close to 3 hours to unravel the bits and pieces of evidence that were to confound the police and the press alike. Based on the book by Robert Graysmith (the SF Chronicle cartoonist who became obsessed with the conundrum of the murders) and adapted for the screen by James Vanderbilt, ZODIAC holds the viewers' attention by its smart, edge of the seat development of what could easily been a too-long-song of a docudrama.<br /><br />Much of the success of the film is due to Fincher's pacing and yet a great deal of the credibility of the story falls in the capable hands of a very fine cast. Jake Gyllenhaal portrays the obsessed Graysmith, a man whose life as a cartoonist for the newspaper and as a husband to Melanie (Chloë Sevigny) and father to three children is gradually broken by his preoccupation with finding the serial killer named Zodiac. He is well supported by Mark Ruffalo as Inspector David Toschi and Anthony Edwards as Inspector William Armstrong, Robert Downey as the alcoholic reporter James Avery, Brian Cox as Melvin Belli, and Elias Koteas, John Carroll Lynch and others in brief but very important cameo roles.<br /><br />For some the film may feel like a long frustrating bore, but magnify that by the real life situation the Zodiac killer created over extended years and the frustration of the forces who wouldn't let the case die will be realized. Obsession such as this takes patience. The payoff is well worth it. Grady Harp, July 07

B000QFCD5O|4.0|The vintage tracks from Yes, ELP, & King Crimson alone were nearly worth buying the record.  I never thought the Buggles were anything to brag about since their only claim to fame was being the first video.. you know the rest.  They played that tune just to appease Geoff Downes who really never had any success on his own.  It was evident when he tried to hold Asia together after everyone split.  Anyway.... wish they would have recorded a show in the states somewhere, probably wouldn't have drawn what they did in Japan though.  Wish they would have put Starless & Bible Black on here.  Like I said up top, they earned some serious cool points for Roundabout, In the Court, etc... & did Steve Howe a solid by letting him do his virtuoso thing.  Should have went all out on Don't Cry... forget doing the acoustic version.

Not what i would expect from a member of one of the most professional fighting forces in the world.

0385340559|4.0|Lee Child's magnificent anti-hero, Jack Reacher, forged his legendary thinking and manhandling skills as a proud member of the military police.  As an officer among the special investigators, he was truly the \\"elite of the elite.\\"  For the past decade, he has been wandering the earth, having adventures and living his unique, nomadic life.<br /><br />But all that changes when one of his former MP comrades gets tossed from a helicopter at 3,000 feet, and Francis Neagley, another of Reacher's old team, sends him a cryptic, alarming message via his ATM.  It is a call to arms - you do not mess with the special investigators.<br /><br />Usually, Lee Child's plots involve Reacher saving someone who is at the mercy of a diabolical schemer.  In this case, Reacher does a bit of saving, but this case is more about revenge as more and more members from the old unit turn up as crushed corpses in the California desert.  A Jack Reacher focusing on vengeance brings to mind Bruce Banner's admonition: \\"don't make me angry - you wouldn't like me when I'm angry.\\"<br /><br />Reacher also usually works alone.  In \\"BL&T,\\" Reacher has several allies from the old unit.  Child does a decent job fleshing out these supporting characters and giving them plenty to do without spoiling the fun - this is Jack Reacher's show.  And Child gives Reacher plenty to do, although it must be said that there seems to be an unusually high amount of number-crunching in this novel when compared to the amount of fisticuffs.<br /><br />All the usual elements of a Jack Reacher novel are here - evil villain, hard-boiled banter, clever plot, good detective work.  But why only four stars?  Well, it is largely because we feel like we have covered this ground plenty of times with Reacher, and while the formula hasn't grown stale, there is little to separate this eleventh book in this series from the others that have come before.  This just shows how spoiled Child has made us over the years.<br /><br />If you are already a fan of Reacher, you will read this book regardless of what any reviewer says.  If you haven't yet started with Jack Reacher, don't start with this book.  Go back to \\"Killing Floor\\" so you can have a sense of where this hulking detective/nomad comes from.book regardless of what any reviewer says.

0316010669|5.0|I've always had these \\"gut feelings\\" that I couldn't explain, but which I've learned to trust.  Much like a woman's intuition or a cop's hunch, there are things that sometimes you just know, even though an attempt at explaining them would only leave you questioning yourself.  Blink explains these things, finally providing quantifiable meaning and terminology for the abstract \\"hocus pocus\\" of those things we just sort-of know, without knowing how.<br /><br />The chapters don't really flow the way I expect a book to flow -- each chapter is a wild departure from the last -- but they are tied together well enough to remind you of the overall theme.  The up-side of this is that each chapter allows you to look at the topic from a completely different point-of-view.<br /><br />For me, the best thing about this book is the wealth of real-world material used to make examples of the ideas being presented.  An amazing amount of leg-work must have been done to gather all this material and put it together under the common theme.<br /><br />Also, as a side-note, I find the concepts presented in this book to be useful to me as a software developer, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to anyone who works in a design capacity in their own career.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|'MASTER & COMMANDER' deliver a ROUSING & VISCERAL HIGH SEAS THRILLER      IN A NUTSHELL: DELIVERED A SENSE OF SUSTAINED EXPECTATION FROM BEGINNING TO END     It is delightful for see an action adventure feature film that so precisely brings us to a world far away from our times and places. We see and feel a lot here and this film is in no hurry to rush to the climax as one is very likely to be hooked after the first scene.       WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT:     'MASTER AND COMMANDER: The Far Side of the World', Directed by Peter Weir is a film based on two novels of the same names, set in the Napoleanic War by author Patrick O'Brian. Russell Crowe stars as Captain Jack Aubrey, of the HMS Surprise. Aubrey a is an able, strong and popular commanding officer with a mission. He is in pursuit of a rather mysterious and powerful phantom privateer of the French navy - the Acherson. The search takes them to the South Seas and around Cape Horn.     From the beginning, the film has a sense of adrenaline about it as we are presented with a few quiet moments before a battle with an unseen enemy. The ship, the sea, the men and the suspense of the unknown are thick throughout the opening scene which effectively sets the tone for the entire film.     --* THE MAJOR PLAYERS *--     Russell Crowe - Captain Jack Aubrey   Paul Bettany - Dr. Stephen Maturin   Billy Boyd - Barrett Bonden   James D'Arcy - 1st Lt. Tom Pullings   Lee Ingleby - Hollom, Midshipman   George Innes - Joe Plaice   Mark Lewis Jones - Mr. Hogg   Chris Larkin - Captain Howard   Richard McCabe - Mr. Higgins, Surgeon's Mate   Robert Pugh - Mr. Allen   David Threlfall - Killick   Max Pirkis - Lord Blackeney   Edward Woodall - 2nd Lt. William Mowett   Ian Mercer - Mr. Hollar   Max Benitz - Calamy, Midshipman     OSCARS FOR: BEST SOUND EDITING & BEST CINEMATOGRAPHY       ABOUT THE DVD: FLAWLESS SOUND & WIDESCREEN PRESENTATION - NO FEATURES     This DVD does not even have a Trailer or Commentary. No featurette, absolutely nothing. I suggest if you want these features that you carefully check which edition of this fine film you are getting as there are at least 7 DVD releases listed at Amazon.     BOTTOM LINE: ANOTHER TERRIFIC FILM THAT I THOUGHT I WOULDN'T LIKE     This film really delivers on a number of levels; action, suspense, natural wonders, good music and most of all, the big payoff for watching it through to the end. We do finally discover whether the Captain is driven by blind pride [as his closest friend the doctor suggests to him] or grim determination in the face of England's enemies at a desperate hour.
0061142026|5.0|I will admit to re-reading \\"stardust\\" pretty much for the sole reason that a movie version of it is coming out soon. The first time I read it, and liked it, but I never saw it as an especially spectacular book.<br /><br />However that could very well have been the intent of the author. \\"Stardust\\" is a true Victorian fairytale (with just the smallest sex scene thrown in) and like most Victorian novels I've read, it is more of a journey than a story with a huge explosive conflict and ending. This book is more like a puzzle, you get bits of information as you read that you must file away carefully for later because eventually they will form one cohesive picture and you will think, \\"Ah! So that's why....\\"<br /><br />The writing is charming, in the illustrated versions the pictures are charming and the plot is charming. Over all, this is a very charming little book (though it has the potential to make a very epic movie, a la `Lord of the Rings' with some minor adjustments.)<br /><br />Four point five stars.
B000000W5B|5.0|I must admit when this album was released it seemed like a let down. I'm sure in part, this was because it was impossible to follow \\"Exile On Main Street\\".....How could it not be overly criticized? Over the years it has really grown on me and I believe it to be one of their finest efforts. Considering Keith was so drugged out during this album it is unbelievably great! Besides wielding some huge hits \\"Heartbreaker\\" & \\"Angie\\" the album holds numerous gems like 100 Years ago,Star Star,Dancing with Mr. D, Coming Down Again, Silver Train and Winter. I might as well of named every song! A great offering from the Glimmer Twins and Co.

B000006TRV|5.0|SIMPLY STATED:Magnum Opus with a beautiful dose of David Gilmour                       There are some really terrific reviews here already, but I couldn't resist adding my two cents. As others have stated, THE WALL is a polarizing album -- people tend to love it or hate it. I'm one of the ones who love it. When I was introduced to THE WALL, I was going through some pretty rough times psychologically and my misery needed some company. I bought the double album and rented the movie from my local video store. I watched the movie first. I really think that this helped me to be able to grasp the narrative.     The music is somewhat dark, but not inaccessibly morose. Anyone who has ever experienced periods of melancholy should be able to tap into these feelings when listening. It is not an easy listen though. In order to fully appreciate the work, it is best to actively listen, preferably while blocking out other senses and thoughts (i.e., in a darkened room without distractions). I also find that it is impossible to share with others. If the co-listener is not a fan, it is embarrassing to listen to. It makes one feel exposed, uncomfortably naked. If the other participant is a fan, however, the experience is akin to the parallel play observed in toddlers. They are playing alongside each other, but they are not truly interacting.     Although the music is subordinate to the narrative, there are some truly sublime musical moments. The song \\"Comfortably Numb\\" is my favorite song of all time. If I can let myself relax, it transports me to another realm everytime I listen to it. The high-pitched ding heard during the chorus focuses my attention and makes me feel as though I am floating on air. Other standouts are \\"Hey You,\\" \\"Mother,\\" and \\"Run Like Hell.\\" Each is beautiful in its own way. \\"Hey You\\" is haunting both lyrically and musically. \\"Mother\\" is both stark and soothing. I love the back and forth between Waters and Gilmour (as in \\"Comfortably Numb\\"). \\"Run Like Hell\\" sets strong anti-fascism lyrics to a killer dance beat.     If you are psychologically-inclined, you will love THE WALL. Listen to it when you have the time, alone and in the dark. It just might transform you.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I was certain it was impossible to improve upon the BBC's stellar interpretation of P&P.  I was sure that no one could improve upon Jennifer Ehle and I was certain that Colin Firth was the penultimate Darcy.  This movie proved me wrong.    Firstly, I want to address Keira Knightley's interpretation of my all-time favorite literary heroine.  She had the spark and fire and quick wit that is so characteristic of Elizabeth.  I thought her performance was pitch perfect and I give her the edge of Ehle.  While I do really like Ehle's rather more sedate Elizabeth, I really liked Knightley's more impetuous version.  Her outbursts sprang from her with such passion and impatience that I felt she had really nailed the character.    As for Darcy, I love Firth's arrogant but socially awkward portrayal.  Because of this, I was glad to see Matthew Macfadyen play Darcy as something of a nerd.  It was an interpretation of Darcy that I'd never pictured but I think it worked splendidly.  Rather than being overtly haughty as Firth's Darcy was, Macfadyen's Darcy was painfully socially awkward and who came across as arrogant because of it.  His Darcy was intensely private and unwilling to give up his family secrets and yet all the more pained for how he knew it made him seem to Elizabeth.    The rest of the cast is stellar as well, though I won't go into great depth or I'll risk running on for pages.  I particularly liked Elizabeth's warm relationship with her father and the way his eyes teared over when he wished Elizabeth happiness in her betrothal.  I also liked the way Mrs. Bennett was made more complex and her motivations made more clear.  After all, what did a woman of that social standing have to do other than ensure her daughters made prosperous marriages?  Mrs. Bennett seems so silly until one considers just how stressful it must have been to have to worry about the welfare of so many girls and to be constantly conscious of how quickly they'd sink into poverty and oblivion if their father--the sole breadwinner--were to become ill or die.    The film itself is wonderfully layered and I find that with each viewing I see subtle things I had not before noticed.  It certainly bears repeat viewings not just for the wonderful story, gorgeous scenery, and stellar acting but also for the subtle background touches that become apparent once one focuses on them rather than the action occurring in the foreground.  This version is rife with small gestures and looks that speak volumes about what is occurring in the story.  Simply put, I adore this film.
B00006AW2M|5.0|I have been listening to a lot of Pompous individuals over the years who for whatever reason seem to think that \\"Their Satanic Majesties Request\\" is a direct rip-off of \\"Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band\\"!....... Wrong! \\"Satanic\\" is an excellent album filled with great original songs and IMHO is a better album than \\"Peppers\\"! .....Did I just write that? Yes! I did! This album really shows off the talents of the band and especially the late great Brian Jones. Who plays more instruments on this record than the others combined. From the aptly titled opening \\"Sing This all Together\\" into a classic stones guitar riffed \\"Citadel\\" we know we are going places we have never been before! The album features Bill Wyman's only lead vocal \\"In Another Land\\" and even though he isn't a \\"good\\" singer, the vocal does what it was intended to do. Going into \\"2000 Man\\", which is a very good song and finishing side one with a reprise of the first song \\"Sing This All Together(See What Happens)\\" The second side starts with the classic \\"She's A Rainbow\\" and then a very underrated pair \\"The Lantern\\" and \\"Gomper\\" before going into a fantastic Stones song \\"2000 Light Years From Home\\" before closing with \\"On With The Show\\" A Brilliant album!
B0000DJZA5|4.0|Many other reviews discuss the \\"Spectorisation\\" of three tracks, which is the most glaring difference between the original and this \\"naked\\" production. Personally, I like the orchestral versions better overall (sorry Paul).    However, for those who appreciate clear, crisp sound, this remixed CD wins hands-down. I'm a former audio engineer, and am very impressed. The stereo aspect is also superior. The energy seems better, too.    I just wish I could get the \\"Spectorised\\" cuts with this much clarity.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|FIRST OFF:     Beautiful, soft, colorful animation with incredible detail brings this character driven doggie-tale to life. The songs, like all great animated classics work into the plot and are a great aid in telling the story, making the film entertaining and making children of all ages happy.     BUT THERE IS MORE -- MUCH MORE: DOG'S TELL THEIR OWN TALE!     Dog's tell their own tale in this one. Unlike \\"101 Dalmations\\", which Disney also made several years after this film, the humans are basically not substancial characters. The humans' role is simply as a background setting for the tale of the Lady and the Tramp, which is completely appropriate for this kind of tale.     WHAT MAKES \\"THE LADY AND THE TRAMP SO DARN GOOD\\"?     1]- The 9 \\"Old Men\\" were really at the top of their game when they animated the major characters of the film. In the featurette, in the 50th anniversary edition, we see exactly what these very talented guys were aiming for and some of the interesting stuff they came up with for Walt Disney.     2]- The music and lyrics are well timed, entertaining and really help set up the many varying moods of the individual scenes. The soundtrack also furthers the plot, and helps us to really like who and what we are seeing on the screen. In short, the tunes help to humanize the doggies, and in that way assist in telling a multi-level tale that means something to kids, something to adults, and something collectively to everyone. \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\\" and \\"The Incredibles\\" also clearly illustrate that multi-level trait.     3]- The story itself is well constructed with clever while appropriate dialogue, and a very eclectic blend of characters with dogs and humans both being from a very broad and diverse background.     The small town, on the verge of the modern age, still is a special and desirable place to be in this film. Things like telephones and early automobiles are just barely hinted at in a few scenes.     4]- Cinemascope was used,for one of the first times in this film, and simply put it makes for a larger, broader world with a lot more background animation. Disney actually filmed two completely drawn versions of this film, Cinemascope [widescreen], and Full-Screen, because many theatres were not equipped to play cinemascope films in 1956.     DVD FEATURES: THIS 50TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION HAS ALL THE FEATURES & IS THE ONE TO GET!     LAST WORD:     Get the 50th Anniversary Edition if you want features and a remastered Cinemascope picture. We did and we are delighted.
0553213105|5.0|I adore and revere Austen and this book is, for me, the pinnacle.  It's such a masterwork of the English language, so richly layered and textured and such a sharp observation of the society in which Austen lived.  Read only at surface level, it seems little more than a sweet romance but when the text is examined deeply the mastery of Austen becomes apparent.<br /><br />Was Austen a feminist?  I'm not entirely convinced of this but what I do know is that she was keenly, keenly aware of the way her world worked.  She knew that the only power a woman had was to charm and flirt until she captured herself a rich husband.  A woman did not have the power to seek her own occupation and a sharp and educated mind was not exactly appreciated.  This is why Austen and her most bewitching heroine Elizabeth are so very subversive.  Austen's creation, like Austen herself, bucks the convention of the time and is determined to see her life played out on her own terms.  She will not settle for anything less than love and though that may seem simple to today's reader, it was anything but in an age when  money and status meant everything.  Elizabeth is not perfect.  She makes mistakes and she is judgmental at times but her greatest strength is her determination to be true to herself.<br /><br />And yet even though Austen makes such a strong case for independence of spirit, she is also kind to those who bow to convention.  Though Elizabeth's dear friend Charlotte makes a choice that initially seems extremely repugnant, it is easy to see that, really, Charlotte is simply doing what she must to survive.  It is not that Charlotte is any less true to herself than Elizabeth, it is simply that she is rather more practical and pragmatic.  She sees her situation in a very clear light and, in the end, chooses what is for her the lesser of two evils.  I think that Austen respected this as well.  Being brave and forging a new path is not for all of us.<br /><br />As for Darcy, he is also a productof his time.  He behaves in a way that society feels a man should.  At a very young age he must deal with gross abuses of his father's trust and a rather horrific betrayal of his family's kindness.  He is forced to shoulder responsibility at a time when his peers may have been busy gambling and chasing skirts.  There are few in whom Darcy can confide and he holds his cards so close to his chest that he must shut out others who could perhaps be of assistance to him.  Though his wealth and status seem to suggest that he is above the slings and arrows of society, it turns out that this assumption is a naive one.  Darcy is no more free to do whatever he likes than Elizabeth is.<br /><br />What makes this book so satisfying is that the hero and heroine triumph over their adverse circumstances.  At heart, Austen was a romantic.  She clearly had hope that the narrow confines of her world could stretch enough to allow for happiness and self-fulfillment.  She believed in the power of love to conquer some very daunting obstacles and she believed that love could help people grow into a better version of themselves.  I think it is this optimism that makes Austen so appealing to her readers.

The size is daunting, but with the amount of amazing pictures hleping to carry the story along, you suddenly realize you are 1/2 thru!!  Great story, amazing art. A friend even got some of the old movies mentioned in the story off Netflixs and we watched them with the kids. Truely enjoyable book.
0316067598|5.0|This book should be required reading for every politician in left field.  You really get a sense of how we are hurting our troops with our misguided political correctness.      We throw the word \\"hero\\" around so loosely these days that we often forget what it truly means.  A hero is not a sports star or a celebrity getting paids obscene amounts of money for nothing.  The men in this book are true American heroes in every sense of the word.  Thank you Marcus Luttrell for writing this book and showing us what a hero really is.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|There's a reason why Season 3 is so different... it's the CW's fault. They dumbed it down for their target demographic (full of girls who are too busy gossiping about the latest episode of Laguna Beach) And now they cancelled it.    This show was too good for The CW. It really should've been on another network + more advertising. It's still a great show though, Kristen Bell puts her heart & soul into every scene.
0143038419|2.0|As I sat at our bookclub discussion of this book, I looked around our table at each of our lives' journeys thus far (we are all in our 40s).  Collectively, we have dealt with cancer, caring for aging, ill or early loss of parents, financial issues, dysfunctional families, children with physical or neurological challenges, etc.  We are just ordinary girls who find strength where we can - through friends, faith, inner-selves and own self-worth.      I agree with the author that each of us has our own path to follow.  Each path can be inspired by a variety of reasons and can be guided by a combination of experiences, religions, and thought processes - influenced from within or by anything around us.  Not really sure what the cause of the author's depression was (there seemed no apparent cause)...which leads me to believe that this author suffers from inherent emotional imbalances or deep insecurities.  This author's journey was laced with self-absorption rather than self-reflection...and there's a big difference between the two.  I kept hoping the book would redeem itself - hoping that the author would find real clarity, and attain her goal of finding herself (and her self-esteem).  Unfortunately, the book delivered the ultimate let-down in that she completed her search for \\"salvation\\" not through her meditation and closeness with the universe and God...but rather through the focused, one-way attention from yet another MAN in her apparently long and growing history of co-dependence.  This may have even been okay - and a nice way to wrap up her year's journey - had there been any reciprocation of Felipe's focused efforts and physical pleasures.  There was no intertwining of souls or culmination of her year's lessons encompassed into this new relationship.  The relationship seems rather superficial actually (which, again, may have been okay if the book had been titled \\"Eat, Pray, Physical Pleasures\\").  Helping a Balinese family purchase a home was the only altruistic thing in this entire book that the author did for anyone other than herself...and not really certain how genuine that effort was (even though it was accomplished) based on the rest of the book.      What message was the author trying to deliver by writing this book?  Did this book enlighten any of us within our bookclub?  What will happen if Felipe leaves the author?  Will she fall apart again?  Will she cry endlessly about her \\"difficult\\" life?  Perhaps her journey is not yet over...perhaps it has only just begun.  Perhaps this book teaches us that the journey continues for all of us.  Perhaps the author will write a genuinely worthy book of reading in another decade or two.
B000062TU1|5.0|I loved Harry Potter and Sorcerer's Stone! It was absolutely wonderful to read as well as to watch. One little thing though: In the movie scene which Professor McGonagall goes to fetch Wood, captain of the Gryffindor   Quidditch team, and tells him that she had found him a new seeker, Harry (after seeing him flying through the air, retrieving Neville's Remembrall that Malfoy threw into the air), the classroon Professor McGonagall enterred was the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom, according to the book. But in the movie, the teacher was Professor Quirrell. In the book, it was Professor Flitwick teaching. Just thought I'd clear that up. Other than that, great book and great movie.

6305546789|2.0|I did not like this film.  In fact, I found it to be one of the worst of the famed slashers.  It was not at all scary, nor did it have many creative kills (there was one, in particular, that I did like though).  I guess at its time, just people getting murdered was scary enough, but not in today's world.  Also, Michael Myers is not supernatural, so why does he not die?  He just keeps coming back to a point of redundancy.  Its just dumb and predictably pointless.  A cliffhanger ending is an alright lead into the next film, which, I must say, is a much better movie than its predecessor.
006056251X|4.0|I really love LK's wallflower series. I couldn't say enough nice things about it. But something truly bothered me with this particular book. It wasn't the fact that Evie was weak because she proves to be strong. It wasn't the romance or the steamy love scenes because they turn out to be very hot. It was the way that St. Vincent (Sebastian) spoke to Evie. This really bothered me for some reason. In the book he calls her a bitch and a coward and a few other things that are sort of degrading. She just came from a home where she was physically and mentally abused. Yet she still manages to fall in love with the cad. I think Evie could've done without some of the abuse he was laying on her.      However, as the story proceeds, you can tell that Evie's just the girl to break the ice around Sebastian's heart. She cracks a little piece every day they're united, all while gaining her sense of self worth. The love that finally blossoms between these two is something that just makes you smile. Wonderful read (even with the some of the harshness) highly recommended.

0802130208|5.0|I have looked through many of these reviews, and no one has yet explained why many reviewers think it is the best book ever, and many think it is the worst book ever. Here is my attempt.    Why some people laugh till they choke    Ignatius is a physical comedian. He follows in the tradition of Charlie Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy, the Victorian classic \\"Three Men in a Boat, to say nothing of the dog,\\" the Marx brothers, the Pink Panther movies (\\"The Return of the Pink Panther\\" is the best), and Mr. Bean. So if you laughed uncontrollably at Chief Inspector Dreyfus's facial tick because he wanted to kill Clouseau, if you laughed when Chaplin kicked the policeman in the pants and ran, or when Mr. Bean accidentally popped a bag of vomit over a sleeping passanger's face, then you are more likely to enjoy this book. It also helps if you were an obedient student and learned all those vocabulary words in English class, because Ignatius is a very learned, pompous slapstick comedian.     What proof do I have of this? Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean) once made a documentary about the aspects of physical comedy (made in 1992, the TV series was called \\"Funny Business,\\" the episode was called \\"Laughing Matters\\", the relevant sections on Youtube are parts 4 and 5). In that lecture, he said that the personality traits of the physical comedian are the following.    1. He is alienated from the society around him: Ignatius stays in his room in his mother's house.    2. He is childish: Ignatius thinks his mother should still support him at age 30.    3. He has to fight with ordinary objects: Ignatius cannot even ride in a bus.    4. His body can be humorous by itself: Did I mention Ignatius is obese?    5. He is uncivilized and cannot or will not conform to social rules: Ignatius's first act in the book is to hit a policeman in the head with a rolled up sheet of music.    6. He is a threat to respectable people: On first seeing him, the policeman immediately tries to arrest him. Even a strip-tease club wants to get rid of him.    7. He mocks authority and politeness: Ignatius is rude and heaps scorn on everyone.    8. He spreads confusion: Ignatius causes the climactic chaos of the book.    9. ... I cannot tell you the ninth quality without giving away the ending. But the book conforms to it as well.     Why some people hate the book    While there has been some smirking and name calling, it is obvious that some who hate the book are quite literate and are not at all dunces. ACoD haters include those who say they like Catch-22, Ground Hog's Day, and other humor classics. Remember, many publishers rejected it, and even Walker Percy didn't realize it was good until about page 50. Most good books sparkle long before that point. Why are its qualities sometimes hard to see?    Although Ignatius is a physical comedian, his humor is not lightning fast like Charlie Chaplin or the Marx brothers. It is hard to quote a funny line, because each line in isolation isn't that funny. They are only funny in the total context of the story. Catch-22 is a book that is hundreds of pages of variations of the same joke. If you liked the basic joke, you love the book. If you hated the joke, you hate the book. With ACoD, if you recognize Ignatius as a slow-burning physical comedian early on--and you find his stately slapstick funny--you will love every page of the book. If you either fail to get the character at all or do not find his version of slapstick funny, you will hate the book.     The book was the first attempt to publish by the author, and it is bit rough. The repetition of metaphors and phrases can be annoying, especially if you are not already laughing. Ignatius is described by animal metaphors repeatedly. He says the same phrases repeatedly. There are very few one-liners by any of the characters. The complicated multi-story plot unfolds slowly. If you are not already in on the joke while this is going on, it is painful. If you are, it is delicious. That is my explanation for the love/hate reviews.    A further theory    I am writing a scholarly article about this book. I have searched the scholarly literature high and low and have not found any other writings on my idea. I have thought about explaining my main concept here, to establish a claim of priority, but I have decided against it. Instead, I will give a brief explanation of a side claim, to demonstrate some of the drift of my thinking. So here it goes.     Ignatius complains throughout the book about Fortune's Wheel. In medieval thinking, everyone was attached to a wheel of fortune. Sometimes you were up and had good fortune; other times you were spun down into ill fortune. Good things happen to bad people and vice versa, so luck does not follow worldy ideas of justice. Or to put it plainly: Life ain't fair.     But in the book, Ignatius himself acts as fortune's wheel. When he arrives at the Night of Joy the second time, Lana and George are in good fortune, and Burma Jones and Darlene have ill fortune. Through Ignatius, their luck is reversed. When Ignatius appears at Levy Pants, Mrs. Levy is controlling both Mr. Levy and Miss Trixie. Through Ignatius, Mr. Levy gets the upper hand, Mrs. Levy has lost power, and Miss Trixie can finally retire. This spherical man acts as a catalyst, spinning the fortunes of the other characters. When Mancuso first interacts with Ignatius, his luck turns bad, but in the end, Mancuso has triumphed, and Lana is off to prison, where she will need some consolation of philosophy.      Boethius wrote in the Consolation of Philosophy that fortune hands out luck that we cannot understand in this world, but which is part of the overall plan of divine justice. Instead of divine justice, Ignatius rolls his circular form through the world, and in his farcical chaos he rights wrongs of this world and brings worldy, poetic justice to the characters. He is fortune's wheel.    Note from December 2008: In the article by Richard Simon (1994). \\"John Kennedy Toole and Walker Percy: Fiction and repetition in A Confederacy of Dunces.\\" Texas Studies in Literature & Language, 36(1), page 113, in a footnote, Simon argues that Ignatius represents Fortuna herself. My claim is slightly different: that Ignatius is her wheel.
B0000CNY27|5.0|In the future, Manhattan Island has become a large prison island unlike alcatraz where criminals rules and there are no guards for the crooks run free on the island doing whatever they want. The President (Donald Pleasance) has crashed landed by accident and is kidnapped by ruthless thugs led by the Duke (Issac Hayes), the military sends out a lone former solider and criminal named Snake Plisskin (Kurt Russell) to find the president, he's been implanted with an explosive device inside him and will explode within 24 hours if he fails but if he succeeds then it will be removed.<br /><br />A unique and original Sci-fi action thriller from the maker of \\"Halloween\\" and \\"The Thing\\" John Carpenter and is one of the true sci-fi classics of all time. Kurt Russell is perfection playing the memorable cult anti-hero Snake Plisskin much like Carpenter's other Kurt Russell hero creation Jack Burton from \\"Big Trouble in Little China\\". The film co-stars Andrienne Barbeau, Harry Dean Stanton, Ernest Borgnine, Lee Van Cleef, and Tom Atkins with an uncredited voice over by Jamie Lee Curtis and has good acting, good special effects for it's time, an original storyline and the qualty of the film makes the New York in this movie look like a realistic post-apocalyptic New York, the music score by John Carpenter is very haunting as well.<br /><br />This awesome 2-Disc special edition has excellent picture and sound quality with two audio commentaries, a comic book inside the case, Still gallery, Trailers especially to a few other MGM releases, deleted scene, and  three featurettes especially on the making of the Snake Plisskin comic.

1594489505|5.0|Wow!  How can you review the chaotic, sadistic destruction of a culture and a gender?  Khaled Hossenini's talent as a story-teller continues to shine.  His characters are identifiable, tragic, and filled with endurance.  It is difficult to accept the institutionalized mindless chauvanistic hatred of the Taliban for any different culture and for women.  But Hosseini brings a front row seat to watch the systematic destruction, the ignorant indifferance to suffering of a centuries-old culture.  You cannot help but extrapolate from this that we will not see the end of this struggle within our lifetime.<br /><br />Pierce Scranton M.D.<br />author, \\"Death on the Learning Curve\\"
B000NVIXDW|2.0|Doesn't anyone notice he has a speech impediment?  He slurs some words and has a very pronounced lisp at times.  I'm not making fun of the handicapped.  If he was someone that I met on the street I wouldn't mention it, but he has chosen a profession that requires clear speech and should be held to higher standards.  If he was my dentist, I would be good with it.      The songs where there are fewer instances of \\"s\\" or \\"th\\" etc. are fantastic, but songs like \\"World On A String\\" are reminiscent of William Hung.  I really like \\"Me And Mrs. Jones\\", but I can still hear a slight lisp here and there.  I don't think I remember hearing the slurring and lisping on previous recordings???  I agree with a previous reviewer that asked how the studio could put this CD out.
B00000J7S8|5.0|.....God created Diana Krall. She is beautiful, sexy, wonderful, and has the most absolutely seductive voice I've ever heard. We are fortunate to live at the same time she does...my wife says I have a crush on her...see my Carly Simon reviews...who says a man is restricted to one crush?<br /><br />Now that I've mentioned Carly...she's sung this same repertoire very, very well, but Carly is really a pop singer branching out. Diana was annointed by God to sing this music, as Rosa Ponselle and Kirsten Flagstad were annointed by Him to sing Opera. Jazz has to be born into a singer...the list of pop, country, and Opera singers who've tried, and failed, is too painful to recite. The great dramatic soprano Eileen Farrell? Sure...there are exceptions to everything...<br /><br />As to specifics...great album, of great material. Diana always Picks me Up, can Look me in the Eyes & Get Under my Skin, and makes me want to Fall in Love...who wouldn't want to Face the Music and Dance? Cole Porter, Irving Berlin, Harold Arlen, and the others HAD to have had Diana in mind. Wonderful singer, sublime music, beautiful picture on the cover....this one has it ALL....Enjoy.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|True Rush fans will LOVE this CD.  By \\"true fans\\" I mean those who are fans beyond Moving Pictures and have enjoyed each of the different stages Rush as played through.  I admit that when I first listened to Snakes & Arrows I didn't have anyt one song jump out and completely grab me alhtough Far Cry, We Hold On and both insturementals (Main Monkey Business & Malignant Narcissism) were all immediately very good and strong sonically.  But like many Rush albums (oops, CDs these days) your appreciation grows each time you hear it.  Like other reviewers have commented, by about the 5th play I was totally into the CD.  But I still was only playing it on my car CD player.  When I finally played it through a good set of headphones and could hear all of the layers of music which comprised the structure of each song, I was sold on this being one of Rush's best products ever and that says alot.  I was fortunate enough to see them twice on this tour and as usual their live sound is as close to studio sound as a concert can be.  I'd recommend finding the tour book for Snakes & Arrows if you can because Neil does an excellent job of explaining how the lyrics, themes, CD pictures, production and everything has an underlieing storyline that all came together quite by chance (and who says they don't have faith in faith).  Lots of humor in both the printed CD and the show as is customary for Rush.  I'd definatly recommend to any fan of rock-n-roll to buy this CD, put it in a quality sound system and kick back and enjoy.  It is a sonic experience to be savored.
0316018953|4.0|So you like a murder mystery?  Here it is!  Connelly has done it again with great, familiar characters and another subtle story line that slides in slowly.  But before you know it, you're on a freight train, unable to get off.  The case starts out slow, a murder on a popular night parking spot over looking the city, the case handed off because \\"everyone is too busy.\\"  Bosch is stuck with it, and yet relishes a chance to be back on the job, back making a differnce in the city he loves. He loves LA like Wilber Smith loves Africa.  His comfort level and respect for the LA culture ooze from the pores of the book.  But this seemingly random murder suddenly springs to life with all sorts of ramifications of terrorists plots, sub plots, and rivalry between LA PD and the FBI.  Suddenly Bosch isn't important enough to be in this case.... not even within his own department.  And yet Connelly has created such a strong, tenacious bulldog of a character, we know Bosch won't accept the snub.  That's why we like him and keep coming back to read.<br /><br />Pierce Scranton M.D.<br />author, \\"Death on the Learning Curve\\"

0060763892|4.0|In my opinion \\"The Judas Strain\\"  was a terrific book, that complimented a great series. James Rollins wrote another compelling, cliff hanger with a super plot and not to mention the numerous visits to all those wonderful places that the story portrays. I enjoy a novel that not only gives me an entertaining read but also educates me at the same time and The Judas Strain did this and more. If you looking for a thriller then I highly recommend this book. For me, I'm looking forward to the next novel in the series.

0061120073|5.0|This is a book that somehow over the years I had missed reading.  It was fascinating!  Mrs. Smith gave a wonderful account of life in an era of America that many of us know little about.  Having grown up with stories from my parents and grandparents about life during the depression, and before, in rural America, I enjoyed contrasting their tales with Frances's life and hardships of growing up in Brooklyn during the same time period.  This is a wonderful read for anyone interested in life in this remarkable country of ours!
B000008JI1|4.0|I know it must have been such a shock for the guys in Poison to experience C.C.'s departure.  Considering all the years they had been together!  I was really proud of the guys for 'picking up the pieces,' moving forward and putting out this new album.  I was attending college at the time and a local radio station broadcast the entire album live from start to finish.  It was late at night but I still wanted to stay up to hear the new disc.  Although \\"Native Tongue\\" Poison was certainly a different sounding band than their prior records, I was pleased with the results.  Years later I am still fascinated with these songs, especially,  \\"Bastard Son of 1000 blues,\\" \\"Theatre of the Soul\\"  and \\"Until You Suffer Some.\\"
B000OQF6N6|2.0|It's hard to believe Corgan's song writing has gotten so bad.  I kept listening through the album, waiting to find a great song.  Tarantula is OK but it's one of the best songs on this mediocre album.  All this album reveals is Billy is a narcissist, who doesn't realize he's lost his songwriting talents.
B000002KDX|5.0|What many people may not be aware of is that the three young men who comprised America were fresh out of high school when they recorded this album and shot straight to the top of the Billboard singles chart with \\"A Horse With No Name\\" (which was accidentally left off of about 150,000 copies of the album's 1st printing!) They also won the 1972 \\"Best New Artist\\" Grammy the following year.    Can you imagine accomplishing all of that before you're even 20 years old?!    Their first album is a collage of raw, stripped-down acoustic ballads and soft-rock anthems with a hint of folk and country thrown in that paint amazing pictures with words and sound.    How could these young gents portray such maturity in their songwriting and guitar-playing at such an early age?    One word: talent.    Yes, America did grow musically over the years, but when compared to other artists of the same age (or even older!), they were way ahead of the curve and have outlasted most other acts of the same genre (with the exception of acts such as the Eagles, Crosby, Stills, & Nash, Neil Young, et al.).    This first album is a testament to the band's talent and the songs contained therein have stood the test of time and sound just as fresh and vibrant today as they did 25 years ago.
B00005JODK|4.0|\\"Hairspray\\" manages to capture the early 1960's, makes you wanna dance and teaches you a lesson about racial prejudice without hitting you over your hairpiece. And there is a whole potfull of good actors-- some famous, others not. I'd give the solid A's to Nikki Blonsky who plays the pudgy adolescent Tracy Turnblad, who has to deal with being different (Fat girls don't dance); and Michelle Pheiffer as the practically anorexic blonde Velma von Tussle who is determined that her daughter Amber will win the dance contest. Christoper Walken as Tracy's father and the husband of Edna (John Travolta), who along with Queen Latifah as Motormouth Maybelle give respectable performances. John Waters, the creator of the original \\"Hairspray\\" has a unique walk-on role much in keeping with what we would expect for him.<br /><br />Although John Travolta is often funny as the overweight, reclusive Edna, he never convinced me that he wasn't just himself wearing a dress. And at times with all that makeup and additional weight he was carrying around (although he was quite agile in his dance routines) he looked for all the world like a hog. Both Robin Williams as Mrs. Doubtfire and Dustin Hoffman as Tootsie were much more believable as women.<br /><br />The music is catchy although probably nothing Striesand will include in her next concert. The dancing is hot; the movie at times will remind you of the fantastic Australian film of a few years ago, \\"Strictly Ballroom,\\" both in the virtuosity of the dancers and the farcial elements.<br /><br />\\"Hairspray\\" is a good way to spend two hours on a Sunday afternoon inside a cool theatre out of the July heat.

B000MCH5P4|3.0|This movie is often compared with movies like Crash, Traffic, and Syriana, and with good reason. (In fact while watching this movie I thought it had been made by the same people as those other movies, but according to wikipedia apparently not). It uses the same kind of directing and the same kind of story telling though. And the same idea of having 4 separate stories, loosely connected with each other but all dealing with similar themes.    As the title suggests, the main theme of this movie is language, but some of these four stories are more language related than others.     There are a number of points in the movie where characters do things that are illogical or don't seem to make a lot of sense. Of course people in real life do things that don't make a lot of sense, so it is difficult to know how critical to be of this. But there were a number of points in the movie where my friend and I said to each other: \\"Now why doesn't he just do this instead of that?\\" Or \\"That doesn't make any sense. If she would only do that all the problems would be over.\\"    The Japanese segments deal with a deaf mute girl who can only communicate with sign language. (I thought I was going to get an opportunity to test my Japanese language skills out during this film, but the majority of the Japanese segments deals with sign language).    Interesting factiod: did you know that Japanese sign language is different than American sign language? I just assumed it was a universal language, but it's not. (This came up in a lesson from the textbook we taught out of last year: the difference between American and Japanese sign language).    Both of the main Japanese actors looked very familiar to me while watching the movie. It took me a while to place them but Rinko Kikuchi was also in \\"69\\" and Koji Yakusho, who played the father, has actually been in a number of famous Japanese movies, including the main part in \\"The Choice of Hercules\\" and the American movie \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\".
0060595183|4.0|I have wanted to read Huxley's THE DOORS OF PERCEPTION for quite some time and purchased it from Amazon about a year ago.  However, I didn't get around to reading it until this past week, when it made its way to the top of my book stack.  Not knowing if I was \\"ready\\" for the subject of hallucinogen use, I opened the thin volume and it hooked me immediately.<br /><br />What was most impressive to me - others have described Huxley's clinical/intellectual approach to the drug experience - was how this work delicately projected the difference of drugs being used to escape TO something, rather than FROM something.  This seems key to Huxley's \\"experience\\" versus other's entertainment, excitement, boredom, or addictive purpose for experimenting.<br /><br />The second book of this thin volume, HEAVEN AND HELL, was, I'm quite sure, directly impacted by Huxley's previous drug experiences, as he argues, somewhat circularly, that drug use inspires appreciation of things produced via drug use.<br /><br />I enjoyed both of these short works, presumably published together because of the William Blake connection in their titles.  Despite reviews to the contrary, the ideas presented within seemed entirely accessible, if somewhat dated.

B000NQR7NO|4.0|(3 1/2 *'s) UK's latest and greatest new sensation, The Arctic Monkeys, come up with a follow up to their smash debut, 'Whatever They Say I Am, I'm Not' with more experience under their belts.  Overall, they add some texture and, as the title suggests, the darker aspects of their brain hemispheres for the lyrics.  While I don't possess their heralded debut, I know by listening to the samplers that this album has more variety, but less of the immediacy of their first C.D.    Starting with \\"Brainstorm,\\" we get a propulsive electrical storm that provides a cyclical effect reminiscent of the 'Pulp Fiction' soundtrack.  In the fast forward vein they still deliver their best, fronted by Alex Turner's trajectory of images that sometimes seems like alternative's free association answer to rap.  Never getting tongue tied, Alex's words, nevertheless, don't always integrate well into the mesmerizing mix.  Following the \\"Brainstorm,\\" \\"Teddy Picker\\" comes to the fore with arguably the album's best song.  Proving that experience hasn't tarnished the band, anti-glam \\"Teddy...\\" is truly an intricate gem.  Keeping in the third person, we get lines about women who make love go wrong.  Included is that propulsive assertion for \\"D Is for Dangerous\\" with some scathing words for some wayward girl known as \\"Your favourite worst nightmare\\".  Later, \\"Do Me a Favour\\" featuring Ventures'-like sounds, asks the lamented beloved to \\"Break my nose.\\"  And \\"Old Yellow Bricks\\" seals the bad deal, lamenting \\"You're a fugitive, but you don't know what you're running away from.\\"  The playful \\"This House Is a Circus\\" and the heavy \\"The Bad Thing\\" almost live up to the aforementioned, but new territory is achieved with the shimmering \\"Fluorescent Adolescent\\" and the Stray Cats-like \\"Only One Who Knows\\".      At their best, Arctic Monkeys gives us some new hooks and elaborations of what they've already accomplished.  When they're effective, they connect well.  Sometimes the trajectory flows like a dream;at other times the whole project is ordinary and stuck in idle.  For those who remember The Undertones, this album reminds one of the transition when they went from the propulsive punk to the artiness of 'Positive Touch'.  Hopefully, with gradual changes, The Arctic Monkeys won't undergo the Undertones' fate.
B00000J2PH|5.0|Carole King is more than just the voice of a generation. She is a voice in the wilderness of modern music. She does not draw attention to herself, but attention to every single person who listens to the albulm. This is a personal album in so many ways. Carole King does not have the attitude that most of the artists of her generation have and that is why this collection of songs will be around for many many more years.
6305508550|4.0|The best part of Office Space is its exaggerated but accurate depictions of life in the modern office place. I've worked in many similar places, and seen many similar stupidities. I've met many of its characters, such as Lumbergh, the Porsche-driving VP jerk who expects \\"his\\" people to come in on the weekend.<br /><br />I've watched Office Space at least half a dozen times, and it still manages to make me cringe and laugh at the same time. Very funny, very pertinent. I figure that those who chose better career paths, ones that didn't relegate them to cube farms, will probably not \\"get\\" the movie.<br /><br />While I have no qualms about R-rated movies and strong language, I feel this is one of those movies that would probably been better off had it gotten a PG or PG-13 rating. The downside is that I can't pop it onto an LCD projector at the office, for fear of getting a visit from the HR Police.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is one of the most spellbinding series I have had the pleasure of viewing.  The cinematography transports you to a multitude of places and environments with it's inhabitants.

1582701709|5.0|Friday, July 27, 2007<br /><br />I have not yet read the book, but have viewed the DVD several times.  I think the concepts presented here are excellent, and provide hope which is the main ingredient in our pursuit of happiness.  Contrary to many negative reviews, there was no message where inaction will bring about your deepest desires.  On the contrary, it gives you inspiration to keep working towards your goals. So what if it advises that visual aids will keep you focused and that perseverance is essential in bringing into reality your desires?! Continued belief in yourself and maintaining hope in a happy outcome is hard work, especially with all the negative feedback we receive from society or those around us.<br /><br />I was not offended by the packaging as \\"The Secret\\", I am familiar with other authors and positive mental attitude teachers such as Dr. Norman Vincent Peale, Earl Nightingale \\"The Strangest Secret\\", W. Clement Stone (who is referenced to as a coach on the DVD), Napoleon Hill, and I loved seeing Dr. Dennis Waitley make an appearance on the DVD.  They were all familiar with the Secret, and at the beginning of the DVD, the narrator is surprised at how many know the Secret.  And obviously \\"THE SECRET\\", is a secret for many, otherwise why has this book and movie become so popular and controversial?<br /><br />In the DVD there was no message that afflictions are brought about by the victims.  Many of the speakers on the DVD recount about their own dysfunctional backgrounds or medical and health conditions that they overcame.  However that there are negative people, situations and outcomes that people do attract to them... yes, and does that idea knot some people's underwear!!  In an era that glamorizes victims or blaming anyone or anything except you, that pill does not go down easy.<br /><br />I think the Secret is great.  Have open mind... will travel!
1582701709|5.0|If you're ready to take a spiritual journey you'll never forget and truly change your thoughts and the way your life is going, read this book. I could  not believe how much of The Secret resonated with me. As a matter of fact, I had applied some of the principles earlier in life without even realizing it with both good and bad results. When I focused my thoughts and energy on something, whether it was obtaining material things or improving a relationship, it happened. When I focused my thoughts and energy on wishing something did NOT happen, guess what? It happened. (Read the book and that will make more sense.) The Secret fully explains why. We are indeed a powerful tower transmitting energy and we have to decide if it's going to be negative or positive.  The thing that some may find difficult to accept IS the power. It can be overwhelming and down right scary to believe that we have the power within us to determine the path of our lives. That's a lot of responsibility to accept. Human nature a.k.a. my ego, did not want to. While I read the book, I found it difficult at times to accept the fact that my own thoughts caused some negative events and people to be in my life.  At the same time it was gratifying to know that I had the power to bring the converse into it. Now that I'm conscious of this power, I constantly apply the principles found in The Secret. I bought the book for my mother and for a very good friend struggling with military life overseas.  I re-read certain passages just about everyday because it is JUST THAT GOOD. I'm not religious, but I am a spiritual person.  I read for knowledge and growth. When you hear the truth, you just know it. The Secret = The Truth.

B000MNP2KI|4.0|Wow. I was not expecting to like Daniel Craig as much as I did in this movie. He is definitely scruffier and more grim than previous Bonds, but I think that works. Should an assassin be chipper & smiling all the time? Even James Bond? I actually believed that the violence was real, and in most Bond films it is more cartoon-like. The villain is a bit weak here, just didn't scare me all that much, and the film felt like it went on too long, so I subtracted one star. But overall, I think Daniel Craig makes a superb (and extremely hot!) James Bond and I look forward to his next movie.
B000005YZM|5.0|Odessey and Oracle is one of the many unfairly overlooked classics of the 60s. Released at the tail of the tail end of the decade to dissapointing sales, the Zombies' last album is a lush, evocative masterpiece. It's a record of dreamy psychedelic pop classics, a set of songs that combine multilayered instrumentation, delicate vocal harmonies, and soaring hooks to create some of the most atmospheric sounscapes you've ever heard. \\"Care Of Cell 44\\" is a rousing, piano driven ode to an incarcarated girlfriend that positively drips with yearning and hope, while \\"Maybe After He's Gone\\" is a beautifully melancholy anthem of loneliness. \\"Beechwood Park\\" is an almost groovy, undeniably catchy bit of nostalgia, and \\"Changes\\" features some crystal-coated vocals and rumbling percussion. \\"Butcher's Tale\\" is a truly unsettling anti-war song with some nightmarish lyrical imagery and a tense, desperate vocal performance. \\"This Will Be Our Year\\" and \\"I Want Her She Wants Me\\" are enticing, irresistable pop songs. Perhaps the album's most well-known song, \\"Time Of The Season\\" is a relentlessly groovy, unquestionably cool  tune with some fantastically obtuse lyrics. My personal favorite track is \\"Hung Up On A Dream,\\" an absolutely gorgeous swirl of dreamy (as the title implies) music and wistful, yearning lyrics. But really, the whole album is gorgeous. Anyone who gives a damn about rock, pop, or psychedlia should have it.

B000028U0Y|5.0|Recorded in 1968 before a real-life audience of rowdy convicts, At Folsom Prison is one the rawest, meanest, grittiest, and downright greatest country music albums of all time. Johnny's cruel, rugged barritone is on full display here, and he tears into these songs with booze-soaked charisma and ample wit, goading on his band (which, by the way, is awesome and features Carl and Luther Perkins on guitar, and the rumbling drums of W.S. Holland) and driving the audience into an absolute frenzy.     In this kind of atmosphere, the songs really have no choice but to rule: \\"Folsom Prison Blues\\" comes ripping out of the starting gates with a blast of fleet-footed guitars and the electric arc of Cash's voice. Other high-strung highlights include the rattling harmonica-n-drum showcase \\"Orange Blossom Special,\\" the bloody minded glee of \\"Cocaine Blues,\\" the gallows humor of \\"Twenty Five Minutes To Go,\\" and the rollicking \\"I Got Stripes.\\" And just when it seems that the show's energy is about to let up, June Carter walks on stage, joining Cash in a just-plain-awesome version of \\"Jackson.\\" The two tear into the song with relentless abandon, harmonizing and trading off lines and verses with electrifying energy. June's amazing- she sings with a kind of raw sexuality and cocksure earnestness that is, well, hot. Cash is no slouch himself, either. The album's quieter moments are great, too: \\"Dark As A Dungeon\\" is a mournful, gospel-tinged ballad, and \\"I Still Miss Someone\\" delivers the helpless loneliness that its title promises. \\"The Long Black Veil\\" is a genuinly haunting song, with an atmosphere so heavy that even Cash's laughter halfway through doesn't break the mood. In a weird way, it seems to enhance it- same goes for \\"The Wall,\\" a darkly-beautiful ballad that only gets better when Johnny cracks a bitter joke in the middle.    A masterpiece, then. Anyone who thinks country should be about grit and attitude rather than pickup trucks and barbeque sauce should hear this right now.
B000MRA5NS|4.0|Let me start off by saying that this is a good movie and the Blu-ray presentation is fantastic.    My problem with this particular film is the lack of a couple of Bond standards which made be feel overall unfilled at the end of my viewing.    Firstly, modern Bond movies always start with a spectacular action sequence that pulls you straight in and gets the heart rate up. This film starts with Bond's first and second kill which while a nice cinematic sequence seemed out of place.    Secondly, where was Q and the cool gadgets that normally accompany Bond? Even the Aston Martin DBS was only featured briefly and had none of the usual gadgetry that is normally associated with a Bond ride. The only gadgets in the movie were very plain compared to those of previous movies and felt like a blatant product placement from Sony.    To summarize, while I liked the grittier edge that the movie went for, I ultimately felt let down by the missing elements.
B000002IHD|3.0|There's no question about it: your soul colletion isn't complete without some Otis Redding in it. The man created more than his share of masterpieces, cranking out brilliant slabs of R&B by the pound. His voice was a (nearly) can't-fail mixture of grit and emotional resonance. He was also a charismatic performer and an excellent songwriter; his final single, \\"(Stittin' On) The Dock Of The Bay\\" is simply one of the most heart-breakingly beautiful songs of all time, a work of devestating genius that has, on multiple occasions, reduced me to tears.    Having said that, I simply can't reccomend this album as the soul masterpiece that other people seem to think it is. Granted, it has some fantastic moments- \\"Ole Man Trouble\\" is a superb midtempo ballad with some pleading vocals, slashing guitars, and a hypnotic rhythm. His version of \\"Rock Me Baby\\" drips with raw, salivating sexuality, and \\"Respect\\" (which would, of course, soon be covered by Aretha Frankin\\") is a rousing anthem with some pounding drums and a great horn line. Plus, Otis' voice is full of infectious passion. There's also a cover of the Rolling Stones' \\"Satisfaction\\" that transforms the song into a relentless, gritty R&B basher. Again, Redding delivers an incredibly exuberant vocal- just listen to those verses!     The problem with this album, however, is that there are far too many tracks here that are little more than filler. My biggest gripe is with Otis' version of Sam Cooke's \\"A Change Is Gonna Come.\\" Now, the original was an absolute masterpiece, a soul-crushing heart-shredder that's every bit as powerful as \\"Dock Of The Bay.\\" Otis' rendition isn't terrible, per se, but it robs the song of virtually all of its supernatural power. He remains faithful to its haunting, mournful melody, but sings without any of Cooke's emotional directness. He darts around the lyrics, adding little asides that ruin the focus of the song. He also tinkers with the lyrics, undermining Cooke's brilliant wording. The result is a castrated rendition of a masterpiece, one that strips the original of its cathartic power while contributing nothing new to it. Aside form that, there's an unexciting \\"Down In The Valley,\\" and the overly sugary \\"I've Been Loving You Too Long\\" (sorry, I know it's supposed to be one of his best, but it just doesn't do anything for me). Also, his by-numbers take on \\"My Girl\\" isn't going to replace the Temptations' version.    The songs that I haven't already disussed are pretty good, but not exactly revelations: \\"Shake\\" has some inticing rhythms, but can't sustain its excitement all the way through, and \\"Wonderful World\\" similarly overstays its welcome. \\"You Don't Miss Your Water\\" fits the R&B archetype to a tee- which means that even though it's performed expertly, it feels like you've already heard the blasted thing a billion times before.     So, it's a pretty good album. I feel somewhat odd, seeing as how I appear to be the only person who doesn't absolutely adore it, but... eh, what're you gonna do?

B000FVNX2Q|5.0|I could not be happier to have purchased this calculator.  As a graduate business student this is a tool that I can not live without.  If I could improve anything about it, I would add additional storage registers but then again this is a calculator not a computer.  Overall this is a wonderful device that anyone who performs financial or statistics calculations on a regular basis should not be without.
B000I5XOVE|1.0|After recently purchasing a PlayStation3 primarily for its functionality as a Blu-ray high-definition movie disc player, I was really looking forward to seeing some of my all-time favorite films on the new format.  I mean, Blu-ray has 50gb of storage capacity on one side of a disc, enough room to pack a pristine 1080p video print and uncompressed 7.1 PCM audio, not to mention loads of extras...  Having said that, Warner Home Video really let me down with their first issue of 1989's \\"Lethal Weapon 2\\" on Blu-ray disc.  This is exactly what I feared they would do.  Rather than do the job right the first time out, consumers are being setup for an obvious double-dip on several titles, including the first two \\"Lethal Weapon\\" films.      I grew up watching a VHS of \\"Lethal Weapon 2\\" with my older brother.  He and I both loved this movie and used to watch it constantly, so naturally over the years we hope and pray for vastly improved ways to watch this 18-year old favorite.  This Blu-ray disc is NOT that vast improvement we've been waiting for.  From the opening frame, what we get is an image so jagged and grainy that it tempted me to insert my \\"Lethal Weapon 2: Director's Cut\\" DVD and see if the 480p image upconverted to 1080p was any better.  So I did that, and while the DVD did make the Blu-ray presentation look good, that's not saying much.  While there's a lot more detail and color depth in the Blu-ray version, there is also the huge distraction of seeing jagged edges around everything and everyone on screen.  Just look at the opening frame of the film, where it says \\"A Time Warner Communications...\\" etc, and look at the text.  Skip into the film a few chapters where we see a fax printing out of a fax machine, and look at the jagged edges around the printed page, everything on Murtaugh's desk... The list of flaws is endless, because it goes on throughout the entire film.  Did anyone actually watch this master before sending it off to the Blu-ray duplication factory?  The biggest reason why I would consider upgrading my DVD library to Blu-ray is for film-like images and detail, and this is one title where the studio needs to mint a brand new master from the ground-up if we're ever to see a better presentation.  I have two words for Warner Bros: Lowry Digital.  See what they did for James Bond?  Enough said.  Incidentally, after watching the film, I did some searching online to find out if other's have complained about this problem.  I found out the technical reason for this is that Warner simply took an existing 1080i master and put it through a process of \\"vertical filtering\\" to convert it to 1080p.  They did the same thing with the first \\"Lethal Weapon\\" film, along with at least five other Blu-ray transfers created from 1080i masters, so I'd be cautious of which early Warner titles you pick up on Blu-ray.      For this initial wave of Blu-ray titles, Warner also decided to do nothing with the format's audio capabilities.  Instead, we just get the same Dolby Digital 5.1 track with slightly more detail, but not enough of an improvement to really notice.  Where's the Dolby TrueHD or uncompressed 5.1 PCM audio tracks?  On top of that, where are the audio commentaries?  Come on, \\"Lethal Weapon 2\\" is a modern classic, surely deserving an audio commentary with Richard Donner, Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Joe Pesci, etc.  Instead, we get a French language track.  Lame.    The extras are equally as unspectacular as the picture and sound.  I just don't get how some films are treated to 2-3 re-releases over 10 years, yet the \\"Lethal Weapon\\" franchise goes by hugely overlooked in the Special Edition department.    Bottom-line: Don't buy it.  I bought it, and I'm returning it.  Hold out until Warner gets their act together, creates new 1080p masters from cleaner elements, and gives us a deluxe box set of all four films with new extras.  They've proved they can do it with other films, so I'm guessing it's only a matter of time before Riggs & Murtaugh get their due respect on high-def disc.

B000K15VSA|5.0|USA Today reported that this edition will available on December 18, 2007.    Details:Blade Runner: Ultimate Collector's Edition, $79, five standard DVDs. (Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD versions planned; no price yet.) Four versions of the film, plus a remastered \\"work print.\\" Though Scott re-edited the film for a 1992 release, he has tinkered further, creating his \\"final cut\\" for the 25th anniversary. Scott says it \\"now is in its purest form.\\"    Among changes: A longer \\"unicorn\\" scene. During the commentary, Scott explains that it's pivotal because the symbolism re-enforces Scott's thinking that Deckard (Harrison Ford) is not human, but a replicant. Plus: enhanced special effects, a new surround soundtrack. Bonuses include a new making-of documentary.    Also: The \\"final cut\\" will be shown in New York and L.A. theaters this fall and at film festivals in Venice (Aug. 29-Sept. 8) and New York (Sept. 28-Oct. 14).
B000E33VWW|5.0|Hoffman definitely earned his Oscar with this production.  However, I find it interesting that no one claimed that he was simply impersonating Capote like many charged Jamie Foxx the year before.  I frankly think both actors did astonding jobs and truely convinced the audience that they were watching the real people they were portraying.  Hoffman's Capote was indeed a complicated man and it seemed in truth that he sold his soul for the 'novel he was born to write.'  There were parts when his wormy insincere persona just completely turned my stomach.  But be forwarned, this isn't a action movie.  No suspense.  It's truely a character study of a talented and intriguing man.  Overall: Highly recommanded.
B000H305U0|1.0|Finally the critics and fans have recognized the talents of Justin Timberlake and he is nominated for a long overdue American Music Award for the CD FutureSex/Lovesounds. It really doesn't matter which song from the album pushed him over the top because they all sound pretty much the same. Hey, when you find a formula that works, stick with it ad nauseum and that certainly seems like the game plan here (it works for every hip hop, Daughtry, Nickelback, etc. recording, why mess with success). All is not decided however, he is up against some very heady competition in Timbaland, a wannabe gangsta who couldn't quite pull off the spelling of his favorite pair of work (and I use the term loosely) boots. Or maybe it was an homage to JT himself after all even JT must realize that Timbaland and Timbalake are pretty close. Might this be prelude to a collaboration. Is there a Timbalandlake recording on the horizon? That would almost certainly be a lock for next year's Grammy and AMA, and They could have the award presented by Michael Jackson and Paul McCartney in a retro moment taking us back to that other monumental Ebony & Ivory recording collaboration. Now, for those of you among us that actually know anything about music save your time. there is nothing musical about this recording, there is nothing sexy or sensual or erotic about this recording, there is nothing and I mean nothing special about this recording. The AMA and this \\"nomination\\" is just another example of the music industry lavishing awards on themselves to generate more record sales. Really lets look at some of the nominees, Daughtry? Akon? Really? This is the best the music industry has to offer. It's a good thing the CD cover design is so cutting edge.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|Yes, it is. I liked the film but the music is what keeps me coming back for more.
0783228457|4.0|David Cronenberg is a unique filmmaker whose vision of the world is somewhat skewed as compared with the rest of us. In Videodrome he investigates the possible insidious and damaging effects that a continuous stream of torture and death from a TV screen could have upon an individual. Well that is one possible interpretation of this film, in fact he could equally just be pushing the boundaries a bit further himself.<br /><br />The film was made in 1982 when Video was just beginning to boom all over the world. It stars James Woods as Max Renn, who gives one of his best ever performances, as an executive for a small cable TV station who in searching for something new to air on the station. He discovers Videodrome, or is a duped into discovering it, and from that point on starts to hallucinate. Beyond this point it becomes difficult to know what is real and what isn't. Suffice to say, if you are not familiar with Cronenberg, things turn pretty nasty and although some of the special effects look a little dated now this certainly isn't for the squeamish.<br /><br />Unless you have read a detailed synopsis by Cronenberg himself, you are likely to get to the end of this movie and wonder what it all means, which is pretty much how I felt. However its done with a style that is largely missing from a lot Hollywood movies, and that is not surprising. Cronenberg is Canadian and this is a Canadian film. It has a different feel to Hollywood movies, perhaps more akin to a European movie. I agree with the previous reviewer that towards the end the typical Cronenberg 'horror' element was overplayed, but overall this is a thought-provoking and strangely entertaining movie that I look forward to watching again.
B000000OA6|5.0|Freddie Mercury is at the gates of Heaven and he is requesting entrance. \\"Why should I let you in?\\", God asks. Freddie doesn't say a word. He twirls, jumps around the stage creating a well earned frenzy, and then hands God a copy of Innuendo. God examines it quizzicaly. \\"Maybe I should play this on my 52 speaker surround sound system\\", He muses. Freddie, not concerned, waits like a controlled panther as God hears the first track. After it's through, God smiles and says, \\"Now THIS is really something to leave the people down there! Access granted!\\". Freddie smiles. Finally!, he muses, He's removed his mask! Well, if anyone could do it, Freddie could.<br />By any stretch of the imagination- this is a VERY HIGH POINT in Queen's catalogue of profferings. Why is this so? Perhaps they wanted to make such a superb album as the lasting legacy to their talent. Perhaps, they just wanted to make it the best Queen album of all. To my mind, they succeeded. Yes, you all know the hits by now. And they are many. Why, I can still remember the breakthrough of \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" and how that song still remains a classic to this day. But, you know, when you're rushing \\"Headlong\\" towards the end, there is nothing you can do about it except make it excellent. The fact that Freddie wanted to leave with so much integrity is a testimony to his talent, his love, and his soul. He wanted to leave on an elevator upwards- and so he did.<br />What makes this album stand out so much is the enigma that it conveys throughout many songs. Also, lets not forget the heart and the conveyance of things that matter on this earth. It is emotion and joy. It is the wisdom inherent in all. And no matter how many times I hear it- I discover something new. After all- why not? Are we forever the same? Is music ever the same? Everything moves and changes. We are in relation to whatever the moment offers. This is the genius of this album.<br />First off- let me state that the production is flawless. If you can't hear the seperation in your speakers and the sound emanating in clever and concise ways- then you have the wrong system. This music can be lush, elegant, heart pounding and ethereal.<br />The title track \\"Innuendo\\" is worth the price of admission alone. It slinks along relating the majesty of our universe with caveats. Yet, there is the human spirit which will \\"keep on trying\\" to unravel the mysteries of reality and within one's self. Such great passages to fine acoustic spanish guitar (thank-you Steve Howe). It becomes harder edged - and this is what is most remarkable about the song. Like \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" we have the soft embellishments along with the raw guitar licks and the lush vocal ensemble. Quite considerable.<br />The rest of the album is a pure treat. \\"I'm Going Slightly Mad\\" is a tour de force with witty play on words to convey the condition. \\"Headlong\\" and \\"I Can't Live With You\\", justifiably, both rock ravers about relationships. Imagine yourself hovering over the highway at high speed. This is just one feeling in your imagination.<br />But the heart and soul of this album are coveyed in certain compositions. \\"All God's People\\" is an ode to the human race for some sort of stability and logic. \\"Don't Try So Hard\\" is miraculous and a tender urging to let the disappointments pass. \\"These Are the Days of Our Lives\\" is one of my favorites. Lovely. And the message that, although we can't go back in time and things change forever, the things that remain within the heart are constant. Beautiful lilting melody.<br />\\"The Show Must Go On\\" is the swan song. Ominous music asking ominous questions. Through the failure, the disappointments, the trials, whatever happens- the show must go on. The song is so heart-wrenching - especially knowing that Freddie's days were numbered at this point. In a way- to me- it indeed conveys that Freddie's show will indeed go on. Maybe not here. But somewhere.<br />In closing - if you like rock music soft, gritty, grandiose, or riffdriven- this one is for you. This is a fine gift you left us Freddie. Now tell God to take it out of His c.d. player! He's too busy listening to that and not paying attention to us - selfish and greedy as we might be. :)<br /><br /> Don't take offence- at your Metamorphohis is a fine gift you left us Freddie. Now tell God to take it out of His c.d. player! He's too busy listening to that and not paying attention to us - selfish and greedy as we might be. :)     Don't take offence- at your Metamorpho
B00012QM8G|5.0|In the list of major films that Spielberg has made this is the one above all others that everyone should see.<br />Its the true story of Oscar Schindler, a paid up member of the Nazi party who saved the lives of around 1,100 Jews in WW2.<br />Liam Neeson plays Schindler brilliantly, but the whole cast are excellent. It would be unfair to pick out any one person, such as Neeson, since for example Ralph Fiennes is also brilliant as a ruthless camp commandant. I've seen the film 3 or 4 times now and its one of the few films that has brought me close to tears, as true horror of the Holocaust is brought to life.<br /><br />What Schindler did shows a side of humanity that most of us will never see. At great personal risk, because he realised that people were being slaughtered, he bribed Nazi officials and ensured in the process that his factory never produced anything useful for the Nazi's. Scene after haunting scene is left etched on your memory. Perhaps for me, where Schindler hoses down the people who are packed into the trains in unbearable heat sums up the whole movie for me. He needn't of helped them, they were going to die anyway, but he did. We all know about mans inhumanity to man, but here is a demonstration of one mans great humanity. So whilst the film is very sad and emotional on one level, because of Schindlers actions the film doesn't leave you in a state of manic depression at the end!<br /><br />Its a fabulous movie and at 3hours and 7mins it is long, but you will never look at your watch, its that good.
0689878451|5.0|This book is WONDERFUL! It is a darling story and does not push any agenda on kids about homosexuality; only about a different type of family. Yes, it IS about two male penguins becoming a family, but the idea of homosexuality is not blatantly force-fed to children. In a very gentle way, it shows us how love can make a family, regardless of genders. Very age-appropriate, and actually, an excellent way to deal with issues that will eventually come down the road in parenting. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could all raise prejudice-free families??
B0000640VO|5.0|Not the usual type of movie i go for, but i watched this movie in on of my french classes, and it blew me away. The story is pretty good, the acting is terrific, and the cinematography was probably the best ive ever seen.  There are quite a few sacks on here that rate the movie lowly, but after reading most of the their reviews its because they cant handle watching a subtitled film, so my recommendation is this, if you dont know how to watch a movie and watch the subtitles dont bother watching it because you simply wont like the film, but if you arent a complete moron and can handle reading something, watch it. Its an outstanding movie.

0143036742|2.0|I'm sorry to say that I was very disappointed in this book.  In fact, I'm not even sure why I forced myself to finish it, since I simply did not care what happened to any of the characters.  Nor did I find the book at all amusing--I don't believe I laughed at any point.  I agree with those reviewers who've suggested that this would be a better short story than novel, because the events in the book are very repetitive.  However, I would probably still not read it, even as a short story.  While it is by no means the worst book I've ever read, it simply did not engage me at all.
0312954468|5.0|This is literally the best book i've ever read.  I felt so personal and close with all the characters that at the end, I was sad, not just that I had finished it, but that I had to say goodbye to these wonderful characters.  I have also read the sequel, and though it is based far far in the future from ancient egypt, it was JUST AS, if not more of a good read.  Especially since if you have read River God u are in on all the little secrets that the books characters are not.  But, I would even recommend reading the sequel to those who have not read river god.  These books are great fun, and full of every element a good story should have.  I laughed, I cried, I read them both AGAIN!!
B000RIHBIE|4.0|As a long time fan of Sum 41 who fell in love with the band at the 2003 Warped Tour, I have to say that former lead guitarist, Dave \\"Brownsound\\" Baksh, was right in saying that the band got darker and had lost their sense of humor.  The title track is definitely misleading, making you think that this Sum 41 going back to the beginning.  I also agree with the other reviewers in saying that this CD makes the band sound too similar to Green Day.  However, that doesn't stop me from enjoying this album, although forever lost are the hints of metallica and megadeth.  The songs still retain their classic Sum 41 catchiness and the great presentation of awesome lyrics (on most of the songs, anyway).

B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|THe only thing that I really have to say here is to ask the question....How many movies companies are backing Blu-Ray format discs?  How many are backing HD-Dvd?  From the last count, only 1, yes 1, movie studio is making HD-Dvd/reg Dvd discs of their movies, while every other movie studio is making their available in regular Dvd and Blu-Ray only.  HBO was also backing HD-Dvd, but even now they have jumped on the Blu-Ray band wagon over the less quality HD-Dvd.  THat right there should tell you who the clear cut winner is going to be in the next few years until someone develops something even better to try and take their places like it seems to happen ever decade or so.  I am not personally saying that Blu-Ray is better than HD-Dvd, since I have never seen a movie in HD-Dvd, but I do tend to trust the thinking of major movie companies and as far as I can tell, they are pretty much telling everyone that Blu-Ray is the way to go since Blu-Ray is what they are all backing over Hd-Dvd.  Take what you want out of this information, but if you want to be able to have the largest home movie selection in the future go for Blu-Ray since you know you can;t have a very large good home movie selection in HD-Dvd if you can only get and watch movies from only one movie studio and only have access to the movies that they make and no one else.
B000K15VSA|5.0|Some folks seem to be under the impression that the final \\"happy ending\\" sequence in the bright sunshine happens somewhere on Earth.  To the contrary, the final escape sequence at the end (before the elevator doors close) sets up the take that Deckard and Rachel have gone *off-world*.  -Hence the nice weather and no worries that Rachel will be hunted down as a Replicant back on Earth.    By the way, I'm another one who prefers the narration, as do most of my friends who have been watching BR for decades.  In desperation, I made a DVD copy of my International Release VHS tape before it wore out.  Once this set is out, I'll happily toss it!

B000000WG4|5.0|This too often gets tagged with the description \\"the music from The Exorcist\\", and that's a shame, because the whole album (especially the first half) is phenomenal.  Oldfield played almost all the instruments himself, and the whole suite (it's one long song clocking in at just under 50 minutes) is amazing to listen to.  I've always loved this album, and despite having other Oldfield albums (which are great as well), this is really the most exceptional of his work.  There are many, many memorable themes played within the 50 minutes, culiminating in a wonderful, intense, and joyous ending.  Oldfield doesn't get lumped as progressive rock, but his work is very similar to it, especially here.  Remember to get the original version of this.  There are many other versions (including a sequel, an orchestral version, and another version with narration by John Cleese(!)), so make sure you know what you're purchasing.
032147404X|5.0|When I bought this book, I assummed it would be like other camera books: difficult to understand etc. Scott Kelby has not only a great eye for photography, but a way of writing that is both easy to understand and humorous. He changed my quality of pictures so I get amazing shots almost effortlessly. Case in point: I did a photo expo in Dec 2006 and sold nothing. In March of 2007, after reading the book, I entered another expo and sold 15 pictures. It is that good. This is a book you won't lend out.  ~Alicia Bailey

Almost everyone down there either has a problem with this album either because it's not just like the White Stripes or they think Jack White sold out to Coca-cola.  Most of them seem to have a personal grudge with Jack White, like they knew him back in high school or something.  They talk about him and not about the music.  The music is amazing, I can't stop listening to it.  I give it 4 start because I wouldn't say that every song on the CD is equally as good and it's a bit short.  I like my CD's to last a bit longer than that.  Other than that this is definitely a great buy.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|As Hollywood movies go, this is definitely not bad.  It's supposed to be an Indie film, though, and won raves at Sundance.  This surprised me; I would have expected it to have been made at Disney.  The story is nothing special although there are some genuinely funny moments.     What saves it and earns my four stars here is the excellent cast.  Greg Kinnear is always terrific, in my book.  Alan Arkin gives the performance only an old master can do.  Abigail Breslin is truly Little Miss Sunshine;it's great to see a child's performance that isn't overly adorable.  Steve Carrell is very good in what had to be a difficult role, rising from his suicidal despair to life before our eyes. Paul Dano is good too as the suffering teenager.  I am not a big fan of Toni Collette.  Somehow she is too good at playing disagreeable, to make me warm up to her character.  But she does sweeten up a bit in the end.      As other reviewers have mentioned there are some things that are too improbable for us to take the film seriously, such as the fact that no one but grandpa has bothered to see the child's act.  I think that what bothered me the most was the stereotyped way of presenting most of the characters. We are clearly shown who the good guys and the bad guys are, in the eyes of the writers, and personally I find that annoying.  We're supposed to love the long suffering mom but I found her to be a dismal crank who has nothing but ridicule for her husband.  We're supposed to hate the dad but he is the one who by sheer force of will, pulls the family through all of the set-backs.     More cliches:  the stupid cop, the superficial folks at the beauty pagent, the cold hearted \\"bereavement counselor\\" etc.  Yeah, there's some truth in all of that, I suppose, but it detracts from the overall value of the film for me.  If this were just a screwball farce, then fine, but we are asked to take it seriously and the heavy handedness of the writers in telling us who we're supposed to cheer and who to boo, leaves me a bit disgusted.  However, that's Hollywood, and as I said above, if you don't take it too seriously, it's an entertaining two hours.     I have not seen the alternative endings but if I were to make one, it would feature Dad dumping Mom as soon as they get back to Albuquerque.    :-)
B000QCUB8I|2.0|This music has been done better by other people. I admit they assembled things a little differently, with a harder sound, but I don't hear the layers and depth of production that I've heard on other leading albums in this genre. Maybe you have to experience it live.
1400063515|4.0|The author is absolutely right.  Banks manage risks simplistically, foolishly.  Having been in the business myself I often posed questions about the models being used.  But when I asked, \\"Why should the probability follow a Bell curve; what if the context is discontinuous?\\" the risk management team leaders would call in their math experts and march on.      The Black Swan is also a fun read.  The range of the material from the personal to the professional to the philosophical makes for quite an enjoyable experience.  The only critique I would offer is that Nassim (or is it Nero) tends to make light of the serious.  But then, if you visit his site, he openly says that his favorite pastime is toying with the academics who lead us out on a limb with their epistemological certainty.    David Hillstrom
B000E5KUK6|4.0|I really liked this movie, but probably because I've never been a Japanese-Godzilla fan. It was a decent moster-movie with some fun effects and a (psuedo)-scientific storyline.    I think this movie may have been better reviewed if it weren't called \\"Godzilla,\\" but maybe that's just me.
B000Q6GUT8|5.0|Most reviewers are missing what insiders would recognize as a very credible scenario for the various assassinations that have taken place in America.  I found this movie compelling and I certainly do not subtract anything for any of what others found to be \\"bombs, babes, and booze.\\"  News flash: that's what it's like.<br /><br />The movie kept me guessing until the end, and I like it so much I am adding it to my list of \\"Great Spy DVDs\\" and palcing it second after only Breach.  This movie has a real message that most miss: privatizing our spies and our military is absolutely the fastest way to out-source and lose our national honor.<br /><br />Four books I especially recommend, for those who want to reflect on just how ugly it can get when money or ideology rather than honor talks:<br /><br />[[ASIN:1400097819 Licensed to Kill: Hired Guns in the War on Terror]]<br />[[ASIN:0452287081 Confessions of an Economic Hit Man]]<br />[[ASIN:0470098287 The Global Class War: How America's Bipartisan Elite Lost Our Future - and What It Will Take to Win It Back]]<br />[[ASIN:0275969878 How to Prevent Genocide: A Guide for Policymakers, Scholars, and the Concerned Citizen]]

0684865130|5.0|I'm almost at a loss to describe just how great this book is, but I'll give it a go anyway.  Suffice it to say Mr. Heller's tale of war, courage, and madness is as relevant today as it was on its first printing.  It's a book that will make you laugh, make you think, and make your heart ache all at the same time.<br /><br />This is the story of Yossarian, an American bombardier stationed on Pianosa under the command of the vain Colonel Cathcart.  No matter how many missions Yossarian and his comrades fly, the colonel demands more of them, gradually raising the number from twenty-five all the way up to eighty.  Yossarian becomes increasingly desperate to escape the certain death he knows is waiting for him, especially as his friends are seemingly knocked off one-by-one not just by German gunners but sometimes by friendly fire or outright bizarre circumstances--like being smothered by a cat.  Surrounded by pompous, preening, madmen like Cathcart, Yossarian turns out to be the only sane person on the base because he still has at least a shred of conscience.<br /><br />The satiric wit employed to paint the Army Air Force as bumbling stooges might have seemed ridiculous until a few years ago.  Now with Gulf War II and soldiers being sent on four, five, or more tours of duty it doesn't seem quite so far-fetched that a Colonel Cathcart or General Peckem could really exist.<br /><br />As good as this book is it can be a challenge keeping all the characters straight and all the events in proper order.  And like a \\"Saturday Night Live\\" skit this goes on a little longer than it should until the bit starts to lose some of its impact.  The end is tremendous as Yossarian does the only thing he can do in the face of overwhelming stupidity and madness.<br /><br />If you're a fan of M*A*S*H the movie or TV show then this book is right up your alley with its wisecracking antiheroes and bumbling commanders.  Really to me \\"Catch-22\\" seems like the precursor to that movie/series only on a grander scale.<br /><br />And hey this is one of the only books to add a new word to the dictionary, so that's neat too.  Go ahead and give this a read; you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />That is all.a grander scale.<br /><br />And hey this is one of the only books to add a new word to the dictionary, so that's neat too.

B000Q6GUTI|5.0|We saw this movie in the theater and liked it. Bought the DVD when it came out. Special features are good.
0670034711|5.0|I loved this book and would love to have lunch with this author.  She is vibrant and funny and deeply connected to her wisdom base.  I appreciated her honesty, vulnerability to reveal what is often not said outloud about our humanness and our monkey minds.  I hope she writes many many more of her life stories.
B000PTYPAC|5.0|I recently purchased this cd in an effort to find something more from Paramore. Since \\"All We Know Is Falling\\" was an exceptional album, I knew for a fact this one would be too. And sure enough, as I played the very first song I was completely blown away. Not only was their first album great, but I can say this one is even better. All the songs are more hard and rocky, and Hayley's voice is beautiful as always. The sound is more clean and it's simple to fall in love with each song. I will add that my favorite song on this album is the last one, \\"Born For This\\". I would suggest you buy this album immediately if you loved \\"All We Know Is Falling\\"!
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|Anybody with a hi def tv should go out and buy this movie. It was an incredible movie at the theaters and should look just as good in the living room on Blu-Ray. The only knock I have heard on 300 from the critics is the abundant computer effects. I however think they added to the movie because they were so seamless. I think they did a better job than the CGI effects on Lords of the Rings.
B0000AM6LY|3.0|There are not too many good ones on this one.. BUT. BUT BUT BUT-  You NEED SUNRISE. Just like De La Soul sampled 'I can't go for that' -Hall & Oats - with much success-- so does Red on Sunrise. Such a great song. It is so amazing.  Red also covers Bob Dylan on this one and it is really good.   With the exception of 'Pocket Book'--Like all Simply Red albums-- I am totaly blown away by one or two songs. Antother one or two are pretty good-- one or two are very ok, and the rest are kinda tired (like old red himself).

B000PGTPE6|5.0|This CD/DVD combo records Springsteen's tour in support of his album, The Seeger Sessions.<br /><br />Springsteen tours with a 13-piece band including banjos, accordions, tin whistles, and occasional E-Street fiddler Soozie Tyrell,<br /><br />The result is a romp through much of the Seeger Sessions album along with some radical reinventions of Springsteen's own material, all performed in front of a super-hot crowd at the Point Theater in Dublin, Ireland.<br /><br />The crowd starts singing the opening chorus of \\"Old Dan Tucker\\" and they go absolutely nuts for the Irish sound of \\"American Land\\". In between, Bruce turns \\"Open All Night\\" into a raucous big band swing number. He turns the rocker \\"Further On Up the Road\\" into gospel and transforms \\"If I Should Fall Behind\\" (our wedding song!) into a waltz.<br /><br />\\"Growin' Up\\", \\"Atlantic City\\", and \\"Blinded By the Light\\" also get new arrangements, and Springsteen sings a straightforward and powerful version of his rarity \\"Highway Patrolman\\".<br /><br />He sings songs from the Depression era such as \\"Jesse James\\" and \\"My Oklahoma Home\\" and then reworks the lyrics to the 1929 Blind Alfred Reed song \\"How Can A Poor Man Stand Such Times And Live?\\" into a scathing condemnation of the US government's handling of Hurricane Katrina. A slowed-down \\"When the Saints Go Marching In\\" later in the show also evokes the Big Easy.<br /><br />One of the oddest surprises in the mix is \\"Love of the Common People\\", a minor hit for Paul Young in the '80s that Springsteen does pretty much straight-up.<br /><br />The video is technically excellent. The only thing it adds that isn't on the audio CDs is am impromptu backstage jam of \\"Cadillac Ranch\\" as the credits roll.<br /><br />What I enjoyed most about this album is how much fun Bruce and his band are having. This is a performance by musicians who have a great love of making music and it truly shows.

B000002JOH|4.0|Pantera's Vulgar Display of Power was considered a highly influential album back upon its release in 1992.  I'm not really into this kind of heavy metal (obviously combined with some grunge aspects) but some of these songs are okay.  I can't deny the influence this band had on the popular music scene (for better or worse) and this is the album responsible for the future generation of heavy metal bands.    \\"Mouth for War\\" starts things off.  The guitar riff that opens the song is pretty good, and the drumming adequate.  Decent guitar solo in the middle that you soon realize is pretty melodic.  The chorus is alright, though nothing exciting.  Unfortunately, when the verse melody finally kicks in, I'm immediately reminded that the heavy metal music scene hasn't changed at *all* over the last 15 years.  I'm writing this review in the middle of July in the year 2007.  The metal scene hasn't changed much, and that's disappointing (and frightening).  I bet 10 years from now we'll *still* be hearing bands with nearly-identical ideas deliberately copied from this Pantera album.  The days of creative acts such as Metallica and Queensryche dominating the scene are offically over.      \\"Walk\\" rules.  The guitar riff that repeats throughout the song is quite memorable, along with the vocal melody.  Catchy song overall.  F***ing Hostile\\" is a REALLY energetic track.  Not really what I'd call a classic because the speed and the guitar riffs wear me down after a while.  It's only a couple minutes long, and it's really too heavy for me to handle.  The lead singer tends to be overbearing on several occasions, and it's hard for me to understand the appeal.      \\"This Love\\", just like \\"Mouth of War\\", immediately grabbed my attention because of the many *many* artists who copied the way this song was created and sounds.  I can't tell you how many songs I've heard that sound just like this one.  The mellow section that begins the song is supposed to be creepy and grunge-y, but it just sounds like an unmemorable melody that's basically a ballad.  The song is actually a switch between a ballad and a rocker.  The rocking parts come into the picture quite unexpectedly and sounds clunky and out of place compared to the mellow section.  In other words, I'm going back and forth between bored and annoyed.  Not really that good of a song, but at least these guys were one of the originators.  They deserve credit for that.  Not acknowledging how significant this band was on the heavy metal scene would be total ignorance.    Many times I think Pantera just took what Metallica did and simplified their style and sound.  Pantera sounds quite similar to the commercial period of Metallica's career (the Black Album).  It's also funny how people mention Pantera as being the band to finally end the hair metal movement of the 80's, and yet, their guitar solos are almost identical to bands like Twisted Sister and Quiet Riot.  They just increased the anger and the volume of the vocal melodies while still putting songs together more or less the same way as any hair metal band.  It would be impossible to deny Pantera's influence, despite what I think about them personally, so for that the album gets a fair rating from me.

B000002G85|5.0|Eric Clapton's solo debut album is really good classic rock.  \\"After Midnight\\" which has become the ultimate late night party song, and \\"Let It Rain\\" with its dazzling display of guitar work (I hear Clapton extended the guitar jam in concert- great track!).  Other tunes that people might not recognize are equally as satisfying, such as the jazzy/funky \\"Slunky\\" and other tracks that make good use of combining female and male vocals such as in  \\"I Don't Know Why\\" and \\"Lonesome And A Long Way From Home\\".  A solid debut.  Of course, live Clapton is the ultimate choice, but his debut studio album is sure to leave you wanting more.
B000OQF6N6|4.0|Let me start off if you don't like what Billy Corgan has been reforming \\"The Pumpkins\\", you don't like some harder songs on this album or you don't agree with his views (Fan Or Not), even though I mainly don't (Still respect him, unless he does something major). As being a \\"Pumpkins\\" fan since \\"Mellon Collie\\" since I was introduced to them to my babysitter, they have been the only real band I have listened to since being around 10. After \\"Mellon Collie\\", \\"The Pumpkins\\" never could match the success of it. After losing Jimmy for a while and D'Arcy not anymore in the pumpkins (After Adore), they would release \\"MACHINA\\" (Which I consider one of the worst albums ever by a band I like) and problems with Virgin Records, they would break-up in December 2000. It's amazing that they lasted over 10 years. As I heard Billy put an full page ad an newspaper, I was doubtful that D'Arcy would ever want to join \\"The Smashing Pumpkins\\" again.(Of course some of you may say Billy wants to throw his name back into the mix again, but I still believe that his reasons for reforming \\"The Pumpkins\\" were legit Even more suprising there is no word from her yet about the new \\"Pumpkins\\". James Iha turned down the offer. So he had to get two members. I personally would have expected Billy to rehire Melissa auf der Maur, since she writes her own songs and had released a solo album (I would expect on the next album, that Billy writes less songs). It was very shameful to hear, that Billy would rather support the big retail store than the independent music stores. In my opinion this (You have to admit is better than \\"MACHINA\\". This is either is my (I don't rate albums and songs) second favorite album behind of course \\"Mellon Collie\\" or behind it, Gish and Siamese Dream. The album starts off with \\"Doomsday Clock\\", which should have been the first single and which is one of their best guitar-drum songs since \\"Cherub Rock\\". The next song \\"7 Shades Of Black\\" I would say is about 7 out 10 stars and fitsgreat on this album. \\"Bleeding The Orchid\\" is one of the softer songs on the album sounds to me like \\"The Pumpkins\\", would have today. Even if you like the old \\"Pumpkins\\" you should at least like \\"That's The Way (My Love Is)\\", which would be another song like \\"Doomsday Clock\\" that should be on a hits complation (If there is another one). \\"Tarantula\\" of course being the first single and being leaked to later be released I would rate as great as \\"Doomsday Clock\\" and \\"That's the Way (My Love Is)\\". The next song \\"Starz\\" may seem somewhat \\"Zwan\\" it is a lot better than any song on that album (To be honest, there is no song on this album that could be bad as a \\"Zwan\\" song. The next song \\"United States\\", is somewhat overlong and could have been better. \\"Neverlost\\" to be honest should have been a B-Side. \\"Bring The Light\\" could have been a little better. \\"(Come On) Let's Go!\\" is the last great song on the album and could be another single. For God And Country and Pomp And Circumstances could also have been B-Sides, but still aren't anything from horrible. In all this album was worth the wait and will should at least sell around 1,000,000 copies. The bad thing about the tour, even though \\"The Pumpkins\\" had an album release party at the 9:30 club in Washington D.C. and will be performing at the Virgin Festival soon in Baltimore is that they need to play more east coast dates and they should tour more in the USA before they go overseas. My main hope is that Billy starts to let his new bandmates write songs and even Jimmy. By the next album, if it's just really bad, I won't support \\"The Smashing Pumpkins\\" then. If you like really bad stupid pop/any rap music artists (Like Rihanna, Fall Out Boy) just because there popular or just like to bother people because you like to then don't bother me, rate this review or message me, because you will me wanting to climb back into your hole.

B000QZZGTY|4.0|This is a version of the Marquis de Sade's story, The 120 Days of Sodom, a story about four powerful men who enslave two dozen teenagers and torture them repeatedly. Unlike the book the film is set in the Sal&ograve; Republic, the Nazi puppet state in northern Italy, in the year 1944. Pier Paolo Pasolini directs his final film. The four powerful men in the story are referred to as the Duke, the Magistrate, the President and the Bishop. To kick things off they marry each other's daughters and then begin to have young males and females kidnapped (18 in all, 9 of each gender). They also have four older prostitutes join in and this whole multitude marches over to some palace. Mind you, the time period means that the Nazi occupied Sal&ograve; Republic is on its last legs and on the cusp of being crippled by the Allied forces. So the setting gives us sort of an end of days feeling right from the get-go. The content and commentary certainly continue with that subject matter throughout.<br /><br />The film is set up in four stages, the first being the ante-inferno, which refers to those who are not quite condemned to hell but also not allowed into heaven either. The film's setting is meant to feel like a brief moment in purgatory with its isolated party of characters doing unspeakable things before judgment, and then it all must end. The second stage is the circle of manias, or obsession, where we see the sexual humiliation of the film manifest itself further. The third stage is the circle of excrement, which is where we see the characters consume feces. Pasolini has used this as a metaphor broadly for the perverse level of consumption depicted in the film overall, and directly as a commentary on mass-produced foods and consumerism. The fourth stage is the circle of blood, this is where those who do not partake in this bizarre corruption are brutally murdered in various ways. The stages bring us further and further downward into degeneracy, which Pasolini has applied strongly as a denunciation against capitalism and fascism.<br /><br />If you found any interest in the above commentary, then I assume Sal&ograve; may be just the film for you, but I assure you that the film is definitely not for everyone. It is up front with its content. It's controversial for many different reasons, but primarily it is the visual content that turns people away. Yes, it's not as violent as Saw and the nudity is not quite as pretty as it is in some movies, but Sal&ograve; is anything other than an exploitation film. One may even argue that it is the exact opposite of exploitation.  Perhaps it is Sal&ograve;'s censure of exploitation that makes it truly disturbing as a modern social commentary.n against capitalism and fascism.     If you found any interest in the above commentary, then I assume Salò may be just the film for you, but I assure you that the film is definitely not for everyone. It is up front with its content.

B000PTYP5C|5.0|I have been following DT since 1994 when I was introduced by a friend who played Images and Words in a car ride home from school.  That was 13 years ago and DT remains the only band I simply do not get tired of listening to.    They were formed in 1985 and here we stand in the year 2007 and 10 studio albums later with Systematic Chaos which I think is arguably their finest work to date.    Some of their previous releases took a little time invested listening for the tracks to grow on me.  They always did and I always grew to love the music.  Systematic Chaos stands out for me as a DT album which I LOVED on first listening.  I mean I think I nearly blew the speakers out in my house the first time The Dark Eternal Night started piping through my system.    Some standout tracks on Systematic Chaos:    In the Presence of Enemies - Part 1:  First track on the album and a great opener for DT as it has a very progressive feel to it with a complicated riff that they play with in several different forms leading up to James LaBrie cutting into vocals at 5:13.  For some reason, 'clean and crisp progressive metal' comes to mind when thinking about this track.    Forsaken - Opens with a creepy sounding piano sequence from Jordan Rudess which would find itself at home in a movie like \\"The Exorcist\\" and then explodes with the rest of the band playing a variation of that theme.  The lyrics are very creative and spell a story of a person being visited at night by a 'forsaken' who tempts the victim to give themselves up.  This song has a more ballad type feel and you are tempted to sing along with this one.    The Dark Eternal Night - If In the Presence of Enemies is clean and crisp, then this song is its antithesis sounding grungy and ballsy.  It starts with John Petrucci on a seven string guitar playing a filthy riff.  The vocals cut in at 1:11 with LaBrie and Portnoy together distorted and angry.  This is a song where your volume knob has a mind of its own and speaker companies may make some money in replacement parts.  This wouldn't be out of place on a Megadeth album and I think DT may find some new fans with this tune.    A note on the 5.1 mix on the bonus DVD...this isn't just the music cloned on the surround and center speakers.  The music has actually been mixed.  You will hear panning and splitting of vocals and instruments.  The bonus DVD is well worth having if you are fortunate enough to have a surround system.    The documentary on the DVD is the only thing I wasn't entirely happy with.  While it was cool to see how the songs take shape, there were a few things that bothered me.  For one, if you watch this with a good sounding subwoofer, be ready to turn it down during the interviews with John Petrucci as they were done in a very windy alley and subwoofers will lovingly reproduce all that wind making the interview almost impossible to sit through.  The second thing is a bit nitpicky, but I feel they should have future proofed the documentary a little better by filming it in a 16:9 aspect ratio.  Widescreen TVs will be ubiquitous in the near future as prices continue to tumble.  It would have been nice not having to watch it in pillar box format on my tv.    Most bands don't last 20 years.  If they do, they are tired sounding and probably ready to hang it up.  DT is in their prime after 2 decades, and if they continue to make albums like this, the fans will respond with good album sales and sold out shows.  I hope to see a 30th anniversary tour in the future.    If you are new to DT I can't think of a better way to start than picking up Systematic Chaos
B0000025D0|5.0|I am not a huge fan of Bruce Springsteen. I think most of his work after \\"Tunnel of Love\\" is horrid, yet even if you dont happen to like his music anymore, its really hard not to like the dark and edgy \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\\". This is not a typical Springsteen album, and sure there are some slower paced material with a more \\"Whiny\\" Bruce, but this is tolarable, condidering the lyrical content is so strong, and the emotions run high on this album. Even though I am not familer with any of his material after \\"Tunnel of Love\\" this is the best of the bunch, and even though \\"Born to Run\\" put him on the map, I think this hits harder and it a better album. If you are just a causual fan, this is a great place to start, and even if you arent a fan, this is a great Rock album to have. In fact its better then great, its Outstanding! Five stars to Bruce for this classic. (you also get some great guitar playing from Bruce, with some short but sweet solos, and some decent drumming here, two things that seem to be missing on a lot of Springsteens Work, espically the newer songs that I have heard. I havent heard them all, but what I have heard does not even come close to this)  ENJOY
B000QGAU4E|5.0|Not since the classic epic \\"Doogal\\" have I been so riveted by the stark realism and deep originality of a movie.  This is the kind of stuff that our government doesn't want the \\"little people\\" to see lest we swell into an \\"uprising.\\"  Nearly every scene kept me at the edge of the toilet, unable to hold it in as I squeezed tight in anticipation.  Don't miss this sure fire hit.
B00002MZ4V|5.0|This two disc CD does an excellent job of covering thirty years of Academy Award winner John Williams' greatest hits.  It contains main title themes from films such as Star Wars, E.T., Jaws, Indiana Jones, Home Alone, and of course the best theme of them all (in my opinion), Superman.  It also contains two principal themes from the summer Olympics that NBC has used in its broadcasts since 1996 when John Williams composed the album \\"Summon the Heroes.\\"    The sound quality is excellent and I've been extremely pleased with the product.    Bottom Line: Great CD with unforgettable hits.  Buy it today if you're interested in it.
B000089A06|4.0|This is certainly a great movie - Anthony Hopkins cannot be compared - he is a truly great man of our times.  But, if you want to see Gil Grissom (C.S.I.) when he was young, go get the original Red Dragon movie - he was a very handsome young man in that movie and delivered a great performance.
B000002I2M|5.0|Yes the album is inconsistent, and yes there is too much blues filler - but that misses the point. Unlike all the other previous Doors albums, which were over produced to varying degrees, this album gives you an unvarnished glimpse into a stream-of-consciousness Morrision as he teeters on the edge between pure genius and sheer madness.     Morrison warns us from the start in the Changeling that this this not going to be a TV-ready performance when he sings \\"I've never been so broke that I couldn't be stoned\\". A great rock screamer and a fantastic opening song. The title song is simply the Doors at their best - great lyrics and fantastic ensemble playing - especially the drumming of John Densmore. It's wonderful to hear him play with an actual bassist. The WASP (Texas Radio and the Big Beat) is Morrison at his poeteic best, full of provoacative imagery. Riders on the Storm is one of the most uniquely ethereal pieces of rock music ever created. There's not much to say about the rest of the album that hasn't been said already.     In short - all fans of 60's psychedelic rock need this album. If you love \\"Tonight's the Night\\" or \\"The Madcap Laughs\\", this is your cup of tea.
0452281881|5.0|Hilarious. If you work in advertising (or want to) and you have not read this book, do so. Absolutely bloody brilliant!     Also good for anyone that works in an office of any kind. I love how you can put each character in the book to someone you know!    I have lent this book to many friends who have loved it ...    Its a book you won't be able to put down!
0316067598|4.0|This is an amazing tale of heroism and humanity. You follow Luttrell through his training and then onto a devastating mission. It's truly heroic,  though his politics came too much into the book. A little less hero worship of Bush would have been better (though he is from Texas).
B000000WCA|4.0|You gotta admit it.  \\"Wannabe\\" is one of the all time catchiest pop jingles.  Is it in your head right now?  \\"Say you'll be there\\" is also very good.  The remainder of teh album, while nowhere near so catchy, isn't bad.  It's perfectly respectable chick pop.  Gotta own it as a piece of 90s \\"culture.\\"

1400049628|5.0|They say that \\"everything you really need to know, you learn in kindergarten.\\"  Not so. Kindergarten is not sufficient preparation for survival against the living dead; zombies will not refrain from ingesting your brains if you offer to share your crayons with them. That given, this book is recommended to fill the deficiency in your education. It's full of detailed information that will be valuable to anyone interested in protecting their homes and families from the undead, including helpful diagrams and a handy log to chart your own zombie-sightings. (This is very useful when following the movements of many of today's public figures.)If you value your safety, buy this book.
B000065V3H|5.0|Funny romance movie with a really cute young Patrick Dempsey.  It has a great message that you need to just be yourself and not change who you are to fit in.

B000AAF1U4|5.0|I bought this movie more for me than the kids, it is so funny!  David Spade is his usual sarcastic self who learns to grow up and treat people right.    I am not a fan of Disney movies like Hunchback of Notre Dame or Hercules, but this a classic.
B00005JPLW|5.0|This is the first movie that I went to see twice in a theatre, since Star Wars!  Yes, I'm in my 50's, but thoroughly enjoyed this macho adaptation of the true story of Thermopylae.  To those who pan it for political incorrectness and comic-book visuals,go rent a Barbara Streisand movie or something!  My wife even loved this movie!  Most people have no clue of what this battle meant to the survival of Greek/Western civilization and form of government that we now have, but as long as the story of the 300 Spartans is told, King Leonidas will have achieved immortality.   Will any of us be able to claim the same in 2,500 years??!!
B000K15VSA|5.0|I recently saw Blade Runner (the Director's Cut) for the first time ever, without having seen the original theater relase, and I loved it! Some parts were confusing, which is why I want to see the original version, with the voice over explanations, but I don't mind ambiguity in films. This is why I enjoyed the ending so much. Will Decker \\"retire\\" Rachel, or will he help her escape? I can't wait until this new 5 disc release comes out! Finally, fans here at the States can have the Theater Version on DVD! And not to mention a lot of cool extras that are sure to be included.<br />P.S.-along with this anniversary set, I also plan to purchase the novel.

Even though the circumstances are completely impossible, to me it's easy to relate to. Just the message it sends out. Plus, it made my cry twice. Any movie that does this and affects me that much is automatically good in my opinion.

1582701709|2.0|I have been interested in the power of the mind to allow us to feel better through visualization, positive thought and positive action for many years. But I found \\"The Secret\\" to be a disappointment and can't really understand what the hype is all about surrounding this book. It gives a distorted message in which personal development, self effort and growth take a backseat to wishful, magical thinking. I would rather read the new Harry Potter [[ASIN:0545010225 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Book 7)]] if I want magic in my life.    The book and DVD are like a slick infomercial where you can have your wants fulfilled with very little effort or the need for self development.  Once you get past the slick production values, you soon realize that the ideas offer little practical help in terms of personal growth nor do they offer a practical approach that asks for clear action not merely wishful thinking.     Positive thinking can allow us to recognize the power of our mind in re-framing experience and to overcome mental distortions that hinder our personal best. We are always in charge of our reaction and response to life events but the idea that the universe is merely a catalog or a genie that merely waits to serve our desires no matter how selfish, childish or unintelligent they might be is a highly arrogant attitude.     Yes, gratitude is very important in moving us away from negative thoughts and feelings of lack in our life. It's important to count our blessings and to move in the right direction. Nevertheless, the direction promoted in this book is no better than any other get-rich-quick scheme with no need for effort or personal development. Worse still \\"The Secret\\" gives little consideration for the environment or other people. In fact, it twists the Law of Attraction as a justification for blaming-the-victim and for lack of care for those who suffer.    Real mental power allows us to change our perception though reflection, insights and paradigm shifts. Magical thinking is an unscientific form of reasoning based on superstition. In \\"The Secret\\" magical thinking is presented as your thoughts having power to influence events, either beneficially through positive vibes or negatively through negative vibes.    Certainly the human mind has power: We have the power to move our own arm  but I can't will a piece of paper to move just by my thoughts. Nor can my thoughts will another person to move in order to give me a parking spot when I want it. Positive thinking in terms of personal self development through transformation of our perception has an important place in our spiritual growth but superstitious ideas need to be avoided.    \\"The Secret\\" also makes the assumption that everyone's happiness rests in basic materialistic values largely centered around getting cars, money and mansions. The message is centered around \\"getting\\" with little mention of being giving or transforming ourselves at deeper psychological and spiritual levels. Personal effort, action, humility and care for others have little place in the world-view presented in \\"The Secret.\\" Even with some of the positive thoughts presented in the book and DVD, these flaws reduce the value of the message.    Whoever reads or watches \\"The Secret\\" needs to exercise common sense, good judgment and listen to their conscience when receiving the slick presentation. Take it with a grain of salt is the best recommendation. I also encourage people to read other books that expand awareness in different ways. Some books that I recommend:    1. Nexus: A Neo Novel for its message of overcoming pain and finding compassion  2. [[ASIN:1599869470 The Master Key System]] on which \\"The Secret\\" is based  3. [[ASIN:0679783229 The Essential Writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson (Modern Library Classics)]] who is strongly influenced by Vedanta as clearly evident from \\"The Over-Soul\\"  4. [[ASIN:0061122416 The Alchemist]] A story about following your dreams  5. [[ASIN:0691096120 Walden: (Writingsof Henry D. Thoreau)]] Thoreau influenced the ideas of Gandhi, Dr. King and was the one of the first environmentalists
0440237688|5.0|If you haven't read it yet, you must. You just must. It's such an interesting idea for a book, one that is bound to interest all ages. I think I've read it 5 times. Oh, the sequels.. they aren't as great. But enjoy this one!
B000OPOANE|4.0|The MVI is not a bad thing - it offers many features the CD does not, including .mp3 DRM free and 5.1 audio, but the high resolution audio is not in DVD audio format, and simply plays back as down-sampled 44.1khz.  For some reason, I expected music videos, though after a short review that was never mentioned.    Snakes and Arrows is easily one of Rush's best and should be an automatic purchase for any Rush fan.    Love it!
0684853523|5.0|If you are looking for a straight-up writing manual, look elsewhere. This is a thoroughly engaging tips-n-tricks/memoir by the rightfully named King of Horror.<br /><br />The recommended reading list in the back is one of the book's biggest assets (though I was disappointed at some of the writers he enjoys - that ain't my business, though).
B000001E8S|5.0|I do not see this work as a U2 record, I see it as what it is: A collaboration between Brian Eno, U2, and 'extra passengers' (Pavarotti, Howie B, Holi). Lets all remember that Mr. Brian Eno was already rock and rollin' in Roxy Music when Bono and The Edge where pubert kids. So I do not agree with the reviewers that althought they love or dislike this work, they tend to see it as a U2 Album.     U2 has taken the influence of Eno since The Unforgettable Fire and melt it with their unique style. With Passengers, Eno is the creator of 'strategies, sequences, synthesizer, treatments, mixing...and vocals'.  U2 are almost Eno's sidemen, it is Eno who is in charge here of the final result of the record. So when people compare this with other U2 records, they should compare it first with the numerous Eno's catalogue, starting in 1971 - Passengers could be very similar with Eno's 'Another Green World ' and 'My Life in the Bush of Ghosts'.  Songs like Ito Okashi, One Minute Warning, Plot 180 are pure Eno, Theme From the Swan comes straight from 'Music For Films'. The only real U2 songs Miss Sarajevo, a beatiful ballad that ends with a masterful Pavarotti solo, as stroke of geniuses; the other one Your Blue Room.     It is true that you can listen U2 in Bono's voice and The Edge's trippy guitar (an Eno influence since Unforgettable Fire) and their pulsating playing, but the concept here is all Eno, you can't blame U2 for some of the slow ambient and edgy music that's in here, completely alien to rock/pop format: U2 by themeselves would have never made an album like this.  Now I will have to admit that I love this album until the song One Minute Warning, until there 5 stars, after that it comes a little meandering but good anyway.    I'd recommend Passengers for rock fans who also like electronica and experimental music, pure and only rock fans might want to stay away.
0316067598|5.0|Politics aside, this is a compelling story and a great book to read on vacation.  Meaning that you won't want to take time off from this book to go to work.  I didn't have to agree with Petty Officer Luttrell's politics to understand why he holds his beliefs so passionately.  Politics have affected his life in such an all-consuming way.  Like Frankl said about the concentation camps, the bravest ones died and I appreciate the opportunity to learn of their story and mourn their loss.

B0009UC7H0|2.0|I was excited about buying this movie.  The trailer was sure deceptive as I thought it would have been interesting and fun.  I thought it bordered on ridiculous.  Matthew's character was not blieveable at all.  It was also pretty hard to imagaine Penelope as a doctor.  The only actor who played his part and actually had me believeing in his character was Zahn.  Sahara could have done a lot better if the script as welll as the acting was better
B000PMGNK4|4.0|It was a pretty good movie. If you don't know this is a movie to kind of cap the Stand Alone Complex series. I am a huge fan of GitS and like this movie thoroughly. In my opinion though the story did not warrant a movie, as it doesn't come close to the other two GitS movies both visually and in story. Also, the story seemed a little off to me, I don't know if it was intentional given the plot line (don't want to spoil it for you).     Pretty good overall though.
0553260111|3.0|I wasn't sure what to expect with this novel. I knew it bore little resemblance to the movie, but not much else, and I'm not a big reader of this genre.<br /><br />I found the first two-thirds of the novel tedious, a chore to read. The premise - a man with no memory - was established almost immediately, but the narrative degenerated into long-winded and pedantic conversations about international banking and security.<br /><br />Presumably, this exposition was supposed to justify how the protagonist - Bourne - could successfully access a Swiss numbered bank account when he had no recollection of his identity. In fact, though, it had the reverse effect - anyone asking as many questions about security procedures would only draw attention to themselves.<br /><br />Sadly, the characters' motivations and actions weren't much more believable as the story progressed. Bourne holds a woman as hostage to escape pursuit, and treats her abominably. Of course, she then falls in love with him, and turns out to be an expert in international banking - crucial to understanding the scheme Bourne finds himself caught up in.<br /><br />The final third of the book greatly improves, though, as Bourne discovers the truth about his identity, and plots to outwit and eliminate his enemies.<br /><br />In short, a novel of mixed quality, with equal parts enjoyment and frustration. I admit, though, that despite the book's flaws, I will probably read the second in the series.

B000K15VSA|4.0|It is great to finally be able to get disks with all these different versions, but a few things need to be noted: (1) the only way to get the Workprint version is in this 5-disk set packed into a \\"briefcase\\" and which also includes a bunch of \\"memorabilia\\" and other junk and wasted packaging.  It would be nice if they'd just put out the disks without the other stuff.  (2) The only way to get any of the older versions is in either the 4-disk or 5-disk sets.  It would be nice if they made the older versions (basically disk 3) available separately for those who only want one of the older cuts.
0767827902|5.0|The cold wind that blows through the town at the beginning of the movie is perfect symbolism; this same cold wind blows through the lives of the people in it. This movie expresses what Thomas Wolfe wrote about loneliness being central to the human existence. That has been explored and expressed beautifully in films before, such ones as Sling Blade,The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter, Member of the Wedding, Taxi Driver...Likewise for this incredible film. The acting in this movie is superb on all levels,with Cloris Leachman's Oscar-winning performance clearly the film's most incredible, amazing acting of all. The direction:perfect. The first time I saw this, I wondered why it was done in black and white; by the end of the film, I realized it could be no other way. The music (there's no score, thank God; music comes from radios and jukeboxes, playing classic country and western weepers, mostly)only adds to the poignancy. Loneliness is everywhere in the sense of everyone looking for connection desperately. This movie points out the void or voids in our own lives, where they may lie. It is not solely about loneliness, by far, that is just the underlying theme; in fact, this movie has some scenes of such sensuality (many scenes, actually)with a passion rarely seen in movies; of course,desperation increases the need, the want, the desire, the release. It's no wonder many in this are consumed by desire and lust. Take Jacy, played by the beautiful young Cybill Shepherd; it's easy to see how she could wield such power over young men, with her looks; but as P.F. Sloan once wrote, \\"a pretty face can hide an evil mind\\", and that is the case, for she is the most scheming, self-centered, duplicitous character you will ever see...  The charcters in this are complex, as they should be, and due to the fact that nothing in this movie seems contrived, forced, or fake,it leaves you with a feeling that you rarely see in a movie; that it relates to real life as much as possible as a movie can;few movies are this way.  While there are some characters we don't know much about,there is the feeling, the loneliness that pervades, that even when little is given about a character, something is clearly amiss, such as poor Miss Mosey; we know little about her, but the few things she does say, and her expressions, tell us all we need to know. The main characters(played by a terrific, then-unknown ensemble of talented actors), are all well-fleshed-out, three-dimensional ones with well-defined motivations,with interesting stories (to put it mildly!); yet they live in a ghost town. And it's fascinating. This movie is a must-see for any and all fans of dramas. Just stupendous, this movie is one for the ages.

1594489505|5.0|What a difficult subject to cover, in the guise of a novel. If you enjoy thinking in images, then you will find endless food for thought, in this book.    He narrates, simply, and almost as effortlessly, you will get the problem, the challenge, and maybe the solution - though you may not be ready to admit it at first blush. Some of you will be able to say there is an \\"elephant in the room\\", to these readers, this book is dedicated.

B000E5N62U|5.0|A supernaturally-polished sphere of jazz-pop perfection.    The only bad news I can relay about Morph The Cat is that it is not experimental.    Big deal, Don knows what he does best, and he does it better.    Billed as the final installment of the solo trilogy (The Nightfly - 1982, Kamakiriad - 1993), this is probably the best of the three. The Nightfly was innovative and fresh, youthful; twenty-four years later we are now pondering mortality and loss of liberty.. bypassing the Philip K. Dick Weird of Kamakiriad, Morph returns to the stark bittersweet ascerbic angle of Nightfly, solidly set in post-9/11 Manhattan with patented Fagen character fresco-snapshot-stories.    The album is nothing less than what you expect from Fagen - crystalline, perfect and utterly premeditated, but this time more organic and rooty. More horns, no noodling nor an extraneous note. Keith Carlock plays drums on every track, and is allowed to de-quantize himself a bit, be a little funky and show why he is one of the fastest rising stars in New York.    Fagen seems to have rediscovered the hard hook, which wasn't readily apparent on most of Two Against Nature or Everything Must Go.. every last track on Morph has a gold medal pop-rock hook (we may see 'Security Joan' or 'Brite Nitegown' up for a Grammy this year). This really adds to the enjoyment of the album, as there is no trace of the obtuse, hard to grasp melody/changes on such Steely Dan songs like 'Green Book'. He also relies much more on his band to provide a solid soundscape for a voice that is aging but hasn't lost any range.    From what I hear, he's going to keep doing what he does, and I couldn't be happier.
1591791707|5.0|Nonviolent communication is a very effective tool for anyone looking to create a bridge of understanding and establishing healthy boundaries through thoughts and words. It moves away from the aggressive, competitive and confrontational models that so many people learn from parents, in dysfunctional relationships and at work. My cousin took \\"Assertiveness Training\\" back in the 70s. She said that NVC though took that to the next level by introducing compassion, understanding and nonjudgment though observations, feelings, needs and requests.    I've recommended this series to many people [including my cousin] and especially  those who have problems with coworkers and bosses. I thought it amusing that even one of Dr Rosenberg's participants conceded that working with parents can be the biggest NVC challenge of all. Nonviolent communication may not be the solution, but it does help.     One particular story Dr Rosenberg imparts among many is about how his grandmother -- a Jewish immigrant for whom English was a second language -- invited a homeless man into the house for a bit of food and rest. When she asked the man his name, he said, \\"Jesus the Lord.\\" Without a hint of irony or judgment, the grandmother introduced the man to the rest of the family as Jesus. She fed him and gave him a place to stay without a second thought for his gruff appearance or his unusual name. In her own way, by living NVC everyday, she provided the framework for Dr Rosenberg's works.    A few items to nitpick -- and by no means a slight or a reason not to buy the audiobook. In fact, go ahead and buy it now.     Sometimes using NVC language can seem a bit stilted and unnatural. For example Dr Rosenberg often says the phrase, \\"This meets my need to...\\" It works in writing and even when Dr Rosenberg says it. But personally, it sounds stilted and just doesn't quite roll off the tongue for many of us. Instead, I personally say, \\"This  works for me. Does this solution work for you?\\"    Another nitpick: I paraphrase a bit but Dr Rosenberg gives one particular sentence as an example of violent communication: \\"Minorities don't take care of their property.\\" Then he offers a nonviolent-communication example: \\"I've never seen the minority family down the street take out the trash.\\" I wondered if bringing up that the family a \\"minority\\" is truly germaine. Is bringing up a source of division and stereotype such a race or nationality truly nonviolent or would it be more kind to refer to the family as \\"the Smith Family\\" or even as \\"the family two doors down\\"?     Last small nitpick [and a bit of a spoiler]: Dr Rosenberg tells a compelling story of a patient who was uncommunicative and unresponsive due to severe psychological trauma. Dr Rosenberg describes how the woman finally broke through by writing a note to him in perfect NVC language. \\"Help me to express what is going on within me...\\" Not only did she become NVC fluent after 4 or 5 treatments, but she had the fine motor skills to write this out. So why then did she seem unable to pass him the note until he had to pry her fingers open? There must be more to the story than what we're being told, but it is a bit of a small plot loophole in the overall scheme of what is a great tool for communication and for expressing compassion while at the same time holding one's own integrity.    This audiobook introduced me to the grander realm of NVC and I've since attended some workshops where \\"jackal\\" and\\" giraffe\\" are introduced. Like me, you may find that you already use many of these techniques, but NVC just ads a few more tools to the toolbox.
034544678X|5.0|I owe Dr.McConnell a debt of gratitude: I purchased this book shortly after my cherished Alaskan Malamute and I began her long battle with cancer (osteosarcoma). I wanted to read something other than cancer-related books, and The Other End of the Leash turned out to be just right.     Dr. McConnell manages to mix discussions based on her work as an animal behaviorist with stories and anecdotes about her own experiences with her dogs as well as stories about other people's (sometimes crazy) interactions with their dogs.     It's a great book for any dog lover to read as sort of a refresher course on just who our shaggy friends are and on how we relate to them. It certainly brought me some piece of mind as I took my time reading it during the course of my dog's cancer treatment.    I'm just starting to read For the Love of a Dog, which promises to be equally interesting.    Thanks for the great books!

0618680004|5.0|I enjoyed Dawkins book and he puts forth a great hypothesis for not believing that there is a god.  I have given this a 5 stars because it may just have people think and not follow religious teachings blindly.<br />Oh how Christians have been led down the path away from God. They 'think' that God is somewhere outside of them and listen to human men attempt to teach them about God. It is very much like 5 blind men examining an elephant with each one interpreting it according to the place where they are touching and none realizing it is an elephant. Science is God. Science is quantum physics and it is used all the time by everyone because we create our world according to our thoughts and our thoughts and ideas are garnered from the quantum world and also created in the quantum world. God is INSIDE of each and every human on this planet. We<br />are each a piece of the beautiful Quilt of God. We don't need to pray to something outside of us. We only need to create and love life. When we love life, we are not abusers. There is no bigotry. There is no prejudice. There is no better than. We each make up the patchwork called the Quilt of God.

0316152196|5.0|Edgar and Anthony award-winner Connelly takes a high dive right into the turbulent currents of Los Angeles' racial tensions in this Detective Harry Bosch appearance.<br /><br />On the eve of a major lawsuit against the LAPD, high-profile civil-rights lawyer Howard Elias is shot. \\"Bosch thought about all the suspects there would be, many of them standing around outside at that very moment, watching.\\" The obvious suspects are the police; and the black populace, on the brink of rioting, demands action.<br /><br />Suing the police for beating a confession out of a (black) suspected  (white) child murderer, since acquitted, Elias has polarized the city. But Bosch soon discovers that the lawyer had more going for him than racial politics; he had evidence - evidence that the accused child killer, still presumed guilty, was truly innocent. Elias was confident of victory, but his big secret died with him.<br /><br />Find the secret, find Elias' killer, Bosch realizes. But retracing Elias' steps proves difficult, especially with the police stonewalling, the black community clamoring, and Elias' files off-limits. With adroit compassion, Connelly (\\"Blood Work,\\" \\"The Black Echo\\") explores the complexities of racial politics, using the hidden passions and public maneuvering to heighten suspense.<br /><br />Meanwhile, his wife's gambling habit is draining their marriage and city anger is nearing explosion. Bosch steps on toes and strains friendships as he pursues the sordid human mystery, unrelated but now at the core of all this political fury.<br /><br />Thoughtful, suspenseful, masterfully plotted and well written - as readers have come to expect from Connelly.

1400032717|5.0|Haddon has created an unlikely hero in Christopher Boone, a 15-year-old autistic boy who narrates this story.  It was absolutely fascinating to see the world through Christopher's eyes and watch him search for the truth, while overcoming some of his fears due to the nature of his autism.  Especially enjoyable were the snippets of mathematical problems and diagrams which were constantly running through his head.  The curious way of numbering the chapters reminded me of Jarod Kintz's \\"Emails from a Madman\\" where a system definitely was the intent.  This was one of those rare books that I absolutely did not want to end.  I could have read about many more escapades told by the delightful and honest voice of Christopher Boone.
B00005JPAO|5.0|Before I looked at the lowest ratings, I knew that most of those rating it that way would say this movie was boring.  Why?  Because it is not a fast-paced, in-your-face, thrill-a-minute movie.  But I didn't find it slow or boring.  I thought it was an absolutely fascinating look behind the scenes of how the royals think and act.  Was it accurate?  Who knows, since they live in such a private, sheltered world?  But it certainly was convincing.  The Oscar for Helen Mirren's performance was well deserved, but all the characters were convincing.  Very well cast movie.  I have watched it twice all the way through and two more times partially.  No, there is nothing complex here and no great plot.  Just a really good depiction of how events may have unfolded.  After a while you forget you are watching a movie and it almost seems like a behind the scenes peek at the monarchy.  The actors and actresses are that good.

I would have liked to see the story told with a little more nuance and ambiguity.
B00005JPLW|4.0|If you are going to see this movie for any reason but to see an ultra-violent movie in which every one dies and that has barely any moral value then turn around. That being said I personally LOVED this movie. The battle scenes are as groundbreaking as The Matrix and as breathtaking as The Lord of the Rings. I was wowed by the shots of all three hundred Spartans fighting in force to push back the hordes of Persians attacking them and if that had be how all the fighting sequences were it would be an equal to any recent action movie, but the really amazing part of this movie was the super slo-mo battles between individual Spartans and Persians.    As good as the action in this movie was I could not whole heatedly give this movie five stars. I thought it made the movie silly and cliché to have the Persian army consist of fifteen foot monsters capable of taking a knife in the eye and bicep without being injured obese executioners with axes for hands. The main body of the Persian army consists of Immortals who are depicted somewhat like the orcs in The Lord of the Rings not to mention that Xerxes the leader of the Persians is showed as a eight foot tall gay guy. This was by far the worst part of the movie. I understand that the director was tied to the comic book and had to keep similar to it, but this aspect could have easily been dropped from the movie. I don't mind the monsters because it isn't historically acurate, i don't mind that this movie doesn't follow the real story of the Spartans, I just thought it was unimportant and constantly reminded me I was in a movie and that all this action in front of me was just filmed in front of a green screen.     While I think that this movie should have differed from the comic book with the monsters and immortals, I think it should've stayed with Frank Miller's version and left the queen of Sparta with a much smaller role. I thougt the love interest between her and Leonidas was dumb and on such a different pace from the rest of the movied that it made it pass inexorably, whereas alone it might have been intriguing.    This movie is much better since it was cut loose from the real history and I think that anyone who is focused on talking about how unrealistic this movie is completely misses the point of the movie. This is not a movie based on history, but a movie based on a comic book. Again I will stress how incredible the fighting in this movie is. I never tired of watching the Spartans and Persians battle, and I thought the variety of the fighting was responsible for this. I honestly LOVED this movie and would recommend it to any action movie lover. If you're looking for a middle paced action flick to watch with the kids, don't pick this one. 300 is a movie for a boys night out.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|I never had the \\"pleasure\\" of living in the \\"Workers' Paradise\\" of East Germany before the fall of the Wall, and therefore cannot vouch for the authenticity of the life depicted in this film. But others have, and I have read enough of their accounts, including some by von Donnersmarck's childhood memories (his father's uncle was the Chief of Protocol for East Germany's President, Eric Honecker), to be convinced that \\"that's the way it was.\\" For almost five decades, some sixteen millions people lived in an Orwellian country known as the DDR, Deutsche Demokratische Republik (East Germany) under the control of the most Stalinist government in Europe. Its citizens were under the constant surveillance and control of the most sophisticated secret police the world had ever known, the East German Ministerium für Staatsicherheit, or Stasi, with the efficiency, excuse my cliché, for which Germans are known. The Stasi employed about 100,000 agents, plus a network of several hundred thousand \\"extras,\\" who willingly, through bribery, or through coercion reported to the Stasi, informing on their neighbors, co-workers, friends, and even own family members. Stasi only goal was to know everything about the \\"lives of others.\\"     The Lives of Others is at once a political thriller and a human drama. It is a fictitious story based on historical facts. Director von Donnersmarck was also the scenarist. The film's characters were compiled from many different real-life figures, to the extend that several of its actors had been themselves the victims of Stasi surveillance and persecutions, and their own private experiences have contributed immensely toward the authenticity of the film. For example, Ulrich Mühe (Stasi Captain Wiesler) found out after the Wall came down that not only several members of his theater group were spying on him, but his ex-wife had been a Stasi informer and spied on him for a dozen of years. Thomas Thieme (Culture Minister Bruno Hempf) was harassed by Stasi before he managed to leave East Germany in the 1980s, and Stasi tried to recruit Volkmar Kleinert (Jerska) as an informer on his fellow actors     von Donnersmarck's quest for authenticity led him to shoot in as many original locations in East Berlin as possible, such as in the former Stasi headquarters, which included Stasi's original file-card archives, seen at the end of the picture. All of the furniture and objects needed for the film - bugs, surveillance equipment, a room full of machines that steam open letters, and so on, are all original items, gathered from private collectors and museums by prop master Klaus Spielhagen, himself blacklisted by Stasi and imprisoned for two years. The streets of East Berlin are shot with hardly any traffic, as they were then, and the local pub is also nearly empty. Captain Wiesler lives in one of these drab, lifeless, high-rise apartment buildings prevalent in the Eastern European countries under communist regimes, while playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) occupies a gentrified apartment in an old building, typical of the old Berlin. The cinematography contributes greatly to the film's atmosphere. The colors are pale and unsaturated. Brown, gray, beige, orange, and especially green dominate the palette, with blues and reds noticeably absent. As a result of this absolute realism, this film was well-received in Germany, particularly in East Germany, by the press, leading authors, freedom fighters, and intellectuals of the former DDR: they all wrote praising the film for its authenticity.     The success of this film owes much to the high caliber of its actors, several of them having been previously exposed to similar scenarios in real life. In particular, one of Germany's leading actresses, the beautiful Martina Gedeck (Christa-Maria Sieland), recipient of many awards, gives a subtle, vulnerable performance. Sebastian Koch's insouciant, bordering on arrogant, attitude of an adulated playwright is convincing. Multitalented Ulrich Tukur (Lieutenant-Colonel Anton Grubitz) renders the role of a devious, opportunistic department head perfectly, and Thomas Thieme is absolutely repulsive as the lecherous Culture Minister.. But it is Ulrich Mühe 's superb performance, the depth and subtlety of emotions that underscore his acting as he evolves from an ideological bureaucrat into a compassionate human being, which is most fascinating. His performance is not without recalling that of another voyeur, the equally wonderful Michel Blanc in Patrice Leconte's Monsieur Hire (1989).     Another asset of The Lives of Others which contributed to its success is its haunting film score, composed by the multiple award-winner, Gabriel Yared (The Lover/1992, The English Patient/1996, Cold Mountain/2003). In particular, one notices the exquisite \\"Sonata for a Good Man,\\" an excerpt of which is played in the film by Dreyman. The sorrowful and complex music was recorded by the outstanding Prague Symphony Orchestra.     von Donnersmarck offers viewers a cathartic second ending to his film, an equivalent of a musical coda or a literary epilogue, which is a welcome relief to the viewers. There is indeed an under-current of sadness that builds up slowly, imperceptibly, as the film progresses. If The Lives of Others is a political thriller, it is also a human drama, and it is a tribute to the director's artistry and depth that draws his audience into the relentless torments of his characters' wasted talents and lives. At the end of the projection, there were hardly any dry eyes in the audience, which was itself enveloped with a feeling of deep sorrow. If one feels compassion for the misery endured by the subjugated people of East Germany, one cannot help but to also feel genuine empathy for Wiesler. And after a brief moment, something happened which I have very seldom heard or seen in an American movie theater: people applauded.     This film is 137 minutes short, and as a final remark on the production, I will add that the intensity of the drama is such that very soon, for those of us who do not speak German, we forget we are reading subtitles.     The film's first theme is of political nature: life in the \\"Workers' Paradise\\" of East Germany in the 1980s -- love it or...don't leave it. The Lives of Others is the first film that treats an aspect of the life in the DDR which, up to now, has been avoided. All the previous films about East Germany were generally light-hearted; the latest one which met with some success in the US was Good Bye Lenin! (2003), portraying the DDR as a benevolent dictatorship at best, and a bad joke for sure. The present film shows a totally different aspect of East Germany, that of a gloomy country with an oppressive government. We are showed how politics can infect -- and potentially destroy -- every aspect of a citizen's life: work, creativity, leisure, intimacy, and even sex. Steering smoothly between the personal and the political arenas, the film shows how destructively the two fields of activities were combined for millions of innocent East Germans. More generally, we are confronted with a basic reality which is that no matter which country one considers, there are always people in the higher echelons of government who, with the complicity of eager followers, seek to highjack the freedom of the citizens under the pretext of fighting a common internal, but more often external, threat. These politicos are motivated by ideologies, private ambitions, greed, stupidity, or ignorance. Germany is one good example, and we, in the United States, should not be too complacent to believe that it cannot happen here. It is presently happening under the influence of the group of \\"neocons\\" who are playing fast and loose with the US Constitution, slowly and deliberately cutting back our civil liberties at home. Do I have to remind you that the neocons' doctrine has its roots in Trotsky's concept of government?     The second theme follows from the first: knowledge is power. In its quest to have absolute power over the East German citizens, the government must strive to obtain absolute knowledge of every aspect of their lives -- their thoughts, behavior, intentions, and activities -- at all times. Through this knowledge, the government can act to counter any subversive activities which could challenge and endanger the regime. This is a question of life or death for the government, and it must employ all means possible, spare no efforts, and be vigilant 24/7, in its quest for information. Governmental justification for spying on its own citizens is, of course, the common external enemy (in this case, Western capitalism) which threatens the Socialist regime. In other times, for different governments with different enemies, the end result is the same: a gross violation of the citizens' human rights.     The film's third theme is a philosophical one: it explicitly shows how an ideology must shut off one's feelings in order to pursue one's goals. The true essence of ideology is the total supremacy of its principle over feelings, and the biggest life challenge is finding the right balance between the two -- between one's ideological principle and one's true feelings -- when confronted with a moral choice.     I would agree with Minister Hempf's statement that \\"People don't change.\\" No matter what happens in a person's life, that person remains true to his or her nature. However, when along the way, one attains the right balance, albeit temporarily, between ideology and feelings, one is said to have \\"changed.\\" In this context Minister Hempf's statement is wrong, and Captain Wiesler does change. As always, there is never only one cause for a change. Wiesler's dramatic change actually begins soon into the story, when he goes to the theater, an unusual diversion for the person so far depicted. This is followed by his growing awareness of Grubitz's opportunistic character, resulting in his old friend occupying a better position in the Stasi than is own. Weisler contends with the arbitrary use of absolute power when he finds out that his mission has more to do with Minister Hempf's sexual urges than with the defense of Socialism. Finally, as he takes over the direction of Operation Lazlo (an allusion to Casablanca/1942?), Wiesler gets exposed to people whom he would usually only have met during an interrogation situation. And as he becomes more and more familiar with every intimate aspect of their lives, Wiesler starts to question his own life. Through these people, he gets exposed to the arts, and goes so far as to \\"borrow\\" (this could have been a costly mistake for his operative procedure) and read a book by Bertolt Brecht. Although at first he is rather unwilling, even to the point of finally betraying Dreyman, all these things put together make him change, until he finally commits a genuine heroic act.
038073186X|5.0|This is in the top ten of all time psychological thrillers, and as I think of it, focusing on this book makes me forget what the other nine might be.  I read this book quite a long while ago and still note, as one reviewer did, \\"it messed wit' ma head.\\"  I thoroughly enjoy a good head-messing once in awhile.  Why should Stephen King be our only national treasure of twitch?  Lehane is a phenomenal talent and it is a joy to know that Dorchester is still kicking out great writers.  All I can think of with respect to Lehane is:  MORE!

0143038419|4.0|This is a great book.  Inspiring, funny, relevant, and poignant.  I related to all of her quests: for pleasure, balance, and love.  I has wonderful descriptions of why we love Italy and what meditation is all about for the not-yet-enlightened, which is most of us.  Plus I learned a lot of cool stuff...like why Balanese babies cannot touch the ground until they are 6 months old.  It's not great literature, thus the 4 stars, but it is extremely well written and highly entertaining reading.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|This is one of the best shows I have ever seen!  The acting is superb, the writing is phenomenal, and the show itself is pure perfection.  You can sit down and watch this entire series and want to watch it again immediately.  It is a show that will go down in history as one of the best!!!  If you are a fan of Claire Danes or Jared Leto than you need to own this; and if you are a fan of great television than this is a must own!    I have already pre-ordered my copy and cannot wait to sit down and watch this series over and over again!!!
0141439661|5.0|I went into this without expecting much but was soon surprised by how engrossed I became in this classic! This is essentially the story of two sisters, Elinor and Marianne, who are different in temperamentbut experience similar disappointments in romance. It's interesting to see the contrast in their personalities in deealing with their heartbreaks. Prudent Elinor puts up a strong front, confiding in no one and worrying no one while Marianne becomes the very picture of wretchedness.<br /><br />It started off slowly but once you get into the main plot it's hard to put this one down! You hope for each of the sisters to achieve happiness in love, you smile at Austen's wit in observing the upper social strata, you condemn those who are against the sisters and their family and you eagerly read on for each new development. And, of course, there's the lovable supporting cast of characters who at first are viewed as obnoxious but become dear friends in light of true folly from others. And let me just leave off by saying that I loved Mrs. Jennings from the start ;).
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|How do describe it?  Smart story, a lot of suspense, an incredibly good Tim Robbins...  I could see this movie over and over again!
B00005U122|5.0|This is easily one of the most spectacular, most thoroughly entertaining concert videos I've ever seen.  I enjoyed Pink Floyd's \\"Pulse\\" concert (which finally made it to DVD recently) but I have to admit that Roger Waters put together a band that is not only every bit as good as Pink Floyd but in some ways surpasses it.  The treatments of venerable classics like \\"Shine on you Crazy Diamond\\" and \\"Money\\" are livelier and bluesier than David Gilmour's more formal, true-to-the-studio versions.  The three female vocalists are stunning:  I never liked \\"Mother\\" that much until I heard the soloist perform here, proving once again that it's the singer, not the song.  The guitar heroics are absolutely spectacular and there's real chemistry among the band members.<br /><br />I know nothing about the bitter feud between Roger Waters and his former band, and it hardly matters to me, but if playing well is the best revenge, Waters triumphs here.  The band is clearly having a good time and has worked hard, and the concert is as engrossing as a suspense novel.  If you're even a casual fan of the Waters/Pink Floyd musical style, you'll want to see this show.
B000Q6GUT8|4.0|Okay, it is not always 100% realistic, but still far more in the realm of reality then many other Hollywood movies.  I loved Ned Beatty, the political message is okay, enough suspense,  what else do you want from a movie like that?
B000Q6GUT8|5.0|This exciting movie starring Mark Wahberg, Micheal Pena, Danny Glover,<br />Katie Mara, Rhona Mitra, and Ned Beatty was one of the best action flicks I have seen in a long time.<br />Fuqua show us in this movie a government riddled with dishonesty, disloyalty, deception, and vigilantism.  Mark Wahlberg is the lead actor in Shooter and is remarkable as an action star.<br />The movie shows a very good collection of cast members that provides good performances and special effects, considerable gunfire scenes and military combat that is very exciting to the human eye.<br />I do believe I will own this movie for my collection.
B000OQF6N6|5.0|The disclaimers, first off: When I was younger I was a HUGE SP fan, ever since Gish. I would still take Siamese Dream as my \\"desert island\\" album. That said, I knew Corgan's limitations. No one who has any musical talent actually likes his voice, but it somehow fit in over his sonic walls of guitar overdubs. This is why I was mezmerized at Lollapalooza. And this is also where I realized that Jimmy Chamberlain was the most under-rated part of the band.    Flash-forward to \\"Adore\\": What happened! Jimmy's been replaced by a drum machine (!) and the sonic walls of guitar are gone. All we are left with are Billy's over-reachingly pompous \\"poetic\\" lyrics and horrible voice overtop of some lame keyboards. Moreover, in concert these guys look so bored that I walk out halfway through their set.    So now Zeitgeist -- yes it's not Siamese Dream but no disc will ever be that again. But it IS very good. It contains everything that a rock fan ever wanted from the Pumpkins: Driving, thunderous drumming from Jimmy, and sonic walls of overdubbed guitar from Billy that actually somehow make his voice work. Backing off on the whiny \\"oh why is me\\" lyrics and letting us read a little bit more between the lines. All the pop music fans who liked the pumpkins will find this album much too rock'n'roll, but after seeing what happens to the Pumpkins without rock'n'roll, thank god this is the album they put out now! This is the album that should have followed Mellon Collie, and as to those who say that this is only \\"half\\" the pumpkins, were James Iha and D'Arcy ever really more than window dressing anyway?
B0008ENHUI|5.0|I've always felt that this film has never received enough recognition, but every viewer has his own perspectives and tastes.  I've always had a taste for films of detail and real life, like \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\", \\"The Pianist\\", or \\"Schindler's List\\".    It's a true story of one man and his refusal to submit, and of those around him that were sent into exile to the French Guyanas during the 1930's.  The peoples of this film were real and lived.    If you give this film your attention and time, I think that you will walk away with more than just a viewing, but an impression.
B000005YZM|5.0|Mint copies of the original record have sold for hundreds of dollars in specialty vinyl shops around for years.  When this album was finally re-issued on CD I purchased it the first time I saw it on the store shelf.      The Zombies called it quits just after releasing \\"Odessey and Oracle\\" citing lack of funding to promote the record.  Released in March (UK) and June (USA) of 1968, the album never gained any steam and was destined to fall hopelessly into obscurity.  Only when \\"Time of The Season\\" became a surprise hit single in 1969, did the record label apply any interest to the record, \\"releasing\\" it once again with an alternate cover.  CBS Records head of A&R, Al Cooper even persuaded Zombie's Rod Argent and Chris White to pony up their own advanced royalties from the album to go back into the studio to mix a stereo version specifically for the US market.  It's a bittersweet story for a great band and a remarkable record that is a truly great example in mastery of the genre, to share in the spotlight with the likes of Sgt. Peppers and Pet Sounds.
B00004SZWB|5.0|Stevie Wonder is the man. I mean, it's not like that isn't terribly obvious, but it's also true. And it took me a few spins to realize this, but this is one of my favorite Stevie Wonder albums. As usual, it's divided between funk and ballads, with one major exception: the classic reggae-funk song Master Blaster (Jammin'). You've probably heard it, and if you have you probably love it - I know I do. Not quite the best song on the album, but close. That goes to one of the ballads, Lately. Now Stevie's normally a happy guy, but there's no happiness to be found here. Totally bleak, totally hopeless. That's not why I like it, though: I like it because Stevie just belts it out, because I like the atmosphere, because I like the melody. And because it resonates, arguably more than any other Wonder song - and that really takes something, because as we all know, Stevie's got plenty of soul. Let's see... what else... oh yeah, can't forget All I Do and Rocket Love, two FANTASTIC mellow ballads with a ton of hooks, and snappy strings in the latter's case. Oh yeah, and All I Do has a cool sax solo, so it gets brownie points. Those four are the backbone of a very strong album. What else is good? Not I Ain't Gonna Stand for It, that's for sure. The only song with a Stevie Wonder vocal I don't like (not counting his awful cover of Light My Fire from his teenage years - let's just pretend that song never existed, and move on). Okay, the other dud track is Do Like You, which is just a pathetic sequel to Isn't She Lovely, which is MUCH better.<br />So right, no more negativity, becuase this is a cool album, you know? Outside of the four \\"backbone\\" songs, my favorite is probably Happy Birthday. Cheesy as all hell, but a TON of fun. That and it's about Martin Luther King Jr., so it gets even more brownie points (MLK being a personal hero of mine, see?) Oh, and the melody's good. Another strong song is the disco (yes, that's right, Stevie does disco - quite well, too) Did I Hear You Say You Loved Me. The angry political commentary Cash in Your Face took quite a long time to grow on me, but I like the song's lyrics and its piano/string riff. Good song, though not spectacular. Then there's As If You Read My Mind, another one that I thought was a total waste at first - now I enjoy it a lot. Very funky!!<br />So there you have it. A very respectable follow-up to Songs in the Key of Life. Not quite as good. A personal favorite, though. And I like the cover image, too.Loved Me.

B00004Y6O9|5.0|Interesting story behind how I came about this album, and this band. A friend of my brother's was trying to argue that Eddie Van Halen was a better guitarist than Jimi Hendrix. I heard about it, and I'm thinking, What? Is this kid serious? No guitarist is better than Hendrix, and you know it! Well, I still don't think Eddie Van Halen is a better guitarist than Jimi Hendrix, but this album rocks like hell. I mean, a couple of these songs are awful, like \\"Janie's Cryin'\\" and \\"I'm the One\\", but that does not keep the best material from rocking tremendously. \\"Atomic Punk\\"? Oh, hell yeah. Hilarious little satire-thingy. \\"Runnin' with the Devil\\"? You've heard that song, right? It owns. It's got a great refrain, and a great riff, and that motorcycle guitar intro-thing... cool! \\"You Really Got Me Now\\" actually manages to almost out-Kinks the Kinks' original, except for the annoying sex noises in the end that were stolen right from \\"Whole Lotta Love\\". Other than that, it rocks. Let's see... \\"Ain't Talkin' 'bout Love\\" has the best riff on the record, \\"Feel Your Love Tonight\\" has the best solo (never said Eddie wasn't a good guitarist, just not as good as Jimi Hendrix. There's a difference, see?).I even enjoy a couple of the lesser-known songs, like \\"Little Dreamer\\", where Diamond Dave (I want a nickname like that) has all kinds of fun on vocals, and the hard-rockin' blues shuffle \\"Ice Cream Man\\". Even the infamous guitar solo \\"Eruption\\" is decent imitation Hendrix. A lot of detractors like to say that Van Halen is a hair-metal band, but I don't buy it: it never seems like they put style ahead of substance (much like AC/DC), and even Roth's macho-man I'm-so-sexy, do-me-right-now thing seems to be ironic (another AC/DC comparison). So if you want to rock out without thinking hard at all, buy this right away.

B000001FY7|5.0|If you're into reggae you have to have plenty of Bob Marley.   Like all of his albums, this is another nice selection for your collection. He is most definitely the King of Reggae.
1594489505|5.0|A Thousand Splendid Sons brings to the forefront the travesties that women endure while weaving together a compelling story of survival and strength. A must read for teenagers in America. This book should be on all high school summer reading lists for students to come together in the fall to discuss.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|And Bob has definitely kept up with the modern times . . .    Good songs, good music.  This is a keeper!
B000R7PYU2|5.0|These books never fail to entertain me.  There's nothing heavy or intellectual about them - just a terrific story, told with humor.
B000NDIAWY|4.0|I had never heard of Brandi before I heard \\"THE STORY\\".  This song is so full of passion and has some of the best lyrics I've heard in a long time.  The rest of the album is also pretty good and a great listen as a whole.  However, \\"The Story\\" is still the showstopper.
B000K4WPCC|3.0|Panned universally by critics when it was released, \\"Covenant\\" is not likely to be the best film of 2006. But to be fair, it is not the worst either. Some of its special effects are impressive, and some (if not all) actors are very good. Still the film's concept about hunky American teenagers using supernatural powers may look familiar and it actually sounds like \\"Harry Potter\\" meets \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" (or \\"Craft\\") meets \\"The Matrix Revolutions.\\"    The weak storyline is already a problem of \\"Covenant,\\" which begins with the history of the families living in the late 17th century New England. Director Renny Harlin, however, makes it worse by beginning the film with a long prologue or sentences on the screen that you have to read. In the following 30 minutes things don't get better. After the film jumps to modern times, when four teenagers including the film's hero Caleb (Steven Strait) are having fun at the party, not much is explained about the world where these characters live except Wendy Crewson's lengthy remarks about the nature of the power and the fate that awaits those who overuse it. Why all these reading and talking?     There is also a murder case, which is soon forgotten until it is required to be explained later. There is also a love interest here, a girl named Sarah (Laura Ramsey) and some spooky incidents at the school, but despite its moody camerawork, none of them is really interesting. The film does not follow its story consistently until when it becomes clear who is fighting against whom and who wants what in the second half. Then the film gets better with several action sequences, but the film is almost over, and the way they use the CGI sequences (which themselves are very good) at the climax lacks imagination.
B00002Z88D|5.0|I was really unsure of this album.  The thought of Metallica playing with an orchestra didn't really appeal to me.  I thought it would be awful.  Since I am a die hard fan and a collector I decided I would rent the dvd before I purchased the cd just to see if I liked it. I was blown away!  This is one of the best things I have listened to in ages!   The orchestra does not take away from the music. Instead it adds power.  I guess I shouldn't have doubted that anything Metallica touches turns to gold. This is a crowning achievement.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|Brandi Carlile is wonderful!  I saw her open up for the Indigo Girls this summer and had to rush out and get this CD.  She's an interesting modern twist on a classic folk sound, reminding me a little of Patsy Cline and Bonnie Raitt.  I can't stop listening to her.  Love it!
B000001GQB|4.0|Thank you all for the infomative recommendations. I also find Böhm's interpretation impressive. I think that right now it is probably the best there is on the market - it is only comparable with two other conductors: Marriner - and according to my ears even better: Adam Fischer (and the Danish Radio Sinfonitta- who are currently recording all of Mozart's symphonies) [[ASIN:B000NOIWOE Mozart: Symphonies [Hybrid SACD]]]. The 3 three of them are right now on the top 10 of the best Mozart interpreters. Just thought we should keep the head cool and hear the other versions as well.
B000007VLL|5.0|Bonnie Tyler had hits with Lost In France and It's A Heartache before she teamed up with Jim Steinman and created the album Faster Than The Speed Of Night which was a sort of female version of Meat Loaf's Bat Out Of Hell. The album was a megahit on both sides of the Atlantic and gave her top 5 hits in the form of Total Eclipse Of The Heart and the title track.<br /><br />Her husky voice is backed by powerful rock instrumentation, rolling, pounding drums, shimmering keyboards and blistering guitar riffs. This comprehensive Best Of collection includes her other great hit Holding Out For A Hero plus a stunning version of Have You Ever Seen The Rain and a duet with Shakin' Stevens.<br /><br />The tracks from Faster Than The Speed Of Night are exuberant and theatrical, but her sensitive side is also displayed here on songs like the aforementioned Lost In France. If you love the hook-filled big rock sound of artists like Pat Benatar, Joan Jett, Meat Loaf, Ellen Foley, Tina Turner or Jim Steinman, you'll love this album.
B000P2A24W|3.0|Love Jon Bon,always will,  but love that little  bit of  rock and roll I think is lacking in this CD. Yes, I know it is country rock,but will always like it a little bit harder.
1416523359|5.0|I guess the varied reviews for this book show just how subjective art and literature can be.  Because I loooooved this book. I Loved reading it,and loved that feeling of not wanting to put it down and being sorry that it was over.  Like many, I am a long term fan of Mr. King, he's been scaring me since I was about 11 years old.  I was less excited about some recent stuff, such as Cell, but have never read a book he wrote and not enjoyed it.  Lisey's Story, for me, was a transporting experience.    I read a lot.  I don't ask for much from novels, I am very forgiving. Entertain me a little, and I'm happy. But I'm always on the lookout for the book that consumes me.  One of my first experiences with this was Shogun by James Clavell.  The Stand by Mr. King was another.  Well, it had been a while, but Lisey's Story did that for me.  I hated that the book had to end.  Anyway, I've never written an Amazon review, and don't expect to see it happen again anytime soon, but I had actually scrawled a note on a post-it to chime in  with my opinion here, for what it's worth.
B000PY52EU|5.0|Sin and redemption, music and hope, childhood tragedy and living life despite psychological trauma. This movie was awesome. It should sail high on the Oscar radar.  Samuel L. Jackson and Christina Ricci deserve acadamy awards for their priceless performances. These were risky roles, especially Ricci's, and they weren't \\"pretty\\" roles for sure.  Ricci absolutely is one of the top actresses, real actresses, in young hollywood today. Maybe she can't play every role, but she sure could play this one, convincingly and movingly.  Jackson was perfection.  I look forward to more artistic work like this from the director, Jackson & Ricci, together or separately.
1594489505|5.0|Khaled Houssini write as if it is liquid transperant ink he has that waves like a calm before the storm tide on papaer.      His talen to describe humans is stunning. The stroy lines aren't always teh best in plotting but everything else is the mastery of literature fiction at best. You can easily cry for people you just met 40 pages in and at the same time sympathise with people later in the whom you have hated instantly 40 pages in.      Set in Afghanistan after the fall of the monarchy in 1973. Two women who were destined to face each other before the Taliban came into power in Afghanistan.      Like the kite runner we delve into lives by tineiest of details and translated languages like \\"harami\\" which is thief described by the main chrachter.     I am not going to tell the story since i think that will be spoiling. If you read the kite runner expect similar atmosphere and chrahcter with a new twist. People are more real and feel like they could be anyone in the world even if they are afghans.     Khaled el Houssini is going to be much more bigger and influencinal as a writing than you expect... One to read for everything he writes.
0060853980|3.0|I debated on whether to give this novel three or four stars, since I'd really rate it about a ***1/2 if I could.    Aziraphale and Crowley are -- respectively -- an angel and a demon who have been on Earth since the Garden of Eden existed. Now, in the modern age, the world is preparing for Armageddon, the Anti-Christ has been born, and as luck would have it, Aziraphale and Crowley have just come to realize that they rather like this planet and they have more in common with humans and with each other than with either of their celestial hosts. Matters are complicated when, at the Anti-Christ's birth, the Satanic nuns accidentally switch the child, thus leaving heaven and hell to mentor the wrong boy. And as if that's not enough, there's a witch, Agnes Nutter, who saw all of this and prophesied it with complete accuracy -- hundreds of years ago.     In spite of its heavy subject matter, Good Omens is a light and easy read. The prose is a little too light for my tastes, but I don't deduct for that. As an American, I admit some of the British regional humour was lost on me, but I was able to at least understand the intent behind most of the jokes. I believe the humour is very hit and miss, even taking into consideration the aforementioned regional focus and the date the book was written; I do take those aspects into account when gauging the effectiveness of the humour, but objectively, I still feel some jokes didn't work and others were dragged on for too long. The footnotes rarely struck me as clever or inspired and I could have done without most of the random scenes involving minor, pointless characters such as R.P. Tyler.    That aside, I do think Good Omens has its riotously funny moments. The beginning is hilarious. I loved the parts with Agnes and her descendants' interpretations of her prophecies, and I thought Shadwell was a complete hoot. I also liked some of the banter between the Them, even though some of those scenes wore on too long, in my opinion. At its highest points, Good Omens does a splendid job of satiring religious convictions, war for the sake of religion, religious practices, ineffability, and so on. Oh, yes? And \\"Dog\\"? Completely funny. I think overall, Good Omens hits more than it misses, but when it misses, it tends to miss aggressively and with an almost obnoxious need for you to find a joke funny, to the point of extending it for pages and pages.    The book is entertaining, and towards the end when everything was coming together, I got excited while reading it. I believe the build-up for the final conflict is superb, probably the book's highest moment. The Four Horsepersons added a much needed element of true weight and suspense to the novel, but without spoiling anything, I will say I was let down by some of the elements of the conclusion. Some things felt anti-climactic; some opportunities to 'go further' were missed, and the final segment felt too cleanly wrapped up. I kept thinking: wait, it's over for real?     Not a bad book by any means. I'd even suggest that everyone give it a read and see for themselves what they think of it, as it's a much-beloved text. But I do think it fell short of its potential. It would've done better had it cut out the more extraneous segments and focused more heavily on maximizing the main plot. Funny, a good thing to read while bored or before dozing off at night, but mostly not very compelling.
B000ROALCG|4.0|I wonder why Hector's best song was not included on the soundtrack?  The song \\"Periodico de Ayer\\" (Yesterdays Newspaper\\") is to this date one of the best Salsa recordings.
0385338082|5.0|This book is a good read!     Very very funny novel and you ask yourself over and over \\"what more can go wrong?\\"    A book to lose yourself in. Quick and easy read.
B00008HE46|5.0|RABBIT-PROOF FENCE is visually beautiful as well as the story. The story line is about three little Australian Aborigine girls who flee a white concentration camp where mixed race Aborigine children are \\"taught to conform.\\" The movie reminded me so much of the TV movie, THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MISS JANE PITTMAN. There was no difference between Australia during that time and America during slavery. No one really talks about Australia and the Aborigines, this movie SHOWS you!
B000O1799U|4.0|This movie is about a group of singers (inspired by the Supremes) that start out playing in junkie competitions and how they made it to the big time. The band goes through numerous fractures and toes are stepped on. I will let you discover the plot on your own but I have a feeling this is a very realistic story of the supposed glitz and glamor of show business.<br /><br />I liked this movie but I felt that it got too long. It was about two hours long, not a horrible length, but some parts just seemed to drag on despite the actors' great talents (including amazing singing). If you feel like you are somewhat interested in this movie, I recommend that you rent it when you're not too tired but ready to sit down for a long time, get some pop and junk food, and relax on the couch with a friend.<br /><br />I am not a huge fan of musicals, but this was a pretty good movie. Nothing fantastic, but good.
1590171993|4.0|Here's an undervalued book, recently reissued by the New York Review of Books. It tells the grim story of an academic who has lived a very unhappy life and had a very \\"B\\" level career at a midwestern university. There are engaging insights into the pettiness of academic politics and the kind of grudges professors hold against one another, as well as the turf they try to protect.  Lucidly written and engaging, especially for those who know a bit about academic life.
B000002MP2|5.0|In any forum filled with hundreds of reviews you're going to get a variety of opinions.  My opinion is this.  If you like 90's alternative sound you're going to love this album.  Later work by Green Day may have better mixing but it's also filled with their own personal agendas.  Dookie contains the energy of the band without the overburden of having to make a statement.  Its fun and edgy.
1400032717|5.0|I chose this book because it was on the best seller's list and thought it must have some merit.  Once I started this book I couldn't put it down.  The attraction isn't necessarily the plot, but more the narrator's autistic point of view.  There is a fine line between characterizing an autistic person and one who is not, and this book sheds some light on what an autistic person's thought process is like.  This is a great fast read, that allows you to gain more perspective on those around you.
B0002IQHY8|5.0|As an avid fan of APP and then Alan Parsons, I finally got the chance to purchase this CD at a reasonable price (through this website -- the CD arrived quickly, especially considering it was shipped to an APO and took a wrong turn at Bagram, but that's hardly the shipper's fault).  Overall, this latest offering by Mr. Parsons is excellent and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />The music is mostly languid and low-key.  It has some of the trademark Alan Parsons rhythms and instruments, and includes a remake of \\"The Raven\\" that IMHO is better than the original.  The album's got a few funk-type elements in it too, which Alan is able to pull off by not overemphasizing.  David Gilmour's influence is obvious in \\"Return to Tunguska\\" with a guitar that's straight out of \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond Pts. 6-9\\".  There's also a half-hearted attempt at a pop song (More Lost Without You) but the lack of Woolfson's pop music instincts, for better and for worse, is still felt.  I would guess that Mr. Parsons is finally producing exactly how he wants and exclusively for his own purposes, which, although this has some drawbacks, overall is to be desired.<br /><br />This is good music for adults.  It should be played with friends while having a few glasses of wine or ounces of scotch, and I would imagine that the music is also very good to play while making love.  I hasten to add that this last comment is, as of now, strictly theoretical, but once I get this IA over with, and me, my spouse, and this CD all in one place, I fully intend to find out.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|The most beautiful thing you will ever see in HD.  Since seeing it on Discovery HD and being a fellow filmmaker, I have loved this show.  Its even more beautiful on HD-DVD than cable HD, not to mention that the British are always better narrators.  If you own Blu-Ray or HD DVD, this is the one and only DVD you HAVE to own.  Get it now!
0061122416|2.0|The book's saving grace is it's length. Any longer, and the simplistic prose, overwrought symbolism, and unbelievable story would have overwhelmed. A good idea for a book, poorly executed.    If you're looking for inspirational stories with poetic prose, powerful philosophy, and real characters, try Richard Bach.
0061015725|5.0|This was my first Michael Crichton book that I read and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.  I enjoyed the technical detail that he went into potentially making us believe that the nanobots could actually be created.  At times, the technical aspect got very detailed that I needed to go back and reread, but overall just a fantastic book.
0060763299|5.0|Excellent, excellent, excellent!!  I'm going to wear out the CD because I listen to it every time I'm in my car or working out (6 days a week).  I can't get enough of it and I want it to truly sink into my mind and become a part of my mindset.  I can't wait to attend his seminar in October!  It also helps that he is funny and makes me laugh! ~;o))
B00009W0WM|5.0|This is an all-time great movie, but too bad Ingrid Bergman plays a racist.  In one of her first scenes, she refers to Dooley Wilson, the superb piano player, as \\"boy.\\"    She says, \\"Captain, the boy who is playing the piano, somewhere I have seen him.\\"    Dooley Wilson was a grown man at the time, much older than Ingrid Bergman.  (He was born c. 1886; she in 1915).  The only reason Bergman's character would call him \\"boy\\" is pure, utter racism.    Too bad this mars the entire film.
0061142026|4.0|I've just finished reading Stardust by Neil Gaiman (writer of MirrorMask) and it's really a good book. I think it would appeal to any Labyrinth fan.  I love it but I don't care for the epilogue.  I know a lot of people like to compare it to The Princess Bride but I think it's actually closer to The Last Unicorn.<br /><br />  The main character, Tristran, is the son of a mortal and a faerie slave kept by a witch in the realm of faerie.  The story begins in a town near a wall that seperates the magical world from the human world.  When there is a falling star Tristran promises to retrieve it for a girl he is infatuated with.  He is unaware that the star has taken the form of a girl in the faery world and that there are others after her too.  Three elderly witches who want to use her heart to become young again, and some bickering princes.<br /><br />  It's a really good story and it has a relatively happy ending except for the epilogue with of course talks about the death of a mortal character after years of marriage to an immortal one.  I hope the film adaptation doesn't have the epilogue.  Fantasy stories are all too bitter sweet lately.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|Please note that I am not comparing this to any of Linkin Park's earlier releases and whining because they changed their style.   On the contrary, change is a really good thing and the TRUE artists know that change = survival. If you look at all of the bands that are on their 4th + release, you will notice that most of them have adapted to survive amid failing genre and passing fads to evolve into a true vision of artistry. (expect of course bands that have found their niche' and stick with it - but we all know bands like that usually fall off sooner or later. The truly great artists evolve in syncopation with the evolution in their lives).    However, with that being said, Minutes To Midnight sounds contrived, un-inspired and rather bland. Linkin Park's newest offering is so dull that I literally got rid of this CD as soon as I aquired a copy of it (after much listening to try to decipher what exactly I as listening to).  Ditching the ground breaking style that flung Linkin Park into the lime light, they have instead adopted a more grunge/modern rock sound that has been done way too many times before by way too many bands. And that is my principle complaint with this record.   While change is welcome, a change to something more predictable and overplayed is highly un-original and rather annoying.    The musical direction on Minutes to Midnight never really goes anywhere, the guitar parts are rather repetitive and the lyrics are a disaster. Dreadful would be a better word, as the wordplay is horribly boring, lacking creativity and highly over played beyond repair. The rapping is weak and \\"mother-goose-ish\\" at best and could have easily been cut out of the album all together.  Musically, Linkin Park in Minutes to Midnight, resemble earlier 90's bands, and it almost seems as if they are trying to revive a long lost and forgotten style that was prominent in the 1990's. I suppose they felt that they needed to try something new and different, being that they had beaten the whole NU-Metal meets electronica meets pop into the ground.    -Don't get me wrong, I rather enjoyed their first two efforts and really enjoyed their re-mix album-     However, they fail miserably in their attempt to be \\"different\\" and \\"expand\\" and rather, instead of evolving, they de-evolve into an effort that seems rather forced for either the sake of a contract or money. Or both.    I disliked every single song on this album, each track could be skipped. On some of the songs, the intro starts out pretty decent, but then falls quickly downhill into drivel and garbage.   Chester's vocals sound so bad that I cringe at the sound of them. It really sounds as if he is trying to emulate a raspy, \\"smoked-too-many-cigarettes\\" tone a la' the grunge era and early 90's rock, but it sounds so cheesy and fake.    I admire and respect their desire to move on to different styles and such, but they either need to try harder or seriously sit down and do some much needed pondering. Linkin Park are truly talented people, but this album proves that they are either under the control of someone calling the shots, or they make horrible choices. Maybe that is why the lyrics are so angst filled and always lead into a full circle of depression/rage and pointlessness. Hmm...    I guess, in conclusion we shall truly see if Linkin Park have what it takes to be real musicians and artists, rather than the flavor of the week. Time weeds out the wanna bes and the passing fads.
0385522401|2.0|As the novella (miniscule font in a small dimensioned book) begins, Florence and Edward are \\"young [22 years old], educated, and both virgins,\\" newlyweds on their wedding night contemplating the evening's objective: consummation. But considering his prenuptial preparation and nature--prone to making spontaneous relationship decisions in the throes of passion, hers--uptight in the ways of intimacy, what transpires is no surprise. The couple's progress is interrupted at opportune moments for flashbacks into their pasts: a bit on their upbringings, family members, meeting, and courtship. Alternate chapters cover the wedding night. Its final dozen pages fast-forward four decades beyond the honeymoon. On the night in question, she naively suffers from a failure to understand; he just plain misunderstands. Readers, sexually squeamish or not, may also suffer when reading the minutiae of their intimacy, which is, at times, just plain too much information. Better: The Age of Innocence by Edith Wharton.
B000JBXXZ4|3.0|I'm starting to get the feeling that Brandon Boyd is only capable of writing deep, complex songs about relationships, love, and loss. When I think back to the albums before  \\"Morning View,\\" there are a handful that standout which aren't about said topics- \\"Make Yourself,\\" \\"A Certain Shade of Green,\\" \\"Pardon Me,\\" Even Morning View had \\"Just a Phase.\\" But it feels like most of the tracks that jump out on \\"Light Grenades\\" are about love, loss of love, etc.<br />And I guess I've always known that about Boyd. Most of the bands hit singles are about that stuff- (Drive, Stellar, Wish You Were Here, etc.) But I honestly feel like his songwriting has stalled. It feels at times that the music itself has become less complex, more formulaic than in the past. I realize the analogy isn't spot on, but it's starting the feel like the difference between Metallica's \\"And Justice For All\\" and The Black Album. At the time- it might have been just one album. Now that we have perspective on it, it was the first in a series of very different, less complex songs. I feel like that's where Incubus is headed.<br />Don't get me wrong. This is the one band left that I will buy a the album for without hearing a single track. But it's been two albums since I've been remotely satisfied.<br />I hope they go back to the kind of band they were before, less \\"poppy.\\"<br /><br />\\"Dig\\" is my favorite track on this album.<br /><br />It also might be a coincidence, but maybe in a few years we'll find out that Alex Katunich's departure hurt more than they thought it would (with no offense to Ben Kenney's playing).
B000E41JUC|4.0|I have only become a Porcupine Tree fan over the last 2 years, initially turned on by the Deadwing CD.  I just love this band.  They are THE Best thing in Progressive Rock music today.  I would honestly give this album 3 and 1/2 Stars, but 4 Stars will help the low average.  As other people have described it, it is kinda \\"chill-out\\" music.  If you know anything about the history of this band, especially it's founder, Steven Wilson, you will understand why this release makes since in the Porcupine Tree world.  (go to wikapedia:Porcupine Tree for more info)<br /><br />Steven Wilson began doing \\"experimental music\\" for himself. This first step led to an official release of his demos on cassette way back in the early 90's.  Then he was urged to put a real band together.  That first band included the members of Chris Maitland (drums), Colin Edwards (bass), and Richard Barberi (synthsisers) who have played with him for over a decade.  The tracks on this disc are simply demos and Jam sessions by the band recorded in 1995/96 for the Signify album.  Be warned: there are No lyrics, all instrumental tracks.  In fact, the only voices are in studio banter between the musicians and a little bit of \\"taped\\" radio voices a la Pink Floyd's \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\".<br /><br />Like a lot of people, I really like the In Absentia album, Deadwing, and Stupid Dream.  There is much more straight ahead hard rock on these albums and less of the psychedelic offerings of Steven's earlier work.<br />But, the bottom line is, it's still Porcupine Tree.  And I'm glad I have it.  Every fan should purchase every Porcupine Tree offering so as to tell the band and the Record label \\"We Love These Guys\\", \\"Keep giving them the money to keep making Great Music for US!\\"<br /><br />I do read all the reviews, and have been hesitant to purchase On The Sunday of Life, based on the realization it is even more \\"experimental\\" than this.  I have the 2-disc Stars Die Collection, and have been told that the best of the early tracks are on it, so, for now, I'm satisfied. But, the Snapper releases always sound great and are quite a bargain.  I just couldn't justify NOT picking this up for the paltry $12 price.  Always support Your Band, and if you don't have it (or know about it) the 2006 DVD release entitled Arriving Somewhere... is EXCELLANT.  You must get that also.  You will not regret it.early tracks are on it, so, for now, I'm satisfied. But, the Snapper releases always sound great and are quite a bargain.

B000002TQV|5.0|The fact that the reviewers of this masterpiece each cite different songs as the best on this album is a testimony to just how great The Bends is.  As much great material as Radiohead (one of my top 5 all-time favorite artists) has produced, this particular album represents for me the creative apex of the great Thom Yorke and company.<br /><br />It's funny how my very favorite tracks off this album have been tagged by some previous reviewers as their least:  \\"nice dream\\", \\"Just\\", and the stunningly majestic \\"Sulk\\".  Some think \\"Black Star\\" is the best track on The Bends, and if there was one song on here I could do without, that would probably be the one.<br /><br />To reiterate, the fact that different reviewers find various songs to be the best on this album only reinforces is greatness.  Just listen to the damned thing, and you'll be convinced about the pure greatness and brilliance of The Bends as well.
B000024XRP|5.0|This is truly great music, in all aspects.  I bought this when it was released and I can listen to the entire album numerous times a year and not get sick of it.  Really, if you want to give it less that 5 stars, you are not being serious.
B000PMGNK4|4.0|This standalone movie picks up the GITS series two years later.  True Shirow GITS fans will see the final thread unwound from his graphic novel.

1594489505|5.0|After reading \\"The Kite Runner,\\" I was skeptical that an author could produce another work with such incredible emotional force.  I was proven wrong, though, by \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\".  The book is heavy, incredibly heavy, in a non-literal way, but the emotions are never so complex as to confuse the reader.    \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\", in a nutshell, tells the story of two Afghan women whose lives become inextricably intertwined by the course of events in Afghanistan over the last two decades.  The lives of Mariam, the illegitimate daughter of a rich Herati businessman, and Laila, a progressive young woman from Kabul, seem at first completely different, despite the commom denominator of seemingly depthless sorrow and hardship.  However, when a stray rocket brings their lives together, the reader is invited to discover the true meanings of love, family, and sacrifice.    It is evidence of Hosseini's immense skill with the human psyche that he manages not to completely overwhelm the reader with the pain and sadness that Mariam and Laila experience almost daily.  This book is not light reading.  I was forced to pause my reading several times because I - I, the happy reader at a distance from events! - needed a break.  However, Hosseini manages throughout to nurture a tiny flame of hope that keeps the reader, with Laila and Mariam, going in life.  Hosseini manages many incredible feats with this book, including a remarkable, enlightening cross-section of life before and after the Taliban in Afghanistan; however, that unquenchable flame of hope is his greatest miracle.    This is truly a great book.
B00005N9CV|5.0|It sure does. How many guys have bought this album for the cover? How many guys have bought Carly Simon's \\"Boys in the Trees\\" or \\"Hotcakes\\" for the same reason? Beats me, but certainly some. On the other hand, nobody ever bought an album of Kirsten Flagstad or Eileen Farrell for the jacket photo, and those two ladies had voices far beyond anything Diana or Carly could ever dream of. Point is....<br /><br />If you bought this album for the sexy photo, and never listened to it, you REALLY shortchanged yourself. Sex may sell one record, but repeat business has to come from artistic merit; I have all of Diana's [and Carly's] records. Carly is sexy, and she can sing; Diana is one of the most beautiful girls on earth, BUT, she's also one of the jazz voices of the ages. The specific songs don't need discussion; their value was settled years ago. Covers, indeed!! Diana was anointed by God to sing this music, and she does it with grace and style that simply have to be heard to be believed.<br /><br />Buy this for the jacket if you wish, but listen to it. I promise you'll be hooked. Indeed, 'S Wonderful!!!!
B000RIHBIE|5.0|Being with Sum 41 since the beginning, I am not pleased to see how many people are quick to jump the bandwagon.    Sum 41 goes punk, and you criticize them.    Then when they go back to AKNF, you criticize them for that.    This is what made them so popular.  While I'm not happy that Brownsound left the band, I am pleased with what the band managed to create without him.    The music is real. Not some fake crap that they are using to lure Dave back. He is gone I'm sure for good.    The songs are fast paced and resemble their old stuff quite well.    I'm not a big fan of political music, but there isn't enough to ruin the album.  (Noted towards those comparing Sums to Green Day)      I'd give this album an 8 due to that reason, but that shouldn't take away from what you would miss by reading negative imputs.
0375758992|5.0|I'm and avid reader, and i must say this book is one of my favorite reads, if not my favorite. I lived with a family in Malawi Afrifca for awhile, so the book, for sure, draws my sentiments. But Alexandra Fuller spills guts and soul into the sharing of her African childhood experience. As a child, she writes with a child's voice, a child's soul, and as she matures, so does her expression. What a gifted writer! Her writing rings true, and I am hungry for more!
B00005R5G9|5.0|This movie is just so funny that once it started I couldn't stop laughing, I would say the romance is half fantasy, more than makes up the fun. A woman mannequin comes to life at the department store, only at night and enjoys her life with the young man dressing up the windows at night. All the other actors just add fun to the pot to make this a funny, funny movie. When he's hugging or kissing the mannequin all the people at the store laugh and just go along with the story, and with the help of the girl mannequin make Andrew McCarthy look better and better to the owner and all the public looking into the window during the day, just buy the movie and see the fun of many of the actors & actresses that made this movie so lovable. Our whole family has watched this movie more than once and enjoyed the ride. HAHA!  Shirley Frye   This movie is a really another 10 stars in my book. Smile.
B000002UB3|5.0|So many groups seem to fade away in their creativity and sound.  But the Beatles pushed it to the limit each and every time.  Even as they were drifting apart as a group, their music continued to push boundaries of creativity and sound, leaving other groups behind in awe.  Even to the point of a 23 second song called \\"Her Majesty\\"  They literally did not waste a second.      Abbey Road, the title itself sums up the CD.  The road that became a studio, that became a household name, to the point where 40 years later there are television specials of present day artists recording in the Abbey Road studios.      It doesn't get much better than Abbey Road!

B000AYQJJ2|5.0|I was amazed to find the music sounding as great today as it did that night almost 26 years ago. I was home from college in DC for the summer and bought tickets for the evening show through the mail! I was mainly interested because of the rumors that Dylan would perform -- and perform he did. He was awesome and his pick-up band wasn't half bad, either. His performance really was ethereal. And of course, all the other performances (which have been so throughly described in the many good reviews on this site that I won't repeat) were FABULOUS!    This DVD captures the mood of the evening perfectly. The performances were as good as they appear. It was a good cause. The audience was friendly, mellow, and adoring. It was a magical evening.     The only thing I enjoy now more that I did that night is the music of Ravi Shankar. I couldn't concentrate on it that night because of the excitement of waiting for the \\"real\\" concert to begin. But now I really appreciate how beautiful and spiritual it is.

0374105235|5.0|Fearing the hunted, becoming the hunted, fearing the hunter and then ultimately beating the tormenting, unimaginable and dehumanizing events of his country and of his people.  This is what a young child by the name of Ishmael Beah, age 12 had to face.  He battled without a cause and became detached from the goodness and honesty of mankind.  Fighting for his life and the lives taken by the armies, Beah shares his memoirs by telling a compelling and tearful story of a boy soldier with a lost soul, fighting in the Sierra Leone war struggling with the atrocities and the horrific events and aftermath.        The mere fact that this child was forced to survive in an unusual and unforgivable manner is only parts of the bitter truth and the suffering that many children around the world face each and everyday.  Beah tells this story with such deepen emotions from the heart, and his ability to use imagery and descriptive writing invokes the reader to visually understand what took place during his struggles.  This story not only captivates you but also brings a sense of obligation to face the realities of what is going on in our world.  You will be mesmerized with his brilliance and inspired by his devotion to become a better and responsible human being.  This is definitely an excellent book to share with all young and old, a book that can bring about change for the better and appreciation for those around you.
0143039431|5.0|\\"Ya gotta eat...\\" Dad used uto say if we thanked him for taking to the local hamburger stand; he could have, just as easily, been stating the obvious theme of Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath.  One can easily imagine Tom Joad or, more to the point, his sister Rosasharon saying it in her \\"sharing\\" scene in the closing pages of the book.  I read this book, the first time, in sophomore study hall just before lunch in small town Wisconsin; largely as a result of the wretched deprivations depicted in the book,  I remember rushing home, sure I would starve to death if I didn't immediately ingest the bowl of soup and sandwich my mother had waiting for me.  As the Joad family move out of Dustbowl Oklahoma toward the promised land of California, the Joads must survive on fried dough and unripe fruit (from which they are warned they may \\"get the skitters\\"); Along the way they meet tragedy and, in most cases, their dreams of a better life are smashed like last year's fallen fruit...And, yet, they still hope for the best.  Maybe the next Hooverville will be different, maybe the next fruit ranch; if they could only make it there. Government offered little or no help.  Long before the rest of the nation hit the skids, farmers were getting the short end of the stick; they never saw any of the prosperity of the 1920's, and the Dustbowl didn't help either.  But Tom Joad sees hope in numbers, \\"Wherever a guy is hungry, I'll be there...\\",  he says, urging the readers to come along, to fight injustice wherever  they can:  a challenge as urgent today as when Tom made it in this wonderful book.

1400032717|5.0|The curious thing about this book is not in fact the incident of the dead dog, but the life of autistic Christopher John Francis Boone. Mark Haddon portrays the life of an autistic boy with such great realism that you often forget that it is Haddon writing this novel. It was interesting to see life through the eyes of this boy. Christopher is unable to create and develop real concrete relationships with other people including his Father. He is a mini encyclopedia when it comes to facts about geography and other trivia. However, what Christopher is truly gifted with is math. Christopher struggles with such easy day-to-day tasks for most people such as getting on the train or taking the subway, but he can solve the most complex mathematical algorithm only at the age of 15. Christopher (who is infatuated with Sherlock Holmes) sets out to find who killed Mrs. Shears' dog Wellington. Watching Christopher discover more about life and himself was well worth a read.

B00005JP5P|5.0|Confusion repeatedly washed over me as I viewed Sunshine for the first time.  The second time, I felt I was in a bubble.  It was as if I were with the crew aboard Icarus II.  After it ended, I was transfixed by the images of pivotal moments in the film that were flashed on the screen as the credits rolled.  I felt a loss of friends when they were no longer visible to me on the screen.  I somehow also felt a sense of fulfillment, perhaps gained from my solitary viewing and the time to ruminate in my thought, but more likely from the message gained about the commitment of the characters and the vastness of our universe.    Sunshine tells many stories...those of each crew member's ordeal of being in space for 16 months, and what happens to a person's psyche when  blanketed in darkness with no where to go; staring at the same people day in and day out - some amicable, others seen as adversaries, but all with the same goal.    Sunshine also tells the story of our nearest star - the sun.  Shown as an amazingly brilliant force, we come to know that life as we understand it will not exist without it.    Finally, Sunshine tells the story of the need to succeed - our needs as human beings to achieve that which we have set as our goal; of our passions.  Aboard Icarus II, the stellar bomb becomes the obsession, but for each of us it is something different that comes to the forefront.    During my second viewing, I found a kinship with the characters.  Kineda, the captain, and Searle, the psychologist, both show us the dangers of addiction.  Trey's suffering in palpable, and you want to somehow intervene and help him understand his humanity.  Mace's courage and commitment make us feel less of a person for wanting something just a bit different for this crew than his strong sense of ethics allows.  Corazon and Cassie are beautifully written characters who exhibit grace in all they do, even as the aloneness of their circumstances washes over them.  Finally, there's Capa, the physicist, whose youth and innocence, we all once experienced, is transparent in his eyes and demeanor, despite his otherworldly possession of himself and his intelligence.    See this movie, but see it more than once.  The visual extravaganza of the first viewing is translated into a quiet respect for these characters during the second.  I can't imagine what my third viewing will hold, as the first two sent me home with a different perspective each time.  A MUST SEE!
B0000009SY|5.0|Having just received this CD today in an order with 2 other well known Zappa releases I wasn't sure which one to play first. But I remembered what I heard last week reading a quote from Dweezil about his opinion that Joe's Garage would be his choice to pick if he was going to give a brand new never heard Zappa person a Cd to listen to. So as I have about 30 Zappa Cds and dont fall into that category I was instantly impressed and could see why he would make such a statement.This material sounded new and fresh, not dated at all. And it showed all the different aspects of Frank that made him such a unique genius.Humor,guitar jamming,more humor and brilliant fitting in of all the instruments(drums especially).This 3 part act of Joe's Garage should definitly be any new Zappa fans must listen to list,and boy am I happy that I picked it to listen to first too!!Sincerely Bob Repple, Chicago

Theres such a main if not only emphasis on the music,not really much if any humor as I remember and no talking etc...some staples us Zappa fans have come tom expect. But this starts, middles, and ends all in a great flowing instrumentals guitar jamming thruout my favorite instrument of course,so if your into loving Franks Guitar and like to kick back for a good 40 minute jam session then this is the album for you!!Hope you enjoy!!!Bob Repple Chicago USA

B00008BRDX|5.0|It is hard to believe that a band can become a Hall of Fame band with just five studio albums to their name, but the Police are such a band.   This is an honor that the Police are most worthy of. The Police were sort of an off-shoot of the Punk Rock movement of the late 1970s.  The band would eventually encompass other influences - namely Classic Rock, Reggae, Jazz, Dance, and even Folk.  On the band's 1978 debut album, \\"Outlandos D'Amour\\" the Police established an innovative sound by incorporating Punk Rock and Reggae influences with a Classic Rock sound.  One year later, the band would release their second effort, \\"Regatta de Blanc\\" which would continue the foundation and style that was established on \\"Outlandos D'Amour\\".   In the five album portfolio of the Police, this is the one album that often goes most-overlooked.    On \\"Outlandos D'Amour\\", the Police really show their potential is through their instrumentation.    This trend continues on \\"Regatta de Blanc\\".   While many identify the band with Sting's distinctive voice, he often goes underrated for being an outstanding Bass player.   This album demonstrates Sting's best Bass work.  While Sting's Bass provides a lot of the nucleus that will drive the Police's sound, it is important to know that Andy Summers and Stewart Copeland play equally key roles on the band's sound.  Andy Summers provides the right chords from an Electric Guitar standpoint when needed while Stewart Copeland shows why he is the best in the business.       Also similar to \\"Outlandos D'Amour\\", the band continues to have a \\"raw\\" sound. The contributions of all three members that really make the Police something special - and \\"Regatta de Blanc\\" demonstrates this.  Here is a brief synopsis of each of the tracks.    \\"Message in a Bottle\\":  While this song has suffered from overplay, I feel this song was perfectly assembled in the studio.  It is evidence of the how the Police's instrumentation is so powerful.  This is a classic example of Sting's Bass providing the nucleus for a song's sound.  One thing worth remembering is that this song really shows how powerful a voice that Sting has.    \\"Regatta de Blanc\\": While not the \\"household\\" Police song, this song has garnered considerable live-play by the Police throughout their career.  This has been commonly heard intertwined with the live version of \\"Can't Stand Losing You\\".  This song is more of a quasi-instrumental - I would describe it a great jam session with overlaying chants by Sting.    \\"It's Alright For You\\": This song has a heavier Punk Rock influence.   Sting's Bass does a great job at setting the tone for this song as well.  Again, more great instrumentation by the band - in particular, Andy Summers' guitar and Stewart Copeland's Drums are lock step in-sync with Sting's Bass throughout the song.    \\"Bring on the Night\\": This song has more of a Reggae influence.  While Sting has used this song in his solo career, many forget it was a Police song.  Once again, major credit has to go to Sting on the Bass.    \\"Deathwish\\": More Punk Rock influence by the band.  While Andy Summers is outstanding, I particularly hear Sting's Bass and Copeland's Drums working in true harmony together.    \\"Walking on the Moon\\": Both deep and casual Police fans know this song.  This song has Reggae roots.  More great Bass work by Sting, but this time it's Andy Summers adding the guitar chords at the right time.    \\"On Any Other Day\\": This song utilizes spoken words by the band.  This song has a Punk influence.  A very good song, this song could easily be the most humorous by the band.  If you follow the lyrics, it almost sounds like a prequel to \\"Synchronicity II\\" from 1983's \\"Synchronicity\\".    \\"The Bed's Too Big Without You\\":  This song almost as a UB40 feel to it - it has a major Reggae influence, but also has a haunting feel to it.   On this song, Sting's Bass plays more of a complimentary role as Stewart Copeland's drumming is the nucleus for this track.    \\"Contact\\":Another underrated track by the band.  This track has lighter Punk feel to it than the other tracks.  Sting's Bass goes back and sets the driving tone for this track again.  There is a particularly good bridge of guitar work by Summers about 1 minute into the song.        \\"Does Everybody Stare\\":  This song takes a completely different direction.  We hear some Piano work on here.  While this song has a theatrical feel to it, the Police incorporate some Reggae influences through Sting's vocals.   I love the \\"Opera\\" vocals in the background.   This song is a prime example of the band being innovators - it is clearly one of the most underrated tracks in the band's portfolio.    \\"No Time This Time\\": Stewart Copeland kicks this song off with a ferocious drum pace.  Sting's Bass then comes in at the perfect time.  This song has a more of the Punk Rock feel by the band.    One thing worth noting about this album being available in a \\"digipak\\" - I am not a big fan of it.  I still prefer the classic clear jewel case for durability as the \\"digipak\\"s tend to wear very quickly.  \\"Regatta de Blanc\\" would mark the end of the Punk Rock and Reggae era for the Police. On subsequent albums, the Police would refine their sound and begin to incorporate other genres into their sound.  Overall, this is a very good album.  It is a shame that many of the tracks go overlooked on this collection.   It strengthens the foundation that was set on \\"Outlandos D'Amour\\" as well as continues the legacy established there.  Highly recommended.

0671027344|5.0|Despite the fact I am a 54 year old woman reading a book from the view point of a 15 year old boy, I loved The Perks of Being a Wallflower.  If you are easily offended by teenage sex and drugs, don't read this.  But we all know that those two things are a part of that age group.  In particular, I liked the author's writing style and wit.
B000000W5H|5.0|Like \\"Goat's Head Soup\\" It's Only Rock & Roll had some pretty big shoes to fill following one of the greatest recording streaks in the history of music. This is Taylor's last album with the Stones and he does some very nice guitar work(when didn't he?) on it. From the opening cut  \\"If you can't rock me\\" we can hear Taylor wailing away on lead as the intro grinding rhythm cuts through you like buzz saw. The Stones are one of the few white bands who could ever pull off a Temptations cover and they do well with \\"Ain't too proud to beg\\"  followed by mega radio hit \\"It's only rock & roll\\" Closing side one with an excellent ballad \\"Till the next goodbye\\" and profound \\"Time waits for no one\\" Side 2 opens with a great soulful rocker \\" Luxury\\" and it is a favorite of mine. Taylor shows us some nice slide work on \\"Dance little sister\\" and the whimsical \\"Short and curlies always makes me smile. these are the stand out cuts for side 2. This album is really excellent and deserves your attention a very good and last effort by the Stones with this line up. Things would never be the same after this.
0060763892|2.0|The Judas Strain has plenty of action, ya gotta give it that, and  the mutated bacteria biological threat is a good plot device. But I found myself bursting into laughter at the preposterous exploits of the various good guys. Battling giant red crabs, planning to have the jet ski blow up while escaping in the nick of time by using scuba gear, having one's mother just happen to save the crucial broken obelisk by slipping it into her tote on the way out of her kitchen, having one's father fret about the condition of his antique car having barely escaped with his life - these are just a few of the incidents in the first 1/3 of the story that break the boundaries of credibility. JS is like a cartoon in text instead of pictures. I finished only b/c I wanted to know how the rogue bacteria were vanquished, as biological disaster does appear to be looming in the near future of our planet.
B000AA305M|5.0|When i first got this album listened and thought, this is ok, but nothing special.  Put it aside.  Found the song Hospital Food popping up randomly on my iPod and feel in love with it. Played it to death.  Even my wife who doesn't like too many modern artists wanted me to keep repeating it.<br /><br />Then a couple more months passed and decided one day at work to just play the entire album in the background.  I've been hooked ever since.  The beauty and depth of the lyrics grabs me.  My favorite song is Nos Da Cariad, but I love them ALL!  One of my favorite albums now from start to finish.

B00005JO20|5.0|This movie is the real tribute for the 1933`s original movie,I wondered when I heard the score in the Kong´s debute in Broadway  escene: it`s the same fanfarria! I love this remake.It`s the best!    Esta película es el verdadero tributo al original de 1933! Me asombró descubrir que ciertos detalles como la música se habían usado de forma identica en ambas peliculas por ejemplo la fanfarria cuando Kong es presentado en aquel teatro. Esta pelicula es muy interesante no solo porque recrea el entorno fantástico de la Isla Calavera sino que también registra de forma fidedigna la Nueva York de los años 30, me encanta este remake,para mí es el mejor!
B000OQF6N6|5.0|Billy's whiny voice is screeching again: and I'm getting used to the album!      First a word to many of the reviewers thus far: stop complaining, it's irritating.  If you hate the new album, say so, and move on with your lives.  Why is it that so many people want this album to sound more like Siamese Dream, or MCIS, or Gish, or LULL, or whatever?  If you want to hear something from Billy that sounds like one of those, listen to one of those.  A new album should have a new sound, and I think that Zeitgeist succeeds at this on every level.     As with every Smashing Pumpkins album before this, I've had to spend some serious time with the album before deciding that I really do like it. This is how I've felt about every one of their albums, which is why I know this is still the Pumpkins I know and love: with yet another different sound.  (I bought the album the day after the release, and waited for a while to review it, so that I could have some time to absorb it).      I think that Billy is more interested in speaking to his audience in different languages than establishing a style and staying with it.  Yeah, a lot of the new songs sound weird at first, like For God and Country and Pomp and Circumstances.  Some of my first thoughts were \\"what the heck?\\" and \\"what just happened here?\\"      The artist that came to mind as I listened to Zeitgeist several times was Wistler, of \\"Wistler's Mother\\" fame (that's not the real name of the painting).  Wistler was a brilliant artist who could paint in a more classical style, but eventually moved towards a more modern style: a move that even landed him in court!  (for the painting \\"Falling Rocket\\").  I see Billy as a brilliant songwriter/musician who's trying some things out that are totally different: and why not?      Zeitgeist has the familiar Pumpkins pattern of loud (Doomsday Clock, Tarantula, etc) and soft (Zeitgeist, Pomp and Circumstances) as well as a long one (United States) to satisfy all those different urges.  We allknow that Billy has an enourmously whiny voice, but I've always loved how it blends in with the guitars themselves: I think this quality is present more in Zeitgeist than in any previous album.      In short, buy the album for yourself to check it out - as always, Billy has a lot to offer as he continues his years-long dialouge.  Enjoy!
B000Q6GXW2|3.0|People are hyping up the HDDVD like its sooooo much better than blu ray, I think they are misinformed.  The only difference is that on HD you get to clip together your favorite scenes and make a montage, you DO NOT get to add brand new scenes.  If you don't believe me, go visit the official 300 DVD website.  Also the HD version has a game to test your strategy knowledge, and the director gives you an indepth look at the adding of CGI... that's it.  The blu ray still gives you the deleted scenes, actor commentary, webisodes, and a few more added features, so if that slight difference is worth 4 more extra bucks, go get HD, otherwise its the exact same thing...

0786168765|5.0|At last. A life lived largely. A Jack London life. A book that takes on the big gun questions and answers (or lack thereof). No glorificaton of domestic boredom and the long winded whine of its consequences. This story blew me away. Hands down the best book I've read in the past five years, and one of the best I've ever read in my life. I am enlarged, changed by, and grateful for the journey it took me on, and can't wait to read it over and over.

The blu ray still gives you the deleted scenes, actor commentary, webisodes, and a few more added features, so if that slight difference is worth 4 more extra bucks, go get HD, otherwise its the exact same thing...
B000OQF6N6|5.0|I was never a huge pumpkins fan, I liked their singles but never owned any albums.  Plus I could care less who is in the band, I care only about whether or not the songs affect me.  Having said that, I think this album is fantastic. I am a hard rock fan, always have been, and this album takes me back to some of the best rock albums I have heard.  The guitars and drums just pound.  'Starz' is brilliant, I havent heard a track that rocks this hard in a long time, the splash cymbals over the bashing drums and roaring guitars are brilliant.  STRONGLY recommended to hard rock fans.
