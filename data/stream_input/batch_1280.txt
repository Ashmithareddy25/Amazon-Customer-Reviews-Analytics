B004EPYZU8|1.0|WARNING: SPOILERS!<br /><br />Don't tell me how \\"deep\\" it is and how \\"I didn't get it\\". If you dismiss the negative reviews on this film with a \\"they didn't get it\\", you're as close-minded and condescending as those who dismiss action movies on the assumption that action and CGI can't coexist with intelligent, good-quality films.<br /><br />I got it all right. And I guess it IS deep... Like the sludge in the sewers is deep.<br /><br />One reviewer said that this movie can only be appreciated by those who love videogames. I beg to differ. I'm a long-time gamer, but I'd rather suffer through a brutal migraine attack than watch this dreck again. There are actual games that deal with the subject of mental illness and imaginary worlds way better than this so-called movie (American McGee's Alice series, for example). Combined with mediocre acting and dreadful music, this movie is an absolute disaster. Yes, it has some very cool visuals and action scenes, but its visual beauty is completely smothered by its cerebral ugliness. It's all style over substance, poorly conceived and blatantly insulting to the viewer's intelligence. The first fantasy world tells us it's bad to exploit women, and the second fantasy world is a paragon of female exploitation. How does this work? It doesn't! Characters fly hundreds of feet into the air and slam into solid stone shattering it, with not a single bruise or scrape inflicted... Yes, I get it, I get it, it's a fantasy world, but seriously, if we the audience know no one's going to get hurt or killed, where's the suspense? Why should we care at all about any of them?<br /><br />How can anyone think of this movie as being \\"empowering to women\\" is beyond me. If anything, it's blatantly the opposite. An underage-looking, scantily clad, heavily made-up nymphet named \\"Baby Doll\\" who fantasizes about being a prostitute is not empowering to women. Yes, she and her girlfriends kick butt, but they do it in an adolescent male's fantasy world. To add insult to injury, the \\"dance\\" Baby Doll performs every time she enters this over-the-top videogame fantasy world is quite obviously a metaphor for her having sex with whichever man needs to be \\"distracted\\" (which is why the actual dancing is never shown). Yeah, nothing empowers a girl like prostituting/being raped! (Now, apparently, there's a plot line about the impending sale of Babydoll's virginity in the extended edition that tramples the sex argument... I haven't seen it, so I can't comment).<br /><br />It seems that very little thought went into anything here except \\"we have to make it look hot to sell it to as many teen boys as we can\\". If Snyder cared to do his homework, he would realize that the message this movie seems to promote (whether he meant it that way or not) is actually deeply insulting to abuse victims. The character gets to go to a \\"happy place\\" where she has power, because in the real world she doesn't have any. If you've ever experienced/survived abuse, it's heart-wrenching to watch, not because it shows the psychology of an abuse victim, but because it shamelessly glorifies it.<br /><br />Was Zack Snyder thinking about the viewers when he came up with the title for this mess? If that's the case, he must be laughing all the way to the bank.insult to injury, the \\"dance\\" Baby Doll performs every time she enters this over-the-top videogame fantasy world is quite obviously a metaphor for her having sex with whichever man needs to be \\"distracted\\" (which is why the actual dancing is never shown).

0470901071|5.0|Just a great book!  This has to be the most intuitive CCNA study material I have come across.  As many other reviewers will contest, this is one of the easiest books you will ever read, written in a way that anyone can understand.  Many networking books tend to be dry and lack the ability to hold the readers attention.  Todd's book is full of anecdotes and some jokes that keeps your attention.  Each chapter is very well structured and summarized with focus on the CCNA objectives needed for passing the certification.  I invested about 2 weeks, of very long days, studying and I was successful my first attempt at CCNA.<br /><br />I STRONGLY recommend when you purchase this book make sure and get the package that comes with the CD.  The CD has many great features, my personal favorite is the digital flash cards.  The CD also has multiple practice exams along with the chapter review questions.  A great addition to the book.  I do not think I could have done it without this book.  I was so satisfied with this book I will be purchasing the CCNP series and attempting certification after the beginning of the year.<br /><br />I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone.

B005ZUR724|5.0|while this is an exact replica of World of Warcraft, it is a good clone game.<br /><br />this runs and FEELS smooth, which is very important to me.  there are races, classes, professions, dungeons, and pvp.<br /><br />I was not expecting to like this game, now its my most favorite Kindle game app.  :)
B004QX07G4|5.0|I work during the day so I DVR the show and watch them on the weekends for lots of laughs and to keep my sanity. I was so excited to hear she had a new book coming out again.  This book is every bit as good as any of her other books and possibly better! I just love her quick wit, it keeps me cracking up the whole way. I actually debated over getting the book on my kindle or purchasing the book on cd so that I could listen to it... Doesn't matter how you do it, just get it - you won't be sorry. You can never go wrong with Ellen, she appeals to all!
B0058VW36U|5.0|My son convinced me to download this onto my Droid phone. For 99 cents it is always worth a shot. This was so much fun and challenging. There are currently 10 themed 'boxes' that the little guy (Om Nom) is in. The goal is to 'cut the rope' that holds a candy so that he can eat it. Boy does he love candy - but not as much as my 7 year old daughter! There are obviously obstacles and tricks along the way and the difficulty progresses with each box. Each box has about 25 levels so there are hours of play. I just received an update with a new box and the game states that there are more coming soon.<br /><br />The graphics are great - no glitches, no crashes ever. I've beaten every level with three stars but I have to admit that three levels needed a little help from viewing a cheat site to see how to do it!<br /><br />UPDATE: I've since played it on my Kindle Fire and Samsung Galaxy Note tablet and it works well on all of them. I have to say that this is fun to go back to and replay. Originally, it never ran with ads but now it does pop up other Cut the Rope game ads for [[ASIN:B00BTYP6QE Cut the Rope: Time Travel HD]] and [[ASIN:B007KQ6XYY Cut the Rope: Experiments]] both of which are also fun to play.<br /><br />A great value for the price. And the little guy is HUNGRY! Don't leave him starving in the box. Just CUT THE ROPE.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I could not say enough about this headset, I don't know how I lived without it. If you chronically break wired headsets by rolling over the annoying controls on the wire, or hate getting your chair tangled up in headset wires then these are for you. Also, they have the best sound quality I have ever heard, the 7.1 is amazing while watching movies, and the battery life is good. I charged them every few days while heavily raiding in WoW, but that is to be expected with the 10 hour battery life. But nbd, you just connect them and charge up. That brings me to the only thing I don't like about them, which is that they take a long time to charge in my opinion, but just a small complaint. This is far outweighed by the ability to walk around your house and still listen to music and talk in ventrilo/skype, to be able to talk handsfree (perfect for those long calls on skype) to be able to get up from your chair and grab some water without having to take them off your head, and to be able to have pro sound while watching a movie or listening to music as loud as you want without anyone hearing while you are sitting on your couch far away from the computer. The wireless connection is seamless, there is no crackling or anything until you have walked out of range. Love them
B002S8AGZG|5.0|There are many reviews here which already state why this movie is a classic.  The cast along with the great acting by most involved is a must see!!!  This movie deserves 5 stars.....
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very fun and addicting game. just wish you could get points quicker, or games didn't cost so many points. but still always my favorite!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|the app is very good om my Ipad and kindle fire but I think it could be a litttle more responsive when you turn it to landscape mode.
B000002A33|4.0|Bought this when it came out upon reading a favorable review in Rolling Stone. On my 3rd copy since then and still one of the best in my collection. This album is to grunge what Led Zep 3 was to metal, or Forever Changes was to folk. Also showcasing in Dying Days why guest Mike McReady was one of the pre-eminent guitarists of the 90's. Sworn and broken is my peronal fav. off this release, but plenty of other solid rockers. Great big guys making great big rock and roll and hints at what this excellent band was capable of. Keeper.
B004GYY714|5.0|this app is just perfect for someone who loves music. this app lets you hear the radio from everywhere. I love it!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I loved it!  You won't be disappointed.  A book my eyes and all senses could eat.....every word *delicious*. :)
B004EPYZQ2|4.0|I saw the film in a theater too. It was a lovely story, although there were some awful scenes. I think it will give lots of dreams to children and let them think about the importance of our world, the Earth. The ending was so nice. As I liked it so much, I even visited almost all the locations in Weirton after I had seen it in a theater. It is not a big problem, but there is one thing I don't know the reason. Why is this film sold with a bluray and dvd combo?
B0054JZC6E|3.0|could have some better games runs really smooth haven't had any problems with it so far hope i wont have any at all still have slot of games to unlock so i hope there as good
B0064BCNA4|5.0|Really liked how it lets you play a song by simply following the blue key. My daughter loves it and has stolen my phone just to play the piano. Also like how you can choose different instruments.
B003U74NQW|5.0|I consider Blue Velvet the best movie of the '80's.  When Kyle MacLachlan, Dennis Hopper, Isabella Rosellini, Laura Dern and Dean Stockwell come together, their chemistry smolders from the screen.  The movie is mysterious, adventurous, and a bit creepy.  Set in a peaceful small town, with  picket fences, and manicured lawns, everything appears to be apple pie and baseball.  But the town harbors a sinister dark underbelly just beneath the surface, that proves to be too fascinating for some to resist, and that is when the fun begins.  Dennis Hopper's psychotic rage performances are unparalleled!<br />  Great acting, good cinematography, and old fashioned suspense may have you watching this movie more than once.
1416955070|5.0|I am probably the last person on Earth who has yet to read this book and when I finally had I needed to ask myself one question: What took me so long? This book was amazing! I honestly didn't know what to expect. With all the trends on vampires, werewolves, fallen angels, and wizards I was trying to decide where this book fell into place. And it turns out that it falls on all sides.<br /><br />I honestly finished this book in one sitting. After Clary's mom goes missing, she discovers a world of myths and legends where demons roam and the existence of Shadowhunters.<br /><br />One thing that I feel like Cassandra did an amazing job on had been the wide range of characters that are seen in this book. There was the leading lady Clary, which by the way is a cute name, who showed a lot of her strong sides, her weak sides, and her intelligence. Then there was the leading man, Jace, who I had trouble warming up to. But, of course, by the time I did, things went from wonderful to seriously messed up. And for those who have read the book know what I mean. And the rest of the cast who went from annoying me - Isabelle and Alec - to surprising me - Luke.<br /><br />The introduction to the series was a great start, with the hunt for the Mortal Cup, which could turn children into Shadownhunters. The rise of the Accords and the evil villain Valentine, who I might not like at all but I do like his name.<br /><br />This fantasy world has got politics and family drama so entangled in the story line that it just keeps moving the entire story forward.<br /><br />I still don't believe what happened in the end when the news broke out about Valentine and Jace, and I will read the books to prove to myself that this is not true because this is complete unacceptable and if Cassandra Clare plans to keep things like that I will have to stop reading this series to boycott it. Just a little FYI, there.<br /><br />Besides that, this book was great. It leaves a lot open for the next book. And I say, if you don't love it the first time around, don't stop reading it. I've had to force myself in tons of books to keep going before the love actually opened up, so I say, keep going forward, because when I first started this book I was not completely in love. I will admit. But now, I am crazy for it.<br /><br />And before I forget, the humor in this book makes the dark theme so much more uplifting. It's hard to find that equal balance of fun and darkness all thrown into one, but I feel like Cassandra Clare really brought out the best in this story by doing that. I mean, Jace, will have you on the floor laughing he is so adorable. And this is why the ending is so hard, because I feel like that fun loving side of him is gone, but I hope more of it will come later on in the series.<br /><br />Five stars out five for the dark, sexy, funny, twisted story that will keep anyone up all night to finish it.ading it.

B0000046W9|4.0|This is a great review of Stan Getz' Bossa nova years with many great Brazilian musicians and Getz at his most melodic flights and solos.
B003K16P3M|5.0|I liked this book a lot and I'm not normally a YA reader and haven't been for several decades. This is a coming of age novel and has a typical coming of age plot - someone just reaching adulthood is in a lot of trouble, has the gifts to deal with the troubles, and learns how to grow up by dealing with the troubles they are dealt. It is what the author does with the book that makes it count.  First of all the book was fun to read. I enjoyed the plot and I enjoyed the people. The main character is a very dominant, very strong willed young woman, and the author makes that believable in a less than modern world.  Some people try to use her. Others become her friends and she and her friends try to make the world they are living in a better place. I'm not an English teacher so some of the objections made by the one star reviewers never bothered me and anyway, part of building a fantasy world is how language is used. I expected the English to be not quite standard in a world that isn't this world.  One of the things I liked about the book was the lack of what I tend to think of as high school angst. The main character is young, but she is living as an adult in her world. She has power, but isn't using it all that well yet, but has already made the first steps in changing that when we meet her. She has made friends and isn't all wrapped up on who is getting emotionally attached to whom. She has more important things on her plate -- ethics, morals and keeping herself and her friends alive.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|I got this because I wanted a lightweight case for the Kindle fire but also because I didn't want to spend big $$$ on an expensive leather case and wanted something more lightweight. This is very light and I can understand why some people did not feel it offered enough protection for such an expensive device. However, it's exactly as described and about half the price of a serious leather case. I think this works very well and I'm happy with it, however, when traveling I do put the whole thing in a mesh padded zipper case just to add extra safety.
B005DZMP00|5.0|The DEAD - always a treat. Loved Europe '72 and very glad to get more of it. A definite positive addition to any Deadheads collection.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this book had me hooked practically by the first page!  It was and still is one of my favorite books of all times.  I  read this book about 10 times and every time felt like the first.  Beautifully written!
B005HSL626|3.0|This is a fun game to play for a while. Having said that, the game doesn't keep up with how well you're playing. Some rounds you get a few power ups and others you get a lot all at once. At first it's easy to keep breaking your high score.. But the randomness of the rounds means you have to play more and more crappy sessions just to get ONE where you have a CHANCE to play well enough to get to, say, 600, 700 points or more. At worst, it ends up feeling like a carnival game where you know you CAN win but you've got to keep putting in money (by looking at ads) to prove it.
B000A2IPP0|5.0|As everyone who has seen this movie will likely agree, this is one of the most memorable and entertaining movies ever made! The entire family will enjoy watching this movie together. I saw it originally when released in the theaters in my teens and now my six children who are mostly grown love it too! It's great to share fun and memories through great film!! My daughter found my \\"Wish List\\" on Amazon and bought this for me for Christmas and I could not have been more pleased by any gift! Thank you Leda!!
B000SZNFO0|2.0|The orator is so monotone and lacks the ability to pause between speakers that it's one long ramble. Excluding the third disc (The letter monologue) it's difficult to follow. I could glean the story and generally who was speaking but it was like following someone with a thick accent. I'll probably read it in print to fill in where I couldn't grasp the moment appropriately from listening. The story seemed great, but the delivery is poor.
B00365QTQK|5.0|This book arrived quickly and is in great condition.  It is a Christmas gift for my Grandaughter, so having it sent in such a timely manner was important.  Thanks for great service!
B006C45MRE|2.0|I watched this movie with an open mind, but my mind could only open so far. I do not want to give too much away, but the movie seemed to be building nicely until a ridiculous plot twist involving Olivia Wilde. It is sci-fi so I am willing to suspend belief up to a certain point if a script is written well; but after the aforementioned plot twist, the movie started to unravel and go down hill in a rapid, gravity-fueled inferno. My enjoyment turned to disappointment. It became so cliche and anti-climatic, even Indiana Jones and James Bond could not save it. Not a movie I would want to watch again.
B005D63RQK|5.0|Just.wow?..this series is at once engaging on a superficial level...but after on episode, you're hooked and immersed into the storyline, from all sdes.  This show is the best show I've ever seen...I loved The Sopranos, but this  blows that show out of the water, in a different way.

B00479SVBU|5.0|I have owned probably 7 different FM transmitters since 2004 all for listening to my IPOD in the car.  The Soundfly is hands down the best I've used.  It was hard for me to believe some of the reviews about how strong the signal is, but they're all true.  Typically, just driving to and from work, previous transmitters would fade in and out on a 15 mile drive.  Not with this one, set it and forget it.<br /><br />I have only used the Aux input at this point, works great with my cell phone and IPOD.  The USB and SD capabilities were just bonuses for me, probably won't get used much.<br /><br />First road trip with the Soundfly this weekend, will be traveling through 3 states, excited to see how the signal holds up through various cities.<br /><br />So happy to finally have a transmitter that I'm not constantly having to adjust!  Thank you Satechi!!!<br /><br />2/11/12 Update.  Have used this on multiple road trips now and I am still very pleased with this transmitter.  Might have to change the station once on a 4hr drive.<br /><br />Took a little time to adjust to setting the volume when listening to phone/ipod.  Depending on the device, I only need to turn the volume up to 50%-75%.  If the volume is set to high, the transmitter overpowers the stereo in my car and causes distortion.<br /><br />Also put an 8gb sd card in it, and that sounds incredible.  Navigation through the menu is a little cumbersome, but easy enough.  Definitely recommend this transmitter!

It costs very little to produce and now that ebooks have become popular, the price only seems to go higher & higher.<br />As far as the Book goes I found it at a second hand bookstore for $7.00. The story is so so and I agree with other comments that It's turning is very slow, unlike other earlier books.

B001N1DPDE|4.0|Solid full tang knife. This knife is a beast and a real work horse. I don't like the hand grips as they seemed too slick for me. I just put a section of a rubber inner tube over the handle and all is good. The sheath sucks so be advised.
B005V4X8JA|5.0|As a head's up, I tend to submit reviews only for CDs whose music or remastering is either very impressive or so lousy that a warning to potential buyers seems warranted.  I own a number of Steve Hoffman DCC Gold CDs and they are all winners, with warm yet incredibly detailed sound that, although issued in the 1990's, still beats any subsequent remastering more than 15 years later and somehow -- despite the lower bit resolution -- reasonably competes even with SACDs (at least on up to mid-level stereo systems).  In contrast, I find the Audio Fidelity gold reissues hit and miss, at least in terms of having the sonics be revelatory.  After playing this new release (with mastering by Hoffman) of the 1st CS&N album yesterday, even from just a single listen I can report this one is a winner. Since at least one reviewer has already provided a highly detailed report, I will just say that the sound reproduction on this AF release brought me closer than any of this album's other previous CD reissues to the sound that I recall when this album was first released in 1969 and I listened to the LP through headphones on a buddy's stereo (which was better than mine).  Upon reaching the end of the album of this AF reissue, I realized what little role drumming played in the arrangements (and how much some simple percussion had added) and that the rhythmic propulsion of the non-ballad tunes like \\"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes\\" and \\"Long Time Comin'\\" are almost all due to the creatively melodic lines of Stills' bass playing (which in this instance were more akin to McCartney's or Entwhistle's than those found in the usual rock band simply holding down the bottom) interwoven with his overdubbed acoustic strumming and memorable electric guitar leads. It made me recall how unique and stunning this original CS&N sound was and, although the harmonies remained the same, from Deja Vu onwards when CS&N (&Y) added a full backing band, would never again be quite the same.  The clarity of the stereo imaging and sound separation on this AF release also highlights (especially with the organ parts also played by Stills) just how precociously talented and adept Stills was a musician. Just a final note:  As with a number of other AF releases (whether mastered by Hoffman or Kevin Gray), I had to raise the volume on my pre-amp to much higher than usual listening levels to get a clear picture of the sound reproduction.  I usually listen at around what would would be a 3-4 to my volume knob but needed to turn it up to 5-6 for this and other AF releases.  That being said, just from listening (and not from any measurements), I don't detect any noticeable distortion from this necessary volume boost and it did not at all disturb my listening pleasure.

B0036TGSIK|4.0|A high school honors student (played very well by a mere 22 or 23 year old named Emma Stone, she was perhaps the youngest actress ever to play a high school student in a Hollywood movie) decides to consciously experience what Hester Prynne in the Scarlet Letter might have experienced, when her little lie about finally losing her virginity to an alleged friend is overheard and spread around as gossip-instantly of course via all the text messages..  So she becomes the school slut by rumor, then decides to play the role to the hilt, including literally wearing the Scarlet A on her clothing, while actually remaining a virgin. The only predictable part is that the situation gets out of her control due to her inability to say no to the needs of seemingly sympathetic people (though as she notes, almost nobody actually asks her for sex, only notoriety).   A parable about our fascination with gossip and the lives of others, in lieu of actually having lives. But also a commentary on how even the brightest, most ethical and forthright woman can be categorized, even in the modern climate of  supposedly open sex, as a slutty,ruined woman, an outcast, Hester Prynne.  You know it is not going to be teenage junk from the very beginning, as her overly progressive and understanding parents are played by Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci,and Thomas Haden-Church (the great blonde comic from Sideways) plays her English teacher, etc. Happier ending than the Scarlet Letter, of course, it is a comedy, mostly, but a thoughtful one. On another level,surely intended, it's also about the trouble both men and women have with women's sexuality expressed (instead of repressed or hidden). As I enter my 60's, I note that so little about that has changed in my lifetime. Interesting and effective setting, the prototypical perfect sunny So Cal residential community where everyone has perfect teeth and skin, and everything is pretty, with a rambling high school setting reminiscent of so many bad 80'sSo Cal-set teenage comedies.

B002VPE1B6|4.0|I recently purchased a Blu-ray DVD player, and I was looking for a movie that would really show off what it could do.  I knew that I had what I was looking for when one of the inserts proclaimed Avatar the \\"movie that Blu-ray was made for\\".  I can say that it lives up to the billing.  The scenes in the movie are stunning in color and clarity, and I found my jaw drop on multiple occasions.  The story is a combination of the history of the American settlers and the Native Americans crossed with Star Wars.  This may sound trite, but the story and the acting are both better than anything in Lucas' six films.  The plot is very predictable, but it does not ruin the experience.  I found the ending to be satisfying if not surprising.  If you are looking for something plot driven that will keep you guessing, this will likely disappoint you.  Avatar, however, is about visual eye candy first, and it delivers to the fullest extent.  I would recommend this to any Sci-Fi fan looking to exercise their Blu-ray player.  I plan to watch the movie again in order to take in what I missed the first time.

B006G2ZEV6|4.0|I love the look and feel of this tower offense game. It runs smooth on my EVO 4G. I have to dock a star on a technical matter: this game needs an exit button and/or Back button support. All Android games should offer an exit button or Back button support.  I still recommend this game enthusiastically. This really is a fantastic game! Thanks for porting to Android:)
B0029XFNA8|1.0|What a disappointment!  Why would a Bluray video that is pictured in color on the cover of the movie, turn out to be in black and white?  After opening and discovering the movie is black and white, I went back to the website, and if you scroll all the way down to the bottom of the page it does say black and white format, but with the picture on the case being in color, it never occurred to me to check to see if it was actually in color.  Buyer beware!
0765365278|5.0|So often a book gradually sucks you in only for you to be deeply disappointed.  This story grabbed a hold of me--tooth and nail--at page 1 and will not let go.  From the prelude to the very last sentence I was captivated.<br /><br />Words cannot describe the amazing characters or the incredible storyline.  I have read/listened to the book six times on my Kindle since August, and each time a few more bits and pieces fall into place.  Starting the book for the seventh time.  Cannot wait for the next book.

0805047905|5.0|My daughter is 1 and she LOVES this book!  It's her absolute favorite book.  She dances along to the book when we read it since it's so repetitious!  It's awesome!  We have it memorized and can recite easily without even looking as she flips thru it!  The brown bear and the black sheep are her FAVORITES...she gets all excited when she sees them every single time!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Definitely got my moneys worth out of the game. I do find it hard to put down, and I haven't even switched to the Vegas scoring system yet.
0553381709|4.0|I loved the first two books in the series, but this one I found too drawn out and tedious. Still good, yes, but there were things that just frustrated me. I'm quite sick of the poor, long suffering Catelyn. God man just give her her children back, or let her know that they are still alive. (You'll find out what happens to a handful of characters, and you should know now that he likes to kill them off; in this one it is two major characters and two supporting characters...bye-bye) However I think one of them might still be alive, which is what brought about my confusion at the end. Its not possible for them to be alive, unless that person has become an `Other'.  I don't think I will be reading the next one anytime soon. I've flipped through it and I see that my favorite character in it, Queen Dany, is not making an appearance. That's upsetting, for she is the bomb!

1439102732|3.0|This book falls far short of its potential and many of the issues touched upon, such as someone's identity, are just blantantly ignored. Let me first state that I have many gay friends, so I am not being homophobic when I say I find it unrealistic that no one suggested Zoe should maybe have counseling before marrying Vanessa. Why? Here's a woman that, in the space of something ridiculous like six months, loses a baby, gets divorced by her husband of ten years, finds out she has cancer, gets a hysterectomy, falls in love with Vanessa, decides she's a lesbian, and gets remarried. I find it extremely unrealistic that she would not struggle with having lesbian feelings for Vanessa after being happily married for many years without the slightest inkling she was gay. If I Zoe's friend, I would suggest she wait a year and see how she felt before taking the major step of marrying someone. If I was Vanessa, I would definitely want to wait a while to make sure this was a lasting love and not a passing stage caused by extreme grief and emotional disturbance. This woman just had too much tragedy in too short of a time to be emotionally grounded enough to make life altering decisions.
B005DCJ1J6|4.0|I've got to admit, I love almost anything with Michael Caine in it, and I certainly liked this film as well. It starts off with an orphanage being one of the main scenes in the story and goes on to show one of the main characters, Homer Wells (Toby Mcguire), how the world can look very beautiful, but be filled with pain and ugliness. It's a journey out into the world and home again, and the joys and trials that go with it.
B006G2ZEV6|3.0|This game has all sorts of accolades so it was a simple decision to pick it up - however, on the Xoom at least, the subtitles won't show up even if they are turned on as other users have suggested... 4.5 stars if this bug gets fixed...
B000FVE3AC|5.0|This is one of the better Invicta watches.  The Japanese automatic self-winding movement works properly and never needs a battery.  Build and finish on the watch was excellent, considering the low price.  Big and Heavy!  This is a real dive watch, not a fashion watch. Solid Stainless Steel.
B005TQACLC|5.0|Saw it live, twice in Ohio and LOVED it! Great mixes for some of the songs, wish she hadn't used the Studio Versions for this release, but true Britney fans know that it's not about the singing. (Yes, we love her that much.) Great tour, great angles, highly recommend it.

0062060554|5.0|This is one book you will not put down from the moment you read the first sentence.  Others have summarized the premise, I will not do so here.  Suffice it to say that this ambitious and well-written first novel keeps you guessing and holds you to the last sentence.  Although it does lapse into a somewhat conventional thriller toward the end, it is a minor negative and does not in any way spoil the gripping conclusion.  Do not miss this book!  And do not plan to get much sleep yourself before you get to the final words of this novel!
B005G4YEOI|5.0|After putting out the 1980 Menotti production on DVD ([[ASIN:B000E5KOK2 Puccini: Manon Lescaut]]) and the 2008 performance of the same production on DVD as well ([[ASIN:B001DHE9KQ Puccini - Manon Lescaut (The Metropolitan Opera HD Live Series)]]), are we tried of getting Puccini's first big success from the Met?  Surely not, now that Decca is reissuing this, their first of the Met's only two complete recordings made for the label (The other? Verdi's I Lombardi from 1996, with Pavarotti ([[ASIN:B0000042GP Verdi - I Lombardi / Anderson, Leech, Pavarotti, Ramey; Levine]]), as does this one). This recording from 1991 (After the Met performed the opera that season, their last until 2008) is being reissued as one of the first releases of the new series Decca is marking, honoring the label as The Opera Company. And proving with their recent releases on DVD (Specially from the Met), they are still that!  As with the DVDs, James Levine lead his orchestra (The Met Orchestra) as if they done it countless of times before-to perfection. Pavarotti and Mirella Freni led a fine cast that makes this one THE Manon Lescaut to get on CD (Or downloading, if you prefer)!  Grab it while you can!
B003L77GGK|4.0|When \\"Supernatural\\" began it was a good show. In season two it became a great show with exciting stories and good, believable interactions between the main characters.  The series continued at this high level for several years.  After the producers introduced the apocalypse storyline the show lost its way, but there are still some wonderful episodes in season six, particularly for long time fans of the series.  People new to the show are likely to miss many of the In-jokes so prevalent in season six, but it is still possible to get considerable entertainment out of it.

0307477479|4.0|This widely praised, \\"genre-bending,\\" post-modern novel about the rock music business certainly deserves its many accolades and prizes, including the Pulitzer, for its humor, originality, and stylistic brilliance.  Jennifer Egan's experimental approach to story telling, including seventy-five pages of PowerPoint presentations about life in the 2020s, may be unique, and for that alone, the book would be captivating.  Fortunately, she also manages to create several fascinating characters who echo and re-echo throughout the short-story-like chapters, even when the narrators change constantly.<br /><br />Beginning in the late 1980s, the novel opens and closes with the focus on Sasha, the kleptomaniac assistant to Benny Salazar, a band player and rock music producer in New York, and Alex, her timid date.  They and a wide variety of other characters reflect the values and goals of the music business, which like film and photography, are eventually considered to exist in an \\"aesthetic holocaust\\" as a result of the \\"digitization which has sucked the life out\\" of creativity. Time becomes a major theme here as characters move in and out of the action, which takes place in many different locations:  New York City, the Mabuhay Gardens nightclub in San Francisco, Africa on safari, Naples, and even the American Southwest in 202_.  Seventy-five pages of PowerPoint presentations, taking place in the future, add contemporary identification with the stories of these characters.  The more time passes, the more obvious it becomes that regardless of the times that rebellion is a fact of life.<br /><br />The novel, almost a collage, focuses on the specific and unique, sometimes at the expense of the universal, but Jennifer Egan holds it all together and keeps her reader engaged with a series of characters who are different from the norm and committed to goals we can all understand.  Ultimately, the \\"goon\\" of time and the characters' desire to be creative within it coalesce, and \\"th stRs u cant c\\"  do inspire succeeding generations.  When the novel moves into 201_, employees of the music business are \\"handset employees,\\" people who are \\"paperless, deskless, commuteless, and theoretically omnipresent,\\" due to the internet. Creating audiences for concerts becomes a question of creating \\"blind teams\\" of \\"parrots,\\"  people who will spout what they are paid to spout in order to generate attention for an event, a process regarded with \\"ethical ambivalence.\\"<br /><br />The most difficult aspect of this book is the constant change of point of view and change of time.  It is sometimes difficult to figure out who is speaking, where the action is taking place, and whether the speaker is one whom the reader has seen before.  The interrelationships among them can become complex, but as a rule, they help to bridge the action between what has happened in the past and what is happening at the time of the new chapter.  If anything, there are too many characters of too little importance, thematically, but as the conclusion connects all the past to the future, ten years from now, the author makes her points vividly.  The final scenes reinforce the author's positions regarding the fate of the characters and the business to which they have devoted their lives.  Unique and intriguing.

B0000074LY|1.0|I recently recieved a Twisted Sister cd, love is for suckers. it's all full of static and sounds like crap. i would like to exchange it for another copy. losin my faith in amazon.com. ----Derrick A. Adams
0143039431|4.0|I recently finished this book in an attempt to fill in the gaps of my \\"classics\\" of literature. A lot of people read this book in High School or early in College, but for some reason my HS skipped it, probably because it is a little longer than most of the other books we read. That said, I'm very glad I took the time to read it, and also find a certain amount of serendipity in the fact that I read it as the effects of the 2008 financial meltdown are still reeking havoc on careers of so many people. The book in of its self is great, but the timing of when I read seems to give it a little extra kick.<br />Grapes of Wrath is often labeled as a work of socialist fiction. Personally, I didn't really get that from my reading of it. There are workers that are treated unfairly, they are often harassed or oppressed by their employers, they theorize that if they stand together they could demand more, and they find that they are often better off when they are left to fend for themselves. If you look at these, you will find that there isn't much in the way of propaganda here. Workplace bullying by those with any level of authority is a fairly well-known and well accounted fact of life. Your boss is a jerk and the company will do anything it can to suck every bit of effort out of you for the lowest price possible; maybe this was not well known in the 30's or people were more ashamed of it then, but now it is what it is. Which leads to the next point about workers sticking together. I don't think it is particularly socialist to realize the practical fact that there is strength in numbers, which can be leveraged against businesses that go to far. I know what Marxism is, and that isn't it. Finally, the characters often remark that they are better off taking care of themselves or enforcing their own laws. That sounds like a small government libertarian's dream to me.<br />The pleasant surprises I found in the book involved the well developed characters, accept for Noah (pointless), Connie (plot point but nearly pointless) and Uncle John (broken record.) I was able to create a solid visual image of this tight knit family that shared so much together. You had a real sense of each person's place in the Joad family, that could be alternately openly loving or mechanically efficient. I also found Steinbeck's use of different literary tools interesting, with him moving (although not very smoothly) from immersive local color, to disjointed stream-of-conscious, to poetic prose. He uses these tools to help bring more texture to the parts they are used in without being too heavy handed, although his jumping from different perspectives or suddenly going head first in the mile a minute mind of a used car salesman, can be jarring.<br />Some readers complained that this book is slow. That is true; it is a little slow, but I believe it is probably supposed to be. This isn't an action packed thriller or romantic drama, its a yarn about simple people trying to live their lives in a world that is far from simple. If the story didn't take the time to set up the atmosphere, to really set the scene, I don't think the book would be half as good.<br />Finally, given the ago of book, there has been a lot of time for people to over analyze its historical accuracy. This is a work of fiction set against a series of events that happened in history; so looking further than that is merely an academic exercise. Its in the Literature section of the book store not the History or Non-Fiction section, so you would have to be a fool to put too much stock in the writer's interpretation of events.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1.) Steinbeck does a wonderful job of capturing the mindset of a farming family. He waxes poetic about the cultivation of land in a way that I wouldn't have thought possible, which in turn gave me a real sense of how much love farmers can have for their life's work.<br />2.) The fictional Joad family lets a 21st Century urbanite like me look into a world that I havelittle connection to and no experience with. A good writer engages the reader in a way that makes them feel like they are sharing the story with the characters, and Steinbeck does exactly that. I really wanted to know what happens to the characters after the all too open end (see con below.)<br />3.) Some may disagree with Steinbeck's personal reasoning behind writing Grapes of Wrath, but it's hard to argue with his economics, especially since we are seeing a model of it in action now. As the demands for jobs go up, workers are willing to work for increasingly less out of fear and desperation. Just as Steinbeck's farm owners pit workers against each other to lower wages and work conditions, so do the managers and presidents of business today. Don't want to work overtime? There is a line of applicants that will. Want $50k a year? I have 10 resumes from people that will do it for $40k a year. You've got a retirement plan and pension? I should get rid of you because you cost too much and hire a college grad for the half the money and don't have to offer them any kind of benefits because they will be happy just to be working. This is real and I see it happening every day.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1.) Like most good books, Grapes of Wrath isn't for the casual reader. It's long, slow and thoroughly depressing; as well has needing a little bit of historical context. I think it was worth it, but I know not everyone will get a lot out of it.<br />2.) If I was looking to edit the book down to make it easier to read, I would tie up some of the dead ends or eliminate them altogether. What was the point of Noah? Do so many animals need to get hit by cars? Why did Casey play such an important role, just to vanish for a quarter of the book and then meet an inauspicious end suddenly.<br />3.) The book ends very abruptly. There is a complete lack of finality that makes you wonder if the author really knew what was going to happen to his characters when he started writing. To just end the story in the middle of a sort of hairy moment, after suffering so much with the Joads, it almost seems like a waste. Steinbeck closed on a pretty, albeit odd in a modern context, visual, but I think it was a very unsatisfying ending.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />A great book about the American experience for some in the 1930's that is a little long, but for me should have been a little longer if only to give the reader a sense of what the future would have in store for the Joads.ience with.

1451648537|4.0|As a person who doesn't really enjoy reading many biography, I have to say I really did love this!  Steve Jobs was such a unique character and I was enthralled every page of this book. He is definitely a visionary but I wouldn't want to work for the guy.  Regardless, the book was written extremely well and keeps you interested.  My only complaint was that this book is a big time commitment.  With 571 pages in the hardcover, it did take me about a month to get through (partly because I didn't want to carry it many places, its heavy).  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in technology, Apple, or even interesting management styles.
B004EHE894|4.0|Unlike Audrey Hepburn's [[ASIN:B004IK30LY Sabrina]], you don't have to study in Paris to be a French chef thanks to this iconic cookbook written by Julia Child & company. The book is laid out methodically for the novice as well as the experienced cook: essential equipment, ingredients, definitions, temperatures, basic cutting techniques and a short comprehensive guide to cooking with, drinking, storage and serving of wine.<br /><br />The chapters (title pages decorated with three adorable fleur-de-lis) are laid out from soup to desserts interspersed with helpful hints as well as variations on most themes as it were. You are going to want to master Chapter 2-Sauces before you proceed any further: the whites sauces, the brown sauces, the tomato, mayonnaise and Hollandaise sauces. Not only are these the essence of French cooking but their mastery will give you a lot of expertise as well as a wonderful sense of satisfaction!<br /><br />Then she moves on to a chapter solely on Eggs. Believe me, if you can master a perfect omelette or even scrambled eggs, all manner of wonderful compliments and proposals will come your way.<br /><br />Warning: many of these recipes are not easy to prepare, many of them are very time consuming and some of the ingredients are going to be darn near impossible to find. Read them very, very carefully and in the beginning always allot more time than you reasonably think it might take. Extra ingredients are handy in case you really botch it up the first time.<br /><br />My personal favorites are the Roast Chicken, Boeuf Bourguignon, her classic Salad Nicoise, and her recipe for Creme Fraiche. The decadent Chantilly Creme is great on anything and her instructions on poaching fresh fruit means you never have to worry about a less than totally spectacular dessert again. God bless you Julia!!

They came to the conclusion that the product was defective and sent me out a new one within a few days.

This is a perfect product for anyone who has special cassettes they would like to preserve and also be able to listen to.  In this day and time, it sure is nice to know you can still rely on some companies to back their products.

B004X60QE2|1.0|It's hard to believe all these great reviews.  This show tries way too hard to develop a Northern Exposure-like cast of quirky characters.  It also tries way too hard to convince you that everyone in town is a super-genius a la \\"Real Genius\\" with Val Kilmer.  However, the real trouble starts when the entire town comes together and starts finishing each others' sentences - solving impossibly complicated problems with a few minutes of facile, preposterous techno-babble.  It's enough to make me long for the plausibility of the worst episodes of Star Trek Voyager, if not a quick death.  I wonder how Hollywood executives thought that writing a show about geniuses and mind-bending science at an elementary school level of sophistication would be a good idea... oh yeah, all those great reviews.  Never mind.

1451648537|3.0|3 Stars  Extremely compelling bio no matter who may have told it; however, with Isaacson at the authorship helm, one would expect a grand slam (compelling bio/preeminent author).  I just cant stand the dumbed-down and hackneyed syntax used by Isaacson.  I realize that conversational tone is in editorial vogue these days, but gosh, could people, in the spirit of what Steve would expect, incorporate beauty in things that they do, especially those things offered to a mass audience (in this case, the written style of Isaacson, which is particularly ugly.  Perhaps he was rushed to meet a release date.).

B005I6EU48|5.0|I purchased this for my nifty new Kindle Fire.<br /><br />It looks like a classic antique book. It fits my Kindle Fire perfect. The Fire fits in just fine and stays put in the case.<br /><br />It has a nice soft lining with a handy pocket on the inside of the front cover.<br /><br />It is just very stylish, classy and downright cool.<br /><br />It is made of some high quality plastic material that really looks and feels like real leather.  Probably actually better then leather as no cows were killed for the hide, resists water and stains and does not require maintenance like real leather does.<br /><br />Yes, the price is a bit steep, but if you want quality and class you got to pay for it.<br /><br />Very highly recommended.......
B005PTQPU0|5.0|Haunting, beautiful and evocative, Kate bush creates a spellbinding world of  homages to loves, losts and desires snugly wrapped around the theme of winter. I'd  rate it as her fourth best album, between \\"Never for Ever\\" and \\"The Sensual World\\".  I think 50 Words is more concise and easier to listen to than \\"Aerial\\" because  the songs all run along a parallel theme, whereas Aerial felt at times a little  uneven to me. I like 50 Words for Snow more and more with each listen, and I can't  wait until her next album comes out under the Fish People label!   Congrats Kate!

You wanna sell books doing something else? Fugedaboudit! You don't like using social media to expose readers to your books? Fugedaboudit! You don't wanna do like John says? Fugedaboudit! Just remember, he's the one selling all the books. Anyway, you read one or two of his books, you buy more - - or not. The purpose of all this MARKETING stuff is to stick a book in front of a reader's mug. Hopefully, they will start reading and want more. Tell a friend maybe.  Nobody's putting a gun in anybody's face here. There are all sorts of connections to be made out there. And some might be a long stretch, but you decide for yourself. Eh? Me? I know nothing about Twitter or Facebook. But I'll do what I can to sell my own books that I love writing. And I'll try and capture ALL of John's readers, too. Whaddaya gonna do?
B0064Z7CI8|2.0|Truly 5 stars.  Seriously, did I just fat finger a 2 star rating?  Not really.  I just wanted to accomplish two things.  1) get your attention 2) explain why a 2 star rating applies.  As to this 2 star rating, I rate it such, since all bands influenced by the music from this album, are utterly unlistenable.  All of the typical post-modern rock fare originating during the 93/94 time frame until now goes down path that the Smashing Pumpkins started.  Some milestones along this path include the wall of guitar sound, confessional subject matter in lyrics, emotive singing style, and rhythmic sophistication, drawing upon fusion jazz influences in the drum figures.  All of this, and more, is great stuff in a Pumpkin world, but everywhere else, again, unlistenable.  You hear it everywhere: Creed, Deftones, Linkin Park, the thousands of contemp[table]orary Christian praise bands, prom bands, and the like.  You get the picture.  But, as far as this album, awesome.  Buy it, just don't try to replicate it in the garage--Thank you.  I plead with you, don't try.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great fun, challenging enough to occupy but not discourage! Kept me busy for a long time. I don't think Ill be bored anytime soon.
B002SSUQFG|1.0|This watch does not keep time, it either runs fast (rarely) or slow (very often), but is never accurate.  Very disappointing purchase.
B005YDLJ76|5.0|Beyoncé is looking fabulous on the '4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé', which happened early in 2011. Her vocals are amazing as always and the video editing from 'Live at Roseland' DVD is incredible!  The beginning of the concert shows the path Beyoncé followed until now (as in 'I Am... Yours') and later on she performs almost every song from her latest album '4' (except for 'Start Over' and the tracks from Deluxe Version). It's really nice to watch, specially these songs: the ballads are amazingly performed with intimacy and the uptempos feature an amazing set of lights to complete the well-known Beyoncé coreography style.  The only thing I would change is to add an angle option to see the concert from Roseland only (some songs show some personal videos and/or footage from other concerts). Not that I didn't like to see these clips, but it would be nice to see how it happened in NYC only.  About the deluxe package, I found it really nice! As I don't actually like digipack, this one is really beautiful!!! The cover is kind of shiny, like a Blu-Ray glove and the CDs are packed in a good-looking plastic. There is also a booklet, featuring some pictures from '4' photoshoot and others as well.  You won't regret buying it!
B006P4H7OW|1.0|I really loved this show and thought the writing was amazing.  This finale shows that it's just another show with everyone becoming super natural.  It's going to now be a ghost opera just like what True Blood has turned into.  So bummed :(
B004EBT5CU|5.0|The Adele 21 CD I ordered was received on time and in fantastic condition.  I can't get enough of Adele...what an awesome CD.
B000035P5E|4.0|A great movie.  Lots of suspense.  The acting is above average. It is not a new movie, but many young adults would not believe how good of a story this is.
B005OLF6BI|5.0|I went to one of her concerts, in germany, and i was surprised when i heard 'Drops of Jupiter' and some other covered songs on the CD that she hadn't played at her concert in germany. it was a great surprise and i just love her playing and singing live.  It's a really great CD & DVD.
B001LMAK88|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Right up there with \\"Kingdom Of Heaven\\" and \\"Braveheart\\" and \\"The Thirteenth Warrior\\". A fun movie to watch.
1423140591|5.0|I have been a fan of Rick Riordan`s work since 5th grade. Where a friend of mine offered to trade his book, The Titan`s curse with my book (i forgot what it is). It was one of the first book i read that exceed 100 pages. The book has more than 250. Which is pretty incredible since that was the first year i learned english. The book is the reason i am not addicted to reading. Anyway, kind of got sidetracked there, the son of neptune is an intriguing sequel to the first book, the lost hero and the past 5 percy jackson and the olympians book. The book keeps you reading until your eyes hurt and the ending keeps you guessing until the next book came out. Which i cant seem to wait a year for! TOO LONG!
0439023521|5.0|I had heard this trilogy was for young adults but that is not true! You already know the plot, so I won't go into it. The books were highly recommended to me by a 62 year old woman. Being a baby boomer, I devoured the trilogy in no time flat. And then after you have read the trilogy, you are not in the mood for any other books because you are still reliving those moments from The Hunger Games. I loved this book and recommend it to everyone, young and old! I can't wait to see the movie in March to see the spectacular costumes and Katniss fighting to the death.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|It is definitely one of my most favorite apps but the are a few problems. One problem is that it can be slow and laggy but that is because of bad internet connections and is to be expected when I'm at a place with slow wifi. The second, and biggest, problem is that the app is very CPU and RAM demanding. The app occasionally makes my system \\"stutter\\" when I'm playing media on my Kindle. I have checked it on Windows Task Manager and when it is in use there is a process called Desktop Windows Manager that takes up a great portion of my computer's memory. If they could fix it so it wasn't so demanding then this app would be perfect.
B00656C6KK|5.0|A legendary artist at her best. Her top box office status in film, to date, has never been matched. Her recording are timeless. From band singer to pop singers - her articulation, nuance and pathos as always evident. Her articulation and diction should be taught to all the American idol wannabees. A must have for Miss Day fans and for anyone who enjoys beautiful. All proceeds go to Doris Day Animal Foundation. So cool![[ASIN:B00656C6KK My Heart (U.S. Edition)]]
B002ZG98C8|5.0|A lot of republicans did not like this movie!!!   Angry about shearing land that one day was part of Mexico.
B002BSRBRO|5.0|I must say... the wife needs some type of award for best actress because I really hate her!!! She's just over the top about everything and very bossy!!!
B000002LFZ|5.0|one of the best bands of all time i love them i grew up to them and i love stevie she has a voice the moves you. stevie is the one the made that band if you ask me well keep on rockin!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B001HN6918|2.0|They took a good story and made it a low budget follow up. I mean, a chase scene in broken carts?  Not without it's moments, but there's a reason Pixar is consistently better!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a wonderful book. A must read for everyone. I enjoyed the characters and the story very much! Worth every penny!
B00006D295|5.0|My sister got me this off of my wish list for Christmas! It came quickly and well packaged. I Love This Movie!
B004LL1HM4|3.0|It is pretty obvious that this group has spent a fair amount of time studying old Beach Boys records.  They have a wonderful \\"sound.\\"  However, it sometimes sounds as though the beautiful production is used to cover up fairly lackluster and forgettable melodies.  I thought that their previous album was much stronger.
B005BOHYW2|4.0|This was a slightly uncomfortable read, as a Mother, the emotions felt by the main character were some of the unspoken truths first-time mothers feel but won't tell anyone for fear of being accused of being a bad mother. Loved hearing about the meaning of flowers. What a fascinating main character. Couldn't put the book down. Thoroughly enjoyed and recommended.
0756404738|5.0|I disagree with the negative reviews on this book. Of course we are left in a similar standing as the first book; there is a whole day left in the story! Kvothe, our hero, continues his quest and encounters in this book and we are introduced to several new concepts and important characters. More scandalous adventures and situations.... I found this book to be every bit the page-turner the first book was. I have fallen even more in love with kvothe (who is becoming a total bad-a). Five stars! I cant wait to see how this story ends and how all of these loose ends will be tied up!! Bravo Rothfuss.
B004EPYZPS|5.0|I wasn't sure about this one due to all of the hype connected with it,so I ordered it with an open mind.Well now I am glad that I bought it.A lot of excitement in it and the effects are really good.Thanks to the other reviewers for taking the time to post their thoughts on the movie, as it aids in making a choice on where to buy or not.I bought the dvd of it and now am going to order the bluray version.Don't miss this one Folks.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Fantastic Series! It came quickly in the mail. My husband got this off his wish list for Christmas. He loves this series!
B000002KAT|1.0|I know this is considered a \\"classic\\" and one of the \\"best albums of all time\\" but I find it ultimately annoying.  I bought into the hype when I first purchased it but I gradually came to realize that I couldn't stand it.  The overly lengthy songs and vocal \\"improvisations\\" drove me batty.  Morrison's vocal mannerisms are highly repetitive.  He seems to have a few signature vocal \\"licks\\" that he uses again and again and again...  This album killed any budding interest I had in Van Morrison.  Best left for the retirement set.
0525423281|5.0|Stephanie Perkins does it again!  I just love her books.  You can't put it down.  It has that yearning/longing feeling.  A love story about \\"The One\\".  Cricket is a funny name though :-)  But the book is absolutely sweet.  You'll love Lola and Cricket.  I highly recommend Anna and the French Kiss as well.  Both are a must read and I can't wait for Perkins's next book.
B005DF2QMC|4.0|I bought this Item for my boyfriend for Christmas so he has not gotten it yet, but  the delivery was very fast, I guess I'll let you know later how it works!!!!!!!
B002BU0DPE|1.0|Worked fine for a while. Then started falling apart. Breaks at joint between arch and earpiece.  Earpiece also too small and shallow to wear comfortably for long periods. Good sound but bad design.
B004LROMWU|2.0|I do not know where to start.   - fully armed civilians obeying a withdrawn para-military person??  - A professor of history (an intellectual!!) who is mentally and physically capable of fighting like a well trained soldier??? His obsessive addiction for AK47 is another issue..  - 16 - 17 year old teenagers armed and fighting like trained mercenaries?  - many different weapons but no shortage of ammunition for each of them??  - unlimited supplies of food, equipment, water, ammo and fuel???  - alien robots with \\"impact weapons\\" firing Earth technology bullets??  come on. is that the best you can do? even my eight year old son can create a plot better than that.  to me, this series is a mixture of Lost and V but much worse than each of these.  by the way, 2 stars is for very good acting of Will Patton and not for the series.
B00425S1H8|5.0|I needed a solution that would allow me to connect my GPSMAP 76 with a 9 pin serial interface to my serial portless laptop. I received it in about 4 days, installed the software on Windows 7 (64 bit), connected the converter to an open USB port and waited for windows to find it. Then I connected the GPS device and fired up my mapping software - WOW it worked the first time and worked like it should. I can communicate with the GPS with no problems.
B002ONC9NC|1.0|I love this movie and bought a copy for my mother. When she received it she found that the audio wasn't working. I had her return it and sent another copy her way. That copy had the same problem. Luckily a friend was able to figure out that the audio-channels were the issue. If she re-wires her cables she can get the sound to play on one channel, and has to change it again if she wants to hear any commentary. This was a real disappointment since I really enjoyed the movie! Hopefully there aren't a large number of copies with this same issue...
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I have attempted to watch many well liked musicals, such as West Side Story, The Hills are Alive with the Sound of Music, Mama Mia and Moulin Rouge, and I experienced profound misery - to the extent that I was not able to watch any of them in their entirety. Therefore, I was especially resistant to a musical tampering with the Beatles. It seems that musicals are just not my forte. With a bad attitude I was corralled into watching this movie. In fact, my attitude was so bad it should have landed me in the dog house for a week.<br /><br />However, from the very start of this wonderful film, I was captivated.<br /><br />What caught my attention and held it is how the movie looked visually. It is an absolutely wonderful treat for the eyes. Choreographed well (the businessmen in New York on their way to work), outstanding cinematography (with attention to little details like juxtaposing the pattern of the sidewalks with the structure of the cathedral ceiling), enjoyable use of animation and special effects (Come Together, the Egg Man and Mr. Kite are enormously fun), cast perfectly with each actor delivering outstanding performances (every frame of the movie provides an example of this). Moreover, the interpretations work well with the story line which is relevant to the times.<br /><br />Tampering with the Beatles music turned from sacrilegious to the ultimate in respect for the integrity of their music.<br /><br />This movie rekindled my love for the Beatles.<br /><br />Bravo!
B0015ABRE2|4.0|What can you say about a serial killer? Somehow the writers have created a likeable and sympathetic serial killer in Dexter. His unnerving escapades continue in Season 3 as we are introduced to Miguel Prado played wonderfully by Jimmy Smits.<br />Another serial killer dubbed \\"The Skinner\\" is terrorizing Miami. Hey, how many serial killers can one city have at the same time? Miami Homicide is on duty tracking him down while Dexter and Miguel form a very unusual bond. Miguel has something in common with Dexter that only the two can understand. One thing gets in the way - Dexter's \\"code\\" of never harming the innocent.<br />Season 3 is full of twists and turns. Dexter is always one step away from getting caught but he always manages to save his skin. Here is the beauty of a DEXTER. A serial killer is the blood splatter expert in the homicide division. Who else to better bend the rules and create an aura of suspense.<br />As always, Michael C. Hall does a smashing job as the not so-evil-serial killer. Jimmy Smits is a great addition to the cast this season.<br />You won't want to miss how this season ends!
B004J1DBJI|5.0|Innovative search app that unlocks the power of your phone or tablet.  Google is great for searching text, but what if you have a math or science question?  Wolfram Alpha to the rescue.  Try it with speech input enabled:  \\"What is the central limit theorem?\\" or \\"What planets are visible tonight?\\".  The app has plenty of serious uses - integrating functions, defining math or science terms, etc.  It's also great fun if you were the sort to browse encyclopedias as a kid: \\"What is copernicium?\\" or \\"plot sin(x)/x\\".
B003A4IFGY|4.0|I think it's cool that Tom Petty decided to more directly explore the music born in the region where he comes from--blues in the south. Top notch band, of course! Great songs, too! And we get to hear Mike Campbell REALLY tear it up! I know that he's always been a restrained player by choice, soloing just enough to complement the song at hand, rather than concentrating on showboating his abilities. Well, this is the BLUES--guitar heaven--so this time he wisely chose to step up to the plate and really show us what he can do! A nod of admiration goes to Mr. Campbell!  Now Tom's singing...Tom's a great vocalist with an immediately recognizable sound that fits his own music like a glove. However, I don't consider it the best sounding voice to sing blues--just doesn't fit, IMO. Of course, I'm not saying he shouldn't have made this record or gotten someone else to sing the songs--that wouldn't make any sense. In fact, not a lot of these songs are straight blues, anyway, but some are pretty close to it. I still think this a great album, but since it's Tom Petty, I regard it as a bluesy Tom Petty record rather than a straight blues record. Just my take...I still highly recommend it for any Tom Petty or blues guitar fan!
B003PBB4ME|5.0|Pretty solid for the price. Will update and see how it holds up to the mountains and rolling shots with the cars.
B001S86J0I|5.0|Galaxy Quest provides a look into the Star Trek TV and movie and genre that is both amusing and illuminating.  To think of the hapless aliens who mistake the televised adventures of the crew of U.S.S. Protector for actual deeds still makes me smile!  Tim Allen gives an inspired performance as the shoot-from-the-hip Kirk-like commander who mistakes the enemy they must face for a character in a fictitious scenario presented by fans of their canceled TV show.  Sigourney Weaver is charming as the sexy but operationally superfluous female officer.  Allen Rickman is hilarious as a British Shakespearian actor chafing under his ridiculous role as the obligatory (and latex-crowned) alien member of the crew.  An amusing minor character is the high school kid sci-fi geek who ultimately provides them with the essential details for their starship needed to triumph over their galactic enemies.  Don't miss the crash landing of their starship at a Sci-Fi convention--or Sigourney Weaver's new, improved, and cleavage-enhancing uniform!
B004X80QNG|5.0|Versatile and feature-rich calendar app.  The Android version reflects the design and engineering work that made this a \\"must-have\\" app on Windows Mobile.  Switch easily between Day, Week, Month, Agenda, and Task views.  Color-code everything!    My wish list items:    o Widget - I currently use Agenda Widget, which opens Pocket Informant for calendar items    o Task Integration - I currently use Astrid for tasks. I wish this could read and write Astrid tasks.  Caveat: as of 12/2011, the app is broken under Android 4.0 \\"Ice Cream Sandwich\\".  Accessing \\"Settings\\" causes the app to crash, and the app does not display any appointments.  ICS came out mid-December, and this is the holiday season, so I hope it's fixed by early January.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|My mailing address is PO Box 1860 Wellfleet; MA 02667; I sent you a physical address thinking you would send by UPS.  You attempted to ship but now is getting returned.  Please resend to above address.  Wes Chapman
B001UV4XIS|5.0|After this, I still couldnt believe I was stareing at the end credits as the movie faded out and the credits started rolling. I think this was the best Harry Potter movie out of the entire series that made for a near-perfect close. Even though Part 2 did diverge from the ending of the book, the reason its getting the rating I'm giving it is becuz I do apperciate what everyone working to give us the great stories that came off the books. The books didn't do the movies justice, but I enjoyed watching them and watching Dan Radcliffe portraying Harry going from a once small innocent boy to a slightly grizzled man, and a wonderfull one at that. I do appreciate what he did for the series, and in my opinion, he has proven that he was the right guy to play Harry Potter over the last decade. I hope that this movie does get Academy Award recognition becuz I believe Part 2 truely deserves it! So long Harry, Ron, and Hermione! Its been a long journey, and we'll miss you all! :)
0142429414|1.0|i got about half way through this book and just couldnt finish it, i've had to put  down maybe 10 books in my 42 years, and this is one of them. just really didnt keep me there, sure i wanted to find out what happened, but that driving force wasnt enough to get me through it.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Breaking Bad continues to entertain with Season 3.  The characters become more layered as each season progresses.  Love the acting!
B006INDMEE|1.0|Plot is very slow developing, so slow and uninteresting, did not even finish watching. Perhaps for some, ok but not watch I expected, which was a smart, clever, spy movie. Perhaps take a chance but be warned.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Homeland is an excellent series about the covert operations that go on right on our own soil. Not only is this series riviting, well written, well acted, but it's extremely accurate. How POW's are seen by the government, what actions are taken in this day in age when they come home, and how the CIA, FBI, and security to our Nation really works is well illustrated in this series. The effect the war on terror has, on our own soil, goes mostly unnoticed on the level this series portrays. Great actors like Mandy Patinkin, Damian Lewis, and Claire Danes compliment this already well written script. Don't miss it, the pilot episode is shown for free on [...]. Check it out, buy the DVD, keep the series in action, help the possibility of more seasons to come.<br /><br />HOMELAND IS A MUST SEE FOR ANY OF THOSE INTERESTED IN THE MILITARY, INNER WORKINGS OF OUR GOVERNMENT SECURITY, INTELLIGENCE, OR ALL OF THE ABOVE!!!
0307943194|2.0|i have read almost every book this guy puts out, i have too, i just have too. that being said, i think book is the same formal as the others, just doesnt change that much, and it be completely honest- his last two books have dealt with young kids being injured or killed and that is just something i have no interesting in reading about. not that interesting.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Breaking Bad continues to be a hit with my college age son.  He watches the videos at his convenience (after studying, I hope).
B004EPYZSU|1.0|Should have known better but concept, \\"Cowboys and Aliens\\" interested. Have nothing good to say about this film. Script needed a severe edit/rewrite, very uneven pacing, Ford is just awlful, special effects nothing to write home about. So I suggest you forget this one and do not rent.
B003UESJJC|1.0|Great movie but I could not play it on my Oppo blu-ray player....and the Internet chat rooms are full of problems with this version. It simply won't play. Dec 2011
B0035G04TI|5.0|There are some books that are meant to be read by only folks who are married but this is for anyone and everyone.  It can also help you in business while dealing with with challenges with employees by knowing what's important to them.  A MUST READ.....  The author did an incredible job with this book.
B005MJ883K|4.0|Great fun toy that kids occupied for a long time.  The boy I gave it to couldn't put it down.
0446691437|5.0|For having a knowing, gnawing feeling that there is something you should be doing, contributing, creating and not being in that place yet. For all of the reasons we have for \\"why not\\" to do that thing. For any creative endeavor. For the procrastinator. You can read this book in an afternoon but it will forever be a reference for a creative life. 10 stars.
B003L77GRO|5.0|I had successfully not heard anything about the plot line of season 5 (since I do not own Showtime and rely on Amazon for supplying me with this show) and I am glad I did!  What I mean is that, with not knowing about anything after the season 4 finale (wow) I was left wondering what they would do with Dexter's character, and I was pleasantly surprised!  This is tied with season 1 for being my second favorite season of Dexter, with season 2 being the best so far, and I was glad to see that the writing, plot twists, suspense, and action on this show is not getting stale.  LONG LIVE DEXTER!!!
0762434279|5.0|There's a lot of power in simplicity.  The author has a gift of explaining complex subjects ina simple format where anyone can understand.  This is exactly what he did with this book.
B003NFM3JK|2.0|impressive special effects but i find the characters' look creepy---their eyes are weird and glass like--it has many nice things about it but i couldnt get over the look of the people. And why is Cratchit so short? some of the girls tower over him. My favorite is still George C Scott with the fabulous Edward Woodward.
B005SZNZAY|5.0|The title on the album says it all, some of his best work to date. Chris Cornell in his purist form.
B0015ABRE2|3.0|If you are a completist like I am, go ahead and watch it.  But if you aren't quite Obsessive Compulsive like the rest of us, then it will serve you well to skip over this season.  A well-known actor is brought into this season and gets to know Dexter very well, and all he does is make me wish that he would go back onto basic cable and off a great show like this!  Season 3 is by far the slowest and most drawn out of the first 5 seasons that I've seen, and there isn't as much hunting down and killing that makes Dexter suspenseful and riveting television.  It might sound sadistic of me to say, but it's really the truth behind the greatness of Dexter.  Don't let season 3 season taint your view on this series though, season 4 gets back to the Dexter we know and love, and season 5 hits a home run.  If you do decide to watch it though, hang in there!!!
0060763280|5.0|T. Harv Eker now only has a great name for an author but he also knows how to write a book. Excellent read.
B002BWP49C|3.0|Twilight: Breaking Dawn Part 1 is no doubt going to win Best Movie at the MTV Movie Awards but it's nothing too special. For one, cutting the last book down to 2 parts worked much better for Harry Potter since at least something happens in the first half of Deathly Hallows and there's action. Breaking Dawn is engaging in the second half of the book mostly. There's romance and drama in the first half but that's about it, just making the last one movie would have been better.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I purchased the Kindle fire lightweight microshell cover for my new Kindle fire to protect the face of it as it is small enough to fit in purse. Also I can see the pink color in my purse easier.  The Kindle fire snaps into the case quite tight so it is secure. I feel it is a must have item.
B0007TKNII|2.0|If you love Phantom of the Opera, then do yourself a favor and stay away from this retched movie!  Everything is pitch corrected, Gerard Butler is God-awful as the Phantom, the overall singing is bland, and the magic of the musical is nonexistent in this movie!  The only reason why I am giving this 2 stars instead of 1 is out of respect for the other outlets that got me familiar with Phantom.  Watch the 25th anniversary concert for the appropriate way to view this Phabulous musical.  If you haven't seen this already, skip over it and watch the concert version, you'll thank me in an alternate dimension where you regrettably viewed this pile of rubbish.
B003HE2B9E|5.0|I heard her song \\"Somebody Like You\\" on the radio and it reminded me of an old boyfriend - sounded like I could be singing it to him!!!!  But, her voice is wonderful.  I loved the song, her voice and the music.  There are other songs on the CD that I think will eventually be on the charts too.  I bought two CDs of her's through Amazon....best place to buy from and they are both very good.  She's got a voice that's very catchy.
B004USRKX8|3.0|As others have said, the music is 5 STARS!!!.  But, read the description fine print that says, \\"This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\\"  This item contains one audio CD, nothing else.  It is not remastered.  It is the original release of the CD, hence it's low price.  One would think that Amazon would correct this blatant error, especially after multiple comments about it.
B004QK5N5W|5.0|Purchased to connect my iPod to the television to stream movies and video to my TV screen. I find it to work simply and well. I would recommend this product to anyone who would like to do the same.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|After the crapshoot that was season 3 of Dexter, season 4 was a HUGE relief for me to watch!  This one gets the show back on track with introducing Jonathan Lithgow's character, and Dexter getting back to doing what he does best; being a vigilante serial killer!  After watching season 4 you will see why Michael C. Hall and Lithgow won Golden Globes for their performances.  This is a must see for new Dexter fans and is a great season to re-watch for the old!
B0055V6EZE|5.0|Love the cd.  Hugh Laurie's voice is a little strange and forced, but his love for the music comes through loud and clear.  My favorites on the album are Baby, Please make a Change with Tom Jones at his best, Laurie's fabulous St. James Infirmary, and Six Cold Feet.  It's a great collection for Blues/Boogie Woogie lovers.  Let Them Talk is so sweet, it almost makes you cry.  Can't wait for the next endeavor to come out. Lots of fun.
B001F12J48|2.0|Hi,  This is not looks like 3D Movie, Its looks like normal DVD.  I have 3d LED tv,I am not feeling the effect while watching the Movie.  Thanks,  Shiva
0307891372|5.0|This book has a lot of different reviews ranging from one star all the way to five. It was for that reason that I wasn't sure who to believe when it came to purchasing it. I couldn't find it in stores until just yesterday at a local gamestop who was recently restocked with them, and I finally got a chance to look through it myself.  So I'm going to go over some of the common issues with the strategy guide here (the paperback one).  First a foremost, the text really isn't that small. As a matter of fact, it's just as big as standard text on a computer screen and does not require a magnifying glass unless your vision is truly failing you that badly. And this is coming from someone with horrible vision. Even without my glasses on I can read the text just fine.  Spelling errors? I went through a few hundred pages here and there and didn't notice any. Even if I just missed them, it's all about the content anyways and this book is full of just that. Unless you're constantly searching for typos or even a bit of an incorrect statement (such as the 'daedric mace' being an axe in the game mistake), you won't be turned off by this.  Overhaul of unimportant information? This is a strategy guide, people. It's not a book on interesting facts you might or might not know. It's going to spent 200-300 pages detailing every quest in the game and quite a few others detailing every item in the game.  That information may not be important to you, but it is to someone who is trying to get every last bit of help from this guide that they can.  All in all, potential buyers, this book is great. It's a huge 600+ page book, and the people who complained about it are just nit-picking. There's a disclaimer at the back regarding any inaccuracies with the game. With a game as big as Skyrim, there's no way the author can get every thing right. Suck up the tiny negatives (if they even exist) and enjoy the unparalleled amount of content, some of which you won't be able to discover by yourself such asa hidden quest line.. ;D (\\"Fail, Sithis!\\")  Take my review to heart and get this book if you're interested. It'll be worth it.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I read the reviews, good and bad, and agree with the good reviews.  This cover is terrific (purchased via Amazon.com).  Lightweight, yet sturdy; perfectly formed to my Kindle Fire (which I also love) (purchased at Target), and it's still compact enough to fit in my Griffin Tablet case for 7\\" tablets (purchased at WalMart). Highly recommend all three!  [[ASIN:B005V2EVBQ Kindle Fire Lightweight MicroShell Folio Cover by Marware, Black]]  [[ASIN:B0051VVOB2 Kindle Fire, Full Color 7\\" Multi-touch Display, Wi-Fi]]
B000WC4A8O|5.0|I've got a Zepp junkie in the house, so it's a treat to find something cool to put under the tree each year for Christmas.  Last year it was a complete set of Houses of the Holy tab books.  This year it was your Mothership repro vinyl & the album cover will look GREAT framed & hanging in our music room.  Definitely the gift that keeps on giving!  Your product was in immaculate condition, shipped quickly & what a smooth & seamless transaction.  Thank you & will be shopping here again soon.  Rockin' in the ATL,  JC
B0063IH60K|3.0|I've been enjoying this game on my Kindle Fire for a week or so. It's simple and clear, and has a features to mix up play (draw 1 vs. draw 3, etc.) You get used to the ad popping up with each new draw. But what I find unacceptable is the random hijacking of my device to show a movie trailer for a violent movie.
B006O5XYWG|4.0|I have not watched this yet. However, I recall watching the original \\"Planet of the Apes\\" from 1968 and was struck by Jerry Goldsmith's virtuosic and profuse soundtrack, which bordered on the Avant-garde. The jarring orchestral cues seem to fill the entire last half of the film; perhaps that is why I loved it when I was a child. That, plus the iconic ending with Mr. Heston on his knees at the protruding remnant of Lady Liberty lamenting with his famous utterance. I am wondering if the score for this prequel was equally intense as that of the original, and whether it hearkens back to the original score in its prolixity. I will post a proper review after I actually view the flick. Consider this a 'preemptive review'. Please leave a comment here if you, too, were impressed by the music score of the very first \\"Apes\\" film. Gathering from the other reviews, I am going to hazard a guess that I will enjoy this film; so I have given it 4 preemptive stars, unilaterally. I hope \\"Rise\\" comes to my theater soon, since the last film I saw at our local digital cinema-house was \\"New Year's Eve\\", and I need to get the bad taste of that one out of my mouth...
B004EJUMT2|5.0|I hear musical bits and pieces of Megadeth, Mercyful, & Priest.  And some Randy Rhodes type power chords.  (I really don't hear that much BOC in here, as do many reviewers).  Throw in some silly satanism and gothic costumes for good measure.  Love it!!  Classic theatrical metal.<br /><br />Standout songs include: Con Clavi Con Dio; Ritual; Elizabeth; Stand By Him.  And the others are all at least decent.<br /><br />This album doesn't need to be taken that seriously - enjoy it for what it is, folks.  Buncha catchy 4 minute songs by dudes in costumes.  And that diminishes its quality not one iota.  Great job guys!
B003OETK32|5.0|I ordered 2 but only got one, and it arrived too late for me to mail it as the gift I intended it to be. So, I've kept it as a gift for myself which I will listen to on Christmas.   I'm sure I am going to love it.  Every time this lady works her craft I cry because I am touched so deeply by her depth of character and persistence that comes through everything she does, and I find it so refreshing and inspiring.
B0063IH60K|4.0|great game to pass the time away though I feel all rounds should be considered a random deal as opposed to being able to choose a winning one.
B001JIFYSA|5.0|This is one of my favorite Christmas movies, and one of my favorite movies all around. The movie revolves around several stories all interwomen, all related to love (in various forms). The acting is great. The cast is star studded and the stories are heart wrenching.  This idea has been copied several times since and will continue to be, but never as well.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|I purchased this product on Dec. 17 and it arrived Dec. 22, assembled it in about 5 minutes. Took it out to the shop along with an old coffee maker. Set up my bottle for the location of the cut. Set the cutter on its side so the bottle can rest on the lower guide and made a light score cut using only one turn of the bottle. Fired up the coffee pot with just water, poured the entire pot of hot water slowly over the score line. When the hot water was gone I quickly ran it under cold water on the score line and presto, a perfect break. The hot and cold water technique is the easiest for getting a smooth and great surface to finish up with sanding for use of the glass. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to cut bottles or jars, just remember to only make one pass and then use the hot and cold water method(very hot and very cold).
B0054JZC6E|4.0|there are lots of games to play and is very addicting. if there is a game you don't like there is always a new one. this app worked very well for me on the kindle fire. there are some ads but you can simply hit skip and they are gone.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Obstacle one: take 1,000+ book and attempt to squeeze it into one season of 10 50-minute episodes.  Obstacle two: introduce and create character development with a multitude of key players in the series (or until they die haha)  Obstacle three: seamlessly blend 4 'main' story lines   Really, no biggie there huh?  I have been an avid fan of this series since I was introduced in 2007, and HBO did a triumphant job in bringing this to the screen.  Sure, like any book adaption, there are bound to be differences.  Tyrion in my mind was a super ugly, plump, waddling mini-monster.  Well, I don't think anyone like that exists in real life, so take a brilliant actor who can still capture Tyrion's personality and I'm fine with that.  The Hound was a bit more burned and the Mountain a bit more...mountainy, but I still accept HBO's version.    Without diving into the story as I don't want to review that, I just wanted to express that from a fan of Double-R Martin's work, I was extremely happy with the result of season one.  Lastly, for all you complaining about the 'XXX'-ness of this series, don't watch it.  That is part of the GoT world.  If HBO decided to take that out you would end up with bombs like the most recent Conan movie.
B00371QQ0M|5.0|Frank Herbert's 1965 book, Dune, is a science fiction masterpiece. David Lynch's 1984 film, Dune, is one of those films I will watch again and again for as long as fossil fuels hold out. Oh, the irony. Like oil, the spice must flow! The remakes are nice, but I thought nothing could replace the classic David Lynch film--until it came out on Blu-ray. Watching Dune in 1080p is an experience for which it was worth waiting.
B000002UB2|5.0|I just received the vinyl record and it is in Amazing condition.It was shipped very fast by ups. Nice job.
B004LL1HM4|5.0|Album shipped in great condition and very quickly. I love this album and would highly recommend it. I can't stop listening!
0399250573|5.0|The book came on the earliest estimated date of arrival. It looks fantastic, and I can't wait to read it! Also, thanks for getting it to me in time for Christmas!
B000MQ54OO|5.0|I am sure this is movie is fine since I watched it in the theater...this copy was purchased for a Christmas present.
B005NPCJ88|5.0|i have known the guys, not personally but have chatted with them many times in their early days....remember myspace??? well, i got to know them as people and as artists. i've been to every concert they have had in Nashville and have also interacted with them at the hard rock and a local concert. anyway, OUTSTANDING people alone and their music is gritty, deep and true. sometimes the truth hurts, but oooh, it can feel so good. (hey guys, that could be your next album)<br /><br />i love the energy, lyrics and strength of this death metal band and i plan to for as long as they are making music.
B001B51B9M|5.0|This \\"Music Man\\" Blu ray is available on the Warner Bros. home video  web store for$10. I ordered it a few weeks ago,and it arrived within a week. Do not pay this outrageous price!
B0063IH60K|4.0|love it - good old fashioned mindless entertainment - fun fun fun - easy to play and gets addictive - especially when you need a break from angry birds
B0058VA2U4|5.0|this is a great cd if you like anthrax and i know i do and this is a really good buy they have some really hardcore heavy hitting songs on here but anthrax has always been heavy so if you like these guys then you need to buy this because its worth it i can promise u that
B005H5H3LW|2.0|When I first found out about a live action Japanese version of Starblazers last year I was thrilled, finally one of my favorite cartoons as a kid gets a movie version! Well having just watched the video I waited so long to become available in America, I have to say I am very disapointed. It only follows the basic plot slightly. Other reviews mentioned changes in characters genders and some slight differences in storyline. I found the whole movie to be changed for no perceivable benefit.<br />It was more like a Japanese melodrama set in space that slightly resembles the Starblazers plot. Yes it has the Argo (here rightfully called the Yamato) but with hardly any explanation about its technology or how it was built. The ship in the cartoon was a major draw as a kid, here it is merely transportation. They only fired the wave motion gun twice. Maybe three times if you count the ending depending on how you see it. The DVD itself was an OK transfer in picture quality with decent subtitles. The copy I purchased on Amazon had about 12 minutes of comercials and previews that could not be skipped or fast forwarded through at the start. Overall if your a fanboy you might be happy if you can overlook the differences. I found it to be a poor rendition of a childhood favorite. A ScyFy channel version at best (thats being very generous). Wait for your friend who's a devoted fan to buy it then you can borrow it. Unfortunately I'm that sucker.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I've been using the Amazon Appstore since the first day it was available, and I'm wondering now how I managed to miss Quell all this time??<br /><br />The game is as mesmerizing to listen to and look at as it is wonderful to play.<br /><br />A simple concept becomes deceptively difficult, at least to complete the levels in the target number of moves.<br /><br />It's pure simplicity in every aspect, but it just plain works.<br /><br />There's hundreds of reviews, so I'll keep mine short.  Great game.<br /><br />I'm playing it on a Kindle Fire, and even with the larger screen real estate it looks fantastic.
1401922414|5.0|I really love Louise L. Hay's calendar because her daily affirmations are positive and uplifting.  I looked for this calendar in several stores, but couldn't find it.  Purchasing on Amazon was so easy!  That's why I plan to do it again when I replace the calendar next year.
0743298020|5.0|This book engages one's interest. Enough clues are dropped to enable one to twist and turn & start to guess but the last several chapters are well done. The writing itself is superb and does not get in the way of the plot. Wish there was a \\"tidy\\" at the end about the narrator's coming to terms with her mother, but otherwise very satisfying.
B0063IH60K|4.0|fun and good interface. custom playing field and card backs is great. can't beat the price. I highly recommend this application.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|Great product and was just as it said.  Didn't have any problems with the disc it worked great!  Fast shipping with absolutely no hassles.
1416550550|5.0|Kate takes you by the hand and opens your mind's door to an enjoyable, mysterious journey.  I was upset at the father, for the way he revealed the secret, but this set the story.  I am looking forward to reading more of Kate Mortons books.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Excellent deal.  Fast Shipping.  Could not find a better deal locally.  This will keep the kids out of our hair so we can recover Christmas morning.
B00008FROP|5.0|Thank you soooo much!!  I was super excited to give this to my boyfriend for christmas and it came is super fast time and in great condition!!  Thank you again!
1451648537|5.0|I am very pleased with this book and whilst I live in UK I am on an extended holiday in Australia where you sent the book. The price of the book here is $45 but I got it from you with the postage for $27 a big saving thank you very much  Regards
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really like that when I have a difficult winning game I've tried again and again, I can go and see how it was played to win. I have this on my Kindle and I'm loving it.
1466401885|5.0|I started it this afternoon.  I just finished it at 2:20 AM.  Up until the last line of the last page I expected it to end in heartbreak.    The title is perfect.  The two of them *are* a beautiful disaster, and any one reading this story can only fear for their future.  But when it is only the two of them, at peace together - they are perfect.  I'm so glad I read this.
B004LP3AYI|3.0|I have not yet finished the book. But im about one hundred pages, and there are no indents. Its not too bad when your reading, but its kind of hard find your place if you get distracted or stop, and sometimes in dialog intense parts, you lose track of who is talking.
1466272708|5.0|If Bill Bryson and Paul Theroux had lived in the nineteenth century and collaborated on a 12 day hiking travelogue of the mountainous C&eacute;vennes region in south central France, the result might have resembled Robert Louis Stevenson's TRAVELS WITH A DONKEY. Stevenson's hilarious account of his laborious travails with his relentlessly stubborn and self-willed but completely lovable donkey, Modestine, is both laughable and utterly charming. His recounting of the preparation of his equipment, most notably his sleeping bag, in preparation for that 12 day 120 mile trek is absolutely fascinating, particularly for a fan of lightweight wilderness camping in all four seasons. His mellifluous and detailed description of the rugged and often barren local topography is clear and concise and his narratives of the history and the sociology of the region that he has chosen for his long distance walk are meshed absolutely seamlessly with the anecdotes of his interactions with the locals along the route. Highly recommended for readers that enjoy literature in the travel genre.<br /><br />Paul Weiss
B003XQPT9A|5.0|I must admit, after the Patrick Stewart \\"Christmas Carol\\" movie, this is my favorite. Michael Caine is terrific as Scrooge, and the songs are great. My kids love this movie, and it's not too scary for little kids. Highly recommended.
B005JZBP8W|5.0|I love this movie and the play it comes from. This version is re-done for BD. The color is beautiful and the audio is perfect. The special features about the mastering is very interesting and includes comparisons with the original film.
B003Y5H5AQ|4.0|Sorry if you've been hearing the word Epic alot but in this case it's warranted. The movie is good and had our family laughing and we also love the mini Christmas movie included.   What's not included? A disc for the digital copy. I am new to the Ultra Violet concept, and this was the first movie I purchased using this feature. I've purchased at least 16 movies with a digital copy in the past and transferring them was fast simple and easy never taking longer than 10 minutes from start to finish.   This wasn't and I am very computer literate and this UV thing had me, rather my computer confused. I have a brand new laptop and my internet is very fast. I started the download of the copy at 2am December 22, and here it is December 23rd at 1:51 and it still hasn't finished.   I hope Sony trashes this concept most people dislike it the other way was simpler and quicker.   Yet I'd buy the combo pack again.
B000069AUH|5.0|It took a little while to get here, mainly 2 and 1/2 weeks. Yet once it got here it was amazing. Im very happy with the quality
B005LNCMIE|1.0|I'm a regular Ultimate-Guitar.com reader, and for the last few weeks I've been ignoring everything the UG community has to say about this album. This is because, though I love the site, my opinion of most of UG readers (based on the content of comments of articles) is that they love to complain and bash on artists that really don't need/deserve heavy criticism, i.e. Nickelback, Justin Bieber, and the like. Artists that gain mass appeal because of their poppy tendencies are hated on UG for no other apparent reason than their successes relative to the failures of the 13 year-old Squier-wielding idiots that make up 95% of the UG community. So, when this same pattern started following Lulu, I immediately dismissed it, but didn't even care about listening to the album myself.  So I decided to take a listen to the album today because I was bored. Within the first 20 seconds of Brandenburg Gates, I was questioning whether I was listening to the right track. I must have picked up the wrong track, this must be a joke, something HAS TO be wrong, because this song is SO BAD. It's nonsensical poetry over top of repetitive Metallica riffs- for the whole album. And really, I'm not going to try to give you anymore explanation as to what I think of the album because there aren't any words to say what I think. I believe this is mainly because Lou Reed sapped all my creative energy to write some eloquent review, as well as my confidence in saying anything clever. \\"I dreamt of breezes going through the treeses\\"- how can I compete with such raw genius?  Die-hard Reed fans, I'm sorry to offend you. To any casual listener though- get a good laugh from this and then move on.
B005KJZDXK|5.0|This has become one of our favorite Christmas Albums!  Its an easy listening recording.  Zoey has a beautiful voice.  Should be in everyone's collection.
B004EPZ07U|3.0|The Green Lantern movie is pretty good. What I didn't like so much is downloading the UltraViolet digital copy. You've to install Flixter to your computer to able to download the movie and with restrictions. They should put a digital copy disc with a code to access the disc instead of downloading.
B005WY8YZW|5.0|This new release by Puscifer is AWESOME! We also saw him in concert and what a great show.  Highly recommend!
B003L77GG0|1.0|This final season I place in the worst season in the ten year history of the series. If I had seen this series on television I would not have purchased the box set.
B005BCE7FQ|5.0|Rio is a very nice animated movie to add to your collection. In Blu-ray the animation looks beautiful and in 3D it is awesome! I highly recommend it. Shipping was a breeze through Amazon.
B005XN3150|4.0|(I like the twist in the story, it is getting better and better with each episode. The more I watch the more I like it. What is great about this show, is that the story can't be great, but the true is that it is very engaging, but the casting was excellent. They couldn't choose better actors for this show. I love Snow White new twist, from fragile damsel in distress to lady Robin Hood at times. Of course what else to expect from a run away girl that is living now in the forest with 7 strangers, delightful. And Rumpelstiltskin, the actor is amazing, just he alone make the show worth watching for me.)<br /><br />I am revising my review and my ratings  as I watch the show, I still like the show, but damn what is going on with the female good characters in this show, are they that naive. They just let everybody tell them what to do and walk all over them, no character at all, it feels like a cheap soap-opera sometimes. The Sheriff, Snow white, and all the others ladies are just a bunch of weak female characters. I am admiring the Mayor over the others. It is getting a little bit masochistic, really.<br /><br />Update: My review for now is a 3.5, I totally love the history of Red Ridding Hood and the last episode was also really good. So I feel a little bit more satisfy with the female characters, they were starting to annoy me with their lack of decision. In the other hand, Charming well... oahh.. he is not really the guy to look for when you are in trouble, the Genie seems to show more blind passion and love to the Mayor/Evil Queen, before and after the events that change them all than what Charming does for Snow, but it is how he is been play. His lack of memory seems to go together with his lack of decision.
B004XWLN20|5.0|I came a little late to the Smallville universe, but after watching Season 6 episode \\"Combat\\" I was hooked. I quickly backtracked through the previous 5 seasons and remained a steadfast viewer right through to the magnificent end. Smallville was a show that could make a non- Superman fan(me)watch a show about a boy becoming Superman. It was filled with beautiful scenery, stories, relationships and people, all of which were grounded in a reality seldom seen in a sci-fi show. How lovely that the product issued to celebrate such a milestone would be as great. The packaging is sturdy, befitting a Superman saga, with gorgeous pictures throughout, as is the episode guide booklet. The Daily Planet newspaper is a nice touch as well as is the Aquaman pilot with Justin Hartley. I could have done without the Superboy extra and the DC Secret Origins, but that's just me. My favorite extras by far were the Comicon and Paley interviews and the season by season retrospectives. Just like in the series there were some misses,(no commentary with Tom and Erica,still no gag reel) as well as hits. All in all this compilation is a great tribute to a great show.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Avatar is a must-have in your collection. This movie in Blu-ray looks fantastic. Excellent service and packaging through AMAZON. I recommend this movie if you like real-looking animation.
1594744769|3.0|I enjoyed this novel; I understand that it's geared towards a younger audience so it's rather simple and at times lacks development, but it was a fun, fast read. What I am curious about is the fact that it ends so.... poorly (in my opinion). When I say this, I say it because I feel that the ending is very abrupt and doesn't give any closure. I set this novel down and all I could think was, \\"Is that it?\\" Perhaps I am being hasty in my review; perhaps this book IS intended to be followed by another. But if not: Horrible ending!
B000001FDK|5.0|We purchased this original soundtrack for our 9 year old grandson who is performing in the Grease school play.  Being such an old CD we did not expect much, however, when we listened to the music we were totally surprised with the quality of sound.  For those wanting to relive the original motion picture and like to have a great encounter with it I recommend purchasing the CD.  It is inexpensive, it was shipped quite fast and the supplier was very reliable.
B004EBT5CU|1.0|I just don't like this woman's voice. I find it very irritating, which is why I find it hard to listen to this album again - let alone enjoy it. Yes, her voice light years ahead of the rest (i.e. Spears, Beyonce, Rhianna, Katy Perry, etc.) but, that's different. None of them can sing for crap. This girl's songs are ok but, the voice just irritates me. Amy Winehouse really had a soulful voice unlike this girl.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Excellent album, one of the best of her. INCREDIBLE MUSIC, Britney is the best. Excelente album de Britney Spears. Excelentes condiciones.
B000I0QL82|1.0|I hadn't watched the movies \\"Holiday Inn\\" or \\"White Christmas\\" for years. So I just bought the two of them on DVD.  \\"White Christmas\\" is always billed as a sort-of remake of the black & white \\"Holiday Inn\\".  I just watched the two of them, back to back. Overall, I liked \\"Holiday Inn\\" better, except for one glaring fault, which I'll get into later.<br /><br />First off, I love dancing, and Fred Astaire is so fantastic, that he really makes the movie for me. The storyline is fun. Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire have a dinner show act, along with a woman, that features singing (Bing) and dancing (Fred), the woman being their partner in each. Bing gets tired of life on the road and buys a run-down resort that he calls the Holiday Inn, because he only has big shows on the holidays.  The fellows have a running rivalry when it comes to women, and Astaire is pretty funny with his over-the-top confidence that he can get anyone he wants.<br /><br />At one part of the movie, it shows a number from each show as the year proceeds. There's Christmas, of course, and Valentines Day and then there's Abraham Lincoln's birthday. (This was before Lincoln and Washington were combined into President's Day.)  For this number, all the Caucasian dancers and singers are in blackface with stereotypical hairstyles and mannerisms. The song is a celebration of Abraham Lincoln freeing the slaves.  The times, they are a'changing, and I was very uncomfortable with the black face number, particularly the mannerisms. The feeling affected my opinion of the whole movie. If they would release the movie with that holiday scene/dance cut out, \\"Holiday Inn\\" would get five stars from me. (And I think \\"White Christmas\\" is four stars.)<br /><br />I gave my DVD away.<br /><br />EDITED TO ADD: I have obviously struck a nerve, given the comments I've gotten. But though people can certainly disagree with me, they are ignoring one point. I hadn't seen the movie for years and didn't remember it - I just thought, \\"Oh, a classic Christmas movie, let's get it\\". If I had remembered the blackface number, I wouldn't have purchased the movie. If the blackface number, for whatever reason, doesn't bother a buyer, then it isn't a problem. But a person like me, who doesn't appreciate the number, can be told about it in advance, and save some money.<br /><br />Happy Readerget it\\".

0439023521|5.0|This book was recommended to me and I am grateful that I took this suggestion. The Hunger Games immediately interested me, I was engrossed and I couldn't put it down. The story of Katniss and her death defying trials and her frank views made me root for her. The people that love her and root for her make her more sympathetic and made me love her also.  I recommend this book and the remaining two books in this series to everyone I know.
0307454541|4.0|Loved it!  I was promptly encouraged to get the other two books in the series (got 'em for Christmas ... but WOULD'VE bought them) and to see the movie.
B005J29HCQ|4.0|I guess I'll say that this review - like the original \\"album\\" - is also a work-in-progress. Gotta put more thought to it. Anyway, my gut feeling, my disappointment, is in the discovery that nowhere on the two discs is anything resembling an *album*.<br /><br />I realize that the bigger box set probably has such a feature (got to research that) but without it, we have an extended version of the 1993 boxed set entries.<br /><br />Disc One is jacketed with what appears to be the original front and back artwork and songlist. But...no. Then I looked deeper (without the help of an electron microscope) and read what appears to be the (original?) disclaimer, to refer to the actual record for the real lineup. But it relates to nothing more than a mix of songtitles.<br /><br />Highlights for this \\"casual +\\" fan: the many segments of \\"Heroes and Villians\\", \\"Wind Chimes\\"..any pressing of the tracks from the sessions which made it to the light of day, way back when.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Awesome app.  Has brought hours of enjoyment.  Well worth the 99 cent.  My 7 year old nephew played this game for an hour straight without any complaints (hard task for him) . Get the app if you haven't already!!!
B001TKK3O8|1.0|What starts off as a decent legal thriller with all Anthony Hopkins has to offer being portrayed on screen outsmarting an idiot of a prosecutor ends in the most unsatisfying way imaginable. Everything works exactly as Hopkins plans, until the mind-bogglingly bad ending that fails on a multitude of levels. First of all, the \\"evidence\\" the prosecutor obtains would never, ever, EVER be allowed in court. It would be so illegal as to make Hopkins look even more not guilty with a simple denial that the prosecutor is correct at such a useless and circumstantial claim. The prosecutor, in a frenzy of idiocy, visits Hopkins in his own home (this alone is bad enough, but it gets far worse) for a confession. Not only is what Hopkins' alleged slip-up not admissible in court in any form, but what he forces from him for a crime *that he did not commit* is a public confession out of nothing but boasting, but even then, the hero would lose here in the real world. The prosecutor does absolutely nothing for his case the entire way through, and the legal system is shot in the head just as badly as the victim in the whole case. Basic legal rules are completely ignored, the \\"twist\\" ending is insensible, stupid, and impossible, and everything is just ruined completely by it. Hopkins would win this if the movie played by the rules, but it doesn't when it means the most, making the whole thing totally pointless.  To make everything infinitely worse, the Double Jeopardy rule that Hopkins takes advantage of is not disproven like the prosecutor says. Hero Prosecutor gets around the Double Jeopardy rule with a charge that would never hold up, because the fact is, he didn't do what the prosecutor said he did. He did not directly cause his wife's death, so everything used to charge him with murder is simply false. He's charged with one thing, found innocent, and then the prosecutor \\"turns the tables\\" and finds him guilty of a more serious crime--one he actually didn't do, so he could get around the Double Jeopardy rule.  It gets even worse. The Double Jeopardy rule isn't even used correctly here. Double Jeopardy doesn't simply mean you can't be charged for the same crime twice. The twist here is that Hopkins is charged and tried with one thing, and then again with another. But the two crimes he's charged with could not be treated as separate crimes, even if it were the case that he were guilty of the second that he gets caught on.  And yes, it gets even worse than that. When Hopkins' wife ultimately dies, it's *through legal means*. This is where everything falls so far apart, the title starts to make sense in the context of the story. When he's doing his thing, what he's doing is legal. He has legal free reign over whether or not they maintain life support. He didn't do anything illegal when he asks them to pull the plug. There is no murder charge possible here. He has every right to do what he did, whether or not people agree with it. No illegal action was taking place--Hopkins, at that point, is a free man, with no charges against him. Just because he tells a doctor to pull the plug on his wife doesn't make him a murderer in any way. He did not cause her death, and even if he did, it was legal. It's not like he snuck into the hospital and shot her again. All he did was fill out a form and make a formal request. That's legal. There is no possible murder charge like the film uses to throw him off his guard, since he didn't murder his wife. Period.  So, unless legal thrillers with no sense or basis in reality interest you, this just isn't worth it. Maybe catch it on TV just to watch Hopkins look smug, but don't bother even renting it. It's just too out-of-touch with reality to be worth anything meaningful.  Extremely disappointing conclusion to an otherwise decent legal thriller.
B005ARYEY6|5.0|Love each cd have been listening to exclusively for the past week. The dvd is good too. Great gift for a friend or family member who is a Miles fan. This set definitely belongs in every Miles fans collection.
B000VI6T6U|5.0|Jimi Hendrix at Monterey was a historic performance.  You will experience more than enjoyment and appreciation when watching his act at the Monterey Pop Festival, you will be amazed.  You will see Jimi play with the guitar behind his head, behind his back, and between his legs.  He does all this without missing a beat.  He was a master of his instrument.  His performance is full of energy.  At the beginning and end of the disk are moderately sized documentaries that describe Jimi's career and the creation of the Monterey Pop Festival.  Both stories are impressive. I believe you will be educated, entertained, and amazed by this excellent combination of music and history.  You will learn a bit about the world of music in the year 1966, when the Beatles, the Mama's and the Papa's, the Rolling Stones were all newly established and wanting to help the new talent, Jimi Hendrix.
B003WTE886|5.0|I purchased a used \\"Speak Now\\" album and am very satisfied with the purchase.  Got a really good price and have added it to my I-Tunes Library.
B005DMNS4A|5.0|I hesitated for some time before buying this newest CD version of what is perhaps one of the most sophisticated rock and roll records ever made.  The only other version I have is the original--and I mean the original--LP pressing.  Yes, I'm that old, and yes, I bought QUADROPHENIA the first week it was released; I was 20 years old, and blown away.  WHO'S NEXT was a hard act to follow, but QUADROPHENIA was the Who's crowning achievement.  I really don't get the extreme negativity here; this release's mix sounds much the same as my original LP, only clearer.  The vocals were muddy on my original album, and they're much improved here; the sound is also crisper.  All of the sound fx (yes, the seal barks on \\"Dirty Jobs\\") are here.  It would have been nice to have the entire original 2 albums on a single CD--and time-wise, that appears to be do-able--but who really cares?  Put both of 'em on your changer, pour a beer (or whatever your pleasure), and enjoy.  The orignal LP's were awkward too:  sides 1 and 4 backed on one, sides 2 and 3 backed on the other, so that they could stack up on your turntable.  The Townsend demos are also fascinating, and not just padding.  In their own way, they're almost as entertaining as the Who's versions.  They add more evidence of Townsend's musical genius.  And what if there are a few minor changes from the original in this new Townsend mix?  Even Shakespeare revised, and often it was an improvement on his original.  So, if you're also from \\"my generation\\"--the folks who loved the Who before they became \\"classic rock\\"--I'm pretty confident you'll be pleased with this 2-CD \\"Deluxe Edition\\" release.  Don't let the neo-purist reviews scare you off. QUADROPHENIA is so great, it often brings tears to my eyes, and not just of nostalgia.
B005K2XM94|3.0|I work in rugged conditions and needed something to keep my new Fire safe on the job.  The Timbuk2 envelope sleeve does that pretty well for a soft case, but it's inconvenient to keep taking it out and putting it back in the envelope with the heavy duty velcro closure.  I usually use these sleeve style holders for laptops and little tablets, but have always had either magnetic or tuck \\"friction\\" type closures.  4 stars for the product over all, minus one for the closure.
B005DC68NI|5.0|This is a fabulous book. Packed with information. My only regret is that I didn't find it six months ago! If you're thinking about going indy, if you want to know more about the e-book revolution, this is the book for you. Heck, even the people at Amazon (including Jeff Bezos) should read it. This is an easy-to-read, informative, thought-provoking book, written by a very intelligent man.
B005IZLPMY|4.0|The movie was better than I anticipated. Watched for family movie night and very pleased. Just the right amount of humpf for adults and tweeners.
B005UKJX4E|5.0|I was worried I would find the movie overly pretentious and dull, but thankfully that turned out to not be the case. The depiction of the '50s suburban family was intimately rendered, beautiful and sad, while the cosmic scenes were so well-done that I never lost interest. A great film to watch, and even though I'm sure a lot of the symbolism I'm sure went over my head, it was still worthwhile to watch. It's OK for a movie to keep some distance, after all the movie seemed to intend to portray a God-like view.
B000001FSU|5.0|I used to wake up with this album when I was a teenager. My stereo had an alarm clock function and for at least one year, the first sounds I heard in the morning where the cello intro of \\"Be All, End All\\". To this day, 'State of Euphoria' is one of my all-time favorite metal albums. Also, because it includes the song 'Antisocial', a classic heavy metal hymn.

B004L3AR0K|5.0|I purchased this DVD from Avalon AFTER I had watched the film on TV, because the movie contains exceptional, believable performances, bright, often funny, dialogue, and a perhaps unanticipated emotional validity of what true love can bring to life and living, that I wanted to have available; a valued renewable asset.  Oh, it's funny and sexy and realistic, but the two principal actors, regardless of their comedic skills, also offer a depth and emotional content beyond their early, outwardly \\"easy\\" tone. Perhaps it helps, as I have experienced, that beside those glib jabs at love and/or marriage that we often accept only too easily, this story can suggest how real love can surprisingly redeem your entire sense of life's fundamental rewarding possibilities.

B0052VUNHC|4.0|BRIEF SUMMARY<br />Abby is starting college at Eastern University. She hopes to blend in and leave her home town life behind and start new. Unfortunately, that all went out the window when she meets Travis, Eastern University's bad boy.<br /><br />THOUGHT<br />There were so many stages of emotions and thoughts that went through my head while reading this book. I think this story should have been called Beautiful Dysfunctional Disaster.  It basically boils down to you either love this book or hate it. I think what the author did with this story shows that every detail was well thought out, and I applaud the author for pushing her creativity and daring herself to go to the extreme with this book as well with the characters.<br /><br />This book was one that got better as the story progress into each chapter. Meeting Abby, I thought of her as a mature nineteen year old at times, as she was witty and funny, while at other moments you remembered how young she really was. Travis, wow, he seems A.D.D. He was so vulnerable and seems broken at times around Abby; it was crazy that he seems like a walking time bomb. The one person that made him feel balanced was Abby. They were both each others drug of choice for relief. Though some readers think he was violent and found him disturbing, I understood what the author was trying to convey to the reader, showing us who he is and why he acts the way he does throughout the story.  Along with the other adjectives I used to described Travis, I also found him to be insane, obsessive, and paranoid, and if the author made him any other way, the finished product would turn out differently.  I felt as though the main characters of this story were Abby, Travis and their relationship. The relationship definitely was engaging and dysfunctional at times, but it's what kept me going in this story. I also have to admit I found the start to be ok, but it really pick up for me when Parker entered the pictured.<br /><br />The other characters of this story did not disappoint. I really enjoyed getting to know Travis's family. All those yummy brothers should not go to waste. The other main characters were America, Abby's best friend and Shepley, Travis' cousin.  They definitely add a lot to the story. My only disappointment was that I would have really liked a chapter devoted to them, because I really wanted to see how they met each other, though it was told briefly. I found their relationship interesting as well.<br /><br />While reading this story, again, at times I forget how young the characters were, because this is not your typical YA, and I love that. That is how involved I was with the story as I am reading along. Plus, majority rules, showing the many readers that are in love with this story.<br /><br />RNJ Rating<br />Storyline: GOOD<br />Intimacy: GOOD for a YA<br />Enjoyment: GOOD<br /><br />Romance Novel Junkiesenjoyed getting to know Travis's family.

B004LWZVZC|5.0|[[ASIN:B004LWZVZC The Conspirator (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]]  I purchased this DVD of The Conspirator, and have now seen it three or four times. It is a Historic, True account of what was behind the assination of President Lincoln. The fact that Mary Surrett was not proven guilty, in a Prejudice Court and Environment. The Constitution totally ignored by all those of the Prosecution, the fact that she was guilty before even being tried in a Military Court and not one by her Peers. The Secretary of War only interested in seeing someone \\"pay\\" for Lincoln's assination, innocent or guilty, man or woman. Others involved in the Conspiracy lied in court, or was not apprehended and got off scott free.  The DVD arrived in very good condition and well packed. Very good job, for the wrapping, sending and condition of items bought, is very important for the consumer. Thank you. I would recommend this movie to anyone who finds interest in our Country's history.<br />Also, the true feelings of the Americans, both North and South towards one another. Much hurt, pain and grief from all. For the North continued for several decades to punish those who were on the Confederate side of the boundries of this country. They were even denied to have equal representation or anyone representing them in our National Government-Congress or House of Representatives, for a long time after the war ended.<br /><br />Abraham Lincoln knew the feelings and pain of the Northern and Southern people towards one another. He \\"did not\\" want the South punished for \\"any reason\\" after the war ended. He just wanted our country to be reunited, be civil and sypathtic to one another, so as to heal all the wounds from this horrible war. His full intentions was to reunify the United States of America. This is what he was fighting for. To once again see America reunited. But sadly it didn't happen that way, due to his death. This is quite evident and reveals it so much in this movie.<br />A movie that every school child should see, or even adults, for it is a very sad part of our American Heritage and History. But the TRUTH, it reveals.<br /><br />Thank you to Robert Redford for bringing this very factual, moving, emotional and Historical movie for all Americans to see and experience. A great job very well done.<br /><br />I wonder if someday, someone like Mr. Redford, will make a historical movie, based entirely on facts, the truth of the John F. Kennedy Assination? Yes it is out there. For even today they (experts in many different fields) are still researching and revealing what took place. I will never live to see it, but maybe someday the whole truth will come out for Americans to know the Conspiracy that enveloped his murder. LBJ had much to gain by getting rid of the Kennedy Brothers, and he managed it, all within his term as Vice President (to become the new President of the USA) and President then for a second term of office. Also, the murder of Martin Luther King. How many died because of his Greed and Lust for Power and Money.e, or even adults, for it is a very sad part of our American Heritage and History.

0141195851|3.0|As far as the content in this book, it is fantastic - Dickens work easily earns fives stars.  This review is mainly on the book itself. I have five of these style of books from \\"Penguin Classics\\" and, although beautiful, I do wonder what they will look like in five years and after a few handlings by friends or family. Of the two I have read so far, the ink designs are starting to rub off slightly in some places. With some hardbacks, the ink is pressed at least a bit into the hard cover. With these books, it is just printed directly onto the clothe.  I have some leather bound books and so I do know how take care of my books. Perhaps the covers could have worn some will carrying in my bag. I am not sure, but my advice is to just be cautious to protect the covers if you choose these hardback editions of the classics.

0312944926|4.0|well first off i read the book like 5 years ago so it's kind of vague now. but i'm pretty sure i enjoyed the book and thought it was quite good. it introduced some of basic concepts of cryptography and the way Dan Brown put it in there was really easy to understand and i didn't get bored. also i really liked the final cipher they tried to break towards the end of the book. i'm not an expert in cryptography but i think any author who isn't personally a cryptographer can come up with a cipher like that is very impressive already and Dan Brown actually made the whole solving process interesting to read. so yeah, i think he did well on the scientific aspect.  the romance, however, i have to say it was one of those typical plots where one of the lovers got into trouble and the other one was also somehow involved in the same issue and eventually they solved the problem together. so yeah it wasn't very authentic but to be fair it wasn't as boring as i made it sound like (personal opinion) maybe it's because i actually liked Susan so i found everything that she was involved with interesting :) and i think it's only fair to give Dan Brown some credits for creating lovable characters and making an ordinary book almost exciting~  about the plot, well, personally i don't like the ending. the ending in itself is okay, but the way Dan Brown wrote it just didn't make much sense to me. it's been 5 years and i still don't get how Strathmore would do something so terrible to someone he loved. nevertheless, i think the outcome would've made sense if Dan Brown elaborated more on Strathmore's motivations.   anyways, i enjoyed reading the story and would reread it again in the future if i have the time for it. recommend to those who like something exciting and (a little) educational but not necessarily original  :)
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I couldn't stop reading this book, between waiting in airports, then a flight to Beijing and a flight cancellation there I finished this book in basically one sitting.

1439170916|5.0|It's one thing to write an exciting novel; it's quite another to write nonfiction in a captivating way. From its conception to its execution, The Emperor of All Maladies is brilliant. It is a valid wholly comprehensive look at the history and significance of cancer in its many forms. The subtitle, \\"A Biography of Cancer\\", provides a unique frame of reference, showing that cancer is something we have historically lived with, not avoided or conquered. Although a few Mr. Mukherjee's attempts at being clever miss the mark, most of them succeed at brightening up what could have been a clinically cold look at cancer. And, naturally, not every chapter is equally gripping or important. Most fascinating for me was the medical acceleration that occurred in the last 150ish years, as surgery, radiation and chemotherapy all come together from different oncological angles to form the modern course of treatment. I can see why this masterpiece won the Pulitzer Prize.
006056251X|5.0|Reviewed at Another Look Book Reviews<br /><br />According to Goodreads, Devil in Winter is Lisa Kleypas' most popular book. Oh yes, that is a very accurate assessment. Devil in Winter was a fabulous historical romance. It is the 3rd book in the Wallflower series. I had not read the two previous books, Secrets of a Summer Night or It Happened One Autumn but you can bet that I will be reading them soon.<br /><br />I don't like reading books out of order but I had a gift card and out of the Wallflower series, Devil In Winter was the one I wanted to read the most. It can be read as a stand alone but I really felt I missed excellent points and story plots from the previous book, It Happened One Autumn. It appears that Sebastian was a main carry over cast member and his actions in It Happened One Autumn is what sets the main stage in Devil in Winter.<br /><br />Sebastian is a rake of all roguish rakes. He is selfish, sarcastic and even a bit witty. Now although he held those less than satisfactory qualities, I found the smile he put on my face with his comments, allowed me to forgive him a bit more than I probably should. Of course, not having read, It Happened One Autumn my view may have been different.<br /><br />Evie is a red headed wallflower and by all accounts she seems to be the most shy of her group of friends. The reason I chose to select the graphic at the top is because that is exactly how I pictured her. I thought it was a near perfect representation of what I imaged. I love when the cover art matches the characters closely.<br /><br />From a personality perspective, I liked Evie. Women of the time (London 1843) rarely had opportunities to make life decisions for themselves. Evie concocted a plan and as outrageous as it was, it was a means to an end. It was rather brilliant if not desperate.<br /><br />Devil in Winter will go down as the best loss of virginity scene. It was emotionally charged and moving. I loved it. It was right then that I fell for Lord St. Vincent. It was also then that Sebastian fell for Evie too.<br /><br />I think it would be hard to redeem a character from a previous book that was not well liked. Sebastian did a nasty action in It Happened One Autumn that shouldn't be easily forgiven. I totally love that Lisa Kleypas didn't take the normal easy route and give Sebastian a wicked abusive up-bringing to explain his behaviour. Sure he had some sad moments but he was spoiled as he admitted and instead of harbouring on why his character was rakish, the story more focused on his changing behaviour. I really liked that. I also liked that it wasn't just an overnight change but rather a gradual change.<br /><br />A couple of things that I think Devil in Winter did miss out on. I thought there would be more attempts  from Evie's wicked family to abduct her.  I just really wanted them to really pay for what they did to her. Also, I was curious why there was no lawyer or will reading ceremony. Maybe because it was not needed since all was left to Evie by her father but for some reason, I felt it was missing. Also, it didn't really feel winter out to me. It was a cold carriage ride back from Scotland but that was about it for the winter season.<br /><br />Evie was the best thing to happen to Sebastian and visa-versa. They were perfect for each other's souls. They didn't intend it go that way but I loved how hard their feelings hit each other. What a pleasure Devil in Winter was to read!<br /><br />Teasers: hot brick for carriage ride, an early Cam from Mine Till Midnight was in the book a lot (squee), flirtatious billiard game,  emotional shaving sceneie too.

B0067QPVJ6|1.0|Is it a prequel?  Is it sequel? Is it good story telling?  The answer to all these questions is no!  All this movie is is a forgettable pile of poo.....  Spend your money on something else; don't reward Hollywood by giving them your hard earned money -- because they certainly did not work hard on this generic mess.<br /><br />John Carpenter's The Thing--his 1982 Antarctic update of a 1951 B movie about an alien organism on a rampage at a remote Arctic outpost--was one of the best horror movies ever made. It was a seamless work of dread-inducing art that boasted a brooding score by Ennio Morricone, dazzlingly gruesome special makeup-FX by Rob Bottin, and star Kurt Russell, who was still basking in the year-old glow of his spot-on portrayal of antihero Snake Plissken in Carpenter's equally awesome Escape From New York.<br /><br />In short, The Thing was the type of rare Hollywood release that made you proud to be a horror freak.<br /><br />Unlike this lousy Thing.<br /><br />A prequel to Carpenter's cult classic by Dutch commercial director Matthijs van Heijningen Jr.--don't worry, there's no point memorizing the spelling--it opens with a trio of Norwegian researchers in the Antarctic discovering a spaceship buried in the ice, the frozen corpse of an alien being nearby. Realizing the colossal import of their find, they haul the body back to the outpost in a huge ice cube and use a drill to awkwardly extract a tissue sample. Forgetting that ice melts, they then go party. While they're dancing the Norwegian jig, their prize springs to life, resembling a gooey, spider-crab thingie with flailing octopus arms. After 100,000 years of slumber, it's understandably cranky.<br /><br />The alien is able to replicate human DNA and mimic bodies, so the rest of the film sees it repeatedly bursting from the flesh of folks, making screechy noises while morphing into variations of the gooey spider-crab thingie and getting toasted with flamethrowers, which causes more screeching.<br /><br />And that's basically it. Since Heijningen already had dibs on The Thing's hallowed name, he didn't even bother trying to conjure any of its slow-burning suspense or claustrophobic vibe, instead just blowing his creative wad on gross-out CGI effects, like the one where a vagina with teeth attacks.<br /><br />Of course an American audience wouldn't be trusted to maintain interest in a Norwegian-camp prequel composed entirely of Norwegians speaking subtitled Norwegian. So we have four Americans, an Englishman, a French woman, and a bunch of indistinct Norwegians, most of whom obligingly speak fluent English. One of the Americans is Mary Elizabeth Winstead as a paleonthologist recruited to have a look at the Thing discovered buried in the ice. Winstead isn't a bad actress (she was a delight in Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World), and at 26 she could plausibly be a college graduate and practicing scientist herself, but the problem is she doesn't look it. Like many another actress these days, she looks far younger than her years. She doesn't get to do much science-y stuff anyway, though she does figure out that the Thing can't replicate inorganic material, so anyone without fillings in his teeth is suspect. (I'm guessing she means it can't imitate anything bioinorganic, but the producers may have feared such a word would confuse the same stupes who were assumed to need Americans in a Norwegian story.) So we get several scenes with characters yelling at each other to open their mouths.<br /><br />Look at the 1982 Thing again and you see a perfect thunderstorm of paranoia and suspense, brewed up by the clash of the cold front of director John Carpenter's cool-cucumber style (the camera almost never moves, and it stares objectively at the characters much as a Thing would) and the warm front of Rob Bottin's excitable-boy, sugar-fueled metamorphosis sequences, where chaos reigns. Director Matthijs van Heijningen, a fan of the Carpenter film, gets the externals but can't duplicate the authentic chill and isolation of the original. (In some scenes, too, the steam wafting out of characters' mouths in the cold air seems real, while in others it seems digitally pasted in. It's distracting.) He isn't free to bring anything of his own, either; he's got prequel-cuffs around his wrists, locked into the look of the '82 film, and its denouement, too. We know this film has to end with a Norwegian attempting to kill the Thing before it reaches another camp, and we assume everyone else will die.<br /><br />The only THING here is the pile of poo left behind by Matthijs van Heijningen.te the authentic chill and isolation of the original.

B006FLGBGA|2.0|Although, these type of film is really not my genre I was curious, because I love Dystopian Film and literature, I have seen the cheesy originals with Heston and the newer film from a few years back, which was G_D awful.<br />As far as this film goes? well I love the evolution of the ape and the picture used on the promo poster, other than that? well... unfortunately 100+ minutes of my life I will never get back....

0385737424|5.0|I'm so thrilled about the release of Rebecca Stead's new novel, When You Reach Me. This enchanting tale of 1970s New York City is nearly undescribable for fear of giving away too much delightful information. Here's what I can say: the story starts with a note from an unknown subject, which mostly terrifies Miranda and her mother. Recently shunned by her friend and neighbor Sal - the boy she's grown to know almost like a brother - Miranda is also dealing with the ramifications of being the poor kid at a school full of privileged students. It frequently references an unnamed classic of children's literature (I'd hate tell you which one and ruin the fun of figuring it out). It has so much to say about what we think we know about the people around us - and even more about the mysteries of the human experience. When You Reach Me is a wonderful, funny, and poignant story of love, friendship, family, and some other things I simply can't tell you about. It is, however, a book you won't be able to put down, even once you've finished.
B00005JLIU|4.0|No, I'm not really big on musicals, but I watched this for the first time decades after its original release, and got caught up in the quirkiness.  This is a cute and fun experience with Julie Andrews almost not needing a supporting cast, but has a fine one here that could star as well.
0547258305|5.0|In Katsa's world, some people are born with a Grace. Katsa is one of those people, bearing the Graceling's mark of different colored eyes: one green, one blue. Her Grace is the ability to kill, and her uncle the king uses this to his full advantage. But Katsa has a mind to change things. With a few nobles, including her cousin, the heir to the throne, she forms the Council, who essentially run counter missions, undoing the wrongs done in the seven kingdoms by wayward rulers. It is through this council that Katsa meets Po, a Graceling prince from the most remote of the kingdoms who is in search of his grandfather, who was kidnapped, and is incidentally the same person Katsa was sent to rescue. Po is the only person Katsa has ever met who can even start to match her strength in fighting, and soon they find themselves together on a journey to unravel the mystery of why Po's grandfather was kinapped and to right one of the most appalling wrongs Katsa has encountered. In this debut novel, Kristin Cashore brings us into her charming world as seamlessly as possible. Her characters are sympathetic and multi-dimensional, and their stories are engaging from page one. Graceling is an adventure, rich with action and enchantment, and an ever so slight bit of romance. A mystery to the very end, it also has a refreshing feminist voice that doesn't leave a bitter aftertaste. Cashore's is a novel you won't want to put down.

0802798233|5.0|I don't know why I put off reading this for so long. It's easily one of the best teen romances I've come across, taking place outside Chicago, in a racially-divided high school setting with which many teens are familliar. Told from two points of view -- that of Queen Bee Brittany and Latin Blood gang member, Alex -- two teens are forced to be chemistry partners, despite their apparent dislike for each other. But what they don't know is that neither of them is hiding their true identity from the public. At home, Brittany struggles to take care of her older sister, Shelly, who is confined to a wheel chair and can't communicate verbally. And Alex is a brilliant mind, forced into the gang lifstyle to protect his family, despite his potential to graduate with honors and go to a great college. It's not long before Alex and Brittany find they have more in common than they'd ever imagined, and as a little flirting turns into something a little more, shall we say, en fuego, these two polar opposites might end up turning the school's social ladder upside-down -- if only they could get their friends (or gang affiliations) to understand. Filled with tension, insightful challenges to stereotypes, and steamy scenes, PERFECT CHEMISTRY is a book I'm recommending to everyone these days.
B003L77GGK|5.0|I was very happy to get this item.  I now have all seasons to watch that I missed on T.V. I didn't discover this show until the second to the last episode of this season. BUMMER!  I LOVE this show and find it not only entertaining but very thought prevoking.
0142412147|5.0|In Let It Snow, John Green, Maureen Johnson, and Lauren Myracle have put together a three-part holiday romance - a la Love, Actually - in which three different stories weave together for sheer paperback brilliance. The story is about three teens, each of which is suffering from a case of the holiday blues. Stuck in a snowstorm in a podunk, nowhereseville town, these teens find romance where they least expected - in a new face, an old friend, and a disappointed ex. But first Jubilee, Tobin, and Addie have a few things to deal with, for example: a broken down train full of cheerleaders, a blizzardous hike to the Wafflehouse, and a painful early morning shift at Starbucks. Riddled with humor and holiday cheer, you can't help but feel all warm and fuzzy after reading this book. And, for those of you who wouldn't normally read a romance, Let It Snow is a great way to indulge your mushy side.

0525421033|4.0|Mia is in the hospital. But, the funny thing is, she can see herself laying in bed, comatose. She can hear the people talking about her and her family. Mia also hears a nurse say that she has a choice to make: to stay or to go. She knows her parents didn't survive the car wreck, and even though as a classical cellist she never quite fit in with her punk rock dad, her tough chick mom, and her little brother who is always banging on his drum kit, she doesn't know if she has the strength to go on without them. It's up to those who come in to weep or to pray or to chat by her bedside to help her make up her mind. But can they? Mia recounts her life's ups and downs through Forman's elegant narrative. This is a memorable novel, the perfect length, that avoids the cliche of the angsty teenager while still managing to be touching and believable.

0142419400|5.0|There's another YA romance around every corner. And whether you love or loathe the genre, sometimes it feels like it needs a little kick start. Like you've read that story a few times and want something new.<br /><br />Let me be the first to tell you that ANNA AND THE FRENCH KISS is not just another anything. It's a romance, and it's an adventure, and it's a comedy, and it's a coming-of-age story. It makes me want to spend all day at a cafe in Paris. It makes me want to go back in time and go to boarding school. It makes me want to go on silly romps with my friends and take my boyfriend to arthouse theatres. It is a story in which you feel like you know everyone, and when you close the last pages, they're a part of you.<br /><br />It's the story of Anna, sent by her rich father who writes melodramatic cancer romance novels to a French boarding school. She soon finds herself in a tight group of friends including the charming St. Clair, an American boy who grew up in Britain but has a French dad. And Anna has never met anyone like him. Not even the cute boy she is almost sort of maybe dating from the theatre where she works back home. As she and St. Clair -- who is dating a college freshman -- get closer and closer, Anna has to push back her growing feelings for him. And, ultimately, this school year abroad in France could either be the best year of her life, or lead her to self-destruct. Either way, it will change her forever.<br /><br />If you like John Green, Maureen Johnson, or Simone Elkeles, you'll love Stephanie Perkins. Pick up ANNA AND THE FRENCH KISS right now.
0446573019|4.0|I like Balducci's new character.  Sure there is solid resemblance to Reacher....so what??!!  Balducci's new direction and very creative plot brings a new character to his efforts.  Puller is much more active and action oriented tha some of old characters of long standing.  I will be first in line to any new Puller novels Mr. Balducci may choose to produce. (Having this product on Kindle early on was a real bonus!!)
B005UT29Z0|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this film from start to finish. The story was very compelling. The photography was great (lots of awesome aerial footage for those who love cityscape artistry.) The actors all shined in their spaces. Spacey, Moore...and the entire cast played perfectly. Well written, with some gem dialogs that really hit. I like this movie a lot. This is an award caliber production.
B005KELR3A|3.0|Definitely not what I expected it to be. I wanted a firm but somewhat soft case to cover my Kindle. I also thought this zipped all the way around but it does not. It is just a pouch, pretty much. I ended up buying the [[ASIN:B0042AM7IW M-Edge Latitude Kindle Jacket, Navy Blue (Fits Kindle Keyboard)]] at Walmart instead (well, the one for the Touch, not the Keyboard) for both my husband and me. The M-Edge Latitude cover what exactly what we wanted. It was firm, zipped all the way around, and had little straps to hold the Kindle in, so you can read with the cover on.  I did give this 3 stars because it is a nice product, just not exactly what I thought I was getting and what I wanted.

0316010669|1.0|I usually don't write reviews, but after buying this book a year back and being very disapointed I came upon it agtain today as a result in another search.  I took it as a sign that a review was needed.  I buy books like this to learn How to Do Something; to improve a talent, not to tell me that a something I know to exist, really exists.  I, and most adults, already know that sometimes snap judgements, gut instincts or feelings, are more accurate than some exhaustive study... and sometimes they are not.  I suspect that most people bought this book to learn how to improve/hone that instinctive/gut talent so that more often than not \\"our gut feeling ids right\\".  This book provides nothing in that area, it seems to be content to demonstrate what we already knew/  Of roughly 1300 reviews roughly 500 are 3 or less and 800 are 4 or better.    I suggest you save your time and money.  Good luck

0060786523|5.0|A Suitable Boy has been on my \\"must read\\" list for many years - finally I have got round to it.  For the past five weeks I have been immersed in the fictional town of Brahmpur, India.  It is a long book (Wikipedia helpfully tells me that it's one of the longest novels ever written), but for the most part it was easy to read and it held my attention throughout.<br /><br />The book opens with a family wedding which unites the Mehra and Kapoor families.  Lata Mehra is the younger sister of the bride and it's her mother's determination to find \\"a suitable boy\\" for her daughter to marry that will become one of the main storylines of the novel.  The scope widens though, firstly to encompass the other members of the Mehra and Kapoor families, and then their friends and colleagues and then wider still to cover the events of the time that influence their lives.  In this way the book manages to be simultaneously both intimate and epic and to take in the broad canvas of 1950s India: both Muslims and Hindus, politicians and prostitutes, city-dwellers and villagers, traditional and modern ways.  There is a broad cast of characters and occasionally it can be confusing but family trees at the beginning of the book help you to keep track of who's who.<br /><br />I love books that are set in India: two of my favourites have been [[ASIN:140003065X A Fine Balance (Oprah's Book Club)]] and [[ASIN:0312330537 Shantaram: A Novel]].  This wonderful book has leapt into my all time top 10.  It's hard to summarize it better than the quote from the Times which features on the cover of the English edition: \\"Make time for it.  It will keep you company for the rest of your life\\".
B0052UZIFA|3.0|This is a favorite app on my iPad and was so happy to play on my Samsung I9100. Played until roof level without glitch. After playing first couple of roof levels I closed the program. When I came back to play later, the app had reset to level 1-1. This also happened to my daughters on their Samsung Infuse and Samsung I9000. Is this just a Samsung glitch or Android glitch. So frustrating!
0307959856|2.0|I am an avid (bordering on fanatical) fan of Jane Austen and some P. D. James.  I was sorely disappointed in this book.  While James does a good job at continuing the characters into the future with this book, the mystery part was poorly developed and the solution was implausible.  If you try and figure out the timeline for what happened concerning all the characters and the murder, the timing just doesn't work and the murderer being able to do what he did also isn't logical.  I agree with another reviewer that while James does a fairly good job with the main characters she is too \\"casual\\" with the trial portion of the book and you don't get the feel of what is happening.  She spends a lot of time catching people up on the background of the characters and explaining their actions and she leaves out lots of details that would have made the plot more interesting and captivating. I ordered the book and even paid for express shipping since I was so interested in reading it but I should have saved my money.  I will not do that again. I am shocked that the mystery was not better thought out and that the resolution wasn't more believable.  She even writes that Wickham would have married the girl and never considers or explains how he could do that when he is already married to Lydia?? What happened to Mrs. Younge at the end was so quick that I had to read it several times to figure out actually what had happened and that also was not very believable.  All in all it was very disappointing and I won't make the same mistake again of buying one of these sequels before reading the reviews.
B004L3AR0K|4.0|There are so many ways to go into this. The choices we make in life for long term happiness, we think may be difficult at first...but heartbreaking? Knowing that the difficulties that lead to happiness can result in indescribable sadness? This movie gets to the core of such choices. At first, it seemed like an overly exposed romantic comedy with, might i add, surprising nudity, by a lead actress that seems to have a pattern with movies that end in grief ( ex. One Day). I almost turned it off once it became clear of her condition. A friend wisely steered me away from One Day and i felt like i was walking into another trap. Stayed with the movie because there was nothing else to do anyway. It was much deeper than portrayed and really showed  what a wonderful actress Anne really is. She is superb, and falls into the role, pulls conflicting emotions from you watching her. Jake's character grew from an overgrown child to...well, the kind of man we imagine him to be in real life ( ladies!) Its nice how movies make you believe things that for sure don't happen in that short period of time. Either way, it was interesting, enjoyale, darker than i would have liked, but,at least, not silly. 4 stars for acting, 3 stars for content.
B005JLN9Z8|5.0|This album is nothing short of amazing. The band is on the top of its game. Michael Starr sings like a golden God. Satchel's guitar playing is out of this world. The lyrics are amazing. The band is firing on all cylinders on this album. Listening to this album takes you back to a time when rock music ruled the air and your mullet flowed free like it was intended to. Steel Panther is easily one of the best live acts you will ever see and they have beautifully captured those fun and amazing shows and put all of that in this album. I can't take the cd out of my car it just to good. Steel Panther you rock and Balls out is amazing. Everyone should own a copy.

B005ZUR724|5.0|(I thought I'd write this review as it seems unclear from Amazon's description.  Please vote this up so others can see this, thanks.)  This App from the Amazon AppStore is ONLY for the Kindle Fire.  Not your Android phone.  Not your Samsung Galaxy Tab.  Not your rooted Nook Tablet.  Only the Kindle Fire.  Hence \\"Kindle Fire Edition.\\"  I have a (international version, unlocked) Samsung Galaxy S II (GT-i9100) with an AT&T SIM right now and I'm running the phone version of this game.  The only way to get Gameloft's game for the Android PHONE is to go directly to their site and download the .apk and install them that way. It is not available in the Android Market, or Amazon AppStore.  (You have to enable downloads and installs of non-Market applications in your settings to install APKs directly).    In any case, the game itself:  I'm running the game perfectly fine on my Galaxy S2 (1.2GHz dual core, 4.3\\" screen).  It drains battery really fast, so be sure to be plugged in if you're doing any serious quest runs or raids.  However, it doesn't eat that much data (and works over 3G and \\"4G\\" (HSPA+ on AT&T on my phone)) without lag.  Graphics are very smooth and not jumpy.  Overall feel and artwork is just like Blizzard's World of Warcraft, which I've played for 2-3 years (quit 5 years ago).  It's amazing how great this looks on a mobile phone, and how playable it is.  Think of it as \\"WoW Mobile\\".  Without some of the tedious tasks associated with WoW (if you played WoW, you know what I mean: Rep grinding; 10, 20, 40 man raids...)

B00177Y9ZC|1.0|Absolutely horrible movie.  Terrible acting.  The so-called \\"good guy\\" is not really a likable person - someone who steals from others, while living a good life by eating breakfast on the Sphinx.  Makes you actually want the bad guys to win.  Too many plot holes.  No character development.  Please stay as far away as possible from this movie.  Unless you have all the time in the world to waste on mindless activities.
B0062P3392|3.0|\\"If you don't do this job Hunter's a dead man.\\" After a job changes the way he feels Danny (Statham) retires from killing. A few years later he hears that his old partner Hunter (DeNiro) has been captured and he is the only one who can go in and rescue him. Nothing is ever as easy as it seems. This movie is based on a true story (if it comes out as 100% true someone is in trouble) of a British SAS mission. Going in I have to admit one of the reasons I watched it was because of Statham. I know what you are thinking, \\"but all his movies are the same\\". I agree with you but I still watch everything he is in. This one is really no different, but it does have better actors with him. This is a movie with so much potential but ultimately was very up and down. Some scenes were very exciting and fun to watch, while others were flat and boring. Not a lot of consistency made the movie a little disappointing, but the ending was great and made up for the down times. I did enjoy this but glad I didn't pay full price in a theater. Overall, a enjoyable movie that could have used a more consistent feel. Worth watching though. One last note...again what is going on with DeNiro. Does he care anymore? Performance seemed very phoned in. I give it a B.

B0051T46XM|5.0|This is a marvelous, delightful film. Get it now, the original, in Norwegian, before Hollywood gets their hands on it and homogenizes it or turns the trolls into Big Foot or such.<br /><br />The concept here isn't wildly original. It's Blair Witch Project meets X Files. But the execution is what counts and they pulled it off beautifully. It's a serious film that also will have you laughing. The best moment was when the skeptical intellectuals reacted automatically to \\"Troll!\\" being yelled at them. They ran and felt abashed later. It was a perfectly done moment to show how ingrained in the culture, and in them, trolls--real trolls--were. If, like me, you come from Norwegian heritage and grew up on tales of trolls in the \\"Old Country\\", you'll find an extra bonus in this movie showing were it all came from.<br /><br />Gorgeous scenery.<br /><br />The special effects were also quite good.<br /><br />Great film. Highly recommended. A new favorite.
B004US4K2C|4.0|The fact that this replacement home screen will work on the Kindle Fire is reason enough to give it four stars, because there are only a couple of home screen apps that the Fire will run. That said, I'd give it five stars for being able to make the icons larger. Maybe it's due to the resolution of the Fire, and therefore beyond the developer's control, but the icons are tiny and very far apart, making them hard for old eyes to see, and hard for kids to distinguish between apps. i.e., Netflix, iheart Radio, and UNO icons all have red backgrounds with white lettering or logo on them...my seven year old gets them confused constantly on the Fire, but on my Galaxy Tab he has no problem, because the icons are the size of my thumbprint instead of his pinkyprint. Speaking of my Galaxy Tab, for anyone who owns a Galaxy Tab AND a Kindle Fire, and is sideloading apps on the Fire, this is the perfect setup...99% of apps that run on the GTab will run on the Fire, with comparable resolution and performance.
B000FC1AGG|1.0|I am sorry to report that this was a horrible waste of my money and time.  I really wanted to like it and needed some good laughs. It may very well have been my fault since I also did not get past the sample for the Shopaholic, I should have known not to try this.  The dialogue is horrible, I have more interesting and entertaining dialogue with my 12 year hold nephews.  I was hoping  it would be along the line of a Stephanie Plum story - not even close.  Maybe if I was 13 I might have enjoyed the book more.  I did read the sample and found it to be mildly entertaining, so I purchased the book.  What you read in the sample is basically the best part.  Why does everyone start their sentences with 'ER....'.  I would not recommend this book even if it was free, sorry, just never takes off.

B0064T6LV8|3.0|I downloaded this app and gave it a try... and I won't be keeping it. Not because it isn't a good game or because it doesn't work - but because my device is not multi-touch capable. I keep losing my balls, because I can't operate one flipper too quickly after activating the other. I could probably get it to work decently with some adjusting, but I'm such a button masher when it comes to pinball games that I just don't think I'll be able to find one that will work for me the way I want it to on my device.<br /><br />Still, I've given this three stars. It was a decent pinball game from what I played of it, though the ads were a bit more obtrusive than I would have liked. I'm not going to detract from the score because of my multi-touch issue - though I do think it bears mentioning, in case there are others out there who might not realize the lack of multi-touch could be a problem here.

B000NDI3SK|5.0|Surprisingly interesting, entertaining and informative in a subtle way.  Even someone not interested in the rise of mankind can't help but be entranced with obscure tidbits.  Professor Brownoski is a genius.  This series is like having your own personal college professor in your livingroom giving you a 13 hour lecture!!  Can't say enough for the minute detail and the wonderfully filmed scenes of things now sadly gone.  Too bad this is not shown now, some 38 years after it first aired.  This is a must see series to add to your general knowledge of Man.  Too bad Professor Brownoski died in 1974.  He had a lot to share with us and sadly he is gone all too soon.  I own this series and have rewatched it several times and each time I come away with awe for this simple, yet sophisticated presentation.  I plan on sharing this with my grandchildren and their children.  Magnificent is not a word I use lightly but in this case it seems to fit.

My first inquiry was dated 12/15/11, and patiently waiting for any reponse from my \\"Second\\" attempt to resolve this transaction.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|I'm in my mid-30s and have been feeling a bit out of touch lately.  A lot of the music I listen to isn't exactly current (although I am loving new releases by old favorites like Wilco, Ryan Adams, The Jayhawks, and the Mighty Mighty Bosstones to name a few) and that which is tends to sound like the kinds of things I already listen to (Ha Ha Tonka and Dawes, for example, two of my favorite new bands that sound very much like folk-country-rock from days gone by). I discovered Florence + The Machine through a local radio station and was struck by how modern and current this music sounds despite its timeless quality.  It reminds me of things that I have heard in the past (alt-rock, I guess) but yet blends the influences in so seamlessly that it's really hard to pick them all out.<br /><br />What I love most about this sweeping, anthemic music is that no matter how arty or experimental it may get, it is always anchored by a hook or a driving beat that makes it very accessible and memorable.  The textures are often dense with a lot of instruments going at once, but none of the hugeness ever overshadows Florence's powerful and emotional voice.  The lyrics are suitably a combination of abstract and concrete, leading you down interesting paths but never in such a way that you're going to feel lost or confused.  Perfectly-executed art-pop for the present day.<br /><br />I am noticing that some reviewers are stating that this recording isn't as solid overall as her debut, Lungs.  I bought both around the same time, so in my mind they kind of blur together as one thing.  However, I will say that Lungs is a bit more diverse sonically and sometimes a little more raw, while this one is more consistent and polished.  With Ceremonials it feels like Florence has really found a sound that works for her and she's exploring it to bring out all the interesting nuances.  Neither album is \\"better\\" or \\"worse\\" in my mind than the other, just a little bit different in their approaches.  Both have that instantly recognizable sound though that makes this music pop out of the speakers and lodge itself in the brain.<br /><br />Great stuff.  If this is what music is going to be sounding like in the 2010s, I am all in.recognizable sound though that makes this music pop out of the speakers and lodge itself in the brain.  Great stuff.

B005K2Z2O2|1.0|The actual envelopes/sleeves/products are really nice, and of high quality(a 4-5).  Unfortunately, Amazon links them directly no matter which Kindle you buy.  I did not notice they are for the two smaller/lesser Kindles, and not for the Kindle Fire, and therefore do not fit the Kindle Fire, which is too big.  I was looking at the pictures, colors, which ones are best form/function, etc. and not even paying attention to the product description...  Definitely my mistake, but it would be far more efficient and less of a hassle for everyone, if they did not directly link one product with another product that is definitely not a fit for the first product.  Very annoying...  May sure you check the descriptions carefully, especially with the \\"Fire\\" which does not have as many case options and is a larger Kindle than the others.
1451627289|5.0|I haven't read a Stephen King book in a few years and was reluctant to dive into the behemuth \\"Under the Dome.\\" Something drew me to 11/22/63 (another behemuth) and I am glad to went with the flow. It is beautifully written in the classic King style, a little fantasy mixed with current and at times realistic although horrifying themes. Everything ties together beautifully in the end, and I left the book feeling edified. I couldnt put the book down and while working a 65 hour week I managed to finish it in 7 days. Wonderful writing as usual Mr. King!
B005Y423ZC|5.0|I had been waiting to get this DVD since it came out, and finally I received it yesterday. I only have one one to describe this concert, \\"WOW\\". Her voice is amazing, and just her alone on stage, without special effects, makes a great concert. The video and sound quality is excellent! I couldn't have asked for anything better :)
B005KAJPY2|5.0|4.5 Stars! I would suggest that anyone buy this album and listen. Let the whole album sink in. I lucked into VNV Nation through a friend. I had heard random songs and found them interesting, but after she took us to a concert I was hooked!! I bought several cd's and loved each one for its own theme. \\"Automatic\\" is the newest and it rose to be my favorite album for my personal Top 100.  Fast songs like \\"Control\\" and beautiful haunting songs like \\"Nova\\" make this so worth while! Strangely the only song I don't dig is the first song \\"On-Air\\". The contrast may be too drastic for a new VNV Nation listener. Even if you have never heard of: \\"Assemblage 23\\", \\"Covenant\\", \\"Straftanz\\", \\"De/Vision\\", \\"Wumpscut\\" or \\"Evanescense\\"  Give VNV Nation a long listen, you won't be sorry.<br />[[ASIN:B005KAJPY2 Automatic]]
B005MW8CLK|5.0|Billy has put together a nice little package for fans of the old Pumpkins. The included remastered CD sounds great and the picture replicas are completely cool. For me, the real gem is the DVD. Very, very cool old school show. This box set is quite reasonably priced and for me is a great purchase. Looking forward to the remaining remasters now...
B00124LYHQ|5.0|A Streetcar Named Desire is a stunning film which shocked the censors in 1951 with the powerful acting by both Marlon Brando and Vivien Leigh. Set in sultry New Orleans, Marlon is a working class man who has a run down but stable life with his wife, Stella, in a tiny two room apartment. Suddenly his wife's younger sister, Blanche, shows up. Blanche is from southern gentility, dresses in fancy dresses, and expects men to act in a gentlemanly way. Stanley likes to drink, gamble, bowl, and throw things when he gets upset - which is fairly often.<br /><br />It's clear right away that things are not going to go smoothly between the two, and poor Stella is stuck in the middle, struggling to defend her sister and her husband from each other. On top of that she is pregnant. She's both upset by and enthralled by her husband's passion, running from him and to him in the same breath.<br /><br />Fairly quickly we realize that Blanche is not all she seems to be. Despite her claims of high class morals, it seems that she's quite willing to drink heavily, seduce any man who gets near her, and become lost in angst over her husband who committed suicide. This happened many years ago - when she was only in her teens - but the experienced affected her immensely.<br /><br />The interplay between the sisters is just as powerful as the scenes with Marlon, and this is one of the few movies on the AFI top 100 list which actually passes the Bechdel test of having two meaningful female characters in it. There are both a censored and non-censored version of this film, and the ending is meaningfully different, so it's well worth searching out both of them and watching them to see what happens. I would rather not give away spoilers here!<br /><br />It can be easy to think of a movie about a rough marriage as \\"typical\\" in modern times, but for 1951, this was something rarely seen on the scene. I'm sure for many families it was not strange at all, to see this kind of anger and angst in a family. Perhaps for some it was even a bit reassuring, to think that others went through what they did, and that not all families had a golden-glow life of all smiles that Hollywood tended to portray.<br /><br />Interestingly, background stories about this movie indicate that Marlon stayed in character throughout filming - even when not on set - and that it greatly upset Vivian to have him be that way. So perhaps her looking down at him on film is a reflection of how the woman herself felt about his acting technique. If that's the case, maybe his technique was quite effective, to get each one of them to give the most authentic performance possible.<br /><br />While I appreciate the acting immensely in this movie, it's not a movie I would personally want to watch repeatedly. There is too much seething anger and despair for me, and there's already enough of that in the world.Perhaps for some it was even a bit reassuring, to think that others went through what they did, and that not all families had a golden-glow life of all smiles that Hollywood tended to portray.<br /><br />Interestingly, background stories about this movie indicate that Marlon stayed in character throughout filming - even when not on set - and that it greatly upset Vivian to have him be that way.

B004LROUNG|2.0|I was very disappointed in this Grisham Novel. There were so many opportunities where he could have spun off an exciting story but he never did. I found it very boring indeed. I was a big fan of his but not anymore. There are so many authors now that are much better and much more exciting than him.
B004IFYMYI|5.0|Taxi driver is a fascinating movie, coming out in the same year as Star Wars (1976) but showing a far bleaker view of life. Travis is a New York City taxi driver, an ex-marine, who is struggling with insomnia and just wants to get through the day. He takes on driving a taxi in the worst areas of town. He has people throwing bottles at him, being sexual in his back seats, and his view on humanity gets fairly worn down. The movie is chock-full of hard street language. He throws around slurs about African-Americans and women, and he clearly has some negative opinions about both. He first stalks a blonde, and when she gets upset that he takes her to a triple-X movie he's baffled and then hostile. He then focuses on a young hooker.<br /><br />It was interesting, while watching this I kept thinking of \\"Network\\" with its \\"angry man not wanting to take it any more\\" theme - and sure enough both came out in the same year and Network swept many of the awards Taxi Driver was up for. This must have been quite a year for angry people. It's fascinating to me that we have Star Wars on one hand, and Taxi Driver on the other.<br /><br />One of the most classic lines coming out of this film is De Niro staring in the mirror, gearing up with his guns, snarling, \\"Are you talking to me?\\"<br /><br />Certainly the actors did a fantastic job here. You really do feel that you're immersed in New York City, walking the streets, immersed in the harsh characters that can populate the world. I admit it's hard for me to watch some of the overtly racist scenes, with him glaring at African-Americans, with the slurs that are passed. But I also understand that this is a \\"documentary\\" of sorts of how things were for some people, and there is some context with how he was abused by those around him. Not that it makes it \\"right\\" of course, but it was the way things were for some people.<br /><br />I also enjoyed that the script was not telegraphed. There were many points that I had no idea at all where the story would go - would he do X or Y? I had to sit and wait and see how it all unfolded.<br /><br />Not a movie I would watch repeatedly - but definitely a movie I am glad I watched once, to get a sense of that era in history, and to understand more the references that others make to this film.<br /><br />Note that this movie fails the Bechdel test. While there are two named female characters (and really, only those two) they never interact at all. They are simply there to present \\"beautiful pure angel female\\" and \\"run down whore female in need of rescuing\\". That's the range of women in Travis's mind.story would go - would he do X or Y?

B001BPQT8A|5.0|This Blu-ray book is one of the most beautiful blu-ray sets I've ever bought. The book has amazing informations about the movie and the actors plus beautiful images. The blu-ray quality is outstanding.
B0009H1CK6|3.0|This concert starts off with that terrible thing of asking the audience to clap above their heads -- an insult really. It then continues in a glitzy showbiz style that is truly dispiriting. Nile Rodgers, how can you do this, I thought. You're a great arranger and a great funkmaster. Why this showbiz corn? Why the ridiculous clown of a percussionist? Why are the singers being divas? One of the key things about the original Chic was the ironic low-key style of the women singers, which defined their sound and look as much the bass lines and the guitar riffs.  I adore Chic, the original Chic, one of the great funk acts of all time, with a powerful emotional punch in their songs. And eventually, towards the end, this lot redeemed themselves, with a great funky climax where the music ruled on Le Freak and Good Times. Thank god for that. But to echo another reviewer, I just wish somebody would put together all the old clips of Chic in their prime and release them on DVD. That would be so much better.
B005EY2XFC|5.0|The Crow is definitely a cult classic film. This is one of my favorite films of all time. I bought this during the Black Friday week deals, so I was able to snatch it up for $4.99...not too shabby for a blu-ray movie, which also included a digital copy, as well as a digital copy through Amazon, which will allow you to watch it on the computer (and I assume Kindle Fire).
B005HI4LLY|5.0|I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves horror comedys. I haven't laughed so hard in a while. Myself and all of my children bought this movie and we all loved it.
0061124958|5.0|I have been a teacher for over 30 years.  One of the best loved books , of all the ones I have read to my classes, is Charlotte's Web.  The students love this book and keep coming back to it.  It is a story many of them remember years after they first heard it.  The story is filled with memorable characters who you find yourself rooting for.  It is a timeless book which my students like now as much as they did 20 years ago.  My daughter is now living and teaching in Taiwan.  I purchased it for her to read to her children over there.
B005URRCUY|4.0|That's right. This is a great CD. And yes, you should take the cover sticker suggestion and \\"Play Loud\\". It rocks for sure. However, if you are sporting a stereo with mediocre speakers or an amp/receiver with a high level of THD you will probably blow your speakers rocking this at your normal high volume. The whole thing was recorded/printed at the highest level I have heard on a CD in a while.  Probably 70% of normal rocking volume will do to thump this in all it's glory without damaging your friends.   That said, this is a great effort. You will want to hear the whole thing several times. There is everything here that made The Black Keys one of my favorite new bands after hearing \\"Brothers\\". Yes, that's right, I am a come lately and have only delved back in to their history as far as \\" Attack and Release\\" but I love them. I have heard a couple cuts from \\"Magic Potion \\" and will explore more in time. But for now, the last three releases are plenty to listen to.    My favorite tracks are: Gold on the Ceiling, Little Black Submarines, Run Right Back and Mind Eraser. However, there is not a bad song on the CD.
B003XCVQ3C|1.0|I bought this and didn't have a chance to use it for a while. I wanted to try it a few weeks later when I really needed it and it never worked (on two different Mac laptops). Read the other reviews: This product either never works or breaks quickly - stay away!
B0061JPYX2|2.0|OK, let's hope that there is more in the vaults and this is just the first salvo. We know there is rumored to be a duet with Cee Lo Green somewhere....  To answer the big question YES, there are a few good \\"new\\" tunes on this CD, mixed in with alternate takes of great songs that won't be the ones you reach for when you want to hear them. But let's face it, most are new covers (5) instead of new originals. (3.5?) The producer does an OK job except trying out a rap fusion on \\"Like Smoke\\" which sucks worse than the B-side rap collaboration he concocted of \\"You Know I'm No Good\\" that showed up as an extra on Back in Black. In my opinion Amy Winehouse was never meant to be intercut with the likes of NAS or any other ball yanking rapper. She was not Britney Spears/Nelly Furtado/...insert poor singing overdubbed dance club hit maker.... She was a unique blues tinged soul singer who, when relatively sober, wrote some great original music, with a little help.   Best songs are: Our Day Will Come, The Girl From Ipanema, Half Time
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this bluray as it translated extremely well from big screen  to small! Special features are top notch if you're into that, and the sound is perfect!
B005ZTFPFQ|1.0|It would be a lot better if you didnt have to buy almost every game inside of this. Only one of the games is free and the other 40 or so you have to buy. They could have at least given you one more free game considering how 8 bit these are.
B004LWZW4W|1.0|The original \\"Planet of the Apes\\" by Rod Serling was brilliant, philosophical, mind expanding, and thought provoking, and with an ending which was mind blowing. By contrast, Rise of the Planet of the Apes is just blowing wind--a slow paced intellectual stinker which will put anyone who is not a high school drop out (or a 13-year boy) in a near intellectual coma.   These film-makers basically monkeyed with and aped the plots from \\"Charly\\" (1968), \\"Limitless\\"and \\"28 Days later\\" (which we will see more of in the zzzzz sequel), and applied it to chimpanzees. The plot goes like this: brilliant young (but annoying) scientist puts drugs in chimps hoping to cure Alzheimer's in his father and increase intelligence. In Charly\\" they used rats and injected Cliff Robertson to cure him of mental retardation. But then a baby chimp is born---ahhh, a baby. And handsome annoying scientist meets sexy veterinarian, and then 5 to 7 or more years go by (in about 30 seconds but which seems like an eternity zzzzzz), no one ages, nothing changes at the lab (its like the next day, but 7 years later), but the chimp gets even smarter! So too does dad (and so too did Charly), but then dad begins to deteriorate and he ends up worse than before (which is the same plot from Charly)---but wait, a viruses escapes and its going to sicken all the humans (AKA \\"28 days later\\"), and the really smart chimpanzees are poised to take over the world.  In the brilliant Rod Serling film, we realize, at the end, that the collective stupidity (insanity) of humans and their leaders destroyed the world through nuclear war---but in this boring stinker \\"rise of the planet of the apes\\", a viruses created by the really annoying handsome young scientist will destroy the world and allow the apes to take over. In the Rod Serling film, it is clear that the apes evolved over eons of time and humans de-evolved--both of which are thought provoking ideas. In rise of the planet of the apes, its all due to a drug (which is the plot from Limitless applied to Chimps and the plot from \\"28 days\\" inserted into the end of this film and the upcomming sequel).   And, lets not forget the plot from the 1952 \\"Monkey Business\\" (starring Cary Grant, Ginger Rogers and Marlyn Monroe), where scientist Grant is exposed to a serum (he made) but which was tested first on chimps, one of which becomes so intelligent he puts the serum in Grant's drinking water but which makes Grant the intellectual equal to a child. And then we have Bedtime for Bonzo where scientist (Ronald Reagan) takes a chimp home, becomes its dad (sound familiar?) to teach it to become smart, just like a human, and is in love with a beautiful woman, but must prove himself to the head of his university--a plot which is also aped by the makers of \\"rise of the planet of the apes.\\"  And then there is \\"Terminator, Rise of the Machines\\", but instead of super smart machines taking over, its chimps. Even the use of drugs to make chimps or humans smarter has been done before with the same intellectual consequences.   But a drug which effects the brain and increases intelligence, would not provide an ape with the ability to speak human language as this would require a complete physical alteration of the mouth, tongue, palate, larynx, vocal cords. Nor would such a drug enable chimps to become completely bipedal (walking on two legs), or for the chimp hand and feet to become modified to enable upright walking and the construction and utilization of complex tools--certainly millions of years of evolution might result in these adaptations, which was the premise of the intellectually stimulating film by Rod Serling, the original Planet of the Apes.   Does this very slow paced film have anything going for it, anything new or surprising? No. What about the special effects? Sorry. Already old hat. Everything about this film is \\"see that before, its been done before, and its been done better.\\"
B005SV9X22|5.0|This dvd was the bomb, nice to finally see her live. Now if she come out with a video compilation, that would be awsome.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|My wife read the book and loved it and then dragged me to the movie.  I am glad she did.  This is a really good movie.  Great humor and a great story.
B0058VW36U|5.0|such a original game that takes awhile to beat. has given me hours of playtime trying to 3 star each level. excellent game!
B005UT29Z0|4.0|The stories of the melt down have been told a lot of times and this is another view from the inside.  It is not an action flick as you would normally think of an action flick - but if you like behind the scenes maneuvering, watching people stop on each other to get what they want, and how easy decisions like these get made, then you will like this film.   90% of the time there are just 2 people on the screen.  The movie explores the different emotions and relationships between all levels of employees and economic classes.    The cast is amazing.  I could have watched each role even longer.
B001FBSMW6|4.0|Sometimes I think the rush to post a review becomes the determinant in someone's evaluation of a book or an album.  I've listened to this album for awhile and I must say I don't find it a disappointment.  It is a natural progression and in many ways very similar to what this band has produced in the past.  The melancholy sentimental emotion they are so professional at pulling out of you is still the same.  Their lyrics and hooks are still there.  I think this is a very enjoyable album if you are a Keane fan.  I don't buy the 80's BS, I think they are just expanding with different sounds, but the underlying thematic approach is still the same.  If you are truly a Keane fan, give this a half dozen listens and let it grow on you. I promise, it will.
0451196716|4.0|Very different, but isn't Stephen king usually pretty different. It was one of those books you just want to keep reading to find out what happens at the end.
B005V20JKI|3.0|First off, the one on the Android Market is a later version with another level and character. We're getting an old version of the game. Also, the game flips the screen quite a bit. It doesn't do it in the middle of the game, but it's still a bit irritating. Other than that, it's probably the most fun and addictive game out right now, but it won't get 5 stars until they update it.

0316098329|5.0|\\"Room\\" starts and stays in the narrative voice of a young boy, who begins his story on the morning of his fifth birthday. His strange syntax and declarations about his mom and items in his environment, all of which have a gender, for example, develop a quick awareness in the reader of the wrongness of the world Jack and his mother inhabit. Jack's thoughts and actions and dialogue reveal the \\"why\\" of this wrongness at a pace slow enough that gives the beginning of the story a \\"whodunit\\" experience for the reader. By the time the reader concludes the circumstances of \\"Room\\" the mother yields to the Jack's inquiries about his world and shares the facts as she knows them, also distorted for her own reasons.    Most adult novels that use a first-person child narrator or a psychologically atypial first-person narrator fail to maintain the internal psychological and grammatical consistency necessary to keep readers suspending their disbelief throughout the narrative. Donoghue maintains the mind and grammar of an imprisoned five-year-old constantly-educated boy through the establishment of the character, and through an equally believable arc of growth and cognitive restructuring as his responsibilities and model of the world divide by zero. This may be the most realistic, most complete example of cognitive development in a protagonist in modern fiction.  I'm ready to take Donoghue's class on how to write believable fictional characters, if not to apply the class in my own novel but to learn how she wrote this story. I hope fiction teachers study and teach this book with input from Donoghue.  The character of Jack raises my expectations of how well a fiction writer can make even a patently atypical character deeply understandable, empathetic and realistic.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|An apt reminder of what makes a timeless classic! Not having read this book in many years, it was refreshing to see how effectively Charles Dickens captured a social class system that lives on to this day.

1609419693|5.0|This is one of the best books I have listened to (read?)ever, as far as entertainment goes. Funny but with enough info that you still feel like you know Tina a bit better by the end. Did a great job touching on SNL AND 30 Rock and not just over focusing on her personal life. Also, she packed it with insights so that you get a better idea of what the behind the scenes on these shows are like (writing process, interacting with the SNL stars). And I can't stress this enough - finally a book written by a funny person that is funny. I loved her before this book and now I respect the hell out of her. She is funny, intelligent and a great communicator. She deserves all of her success and more. But I have to agree with her dad (from his \\"blurb\\") - I hate that cover. Ick. I suspect she was trying to make a statement like \\"I don't need sex to sell my book\\" but I think she went too far in the other direction. Oh, do youself a favour and get the audio if you can. As a performer she does a great job reading trhe book.

But if you want to hear real rap, real hip-hop, and real storytelling then this album is for you. In this album Drake tells his story on his rise to fame pretty much from start to finish. I love it. It's sortof slow but with awesome beats and it's him going back to the \\"old\\" Drake. 2 thumbs up :)

0060873027|3.0|While I have never been a huge fan of Mr. Chrichton or Mr. Preston for that matter, I felt this novel had some interesting points. The character development, for one, was unusual and in some ways made me sad. In addition, the foray that the reader is taken on of the insect and plant world was intriguing to say the least!I just wish I could have imagined what it all looked like. This was one of the few books I've read that could have used illustrations to great advantage. (I never did figure out what those airplanes looked like...) So, all told it was a nice read and a good candidate to be made into a movie at some point.

B000ID37T0|1.0|This movie may have been Oscar-worthy 20 years ago, but it sure has not aged well. Several problems:  1. Al Pacino's jerk performance in this movie is too often over the top. It's just too much. If you're Charlie Simms (Chris O'Donnell), you're just going to walk away.  2. At what age does a man's obsession with sex just become creepy? Think about what the reaction would be to a 60 yr old loud mouth who, upon each and every introduction to a woman, names her perfume. And who frequently discusses women in graphic detail (loudly, in public places). And who asks some nubile twenty yr old girl to do the tango in a hotel restaurant. And who makes his young sidekick wait in the car while he \\"experiences\\" a prostitute.   3. The conflict Charlie is dealing with (rich kids, boarding school trouble) feels contrived and predictable.  4. The climax of the movie (Al Pacino's speech in the school assembly) requires an especially strong suspension of disbelief.   5. The musical score is nauseating - especially the piece that gets played whenever we're to feel sympathy for Pacino.  I could go on, but I've already wasted enough of my life thinking about this film.
B00447G29S|5.0|Ok, so here it is...Almost Christmas 2011, and I had never seen this movie until tonight.  I had purchased it a few months ago when I purchased my LG 55\\" 3D TV, and was waiting for this time of year to finally watch it.  My 10 year old and 7 year old joined me (they had already seen the standard 2D version.  We watched using the passive (gray polarized) 3D glasses, and I thought the 3D was fantastic.  There is a scene early on where it looks as if the front of the train is coming about 3 feet out the front of the TV! The train/rollercoaster sequence along with snow flakes in 3D was very cool. The 3D along with this kind of animation really worked, and I think made this movie even more magical than I thought it would.  I cannot imagine it would have the same effect on me in the 2D, but ya never know.  We also had the LG surround sound set up, and the train ROARED!!!  Awesome!  If you have a 3D system, and looking for a movie of this genre, I highly recommend it.  This 3D version has been made very very well!  Buy it !
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I write my to do lists on there, ebay/amazon purchases, and other things I need to remember which is really handy with my Kindle Fire.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|The husband and myself are addicted to this game, I didn't think he would enjoy it but the day I got my kindle I downloaded the game, he picked it up and played for over an hour :)
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I can use ebay without my computer which is nice! Because on my Kindle Fire I can do the same things without trouble!
B0038M2AZA|1.0|I purchased this dvd for my sister as a birthday gift. When I opened up the package and looked at the dvd case I was in shock somebody actually sold this to me. The dvd itself was fine but the case was ripped and broken into several pieces. I was very disappointed because it was a gift, but my sister was nice and took the dvd and threw away the mess of what used to be a case.I would have never bought this had I known it was going to be such a mess.
B0034G4P9E|5.0|WOW. I can't add much to what already has been said, but if you like sports movies or just plain have a heart then this movie is for you. Maybe not my favorite film of 2011 but I can't rule it out for sure. It was definitely the most pleasant surprise for me this year or maybe ever. At least drop $1 and Redbox this movie.
B004DSX5B6|4.0|It's the same tool as Gerber 01471 Suspension Butterfly Opening Multi-Plier with Sheath and it's about $10 cheaper, same Gerber quality... unfortunately for me, I found this one after I bought the \\"BEAR GRYLLS\\" version.  BUT STILL A GREAT MULTI-TOOL
B0063IH60K|4.0|As far as Solitaire goes, this app handles it pretty well. This includes both good and bad, namely in the apparent frequency of losses - something shared by a paper-based game anyway. The inclusion of the Winnimg Hand formula (game is guaranteed to have a solition) is very welcome... even though you're just as likely to lose as before, at least it doesn't feel so futile. Ads are present and minorly obtrusive, but not bad enough to consider getting a different app for my time-killing card game needs.
B0060AY6FO|4.0|Readers looking for a fun, new mystery will really love this book.  Those looking for a Jane Austen re-tread may be a little disapoointed as the emphasis is on the mystery, which is just what you'd expect from P.D. James.  Kept me guessing to the end and I really liked that.    Though the characters are familiar and it's always fun to revisit such a popular classic, I'm a mystery buff so this was righ up my alley.  Highly recommend it for a Christmas vacation read.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|At this price, this is an automatic buy, regardless of how you feel about the sequels. For less than $40 shipped, getting three superior-quality Blu-rays and a bunch of extra discs is a great deal even if you only like the first Matrix.<br /><br />I bought this for $60+. Consider yourself lucky.
B0024NSG4S|5.0|This is a great movie for children and adults as well.  I really enjoyed it and will watch it again by myself.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Works great on the kindle fire. A must app for taking notes and reminders. sync works wonderfully with my desktop.
B005KP7EK4|4.0|I'm not sure what I was expecting but maybe I was expecting more from the history of Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid ... maybe I expected it to relive too much of the original Paul Newman and Robert Redford movie? I'm not sure.
B003L77G06|5.0|Modern Family is the hit show for ABC 7. The writers for this show are comedic geniouses!!! Every show is nothing short of hilarious, and the 3 main households are all intertwined with mishaps,and misunderstandings. There is no better definition than hilarious for this cast, which play off so well against each other every episode. It's hard not to get hooked once you watch one show. Each episode is fresh and keeps you interested from beginning to end. You might have your favorite character in the show, but the entire cast ensemble is great. This show is simply well thought out and put together. It's definitely a good wind down to hectic day.
B0042X9L6A|4.0|I took the plunge and got the right flash for my Nikon D5100 camera... have to say, it's worth every penny!  Makes my photo's look so much better!  Love the ability to swivel left, right, up down... awesome flash!  I haven't begun to utilize it to it's full ability and I love it already.  Definitely recommend this flash!
B004HO6I4W|5.0|Rio is an awesome movie for the whole family to watch! Everybody will enjoy it. With the blu ray combo pack you get great value for your money as well. I highly recommend this movie!
B0000669JL|2.0|I bought this CD based on all the great reviews here on Amazon, and of course because I recognize many of the songs from years of radio listening.  Having now listened to this disc a couple of times, I must say I find it tiresome.  The mastering sounds compressed and cold, and on some tracks the drums/bass are loud enough to be louder than the vocals.  It's like it was mastered for the club/hip-hop crowd.  Do yourself and favor and try to find an earlier version, not this remastered one.
B00007EDY5|5.0|This adapter was bought to replace one that is (apparently) a non genuine adapter. The previous adapter could slide on from both ends. Consequently, I was sliding on the adapter incorrectly for years. This new adapter can only be mounted on, one way therefore even a novice (like me) could not make a mistake. Good product.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I got this to use while playing LotRO (Lord of the Rings Online). It came with a preset for the game, and the software was very easy to customize my own presets. The fast switching between 3 settings is really convenient, letting me easily switch between sets for Healing, DPS, and Tanking. I've also used it a bit on other games, and it works just as well, you just have to program your own macros (which is easy with the software) if it doesn't have a preset for your game.  The only problem I've had is with some older games (namely Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy) I couldn't use the gameboard.
0060873086|3.0|Michael Chrichton passed away in 2008. He had begun work on Micro and was about 1/3 of the way done. Richard Preston was hired to finish the book based on Chrichton's notes and research. Chrichton himself has been quoted as saying that Micro would be \\"an adventure story like Jurassic Park.\\"<br /><br />No dinosaurs this time - instead Micro focuses on nanotechnology -science that is no longer in the future but is a reality.<br /><br />Seven graduate students head to Hawaii, hoping to land an internship at Nanitech, a leader in this field. They get more than they bargained for when they are unwillingly - reduced - shall we say. They battle for their lives in an environment as much familiar as it is terrifying. Meanwhile the Oahu Police department is stymied by the deaths of three men from hundreds of tiny little cuts. Has the technology run amok? Or is someone testing it outside the lab?<br /><br />I found the idea quite intriguing, but it is the descriptions of nature seen from the eyes of humans half an inch tall that make the book. An ant or a wasp take on horrifying proportions. The characters themselves are quite blatant caricatures - the bad guy is almost formulaic, the whiny kid is predictable in his actions etc. The character I was most drawn to and I identified as the protagonist is abruptly killed off. It seems the players are there to only move the story along.<br /><br />I chose to listen to this book in audio format. The reader, John Bedford Lloyd, was quite good. At first his voice reminded me of a news anchor. Lots of expression and he did justice to the action in the book. Some of his interpretations were a bit annoying, but matched the character, such as the whiny student.<br /><br />I have enjoyed Chrichton's books. Micro didn't quite live up to past works, but then again, it's not truly Chrichton novel is it? That being said, it's was an entertaining, quick read that won't tax your brain. I can see it being made into a movie - but the plot isn't really that unique.
B006G2ZEV6|5.0|I love this game on my MacBook and this is a great port of it for mobile platforms. The text for the subtitles is missing, but I'm sure it's because of the bleeding edge software on my Galaxy Nexus. Well done. Stop reading this, you're wasting play time.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I am not usually much of an electronic game fan, but I seem to find myself hooked on this one!
B006OOHYIC|4.0|I'm new to Quell, but it is pretty simple to understand. Quell is a good past time when you are sitting around wanting something relaxing to do.
B005HV6Y84|4.0|The Twilight films always have wonderful soundtracks that create such a great feel during the movies. Breaking Dawn's soundtrack continues the tradition of awesome compilations. Personally, the Breaking Dawn soundtrack is not my favorite or even second favorite, but it still is a fabulous thing to purchase and listen to. I recommend it to any Twilight fan or anyone who is interested in great, new music.
B000024AIP|5.0|Your service was great songs were better music could be heard by old ears and played the music loudly !!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I originally gave this 1 star way back when the game wouldn't run on my Galaxy Nexus, however that problem has long since been fixed.<br /><br />So I've changed the review to 5 stars to reflect the fact that, once it worked, I really enjoyed playing the game.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This app is one of the best drawing apps available in the Android marketplace. It is intuitive to use and it is possible to create some amazing drawings on your device of choice. My two year old loves to play with it on the Touchpad and I have found it to be a good app to pass the time.  Someone that is looking for a more realistic drawing app may need to look elsewhere because you can't blend colors, but the color selection should be fine for most. Overall, this is a great app to add to your collection.
B00009MGGI|5.0|I gave this as a gift so I don't know how the recipient will view it.  I have however seen all episodes and they are just terrific.  I would recommend their viewing to anyone.
0061780308|5.0|The CD arrived promptly and was in excellent condition.The Art of Racing in the Rain is wonderfully done. I've given several as gifts. Thanks!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Using on Kindle Fire. As mentioned below it took a little fiddling to get it working due to lack of GPS, but it has worked well with no problems since.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|There are a lot of people that have rated this as a one star box set for its lack of special features and special packaging, rightfully so. However, $98 is a bit of a dream price to pay for 8 DVD's in a special package.   For the money, this is an excellent set, with great quality picture (DVD at least) that can be watched over and over and over. My girlfriend is an avid Harry Potter fan and will undoubtedly watch all the discs until they are all too scratched to read. Personally, that's what I think this set is for. If you're looking for a collector's item then hold out, but if you just want to watch the movies, then don't pass this up
B004EPYZPS|5.0|I'm a cranky movie person.  Jaded.  Don't like movies.  But this one got to me.  Just great writing, great characters.  Well done.  I hope it lasts a long time in the public consciousness.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Seen it five times so far. It's the sweetest movie I have seen in months. I am a fan of Woody Allen's 1970s works, and own all of those works he had produced in that period. I'd dare to say this movie is along the same lines. Nice on the eyes, romantic and beautiful. One needs a bit of literary knowledge to enjoy the movie. You gotta be familiar with the giant figures like Hemingway, Stein, Picasso and Dali to truly enjoy this movie. Quite fascinating.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a fun game for the kids and adults. a lot of different levels and challenges to get through. Fun fun fun
B003MX5P20|4.0|Good music, really enjoyable.  Great selection on songs and music.  Will probably order more in the future.  Great Christmas gift.
B0063GORYU|4.0|This game is great and well done.  But sometimes it will play a video ad without asking (without requiring me to tap to start it). It just starts playing in the middle of a game and I'm going YIKES!!! what did I touch? Otherwise I would give it 5 stars.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love playing this game! I play it all the time I hope there are more levels for it soon...
B004XN3FHA|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moLGR1EFI2B34O]]The flashlight's appearance looks fantastic. It is not heavy as other people say but if it was smaller, I would carry it everyday with me. I did a lot of researches and watched a lot of video on youtube about this TK41 and I was amazed how bright it was, and people say its also about the camera adjustment so you wont see the real brightness while being recorded. I doubt a little bit, so and ordered one and when I tested  my flashlight on turbo, what I saw was on turbo, it looked like it was on medium or high mode compared to the video on youtube. I think it should be brighter but I dont know. So I'm not sure if my flashlight is the defected one or it is about right and it is how it works. I will record each of its different brightness and someone can help me determine my flashlight if its the defected one or its about right.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|As so many have, I have followed the Harry Potter series faithfully.  I'm such a \\"Potter Geek\\" that I went to the theatre to see the films when they wre released, and then wnet and bought my down DVD copy.  \\"Deathly Hallows, Part 1\\" delivered all fo theaction and special effects I expected and more.  While, I could see some of where the story was going, I must admit, I was surprised a number of times.  The actors have evolved beautifully into their roles in these films and the they do not disappoint in \\"Deathly Hallows\\" Part 1.  I've of course already bought \\"Deathly Hallows\\" Part 2, but that's another story.  Suffice it to say, the Harry Potter story is a super piece of work.  I don't recommend it for little ones, although it might be fun at first, as most know it grows darker as the series progresses.  So...now onto the books!!!  In terms of the copy I received from Amazon, again I have yet to be disappointed.  Always a good and fair price, always good service, always pristine quality.
B004X80QNG|1.0|Downloaded this on my kindle fire and it doesnt even have the ability to sync with google. Totally useless, i will be finding another calendar app to use.
0385534639|3.0|I enjoyed The Night Circus but felt there was very little story and way too much..describing scenes, settings, objects etc...I had to skim over some of it because it just drags on and on. It was also hard to follow because the timeline is so jumbled. The book spans over 30 years in the lives of Celia and Marco. But it pops back and forth. I often couldn't keep track of where the story was.<br />Overall I think this story is enjoyable but don't be surprised if you find yourself skimming over parts of it to get to the actual story.
B003ES5ZPK|1.0|I bought 2 of these units to use with my wall mounted TV. One for this TV and one for a future project. I attached the TV using my HDMI cable, selected the proper input and got a picture. I disconnected the wire from the back of the TV and added one of the adapters. No signal. OK, I say to myself let me try the other one. No signal on that one either. I put the HDMI cable back in directly and the TV picture came back. These adapters are garbage. Back to component video since the HDMI cable is quite bent behind the tv, thus the need for an adapter. RETURN ALL THE THINGS!
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|I think I've only been watching Gosling in films for a couple of years.  I certainly never watched him on tv in THE MICKEY MOUSE CLUB. Although most of his fellow and sister mousers went on to big show biz careers, usually as singers, he is the only one to emerge as a major film star (from any incarnation of the MMC). This film is the capper for an incredible year from him on film.  I hope he does very well at the awards shows because he deserves anything he wins.<br /><br />In all the other movies he made for this year, he was the best thing in them.  The difference with DRIVE is that the film is as good as he is as are the other actors in it.  However, we also have a dream team of actors here.  Albert Brooks makes an absolutely superb villain.  He even has comedy in a few of his villainous moments. Bryan Cranston (almost unrecognizable from his role as Walt in BREAKING BAD), is the weak, unlucky boss to Gosling. Carey Mulligan is the romantic interest and she is wonderful.  Christina Hendrickson from MAD MEN has a brief turn as a gun moll and she is her usual vixen self.<br /><br />Everyone who surrounds Gosling's character seems to think all he excels in is fixing cars and driving extremely well.  Yes, he is quite good at both.  However, no one seems to put together the extraordinary reflexes, instincts and fearlessness such a person would have to have not to end up as road kill. Those traits stay with him as every hurdle unfolds and they fuel the entire movie.<br /><br />There is also some breathtaking cinema here with wonderful cinematography.  The director has done a bang up job.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B005FFW46S|4.0|While Terry Pratchett's latest Discworld (and latest Watch novel) isn't quite up there with his absolute best, it's still a great read, and head and shoulders above so much of what is being published these days. Snuff finds Sam Vimes being forced into taking a country vacation to his wife's estate, where his instinctive dislike of nobility leads him into some extremely uncomfortable conversations. This sounds like the setup for a pretty great piece of fish-out-of-water social comedy, and the first quarter of the book definitely delivers that, riffing on men who are kept in their place by their wives, the relationships between nobility and their staff, and even a nicely set-up Jane Austen joke that pays off pretty well by book's end. But that only covers the first quarter of the book; it's around that point that Vimes's Watch instincts lead him to a murdered goblin whose people are demanding justice, and once again Vimes reluctantly finds himself to be the voice of social justice. It's not that this section of the book is bad, in any way - it's filled with Pratchett's usual brilliant writing and moving speeches, and even as the book gets into some dark places, Pratchett remains funny and witty in unexpected ways (I particularly enjoyed his version of a simple chicken farmer). But like a lot of his recent books, Snuff feels a little overstuffed and busy, as though Pratchett has a lot of stories he's wanting to do and not enough time to do them (something I can't help but feel may be influenced by his health). Snuff is a great read, but it never feels focused and often feels as though its scope is too large for its short length; even when I finished, there were things I didn't piece together till I was reading other people's thoughts on it, and that's not a problem I usually have with Pratchett. Did I still enjoy it? Of course - as you'd expect from Pratchett, it's funny, imaginative, complex, and even moving. But it's not as focused as I think it needs to be, and it keeps it from being among the top tier of Pratchett's work.eeps it from being among the top tier of Pratchett's work.
B0069UP2PI|4.0|This film is close to being a hybrid between a documentary and fictional tale.  It is also an ensemble cast which can be difficult to pull off but this movie manages it. Basically, a very lethal virus sweeps the world, turning into a pandemic.  There is HUGE loss of life until a vaccine is developed.  The first case which brings it into the USA is Gwyn Paltrow who flies home from Asia to Minnesota.<br /><br />POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT. ONE PERSON CONSIDERED THE REMAINDER A SPOILER SO I AM PUTTING IN A SPOILER ALERT.<br /><br />Within a very short time of being home with a cold, she goes into convulsions, is taken to the hospital and dies. Her son goes next and is replicates at swift speed after that. I never once felt that this was a science fiction film or one of these comic book based action films.  It seemed to develop exactly as such a pandemic would develop around the world.<br /><br />There is an all star cast.  It would be nice to have more screen time for some of them but then we'd miss getting the bigger picture.  People do panic, loot, try to escape, kidnap people for vaccine trades and so forth and so on.<br /><br />There is a trade off for all of this reality and ensemble acting.  That is that you never really come to care about anyone or want to explore their stories further.  You do feel sorry for Paltrow's husband, Matt Damon, and his daughter, who are left to deal with their own tragedy.  However, his character would have to be onscreen a lot longer for one to really work up a connection with his character.<br /><br />For what this film is, it is very well done and very good.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B005LY4B0A|5.0|I am not inclined to write reviews, but I felt compelled to comment about this game. It's child appropriate, easy to learn, hard to master. I hope that the developer continues to update the product. I was able to acquire this product thru Amazon free product of the day (disclosure).
B005KJZDXK|4.0|Here we have a Christmas album by Zooey Deschanel and Matt Ward.  They didn't write any new songs for the album.  These twelve songs have all been recorded by other performers (some of them hundreds of times).  But they do manage to put their own spin on these songs.  The arrangements are sparse, sometimes only with a guitar or two as accompaniment.  Of course, the main attraction for most people will be the opportunity to hear Zooey singing Christmas songs.  Personally, I like her singing here very much.  She may not sing technically \\"perfect\\" on every song, but her voice is very charming.  I particularly enjoy her singing on \\"The Christmas Waltz\\", \\"Christmas Day\\" and \\"The Christmas Song\\".  Oddly, her \\"signature\\" Christmas song from [[ASIN:B000YHG72E Elf]], \\"Baby, It's Cold Outside\\", is gender reversed with She singing the male part and Him singing the female part.  That doesn't quite work, but the rest of the album is quite good.
0810993139|5.0|This is a unique piece of literature. It's not a traditional novel. It's not a graphic novel. It certainly isn't a comic book. The front cover description \\"a novel in cartoons\\" is fitting though. This is an engaging journal of a middle school kid. New to his environment, he doesn't hesitate in attempting to make things go his way.    Neither the book nor this kid Greg is \\"Wimpy\\" - the word defined by my dictionary as \\"weak and ineffectual\\". The book is funny and witty and clever. It links all the characters and back stories very well. The narration is brisk and I flipped through it twice to appreciate the cartoons along with the storyline. Greg ain't wimpy. If anything, he seems almost as bad as his elder brother Rodrick. Of course, Greg has good intentions for all his misdeeds (unlike Rodrick).    This is a good gift for child or adult and I am 32 years old as I read and write this review. The \\"novel\\" started as author Jeff's gift to funbrain.com website, a children's site that educates in math and science and other subjects. You can read the original \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\\" at that website and is worth re-reading because the original is slightly different at parts with some cartoons and scenes not appearing in the published book you find in bookstores. That can be found here: [...] so enjoy that as a bonus from author Jeff. He certainly is talented and makes you wonder of his adventures as a child in school.    My favourite part of the book is of course Greg's friendship with his best friend Rowley and the ups and downs in it. Greg certainly ain't mature though all his intentions seem noble and beyond his age. His schemes and plans always backfire and the irony of these situations are visually delivered in simple and attractive cartoons.    All the various characters of the novel standout well and are definitely attractive parts of Wimpy Kid's World. I would recommend this book to anyone who has read graphic novels and kids above 10 years of age will appreciate thehumour the most. Pick it up at any bookstore, all of them have it showcased prominently, flip through a few days of Greg's adventures and I am sure you will be tempted to buy it.

B005OCFGTO|3.0|I was pretty excited to have this set despite some of the warning reviews I received about it just being a re=packaging of the originals. The first 3 or 4 DVDs in my own original collection have scratches in them or skip, so I simply wanted a replacement. When the set arrived, my first disappointment was that the case plastic was so flimsy and brittle, it cracked when I pulled it out of the cardboard case. Perhaps it got snagged somehow (not sure how that would happen) but I was not impressed with the fact that it broke so easily. Now, I can say with full confidence that this will not be a permanent replacement and I hope to get the special editions set when it is released. As far as the DVDs go - the other reviewers were correct - they are all of the originals just repackaged. So, there is no movie quality enhancement or anything that I hope will be a part of the special editions. I forgot how choppy some of the sequences are in the first three movies. As for price, even for the lower price tag I paid, part of me still wishes I had waited and not wasted my money now that I know that I want to replace these soon. But, that said, I still enjoy having these around. In fact, while my husband was in the hospital, we watched through them all as a way to pass the time. Gift Recommendations: Give this set to your kids (under 15) who love Harry Potter, to your babysitter, or to a fan that just wants to watch the movies. For anyone else who already owns part of the collection or knows a little Harry Potter trivia - best to wait to give the the special editions.
B00005N5RM|4.0|I like all the blob movies. The first one from the 50's is fun, the second from the seventies is also fun and coming out on blu ray sept 2016,  and this one is filled with great special effects and is fun. this is available from germany, go to amazon.de and if you have a all region player you can get this for 25.00 including shipping.<br />The blob&#34; is a remake with a satellite returning with a blob that eats anything and grows huge. I didn't like the fact that u.s. military was behind the blob and the lead villian was a scientist instead of the blob. It's not needed but the overall story is a good one in spite of this. The dvd picture is pretty good too. This one should hit blu ray hopefully someday as it was a A movie with alot of money behind it. And the effects are actually better than if they used cgi overkill , which they do on too many movies these days. Kevin Dillon is a good lead in this one and the rest of the cast does a fine job too.  The blob does what you'd expect here it eats  people in very vivid ways and I would say effects wise; that this  is one of the most successful in that regard ever.  Get superglooped with this one! Non horror movie fans shouldn't bother because you don't dig the genre anyways.
B006FTCH2E|5.0|When I first rented this movie, I watched it for a few minutes, then decided I really wanted to see something else--too slow.  I came back to it today, and just finished it.  I am soooo glad I did!  It is impossible to categorize this movie; I don't think there has ever been anything quite like it.  You never know which way it's going to go--my big question throughout most of the movie was, \\"Will she tell him or won't she?\\"  She must, but she will certainly destroy him if she does.  And the inclusion of the blind and deaf janitor -- a story line that seems to have nothing to do with the main story, but in a very satisfying way, adds to the depth of the movie.  If you absolutely must have explosions and car chases in your movies, this is not for you.  Otherwise, this is a profound movie with unexpected twists and turns, and ultimately turns out just exactly right.
B006JN5KBG|5.0|This is a limited edition blu ray which I bought a copy this week of 12/20/11.  I got mine thankfully because the sellers on here are charging alot more than I paid for it.  35.00 is what they paid for it , as did I. , and they are jacking up the price on you. sadly this only had 3,000 copies made for some dumb reason. I think that eventually this will come out in a regular edition and I will see it five years from now for ten dollars. But maybe not. SO I had no choice; as I loved this version of the movie ever since I saw it at the theater in 1985. the picture looks alot better on this blu ray for sure.  go online to search for a copy if you want one , maybe there is a copy left at 34.00 including shipping. That's what I paid. And perhaps if you wait ,years from now or sooner this will be released again. maybe. it's a bad idea to do limited edition things in my opinion. when I ordered this there was less than five hundred left. so maybe by the time anyone reads this , the only hope you will have of owning this edition is buying a one of this gouging sellers blu rays.  Anyways, this is a classic movie of a nerd who wins the girl by fighting the vampire and his kin. It's alot better than the new version and it has the late great roddy mcdowell in it as the vampire hunter. It's a salute to hammer horror films and more in this modern horror classic. The picture quality is outstanding. afte buying many blu rays with faded pictures or worse this one was completely RESTORED. Unlike lets say 'clash of the titans' from the same decade, this is just a sweet job of blu ray work.
B006P0FICE|4.0|If you can imagine Resident Evil's Milla Jovovich in (and occasionally out of) hoop skirts, you're off to a great start. The Three (plus one) have been done so many times you might think it's played out. Hardly!  Starting with the classic political intrigue, this adds some Mission Impossible-style exploits, steam-punk aerials, all-out effects, and the doofiest British royal on record. And, for once, we get a modern action/adventure babe mixed in.<br /><br />Hardly for Dumas purists, this popcorn-worthy flick dishes out what it promised: excitement, surprise, and utterly forgettable commodity entertainment.<br /><br />- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters
B00664AM5C|3.0|This movie is a decent try but it has too much sugar and euphemism to be great. The director is trying to show us the reality but he also admits that the reality is too harsh for most of us to accept.   Who wants to see dead bodies scatter all over the street and periodically explode from gases generated from decomposition? He is right. How many of us have the audacity to face the reality? Let me paint a little about the reality and then you can decide as how unrealistic this movie is.  The virus depicted in the film is NOT realistic at all and could be easily avoided by simply staying at home for two weeks because after that, all the infected hosts would be dead. A truly deadly virus doesn't kill its host so quickly. The incubation period, when the host is highly contagious but showing no symptom, should be about a few months or a little more. By the time it breaks out, it would be too late as everybody would be infected and only the immune would survive.  In reality, it is not the virus that is scary. Assuming staying at home doesn't help, an outbreak like this (killing millions with no cure in sight) would cause a major disruption in our infrastructure, particularly transportation. Given most of us depend on transportation for food and etc. to survive and hardly any of us have food that last more than a week, most of us would starve to death in a month or so.  After two weeks of food supply disruption, a major riot would set in. In major cities, only those with weapons and the willingness to kill for food would survive. After a few months or so, everybody would be killing each other for food. Only those who live in the rural area with access to farms would have a chance. They would still need to have enough weapon and enough organization in themselves to band together because a large swarm of hungry city-dwellers would immediately set upon them. They would have to decide to serve them food so that all would be starved to death shortly, kill them, be killed or allof the above.  Looting the stores and homes shown in the movie is not shocking at all. In reality, before long, it would be common to sell human body parts in meat markets and those unfortunate would be hunted down and eaten.  The government? Don't bet on that. It took FEMA a long time to supply water after Katrina, and took weeks to restore order when food was plenty. It would take probably 2 years to develop the vaccine and another 2 years or so to produce enough of that in peace time. However, because of the disruption in social order and transportation, that time could easily triple or become much longer if not never. By the time all said and done, we would be probably looking at half of the population gone if not more - most would starve to death; others would die of other diseases and unnatural causes (killed by our fellow humans).  By the way, once the looting starts, the government would quickly issue a decree to confiscate every firearm and ammunition and stop any sales of such. I laughed when I saw Matt Damon went to find guns for protection from his neighbor. For those of you who don't believe in firearms, well, if you don't believe in firearms to begin with, you should stick to your believes, be true to yourself, and wait defenselessly until they come to rob you and rape and kill your daughter. Things like this can happen and have happened many times such as LA Riot and Katrina. When law and order breaks down, it is up to you and your firearms to protect yourself and your loved ones!  For those who believe in the government, what described in the movie is quite true. The government would blockade any infected areas to prevent the infection from spreading, a procedure called &#34;quarantine.&#34; This is the primary duty of the government - to protect society as a whole. However, for those left in the quarantine zone, they would be on their own for survival in the face of brutal riots and starvation.  Hard to contemplate, right? Read some history books and read books like One Second After or Lights Out if you want a better understanding.  Oh, in such a huge outbreak, cell phone and Internet still work? I wouldn't even expect to see any electricity or water.  The movie is not too terrible but you should understand how much sugar is loaded in there. :-)

I like it so much we will be getting these for the production people in our office! Don't know how I managed without it.
B005FITIK0|2.0|Surprisingly unspectacular for a Mission: Impossible film. I'd feel kind of cheated if I paid the evening IMAX price. The sequence in the tall building is impressive, but is only a short part of the film. The climax fight in the pigeonhole parking garage was done better fifty six years ago in a film that most of the people who saw it are now dead, called 5 Against the House. The plot seems like a mishmash of Thunderball and [[ASIN:0142003263 The Spy Who Loved Me (James Bond Novels)]]. The high praise this film received from critics makes me wonder if [[ASIN:B001HN6922 Cars 2]] is actually good.
0345529057|5.0|My husband has wanted this set for quite awhile, I was sooo happy to find it on here and for such a great price.. The product arrived very quickly and in perfect condition!! My husband is going to be so happy to unwrap this!
1451627289|5.0|For those of us who are old enough 11/22/63 is a watershed day which we can remember what we were doing at the exact moment that we heard of JFK's death and the feeling of stunned disbelief that followed. If we were given the chance to stumble through a rabbit hole of time as King's main character, Jake Epping was would we try to change the event and the course of history?<br /><br />This is the basic plot line of Stephen King's 11/22/63. Jake Epping a thirty-five year old high school English teacher is shown a \\"rabbit hole\\" in time which takes him to September 1958, by a friend who proposes that he go back and change the events of that renown day.<br /><br />Following Jake through history we are reminded both of the goodness of the times for which so many wax nostalgic, but also the seamy underside of the times, the signs on the bathrooms and buses. We visit some wonderful welcoming places, but also places in which every stranger is treated with distrust.<br /><br />We learn the past is obdurate, as King says it doesn't want to be change it and perhaps Jake Epping is tilting at windmills to change it. We are given an unpleasant glimpse at Lee Harvey Oswald and enough of one not to regret his passing.<br /><br />What was most surprising about 11/22/63, was the wonderful love story at the heart of it. Perhaps one of the best and most moving that I have read in years. I really will not say more so as not to ruin the surprise of it for the readers.<br /><br />I freely admit to loving any book about time travel, so 11/22/63 would be appealing to me, but King's excellent research about the time, the tension and the feeling of danger of the unexpected and the eerie atmosphere which King does so well, the uncertainty of the end result and the wonderful characters make the book.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Our son adores this movie, and we got a travel DVD player for our kids so when I found this I was so excited!!! The price was outstanding and it arrived very quickly.. We can't wait for our son to see it!!!
0375703764|5.0|I read this book as a self dare, as I consider it a challenge to my wit when some piece of media comes out and is acclaimed as shocking. I was told that this novel was horrifying, and I was informed correctly, but what I didn't expect was a ground-breaking, complex narrative with stunning finesse and visual stimulation. One of my favorite novels of all time, and certainly the most innovative piece of literature of the last decade.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|This Blue Ray dvd is a very good buy! Her voice is amazing, her songs the best. This is something you need to have at home for every occasion. Being alone and listening to her amazing songs, having a dinnerparty. Buy it!

B004JZBGWI|5.0|this is a really good app. it does everything it should.  never had any problems with it.  also can send from note to text feature is very useful.
B0015DROBO|5.0|It is a really wonderful book to read.  The description of characters, places and happenings is so good that it makes you believe you are really there.  The story line is first class and moves at a gripping pace.  The way that the heroine Salander is portrayed means that in spite of what might be classed as her downside by the more prudish people (due to her variable sexuality), it is impossible not to fall in love with her and find yourself urging her on to the very end of the book.  In the book there is the wonderful episode where she makes her abusive guardian (both sexually and otherwise) pay the ultimate penalty for his sins.  Hooray!  It is like-ably gory and VERY enjoyable.  The remaining two books in The Millennium Trilogy are like two parts of the same book, not having a defined break between them.  I bought the Kindle edition of the books and found them to be one of the best purchases I have ever made because of the way that they are written making them absolutely compulsive reading.  Like all well constructed literature, the trilogy has a proper ending which complies with the involved feelings of the reader.  My rating for all three is 10 stars out of 5!!!<br /><br />David Hodder, U.K.

Overall, since I've read this book, I've chosen to live my life happy for myself, my daughter and my partner and for my entire family. There is nothing wrong with living a positive happy life.
B005TQAI6G|5.0|This DVD is really fun to sing along to. She has some great new takes on some old songs. Her concert is full of energy and excitement! It's obviously not as great as being at the concert, which was amazing; however, I'd still recommend it!

B00534MGBY|2.0|Simplistic, repetitive, ultra-boring quasi bluesy guitar noodlings by the Great Edgar Froese weave in and out of this experimental soundscape and basically ruin it for me.  Honestly, I'm a totally self-taught guitarist, and he sounds like what I used to play when I was sixteen years old and trying to do my Jimmy Page impersonations.  Staccato one note riffs that slide up and down the scales are just downright bad, and Froese didn't have the chops back then to pull it off.  He certainly got better with time (listen to him on Stratosfear) but this effort is just annoyingly, cloyingly hard to listen to.
0446585025|1.0|This could be fun for some.  I found it difficult to stay interesting.  Apparently it is difficult to transfer standup to paper.
B000002KB8|4.0|What would my discography reviews of Ozzy's albums be without reviewing his Black Sabbath stuff too? Incomplete that's what.  One major strength of this album is the history behind it. This is probably metal's first album, right here. You won't hear me giving out any glowing praise on the production. Frankly I'm not a fan of the Black Sabbath sound at all. Generally I find that any covers I've heard have much better sounds, even Ozzy's live album, Speak Of The Devil, but fortunately I can look beyond that. This thing was probably the darkest album ever released, at its time.  The playing is solid, as you'd expect. Iomi is known for his riffs. The drummer seems to mix in a bit of a jazzy style at times. In addition to drums standing out, which really doesn't happen often enough, the album also has very noticeable bass, and it's played very nicely. Everyone has the opportunity to shine on this disc. Ozzy sounds fairly interesting, and probably slightly more normal than he would later, but I like his style from say Never Say Die through No More Tears. He has a very unique voice, and actually he's had several unique voices, because he's changed so much over the decades. Most vocalists today can't come up with 1 unique vocal style.  Overall this is a landmark album, and a very good one. My main complaint is its presentation. It seems several versions group tracks together, when they shouldn't be. N.I.B. should be its own track. Otherwise this is a very solid album.  Black Sabbath 8/10 classic tune, very slow and dark. There's a very sinister feel to it. I like the faster part which comes in later. There's a cool effect on the guitars during this part as well.  The Wizard 9/10 is a catchy song kind of up tempo, with actually an interesting tempo, not like most songs. Love the drumming in this one. Ozzy's vocals are solid, and Iomi's riffs are good. The harmonica adds something different to the song as well. Overall another Sabbath classic.  Behind The Wall Of Sleep 7/10 is a decent trackNot heavy, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Ozzy uses an effect on his vocals, which was probably inventive at the time.  N.I.B. 10/10 is another Black Sabbath classic. The riff is classic, and catchy, if for some reason you haven't heard it. The vocals are solid, with a good melody. The drums again add their own flare to the mix. Overall a very good song.  Wicked World 8/10 is a solid rocker, mid tempo ish I gues. There are more jazzy drum beats, and a catchy riff played in parts of the song.  The Warning 6/10 is a slower song, with some great melodies. Again the drums stand out. Iomi fills in with some nice guitar licks. Myy reason for giving this middle of the road marks instead of a high rating is the instrumental which lasts forever, way longer than it should.  Evil Woman 7/10 is a decent up tempo rocker. It's a bit simple, especially in the chorus, but it's pretty enjoyable.  Overall this is in a way the reason I like music today. Not that it was the first album I heard, but it was the album to start the hard rock, heavy metal genre, and for that alone, plus being a very solid album this will go down in history as a landmark achievement. And this is also a must own for any Sabbath, Ozzy, or rock or metal fan. Know your history, and it all started here.
B005H0IW6W|2.0|Though a big fan of Buble I must say this CD reminded me of the let down one experiences when you're opening a gift from a friend and it ends up being something odd that makes you say to yourself - what? why? geez....  Though there are number of good tracks like \\"Jingle Bells,\\" All I want for Xmas,\\" \\"Holly Jolly Xmas,\\" \\"I'll be home for Xmas,\\" \\"Cold December,\\" all are nice but none are so wonderful they make you shout, YEA!  There are also many odd or downright awful tracks like \\"Have yourself a Merry Xmas,\\" \\"Ave Maria,\\" \\"Blue Xmas,\\" \\"Santa Buddy,\\"  a wierd re-do of Eartha Kitt's classic, \\"Santa BABY,\\" and the wierdest \\"White Xmas,\\" ever with mis-matched country singer, Shania Twain, yodeling out THE Xmas pop song most like a national hymn-?! WHO selected her and WHY did they chose this song?    As many others have either raved or groaned about this album in the many reviews already posted I'll just add that though Buble's intentions may have been sincere with this album he unfortunately missed the marked.  Firstly the quality of the recording itself is lacking, perhaps because there were so many different producers and engineers working on it that there is no true artistic flow.  This recording also lacks the big-band sound that has been so present on many of Michael's other more successful hits - but here there is little definition of the back up instruments and instead we get a wash of sound (I found myself wondering if it they were \\"real\\" strings or merely synthesizers, and no crisp, tight ensemble,(there is a very nice guitarist playing back-up on \\"Ill be home for Xmas,\\" named Grahm Dechter).  Most of the arrangements themself seem to lack \\"zip\\" and uniquesness found in many of Michael's other recordings, again, ONE artistic director might have guided this christmas sleigh much more successfully.  Instead many have some quirky \\"new\\" arrangement or sound, like \\"White Xmas,\\" which has never been stranger than heard here.  Here lies the biggest disappointment forme; the inconsistency of arrangments and singing on this much anticipated holiday album.  Michael - WHAT were you thinking? -- \\"Santa BUDDY\\" ???!!!  \\"Blue Chirstmas,\\"  ???? \\"Ave Maria?\\" (with many errors in the proununciation of the Latin, oh, and this masterpiece was written by Franz Schubert,one of the greatest composers of German Lieder/Song ever, not \\"traditional\\" as so wrongly listed in the jumbled, hard to read, poorly edited, program notes!    Unlike Buble's first great, brief holiday album, LET IT SNOW, this one will not be getting played much and I sure won't be giving it as a lovely gift to friends as it is just too inconsistent, lackluster, and wierd.  Hard to know why such an important project missed the mark, but here's hoping Michael hires a great arranger, a great producer and a great sound engineer and turns out a higher quality album, in Nelson Riddle/Frank Sinatra fashion, and puts some zip and zing in another, better thought out, produced and executed, new holiday album.   Merry Christmas!  jpd / Grand Junction, CO

B002VPE1WK|3.0|Okay the bag was bought at an excellent price and well below the standard cost of bags like this. There is a plenty of storage for DSLR and 5-6 lenses or 3 lenses and other accessories. I keep a DSLR with a mounted lens, two other lenses, two speed light flashes, battery charger, batter charger for Nicad batters for flashes, ample SD cards, almost all my screen on type filters and a mono-pod if strapped to the side. No way do I carry all that stuff on a shoot but it stores everything nicely and makes it a breeze to transfer to a day pack. I have how ever used it as a day pack and the straps fell apart. The straps are also not made for full size man with broad shoulders. Amazon had my replacement to me in two days and shipped the bad one back, no big deal. If you plan on using this as a day pack expect the straps to come apart, they aren't heavy duty. If you wear larger than a Large T-shirt don't expect this bag to fit right.  For what it is it's an excellent value. If the straps on this bag fall apart I will just cut them, I haven't even untied them yet on the new bag.

B00656C6KK|4.0|...you haven't talked to in ages.  I was not around for Day's commercial prime as a singer or actress, but my mom was, and as a result I grew up on both her music and her films. I have to say, this collection isn't perfect, but in it's best moments it's simply sublime.  Of the newer tracks, my favorite is \\"The Way I Dreamed It\\". I actually got a bit choked up hearing it because, again, that familiar voice was singing to me again. Warm, subtle, tender, endearing...she's positively radiant on the song. At the end, when she says \\"forever\\", it's like a bit of heaven.   I'm also loving her cover of \\"Daydream\\", the original \\"Heaven Tonight\\" (featuring slightly risque lyrics...Doris says she's heating up the hot tub and giving her man a back rub!), and of course the classic stuff she included on this CD. It's not exactly the most cohesive album I've ever heard, and not every song is a home run, but in this instance i doubt that even matters. It's still a joy to listen.    What an unexpected pleasure, to hear from this old friend again.

B004HO6I2O|1.0|1.  Man, this is one of those movies where you actually feel... sorry about the state of humanity or at least Hollywood for putting forth such completely pathetic \\"comedy\\".  The movie is so contrived, the acting is lousy, the characters are so pathetic by their quest to appear so cool.<br />2.  The only more concerning about the \\"lameness\\" of this film is the audience to which it caters to.  Please do yourself a favor and don't subject yourself to this film;  it is really bad material for all humanity.
B000069KE0|4.0|I'm not a big band or Jazz super enthusiast, but in truth this is really a Rock Band with big instrumentation. To me this is their best I liked CTA but II is really up there the vocals are powerful it is almost a thematic album with such powerful numbers as Make Me Smile and Color My World. This is the place to really start and put them on par with the likes of the great Canadian group Lighthouse. Highly recommended.
1849514003|5.0|I think this is a great book, but, be warned: it is huge and, at times, complicated. The most impressive thing about the book is that it contains unique recipes that I haven't seen in other books: voice recognition, vehicles, non-tiled isometric games, side-scroller AI, midi keyboard, Lua scripting and dynamic lighting.  The book is written in a simple tutorial style that gets to the point of things fast. The writing could be better, but, the code is always laid out in a very logical and straightforward fashion.  Applying the code to your existing project usually involves simply copying some source files. In some cases this process is more difficult because of iOS frameworks that need to be linked up.  Each chapter covers a specific topic of game development:  Chapter 1, Graphics, starts with some simple drawing and animation but moves on quickly to more advanced stuff like 3D cubes. Some of the recipes seem kind of random but most are really useful. The last recipe is especially cool. In that one you create a side scroller that has dynamic lighting.  Chapter 2, User Input, is exactly what you'd expect. The most common user inputs are covered including various touch types, a D-Pad, an analog stick, pinching to zoom, etc.  Chapter 3, Files and Data, gives us a bunch of ways to save data. This includes hi-scores, difficulty and character data. Some of it is redundant and there he doesn't mention which way is best. Should I use PLIST files or Core Data? Otherwise, its a good chapter.  Chapter 4, Physics, is a great chapter. This is where the book really gets cool. This chapter includes bullets, vehicles, and isometric games among other things. My only complaint is that the vehicle mechanics were a little wonky, but, the fact that I can make a vehicle is cool nonetheless. Also, zooming an isometric game is awesome.  Chapter 5, Scenes and Menus, is probably the most boring chapter of the book, but, its all useful stuff. The menus and other things here are not very flashy, but, they get the job done.  Chapter 6, Audio, starts out with Cocos2d basics. Here he explains the basics of audio that can get multiple channels of sounds and music to your game. Then he goes on to more (really) advanced stuff like recording your voice and a cool midi piano. The final recipe introduces voice recognition. You can basically make your own version of Siri with this thing, though, its really complicated. It has its own project file which is really large and takes forever to build.  Chapter 7, AI and Logic, is an awesome chapter. After a few very important recipes with important AI behavior like flocking and projectile aiming, we see a number of recipes that computer controlled characters can use to move around. The side scrolling one was especially cool. Think of Goombas in mario jumping over pipes and chasing after you! The chapter finishes with some Lua scripting recipes. The last one is a neat little conversation tree game made using Lua.  Chapter 8, Tips, Tools and Ports, is a bit of a letdown. Here he goes over the Cocos2d Testbed that anyone who is making a game should already know about. Then its on to tools like Tiled, CocosBuilder, Zwoptex and one I never heard of, JSONWorldBuilder. The \\"ports\\" are Cocos2d-X (C++) and Cocos3D. These seem cool, but, they don't really get you past basic setup and initialization of these frameworks. This chapter ends with a really useful recipe explaining the App Store submission process and how you button your app up for sale.  The extra Chapter, Ads, Networking and Social Integration, is available if you email the author on the book website. This chapter is complex. It explains ads, Facebook, Twitter and a bunch of networking stuff for chat, voice and P2P gameplay. A few of the apps require multiple devices to test and I couldn't really get the final networked gameplay one working.  Conclusion: Overall, this is a very good book. The unique recipes make up for some of the less interesting recipes. Highly recommended.
B00000DOZJ|4.0|This to me is a bit of an odd sort of album and as a follow up to Foxtrot and Genesis Live I'm not sure exactly what they were trying to work out. It certainly has many beautiful songs ie I Know What I Like, Cinema Show and Dancing With The Moonlite Knight. There skill is obvious on this album but we would have to wait for the Lamb for them to really burst out of their shell.
054531058X|5.0|this is a book I just did not want to put down.  It was amazing !!! the story is so original and good . the writing is also amazing and wonderful and very very good . I loved everything about this book ! it's different than what i've read before but it's definitely worth the time . i highly recommend buying this book . you wont regret it ! it is such a page turner and thats what i love about books like this is that you can't put it down because you always want to know what happens next . I can't wait to read the second book !!!! 5 stars and if i could give this book 10 stars i wouldI heard about the hunger games on the internet so i decided to get the kindle edition .
B0036OS3Q0|5.0|My mom bought these for me through Amazon for an early Christmas gift.  I live in Minnesota and had bought a pair of expensive Columbia boots last winter and was very disappointed in them...they hurt my feet!  I needed to find another pair that would not only keep my feet warm and dry, but that would also not cause my feet to hurt.  These are AWESOME!  If you've ever worn Crocs, then you know pretty  much what to expect.  So far, I can't find any other brand of shoes that are as comfortable on my feet as the Crocs are.  These are no exception.  They provide pretty good arch support and they conform to my feet.  Take Note:  You will almost certainly have to go up a size in these boots.  I'm not sure what the deal is with Crocs, but they tend to run small.  I wear a size 10 shoe, but I *always* have trouble with the Crocs sizing.  In both these boots and the Mammoth Crocs, I have to size up to 11.  Doing so makes them almost too roomy, but it's much better than having my toe hit the front of the boot.  Great boots at a pretty competitive price.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Except the program crashed when it asked me to write a review about it. I like how it syncs to my computer and is easy to use.
B005KA188S|3.0|I love a remake that's not simply a redo of its source material. Fright Night 2011 brings several new story elements to the table without destroying the integrity of the 1985 original. Now...if I had to choose and put one of the two movies in a time capsule as an example of a great horror movie I'd hands down pick the original. But Fright Night 2011 is pretty good has some darn scary moments.<br /><br />While Fright Night 1985 had a good mix of horror and humor, Fright Night 2011 sticks mostly to the spooky. Colin Farrell is the new Jerry Dandridge (the guy with the fangs) and Jerry likes to snack on high schoolers. Kind of like that other Jerry in the news today from Penn State. Up and comer Anton Yelchin is Charlie Brewster who makes it his personal business to take Jerry down.<br /><br />Like I said, there are some genuinely scary moments and I was entertained from start to relatively quick finish. The movie has an R rating but it seemed more deserving of a PG-13 to me.<br /><br />If you haven't seen [[ASIN:0767817664 the original]], check it out sometime; it's one of the better 80s cult classics that holds up really well to the current day. As for Fright Night 2011....it's no collector's item but a worthy rental for sure.

B0009P5YXO|4.0|This is a great toy for children, collectors and cosplayers alike. I personally love it and am not ashamed to admit that i carry it around with me sometimes just to feel like The Doctor. But unfortunately it was a little loose and i was afraid the light would fall out of the handle so i tightened the screw a lot, but now the screw no longer turns. Learn from my mistake, if it is loose don't tighten it too much or else the screw wont work anymore. Also both of the pen nibs work fine, but i really have no use for them and they also get very loose and fall off causing the whole screwdriver to feel unbalanced and strange in your hands which dissolves the illusion of an actual screwdriver and feels like a toy. I wish that the manufacturer did not include these nibs and made the screwdriver all one piece similar to the other Doctor Who Screwdrivers on the market, which would make more sense and would avoid all problems listed above. But, whatever, life goes on and i have a sonic screwdriver. Beggars cant be choosers. Overall, it's a great product, and is very similar to the one David Tennamt uses in Doctor who.
B005HSL626|3.0|It's a very simple game with no violence. (Unless you count cutting fruit violent.) My boy friend and I took turns playing it with my young nieces, and they loved it! And truth be told it is very addictive, but the ads do tend to ruin the excitement sometimes. This version actually has more blades then the paid version. So if you don't mind ads its an excellent download.
B004G6009K|5.0|I love this movie, the animation is a big improvement ove other Disney movies and the 3D is great, I like the lights, at least one of the lanterins at the end of the light show, I can reach out and put my hand right through it. Just one problem I have with these, Why can't they just have the BR and BR-3D disks in there and leave out the DVD and digital disks, lower the price some almost $40 is too much to pay for a movie nowa days and the main reason I am not buying any more. 3D is nice but not at that price!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a very fun app and it is also great because it is free. You cannot beat free. yay
B005KJZDXK|1.0|I am so grateful that Amazon lets customers listen to sample cuts. Now I know what NOT to waste my time or money on listening to what could be the most ill-conceived Christmas musical album of all time. Alvin and the Chipmunks has more verve.    Who told Zoey Deschanel she could sing? She has a wheezy, thin voice that sounds as if she was taking hits on a cigarette (or stronger) while recording. These wonderful holiday classics have been wrung dry of any juice, style or emotion. MEH.   And, that too precious by half cover art. Those of us who know and appreciate musical recordings of that era are not fooled.    I rate it three lumps of coal.
B0055SWM08|4.0|love the game it has awesome graphics.  and great puzzles.  would recommend this game to others to play would not mind if it was free tho.

B0000E2FLC|5.0|I've never seen AC/DC live & after watching this show I really regret it. They totally impressed me with their live performance. One major surprise to me was the fact that I presumed Brian was the front man for the group as singers usally take center stage. Wrong! Angus is the real star of the show, & revels in the limelight. His energy & skill blew me away. Brian compliments Angus but he could never steal Angus' thunder. The rest of the guys are really solid musically & they deserve all the fame they have aquired.  AC/DC are a great band & this shows big-time in this video, so much so I think I'll buy their  'Live At River Plate' blu-ray next.

0007345623|5.0|I just love Lindsey Kelk's writing. She has a very funny way of putting characters across and Angela Clark is a perfect example of that. The I Heart series started with I Heart New York, followed by I Heart Hollywood and then I Heart Paris. Her latest release I Heart Vegas features Angel and her pals as she seems to get herself in a pickle.<br /><br />The first I Heart Book I read I enjoyed but wasn't overly in love with. Fast forward to today, the day I completed I Heart Vegas and you will find a woman that is slightly in love with Angela Clarke, and wants her very own Angela for Christmas!!!<br /><br />For people who haven't read previous books in the series, it doesn't matter you could still pick this book up and read it no worries. But if like me you want to get to know the characters and the story behind Angela ending up in New York then start at the beginning of the series.<br /><br />By this point in Angela's life she is living in New York with her boyfriend Alex and things are going swimmingly. There is however one sticking point, and a rather major one at that. Angela's visa has expired and as she's no longer working it's a bit of a problem.  The first few chapters of the book were amusing but not rip roaringly funny, but it was fun to see Angela get herself into all sorts of trouble (as usual) while she tries desperately to appear as if everything is okay to Alex. When her friend Jenny decides that a weekend trip to Vegas is the way to cheer them up, she has no idea what will end up happening.<br /><br />At this point in the book the humour goes from amusing, to cringe-worthy embarrassment but laugh out loud funny. Angela's friend Jenny is a rude, brash and very outgoing sort of girl and the two of them together get themselves into some very awkward situations. The theme behinds the whole story makes for great reading and although Angela is a hopeless case you can't help wishing that everything works out okay for her.<br /><br />By the last part of the book I literally couldn't put it down and just had to go right through to the end. This sort of read is classic chick lit. The mix of two girls on a crazy weekend in Vegas, especially with the stunts they manage to pull off as well as the romance behind the story made for a fabulous read and possibly the best in the I Heart series.<br /><br />The only downside is that I have to wait impatiently for the next instalment some time next year entitled I Heart London.go right through to the end.

B000FC1MCS|5.0|The problem with five-star books is that it's hard to describe them and give an opinion, when all you want to do is gush and quote things and interrupt yourself and giggle and find more books just like them. Brilliant book. Funny, and sad too.     Obviously opinions on this book vary. I do, however, agree with many reviewers on one thing - I preferred the first half of the book to the second. I found Christopher much less sympathetic towards the end, which had me wondering if he was actually incapable of any kind of change, or if that was just the choice the author made. Regardless, it's a good story told with a unique voice, and I'll definitely be reading more books by Haddon.
158270208X|5.0|I just ordered my 7th Secret Gratitude Journal. I've filled in 3 myself and given the others as gifts. My morning ritual of writing down the things I'm grateful for plants my feet firmly on a positive path to follow each day. It's downright scary how many entries on my \\"Gratitude Intentions\\" side have manifested in my life...seemingly impossible things, yet, I kept writing about them until they happened. This is an exceptionally valuable tool during these trying times.

B004097IKW|5.0|Why there is such a relatively modest selection of Bellini operas on DVD is beyond me ... I know - supply and demand ... why such an apparently modest demand?  Anyway ... to me Bellini's music is wonderful, as is this Decca DVD offering featuring Juan Diego Florez and Nino Machaidze.<br /><br />After becoming captivated by the Cedolins/Ganassi Norma of 2007 and by Eglise Gutierrez's Amina in La Sonnambula, and Bellini's music in general on various audio recordings, I was determined to add I Puritani to my collection.<br /><br />Thankfully, I was not persuaded to look elsewhere because of a few critical reviews concerning the soprano Ms. Machaidze.  I found nothing at all wrong with her stage presence and acting ... and vocally (while i am not an expert on perfect bel canto technique), her singing was more than satisfying :-)<br /><br />  - A couple of weeks ago, only half kiddingly, I told my wife that I had found the most beautiful piece of music ever ... Natalie Dessay's version of Elvira's mad scene \\"O rendetemi la speme ... Qui la voce sua soave ... Vien diletto\\" from this opera's Act II - nearly 17 minutes of bliss.  So I was a little apprehensive as to how well it would sound on this performance because of the critical reviews.  Fear not - it is wonderful and beautiful, as is the rest of the performance.<br /><br />Together, Juan Diego Florez and Ms. Machaidze are perfectly complimentary.  In their duets, neither vocalist overpowers the other. Their reunion duet in the middle of Act III was outstanding and received a well deserved and spirited ovation of almost two minutes.<br /><br />The supporting cast was fine, and the chorus sounded good too.<br /><br />Visually, the minimalist staging was fine, and the costumes were attractive.  Personally, I find black, grey, and dark blue quite pleasing - and that is the predominant color scheme throughout the opera.  One reviewer took exception to the dark lighting ...  this only occurs in small segments here and there and must have been by design.  Most often though, the singers were sufficiently visible.  Overall, the video of this DVD is quite fine, as is the audio.  5 stars !!!  And, more Bellini please!rs were sufficiently visible.  Overall, the video of this DVD is quite fine, as is the audio.  5 stars !!!  And, more Bellini please!

B005HV6Y5W|2.0|While watching this film last evening I couldn't help but wonder what a group of feminists would think of these parents.  I grew up as a fraternal twin with eight other children who couldn't wait to leave an abusive and weekend drunk of a father who gave our mother nothing but a lifetime of pain.  Enduring Brad Pitt's bullying was more than I could tolerate.  And trying to make him sympathetic as a church organist was unrealistic and contrary to his John Wayne posturing.  His rule with a firm hand relationship concerning his three sons was repetitive and monotonous.  And his wife was reduced to a doormat.  One son was emotionally disturbed by his father's behavior and we saw this son giving us endless and endless sullen looks that said \\"Isn't he cruel\\"?  That is when the repetitive scenes became laughable.  Sean Penn shows up as this grown-up child and wanders in slick contemporay buildings of glass and chrome  ....  we also see Sean looking LOST walking over a very rocky terrain and later, a sandy landscape with a (get this!)door frame that he walks through.  Mr. Pitt loses his job and the family packs up to move on.  The film ends with the thre young sons, their parents and other men, women and children congegating on the beach with the birds flying overhead, the sky is beautiful blue, the heavenly choir is soaring and yes, even Sean Penn is there too.  A palm d'or for this?    I have seen all of Mr. Malick's films  and own three of them.  A true cinematic poet.  But this film I donated to the library.  What a dissapointment. It is simply not accessible.
B000WWFRM2|5.0|When I heard Dave Gahan of Depeche Mode was striking out on his own with his first album, Paper Monsters, I was curious as to how it would sound. I was curious because of having read interview after interview of what he listens to personally, what he was really into at the time, so I figured that those artists/bands would have a big influence on the music he would make on his own. I was surprised, however, to find Paper Monsters to be quite like a Depeche Mode album, which is not a bad thing seeing as I've been a huge DM fan for more than half of my life! I was very impressed with Mr. Gahan's freshman album, it was well written with lyrics that made me stop and wonder, more than once, what was going through him when he wrote it. I love when that happens. SO when Hourglass came about I figured I'd love that as well but it turned out I was incorrect...I thought it was so far superiour to PM that it wasn't even fair to compare the two albums! I love love LOVE Hourglass, the songs are melodic, the lyrics strong and Dave's voice sounds amazing! I would say that if you're a fan of Depeche Mode but maybe not so much Dave's first album then Hourglass is for you!
0553801473|5.0|I am so delighted to get this book and now I will be able to find out what happened to my favorite characters in this series.  I really enjoy George R. R. Martin writing style and how he can make you feel like you are there and how through he is in everything.
B002T9H2LA|4.0|*** POSSIBLE SPOILERS ***  The reviewers who fault this film because it's unauthentic to history or because the military aspects are absurd are totally missing the point.  This film is a FANTASY!  It uses historical elements to weave, what for me at least, is an emotionally satisfying revenge story.  It's a \\"what if\\", or better, \\"if only\\" take on what some of us might imagine doing if we could have.    The editing is pretty tight for such a long film, and I didn't really notice the length at all when I watched it.  Christoph Waltz (Col. Landa) is a perfect villain.  As another reviewer said, it's hard to imagine this guy had a mother!  I enjoyed Brad Pitt's over-the-top portrayal of the Basterds' commander, Lt. Aldo Raine.  But it was a little much to hear his deeply Tennessee-accented Italian not cause an immediate reaction by Landa or just about every other German in the room!  I just couldn't maintain suspension of disbelief through that scene.  Only one other sequence really bothered me.  Shortly after killing the German movie star who was also an English spy, ostensibly because she was a traitor, Landa proposes becoming a traitor himself.  This just doesn't make emotional sense to me in any way.  The final scene, where Landa is \\"branded\\", serves as a nice fantasy antidote to all the real-life Nazis who tried to hide their former lives in foreign countries.  All in all, a very enjoyable film.  Not for pre-teens; this film is much too violent.
0671798154|4.0|A great book providing realism that makes you `feel' like you are there. Does a good job of not contradicting known minute historical details about the world of Hitler's Germany, yet manages a way to add intrigue. It retains the moral high-ground of `Nazi's are bad', and then turns you loose to enjoy the fact they were human also... now lets go shoot a few of them if they get in our way.<br /><br />Set in the final fanatical days of the end of the Third Reich, this book provides accurate but not over-bearing details that make you feel that you are really there, yet provides a plausible story of a Jason Bourne type super hero, believable if you want to believe, which gives you a confident feeling of security in the most dangerous land on the earth.<br /><br />With Stephen King as a `10', how does this rate? About a 5 (that's very good).<br /><br />Action? Ok (that's good)<br /><br />Readable? Very. Words do not clunk along, forcing the reader to try to figure out some pithy obscure meaning. I enjoy pithy books for about a page, then I fall asleep.<br /><br />Could I put it down? Absolutely. It's not that good.<br /><br />No foul language. No sex. But still a good book.

B002VPEAOE|5.0|i loved this book. it starts just befor ww1 and ends in current time. its the story of an aristocratic family through generations. but its told from the view of one of the servants. definitely worth reading. i really liked the characters even the ones not so likable.  it's set in england and tells all the upstairs downstairs intrigue along with the story of the children of the family. i like books that tell a story about generations of families.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|One of the best films I've seen, and unique. Claire Danes is just brilliant. The real Temple Grandin is a fascinating person (saw her on Oprah once I think), great acting job by Danes, great supporting cast, and wonderfully filmed and edited. The editing uses cuts and simple visual flourishes to illustrate how Temple's mind is working, which really helps you as the viewer grasp what she means when she says \\"I think in pictures.\\" This is a very charming, funny and also thought-provoking look at someone worth looking at. I highly recommend this to anyone, no matter what your age or demographic.
B001TODO54|5.0|It was a wonderful book that I could not put down. It's a beautiful story with developing characters, captivating twists, and an ending to be content with but yearn for more.
B005HXGE9G|2.0|Nice cover image - anyone know what it is ?  Really don't care for the secondary female vox - Ane Brun and Melanie Gabriel (kin?).  Sorry, but track after track, they intrude and ruin what might have been worthy efforts.  Exasperating.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|I had been using V Cast Song ID for a few years and been alright with it. then I tried Sound Hound and that was definitely better and faster.

0743455967|4.0|Really. It belongs in any writers toolbox. It isn't THE best book out there on writing, but in my opinion, it's one of the most honest.  I've seen reviews from some who said that Mr. King came across as arrogant, smug, etc. I did not see this.  Some people are unaware that Mr. King was nearly killed while writing this book, which is why it came out several years after he actually started it. Yes, I noticed a change in the writing, but after reading how bad the accident was, I understand. Near death experiences can affect us mentally, even if we don't notice it.<br /><br />One of my favorite parts of this book is where Mr. King tells us to: \\"Write with the door closed. Rewrite with it open.\\" He is so right. I've seen it in my own writing.  This is a book that belongs on every writer/author's bookshelf.
B005K2YTG4|5.0|I don't now why other people don't like this. It does everything I want: it protects my Kindle, it's (relatively) cheap, and it doesn't take up a lot of space. I also like holding my Kindle bare, and I like that you don't have to strap it into this thing. Note: I have the least expensive 6\\" Kindle, and it fits fine.
B00006JJ2Y|5.0|Saw many of these shows at The Bottom Line, I can even hear myself on the record so you can imagine the intimate setting and accoustics..The place was jammed for every show, Lou was full of swagger,smoking,lighting up as you can hear the match on the CD...It was a total fun bunch of shows and the band was tight, great version of Sweet Jane and I wanna Be Black as well as the rest of The Coney Island Baby era material..The rap was funny and Lou was in control.<br />Being fortunate to see him at the Sally Can't Dance tour at NY's Felt Forum (MSG) (with the turnicate act and his regal entrance like James Brown with someone taking off his robe,these memories endure)and these shows hooked me on Lou Live.<br />There are many aspects to the man reflected in his albums and personas but this is a very interesting CD ahead of it's time because of the attitudanal rapping coming from someone from Freeport.<br />The music is just fine.
B005TQACLC|5.0|I definetely recommend this show. It is a great show, with great dancing. I was on one of the shows of the tour myself and I could not see all the detais and great performances the DVD shows you.  Its definetely a must have!
B0012YYZYK|5.0|Hi, this is my first review.  Reading another reviews from Blu-Ray recital, have to say the sound is awesome, perfectly synchronized without synchronizing on the bluray player. So, buy without fear. 100% recommended, and the quality of the image is really good for the time. Viewing best than other bluray movies from the same age.
B005KJZDXK|5.0|I always loved musicians who create Christmas albums and I was especially fond of the Baby, it's Cold Outside of her and Michael Ward. I always revert back to my favorite Christmas cds around this time but, I think this album will be around.
B005C5A6C0|5.0|Buy this album right now.  Don't sit there and debate the purchase any longer, just buy it already.  Be warned though, you might have trouble listening to any thing else for some time after you put this in your player.  I can't seem to remove it from my play list, this album has got me by the balls.  It is in my head all day at work, and I have to put on the headphones and give it a spin before I go to sleep now.  Locust is the master of the disc, although the entire disc is great Locust is possibly the best metal song I have passed onto my ears in a very long time.  It is so beautifully brutal and lyrically powerful it just stands on a pedestal above the rest.  I Am Hell is a monster epic that starts the album off, and is followed by Be Still And Know, my second favorite track on here.  This Is The End is fast frantic and blistering guitar and drum work.  Darkness Within is a slower paced but still heavy track, not the strongest offering but a good song just the same.  Pearls Before The Swine picks it back up and pulls you back in strong, and the album finishes with the oddball Who We Are.  This is the one let down on the disc, I just don't care for it.  It just sounds out of place on here. It does drop the momentum and contrasts with every other song surrounding it.  The bonus/special edition comes with a short \\"making of\\" DVD, and 2 covers, which I will quick review below.  I Am Hell - 10/10  Be Still And Know - 10/10  Locust - 11/10  This Is The End - 9/10  Darkness Within - 8/10  Pearls Before The Swine - 9/10  Who We Are - 6/10  covers  Judas Priest : The Sentinel - 10/10  Rush : Witch Hunt - 7/10

I really wish we wouldn't have paid for a virius and am still upset that it crashed our computer and we still haven't been able to watch this episode.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love this book - that a female lead character could be so intelligent, cunning, & brave...not surprising that it is written by a female author.  The characters are rich and sympathetic; and the country Panem is so obviously a vision of what the U.S. may look like in a hundred years or so when energy sources & resources have been drained.

B005PK1G76|5.0|I purchased this for our peg perego uno stroller since all pegs seem to come with is a flimsy little cup holder - I was glad to find this attachable caddy. It holds two drinks and whatever random smaller things you  may need to throw in the middle like a wallet, keys, tissues, etc.<br /><br />It attaches by velcro loops on either side which are easy to fasten and they are pretty long so they would accommodate different sizes of strollers pretty easily. The fabric seems very sturdy and strong. It looks like it would be washable but not sure on that.
B0013FSL0C|4.0|I'm ashamed of myself - as a confirmed sceptic about the validity and efficacy of psychotherapy - but I found this series quite addictive. Following four patients over the course of nine weeks is intriguing in itself (despite the psychobabble involved) because the stories develop and build but what really kindled my interest was the fact that the therapist himself (played by Gabriel Byrne) is under treatment as well and in doing so is openly sceptical about psychotherapy and its use. The sessions between him and his therapist (played by Dianne Wiest) are crackling with animosity and cynicism; if it weren't for these I might not recommend the series. The rest is OK, the acting is sometimes excellent - particularly that of Mia Wasikowska, who on this showing has the makings of a great actress, and of Dianne Wiest, who already is just that - the various cases mostly keep a good balance between realism and drama, and Gabriel Byrne is always worth watching. He is blessed with one of those faces so redolent of Depth Of Character that he doesn't even need to act. He can just sit there and his face will do all the work for him.   Drawbacks? It could be extremely monotonous for some; virtually everything takes place in one room and it's almost all talk - anybody who begins to fidget after half a dozen lines of dialogue will find this very heavy-going. There are a few pieces of drama but probably not enough to satisfy on their own; if you don't enjoy listening to conversation you'd best leave this alone. As for the more prurient-minded, there is a certain amount of dirty talk (this being HBO) but once again probably not enough to satisfy.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Just received this item (a week before it was scheduled to deliver!) and am already very pleased with my purchase. It is a very simple box set with no extras, but that is exactly what I was looking for. And you can't beat the price!!
1451627289|5.0|For me, a disaffected King reader, all I can say is, \\"He's back.\\" 11/23/63 is warm, touching and loaded with characters who are tough to forget. I kept worrying that he had written himself into a corner, and then I would turn a page and BOOM...we were in overdrive...off in way way that was surprising,gratifying, and at times, absolutely breath taking. His depiction of the late 50's/early 60's was right on. Shades of Christine...his love for cars is marvelous...only this time it's a Ford. For history buffs, the book is a marvelous game of \\"What if.\\" But finally,he settles for \\"the greatest good for the greatest number.\\" All this and a tender love story, too.

0307949486|2.0|I got this for my Kindle after my mom and brother raved about this book. Now I don't feel very comfortable around them.<br /><br />It's not BAD. But I figured it out too far ahead of time and felt the culprit got away too easy and the relationship between the two main characters would have been MUCH better platonic. Blech.<br /><br />And I agree with the another reviewer - did Larsson have stock in Starbucks or was coffee the third protagonist?

B004UC4HCG|4.0|This is thoroughly designed system coming with the exact right features to build inexpensive, low profile, high-performance servers.  It is probably not a right choice for a gaming system as the power supply is too weak for a gaming video cards. On the other hand, its power consumption is too high for a simple multimedia system. This system is a very good choice for a general use Linux server or (non-graphics) workstation. My configuration is as follows:  1) CPU: i7-2600  2) RAM: 16 GB 1333Mhz  3) SSD: 128 GB Crucial M4  4) ATI 6570 Radeon graphics card.  This configuration runs very fast even with memory intensive applications.  At first, I was a bit skeptical about the idea of passive cooling the CPU, but it seems to work, so far and the performance is excellent. Ubuntu 11.04 detected everything (including the onboard sound and ethernet) perfectly (only the open source radeon driver needed to be replaced fireglx).  A small caveat: It is very easy to plug the PSU fan into the wrong socket, which still works, but makes it operate on maximum speed all the time and making it extremely loud. If the fan is connected correctly, then the noise level should be relatively low, but still clearly audible when put on the desk.  Pros:   - Suitable for building very high performance systems at a low price point.  - Good Linux compatibility.  Cons:   - PSU fan could be a bit less noisy, but from a few feet it is hardly audible.  - (Analog) headphone output is a slightly noisy especially on high CPU load.

B001N1DPDE|3.0|The Becker BK2 Companion knife is a powerfully built \\"muscle knife\\". Not for the small of hand or the timid occasional operator, this knife is good for folks like me. I could break an anvil with a bag of marshmallows. It is made for rough and tumble outdoor tasks. Slide your hand back on the \\"birdshead\\" grip and you have a pretty decent chopper. Baton, dig , pry, and, oh yeah, even slice and whittle with this tough boy. It will perform well.    My only disappointment is with the sheath. There is no danger of the knife falling out,and if I had only a light breakfast for energy,not much danger of it coming out either. Way too tight! The nylon webbing belt strap is too light for this heavy knife. When it is unstrapped it tipps like a millionare at a classy restaurant.     A better sheath would greatly improve a great knife, but, hey, its more than worth the money. If it fits your job description, let it follow you home.    buffalobeard

B005OK721G|5.0|I wanted to see this movie ever since I first saw the trailer for it back when it came out in theaters. I did not have a chance to catch it while it was still in theaters so as soon as I seen the movie at Target I went ahead and bought it. I am not disappointed whatsoever this is an awesome movie. Zoe Saldana's character is awesome and not only does she kick butt, she executes the role perfectly. She is the ultimate female bada$$ and I hope they continue to cast her in roles similar to this one, she can definitely carry a movie. If you like an action movie with a purpose (she is after revenge for the death of her parents) then this is the movie for you, if you enjoyed the movie Faster with Dewayne The Rock Johnson then more than likely you will enjoy this as well. I 100% recommend this movie and it was definitely worth my 15 bucks.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Two children unknown to each other are bound in game and a world whose rules they will not discover until they are much older but will rule their lives regardless. Their game takes place in an elaborately constructed circus constructed in shades of black and white which only opens at night. It picks up and moves without warning, its schedule is unknown yet closely followed by a group of loyal dreamers.   I first heard about this book months and months before it release. I was instantly intrigued and could not wait to read it. Furthermore it was hyped and publicized to such a degree that is only made the wait even harder(Ill even admit to jealously staring down a woman on the streets of Manhattan clutching a ARC copy which I had tried and failed to obtain).  I must say this book absolutely lived up to,and possibly exceeded, the hype. I thought it was beautifully written. All of the characters are engaging and you feel connected to them yet at the same time are, till the end, somewhat shrouded in mystery.   Form the opening pages with the descriptions of tents and acts and the experience of visiting the circus it visually jumps off the page. For a place that is entirely black and white in color it is richly detailed and vibrant. I could instantly see it being translated to the screen in a movie and want this to happen if for no other reason than to see the clock which is the centerpiece of the circus. Overall an amazing debut novel.
B0006JGFNQ|2.0|I got this as a gift for a friend. mine does sing and dance, But Looks like crap to be honest. The fur is glued on very poorly. There are sharp pieces of dried glue sticking out all over around the eyes, mouth and ears. You can barely see one of the eyes casue the fur was pretty much glued on on top of it, insted beside of it. Since christmas is tomorrow i had no time to find a replacement. I repaired it the best i could. I remember see these in the mall years ago and they were awesome, what happened???
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible app has worked well for me. The interface is pretty simple and easy to use and has a nice large selection of translations to choose from. The audio Bibles are great and a very nice feature. I know some other reviewers have had issues accessing the downloaded Bibles when they are offline, but I have been able to use them on my Toshiba Thrive without any issues even with no WiFi. Perhaps it is only a problem on certain devices. Anyway, I really love this app and would recommend it.
B005V1WZ10|5.0|Once again Korn has done it. For those who want something fresh while having the feel of their earlier works this is the album you have been waiting for. The lyrics are dark again but definitely more mature. Also this album feels like their is more of a flow and not forced like on KIII. The songs you should listen to are Kill the Mercy Within, My Wall, Narcissistic Cannibal, Let's Go, Way too Far and Bleeding Out. The bonus tracks are really catchy too.
B0044RUSZM|5.0|I love this stand.

0596009208|4.0|Head First Java offers a great way to learn Java, perfect for beginners. I had issues with their, \\"DotCom\\" game which is basically a dumbed down version of Battleships. After that point I noticed it was easy for beginners to quit because they didn't understand. They have a lot of ready bake code for you to put in your game, and a lot of that code communicates with the other classes they have you create. They tell you to not bother with it, but how can you not bother with it, when your trying to learn or take notes on what you just wrote? That's where its kind of frustrating.  I am not saying it's a bad book, it's perfect for beginners. I just wish they would of addressed to keep moving forward in Java even if they didn't get it. Most everything in this book is going to be outright confusing to you, but if you keep moving forward and just do the practice problems, your going to look back and be like, \\"haha, how did I not understand that two weeks ago?\\"   I would recommend this to anybody who has the dedication and innovation to learn Java. Those who are not sure about it, turn away now and start with \\"Game Maker's Apprentice.\\" Even if your not into games, it's the perfect book for brand new programmers. With all that out of the way I say:  Thank you Head First for another great book.
B00000JLWW|2.0|Look, my friends.....this movie is almost as disastrous as the sinking of the Titanic itself!  The acting is stilted, unnatural, and just plain amateurish, and the last half of the movie (beginning with the ship actually starting to sink) is boring, repetitious, and then even more boring and more repetitious. I found myself pleading with the DVD to end, because I felt there must be something more interesting than what I was seeing...

B0061JPYX2|1.0|Amy Winehouse sucks, I have hundreds of reasons why she sucks, but i can go on forever about it. I tried her cd and found nothing special about her music. The only reason you people are giving her so much praise is because she died, you can try and deny this all you want, but you know its true. So why waste money on this? Amy Winehouse sucks, when will you people accept this fact?
B001E45XT4|4.0|I'll admit, it isn't the same quality as a $200 headset, but it is pretty darn good for $25! The mic is really good quality, and is sensitive, so it is suggested to turn down the sensitivity when playing games in open mic, otherwise players might be thinking you are trying to talk the whole time. Had some trouble at first getting it to work, but that was my fault because I didn't plug the wires in all the way. The felt is very comfortable, although it can get dirty very easily, so watch out if you have longer hair. After about an hour or so of having them on, however, I need to take them off for a few minutes because the pressure makes it start getting uncomfortable, but that is with almost any headset. The wire is really long, which is both good and bad in that you have more freedom to move, but it can snag really easy. I haven't had that problem yet. The microphone looks like it can break pretty easily, but I have been careful with it and have not yet broken it. The volume wheel works pretty good, and these headphones can get loud. The first thing I did with these was play Left 4 Dead, and I had the volume on max, and as soon as the Valve intro came on, I nearly had a heart-attack. Another reason it is not recommended to have it on full volume is because sometimes the sound will leak out of the ear pieces and go into the microphone, which can get very annoying for people in other parties. Some people have claimed you cannot \\"feel\\" the bass, but I ran a bass test from youtube on these headphones, and I could definitely \\"feel\\" the bass, but that was at a VERY low frequency.  Pros: Cheap, comfortable padding, good mic, good sound quality, can get loud  Cons: Some parts look like they are easy to break, uncomfortable after long periods of use, felt gets dirty  Recommended for: Semi-hardcore Gamers or Hardcore Gamers on a budget  Ease of initial set up: 5/5  Durability: 3/5  Mic Quality: 4/5  Sound Quality: 4/5  Comfort ability: 4/5  Appearance: 4/5  Overall: 4/5 A great item for the price!!  Edit (1/2/2012): A minor inconvenience I have ran into is that the plugs are both black, and not color coded, sometimes making it hard to tell what plug goes into the microphone input, and what plug goes into the headphone input. A minor inconvenience, since the solution is simply turning on the light. Not enough to edit the rating.

B006G3MZRQ|5.0|WARRIOR is one of the finest films of the year - and that is a statement coming from one who does not like violent films.  The film does deal with UFC fighting, a mania incomprehensible to most), but it is more an extraordinary story about the magnetism of family.  Writer Gavin O'Connor (with Anthony Tambakis and Cliff Dorfman) also directs this intense film and his sensitivity in bringing out brilliant performances from everyone in his cast is simply amazing.  This is a monumental achievement worthy of Academy Award consideration.<br /><br />Tommy Conlon (Tom Hardy) has returned from a tour with the USMC in Iraq where he ran away after saving his fellow marines in a near fatal situation, witnessed the death of his closest buddy Manny, and went AWOL from the stress: he returned to the US to make sure Manny's family was cared for.  An ex fighter, Tommy drinks and does drugs and finally returns to his father Paddy Conlon (Nick Nolte) to gain new training as a fighter.  The Conlon family history is tragic - the mother took Tommy away from Pittsburgh hoping her older son Brendan (Joel Edgerton) would follow - escaping the spiraling alcoholism of the father.  Tommy moved with his mother who subsequently dies: Brendon stayed with his father and the family ties seem to have been forever broken.  When Tommy returns Paddy is 1000 days sober, but instead of love for this father Tommy loathes him and only wants his expertise as a trainer.  Paddy consents and the two begin training at Paddy's old friend Colt Boyd's (Maximiliano Hern&aacute;ndez) Gym.  In Philadelphia Brendan is a high school Physics teacher and has married Tess (Jennifer Morrison) and they have two little girls, one of whom has renal damage that has been so costly that both parents must each hold down two jobs to survive.  Brendan happens upon a Mixed Martial Arts fight (he spends his nights as a bouncer in a club making very little money) and decides that the money he can gain through fighting may save his home from going into foreclosure): he fights, and wins $200.  When he shows up at school to teach he is bruised and cut and is suspended without pay for disgracing the school (the principal - Kevin Dunn - hates to lose his finest teacher). With a dim financial outlook Tess hesitantly agrees for Brendan to re-enter fighting for money and Brendan hires his old friend Frank Campagna (Frank Grillo) to train him.<br /><br />There is a much publicized tournament for the championship in Mixed Martial Arts in Atlantic city and through many strange coincidences the two brothers end up in the final fight -  fighting each other. The end is brilliant in its understatement, not stooping to resolve all family problems,  but at the same time having the courage to show how powerful is the love of two brothers no matter how different their lives.  Both Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton are brilliant as the brothers and Nick Nolte gives the performance of his career.  Every character created by this extraordinary cast is pitch perfect.  For this viewer this is one of the most moving films that has been released in a very long time.  Grady Harp, December 11o foreclosure): he fights, and wins $200.

B005MYEQ4U|3.0|MIDNIGHT IN PARIS  sounds good on paper and looks in ads.  The film opens with a long sequence of views of the sights in Paris - no actors, no story, just the breathtaking magnificence of the City of Light. For this viewer that section i the most rewarding of the entire film.  Once the film starts Woody Allen imposes an improbable story with stereotype characters and with a few notable exceptions, it gets stuck in its own cuteness.<br /><br />VERY briefly screenwriter wannabe novelist Gil (Owen Wilson playing Owen Wilson) and his bride to be Inez (Rachel McAdams) are in Paris with Inez' parents (Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy) who in turn are on a business trip.  Inez is a bore: Gil wants adventure.  As Inez sees the touristy places with her friends, the hideously boring pedantic Paul (Michael Sheen) and his flaky partner Carol (Nina Arianda), Gil escapes to walk the streets of Paris and fall in love with the history and the magic of the city.  At the stoke of midnight he is picked up by an elegant car and is taken to the 1920s where he encounters Cole Porter (Yves Heck), Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll), F Scott Fitzgerald (Tom Hiddleston) and his Zelda (Allison Pill), Josephine Baker (Sonia Rolland), Alice B. Toklas (Th&eacute;r&egrave;se Bourou-Rubinsztein) and Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates), Picasso (Marcial Di Fonzo Bo) and his current flame Adriana (Marion Cotillard who seems to have phoned in her performance), Djuna Barnes (Emmanelle Uzan), Salvador Dal&iacute; (Adrien Brody - in probably the only convincing performance in the film), Man Ray (Tom Cordier), Luis Bu&ntilde;uel (Adrien de Van), TS Eliot (David Lowe) - in other words all the famous artists of the 1920s.  Gil is captivated by the opportunity to share his work with these greats, though he finds it difficult to understand time travel. He falls for Adriana who in turn wishes she could live in the time of Le Belle Epoque so of course Gil and Adriana time travel again meeting Henri Matisse (Yves-Antoine Spoto), Toulesse-Lautrec (Vincent Menjou Cortes), Paul Gauguin (Olivier Rabourdin), and Edgar Degas (François Rostain) at Maxim's.  Gil by day grows less enamored with Inez and by night more infatuated by Adriana and in the end there is a permanent schism between Gil and Inez and we are left with the moral 'Don't wish to live in another time than your own.'<br /><br />Sounds like a run through of famous names?  It is.  Wilson is inept at romantic comedy, and Woody Allen's script is fairly boring for Allen's works.  BUT Paris is Gorgeous - and that is enough!

0439023491|4.0|The first book in the series was stunning, fast paced and very original! This book does build off that foundation and doesn't totally live up to the first, but still has lots to offer. I thought the book would be boring until I got to the end of chapter four, and thats when it really starts to grab your attention for the first time! Take it or what its worth, and you'll be pleased.
B006P4HFH6|3.0|Although I really love this show, I was not impressed with this week's episode. To me, the episode was too chaotic. There were too many things going on. The final member of the family transitioned to ghost status, but this was so predictable, that his death wasn't even the focus of much attention. There were struggles for babies. New residents. More violence. Lots of ghosts. It was dizzying at times. I should also note that this was the season finale - now that \\"seasons\\" only last 1/2 season on many stations.<br /><br />Query: If a ghost can father a child, why can't a ghost have a baby?

140120841X|5.0|I, much like many other people reading the book for the first time recently, was introduced to V for Vendetta through the movie and so I will be reviewing the book in comparison to modern comics and film.  The graphic novel seems a little bit less active; the notable example being the explosion of the Bailey taking a very nondescript panel that was roughly 1/10th the size of the page.  However, if you press on through the first two or three chapters and find yourself invested, you won't be able to pull yourself away.  The story isn't at all dated (well, aside from the dates themselves) and the art, while sometimes a tad anticlimactic, is beautifully done.  It appears that the whole book was done in watercolor and it looks gorgeous when set against the heavy, dark, inky shadows that visually dominate the pages to wonderful effect.  If you're looking to read graphic novels that can show the medium's ability to be thought-provoking and engaging, I highly suggest this collection.

B0034G4P80|4.0|When I heard Marvel was going to make a live-action Thor movie, I just rolled my eyes and scoffed. I figured there was no way they could pull that off. How could they possible present Asgard? How would they tie in Norse mythology to the present-day society? What actor could possible play the title character? Wouldn't the whole movie just come across as cheesy to mature movie-goers?<br /><br />I have to say I was very pleasantly surprised. This movie came across as much better than I had expected. With a good mix of action, comedy, and crowd-pleasing special effects, this movie did what I thought could not be done: Make Thor appeal to an audience outside of comic book fans. Well done Marvel! Now, just don't screw things up with the sequel!

B004GCKRWY|2.0|Definitely disappointed with this movie. I'm sure it was cheap to produce this movie. I mean, you've got only one single actor that's ever seen on film, and your entire set is a sandy box of pine wood. Your sole \\"special effect\\" is a small bit of fire.<br /><br />This movie is the definition of claustrophobic, as the entire movie is set inside the aforementioned box. You keep waiting for a flashback scene, a dream sequence, or some other cut-scene that will take you out of the tight confines of the box, but you never get it. Much as the lead character is trapped in the box and is growing increasingly uncomfortable and anxious, the viewers are trapped inside with him and also growing increasinly uncomfortable watching the movie. Was this the intention of the director? Possibly so. Probably so. My wife, at one point, had to get up to leave the room, as she said she was feeling trapped and just wanted to get out of the room for a bit. Like I said - this movie is the definition of claustrophobic.<br /><br />The movie could have been more enjoyable for me if the ending had not turned out as it did. For me, the ending just killed the movie and I can't recommend it. My wife was of a like mind, saying that the conclusion of the movie really irritated her and made her feel as if she had just wasted 90 minutes of her life.<br /><br />Is the movie tense? Suspenseful? It wasn't for me, but I'm not generally claustrophobic. If I were, it may have been more \\"scary\\" for me, but I just wasn't feeling it. I just can't recommend this movie to anyone.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|a very enjoyable game to play. I would recommend this app for people to play and download. Wish it was more puzzles though
630522577X|5.0|I bought this movie to replace our VHS version and the quality is GREAT!! It was brand new in perfect self condition
1451627289|5.0|and I loved it. I always thought his books were just for silly people who like scary books.  This one seemed interesting when I heard about it but still I didn't think I'd like a Stephen King book. But I kept hearing about it so decided to try it. And Wow! I loved it. I loved the characters, the very creative concept, the philosophizing about time and the writing. I loved it all. Even jimla. I may check out more King books.
B00004VYPF|3.0|the movie was brand new and in great condition, only down side was that it was in french! i apperently didnt see that when i ordered it, plus its format is region 2, so it cant play in the US. however if i could return it for english that would be splendid! :)
B00005LK94|5.0|My child grew up on this movie but couldn't watch it anymore as all we had was a VHS copy so I decieded to look on Amazon for the DVD. Found it and we were so excited we bought it. I ordered it and I rec'd it several days later super fast shipping! We sat down for a girls night and watch it like when she was little. Fun memories like when she was little as we laughed and cried together.
B0014Z4ON4|5.0|This has been my favorite of the Indiana Jones movies since I was a child, and it continues to be so.  The visual splendor is amazing.  From the streets to Shanghai to the forbidding Indian Palace... it's all very surreal.  The soundtrack has all of the charm from Raiders with new, more intense, and emotional themes.  A great adventure from start to finish.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this app works great and I would recommend it to anybody seeking an easy way to access their local weather.
B005NFVZTM|5.0|After the last X-Men movie I remember thinking that the whole movie franchise had been ruined, but this movie was absolutely awesome!  I loved seeing the origin stories.  This makes me want to go back and read/reread all the comics!
B002WIDRM6|5.0|Every song on this CD is a winner.  I had heard of Lady Antebellum from friends and decided to give it a listen.  I got the CD and am on the verge of wearing it out.  I love it!
1612930859|5.0|My Thoughts:<br /><br />Persuasion is one of my favorite movie adaptations in the world. I could watch the Masterpiece Theater version over and over without getting sick of it. That's how much I love it. Since I had never read a Jane Austen book before, I decided to go with that one for my Summer Romance Challenge. I have to admit it was not easy at first. The very beginning with the details on the family and friends of the family was a struggle to get through. I think the reason why is because I know the story so well from the movie. Once more dialogue came about, it became very enjoyable.<br /><br />Anne Elliot was once engaged to Frederick Wentworth when she was very young. Since her friend Lady Russell didn't approve of the match, she persuaded Anne to break off the engagement. Fast forward eight years later. Anne's father Sir Walter and sister Elizabeth have nearly brought the family to bankruptcy. They have to let the house to someone while they get things back to where it should be financially. The person who takes up residency is Admiral and Mrs. Croft. And guess who happens to be the brother of Mrs. Croft? You guessed it--Frederick, now Captain Wentworth.<br /><br />So now Anne is forced into being around him often, watching him from afar, imagining him as not wanting anything to do with her. Especially when it seems he is preferring the company of another. As time goes on, he gets to see a different side of her, how selfless she is.  And when it seems he is attentive to her, Mr. Elliot, her cousin, seems to be very interested in Anne. But where does Anne stand? Does she have a chance with Frederick again?<br /><br />Like I said, this is one of my favorite movie adaptations. Reading the book was like icing on the cake, completely put it all into perspective, getting into the mind of the characters. Jane Austen really is an amazing author. I wish I hadn't taken so long to read one of her novels. Definitely one of the best classics I've read so far.<br /><br />My Rating:<br /><br /> Very Good... Stay up late
B005ZUR724|5.0|if your looking for a full mmo with great graphics buy this game now! its crazy to even think I'm playing this on my kindle!
B004I1WIWU|5.0|The pressing of this vinyl is very strong and heavy. I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in owning a great album. This is a must for any person that enjoys vinyl.<br /><br />There is a download card for a free digital download. IT EXPIRES FEB. 12 2012, so make sure you use it before then!<br /><br />I would have enjoyed more cover pictures or booklet, but otherwise, I highly recommend this vinyl.
1933952806|5.0|So much better than reading the Nikon manual. Darrell Young explains all menus, gives a Nikon manual page reference (for those who want to know even more about a feature), and tells the reader how he sets his camera. It has opened my eyes to features that may have existed on my older Nikon DSLRs that I never knew about or understood. Great reference.
B0012HCASA|5.0|Frankly I didn't watch this when it was on the TV. I was totally disappointed in the Terminator movies after T2. They really just sucked. (Salvation might be the exception.) When I saw the commercials on the TV for this series, they did nothing to dispel my opinion about what this would be. So I skipped it. But when I saw this as free for Amazon Prime members on my Ruko box, I gave it a try. I was hooked. Watched Season 1 and 2 and really longing for more. The stories are very well done (some slight slow spots from time to time, but a minor issue for me.) Most of the acting is very well done and it flowed very well. I strongly recommend it for any Terminator fans that might have missed it.<br /><br />Note to the Terminator franchise: This is what the movies after T2 should have been like. You should make a full length movie using these actors and the plot lines from this series. I think it'll work. And you need to get more with the fans on how to market this series. The commercials on the TV did nothing for me to make me want to watch it. But thank you for doing at least 2 seasons. I really wanted more.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game has excellent music and mechanics. The graphics and animations are very well polished. works great on the Fire.  It does seem a bit short. I've only played the first 25% or so and it only took about half an hour. The difficulty is also ramping up very slowly. I'm hoping it gets a lot tougher later on, but I really like what I've seen so far!

0385534639|3.0|This book left me with many a conflicting emotion.  The vivid scenes and descriptive prose are amazing until you reach half way through the book then you are left flailing through them looking for the plot to move forward and for the characters to be developed beyond their cookie cutter representations.  I liked visiting the world of the night circus but it was left wondering so much that should have been part of the plot development in the first place.  Still a unique read.
B003UESJHO|5.0|This movie lived up to its name, one of the best fighting movies that I have watched in a long time, I will be watching it again and again
B002ZG9968|4.0|I thought \\"The Back-Up Plan\\" was a fun romantic comedy, actually better than I expected.  J-Lo (Zoe) was beautiful as always.  Alex O'Loughlin (Stan) - a darn fine leading man.  I'd take him even if he smelled like goat cheese.<br /><br />There were some FUNNY parts - loved the Dad in the park and his sandbox son; stew eating at its most refined (I couldn't stop laughing over that); really nasty over-the-top birthing scenes kind of like a car wreck that you slow down to gawk at (I would not take anyone who is actually planning on getting pregnant especially of the male persuasion - this movie could be very effective birth control).<br /><br />I loved Nuts, the little wheelchair-strapped dog.  He was a riot - better than some of the human actors.<br /><br />Melissa McCarthy was a lot overboard as Carol, the head of the single mother's group Zoe attends.<br /><br />I also liked Linda Lavin as Zoe's grandmother.  I hadn't seen her in anything in a while and she added a nice spark.<br /><br />Were there some unbelievable parts?  Well, yeah, quite a few.  But this is a comedy not a documentary and bizarre is okay with me.<br /><br />Also, it had a very nice soundtrack - some of the songs played in the movie aren't on the CD though.
B006P4HFH6|5.0|SCARIEST SHOW EVER!!!!!!!! But great plot and storyline. Always leaves you wanting the next episode.

B004T6IBNY|5.0|One of the best pinball games I've played for mobile devices.<br /><br />The ball reacts the way you would expect it to in any situation, the bumpers are responsive, the physics are spot on.<br /><br />The only issue I've found is the flippers sometimes arr either too sensitive (react with hardly any pressure at all on the buttons) or not sensitive enough.<br /><br />The issue wasn't significant enough to keep me from purchasing the full app, and I've enjoyed many hours of gaming since then.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I really dug this book.  It's been a long while since I've read a fiction book cover to cover.  This one pulled me in-  Honestly, I wasn't sure what I was getting into.  I thought for sure a great horror/thriller book.  Not a horror book and what many would think from King (although some parts of this in a movie could be pretty scary)...<br /><br />I got sucked into this book pretty early and really like the characters.  I read some reviews that mention it was too long and seemed to drag-  not in my case.  Every time I had to step away I found myself wondering about the characters and couldn't wait to get back and read more.<br /><br />If you can't tell, I really liked this book!  I know most folks don't like movies made from books but I can say I'd love to see a mini-series or film based off this story.<br /><br />Good read and recommended!
B005V4X8JA|5.0|I pre-ordered this from the UK so for it to arrive on Christmas Eve was great.  I played it in the car on the way to shopping and there were several moments when I had to say \\"Wow - hadn't noticed that before\\".  Now blasting it through the home system constantly. Fantastic.

B004AHNIGM|5.0|As you listen through this album by Gregg Allman it is clear that his vocals show some signs of age but they fit perfectly with the song choices on this album.  Also, the production of T-Bone Burnett is quite evident and there is a feeling of control on each song but I think that was necessary for Gregg Allman to really put out a cohesive record - and that is just what this latest offering from Allman reveals.  There is no way Gregg is pulling off 'Floating Bridge' the way he does here on his own. 'Just Another Rider' - I don't think so.
1439102813|5.0|I adored this book.   It all seemed too real--a novel but it read like a documentary...Maybe it's because the author holds a Ph.D. in neuroscience that it felt so very real--- a book from the point of view of Alice, a woman with early-onset Alzheimer's. A woman who happens to be a Harvard prof of cognitive science. Although their is no hope given by the author (eoA is a one-way street), it is sensitively written.  This should become a classic!
B004Y1USV2|5.0|I have been reading the previous reviews and was surprised how low this had album scored ... below 4. That's unfair!<br /><br />I understand that some may be upset about some of the key members not appearing on this album. So am I, but I won't allow a little disappointment to get in the way of enjoying the music. And this Canadian guy is doing a decent job emulating Lancashire accent ... jk.<br /><br />I am not well-versed in writing florid, witty reviews. But I can say that ...<br /><br />(1) The musicianship is outstanding<br />(2) The song selection and sequence is excellent. It feels like a true album, not just a batch of loose songs, scraped together.<br />(3) It's not yer over-complicated (and hard to listen to) early Yes, but neither is it commercial pop. The trademark sophistication is unquestionably there, but not at the expense of its pleasant melodic qualities.<br /><br />To sum up: buy this if you like good quality, solid, well-balanced symphonic/progressive rock (thinking of Yes, that would be something like their evolution curve from Fragile through Tormato to Big Generator and onwards)

B005V4FJC4|5.0|She & Him are a nice departure from the auto tuned pop albums that threaten to bring down our culture. Think of the Mongol hordes. They conquered Eurasia but when armies receded, they left nothing but destruction behind. They had no culture and are barely remembered. That could be us someday. The history books will extoll the military victories of the Western armies, but the people will have no idea who we were. Then they will dig up an old iPod Shuffle loaded with She & Him's christmas album. Then they will know us. Then they will herald us.

B0064BCNA4|4.0|This is a great tool for those of us who wish we could play piano. You pick a song and then touch the lit up keys in order (and rhythm when you get better at it) to play songs. There are only a few songs and most of them are basic, but what do you expect in a program for newbies? You can also play any song you like if you know any. There are other instruments but they don't sound like their real counterparts so I stuck with piano. This is a very fun app and worth the purchase.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|[[ASIN:B005Z271Y6 Adele Live At The Royal Albert Hall (Blu-ray/CD)]]  I have never written a review for anything until now. Adele doesn't sing her songs, she lives them. She is the people's singer. Her songs  inspire and show the raw emotion of a person who has gone through so many changes inner life. From Someone Like You to Fire in the Rain, with the amazing string section, you forget (for a little while) the things that are going through your life.  You become focused on her life, her memories. Thank you Adele!
B005V4FJC4|5.0|Finally a modern group doing Christmas music justice.  Okay, so they have a retro sound, and that makes this work.  So what?  It's a super high quality recording, and the performances are great.    In an era where artists like Mariah Carey and the Backstreet Boys have been putting out garbage Christmas albums, it's great to see a band do it right.  This album sound classic and timeless, and it's one of the best Christmas albums made in a very long time.  I wish there was more original content on here, as I'd love to see what they would come up with on their own.
B005V4X8JA|5.0|This mastering was absolutely nailed. None of the \\"veil removed\\" type mastering which usually just equates to cranked up treble. This is well done all the way through; it has warmth and character without ever tipping over into the \\"bright\\" mastering that it seems is so often favored by even the better engineers these days. A fantastic balance of tonality was attained between the different tracks that I think is astonishingly good and really works. I would absolutely recommend that you buy this CD.   I do think that the original Atlantic CD mastered by Barry Diament is also sensational. That version is easily found for a few dollars and is certainly worth owning along with this version. I'm also fond of the Chris Bellman cut vinyl that I believe is still in print on Rhino. Between these three versions, I think you have the sonic possibilities of this album pretty much covered.   5 stars. An essential buy!

B003Y5H5HY|3.0|Having read all the books years ago, the story itself really never did anything for me. It's really all about Salander. Fincher did a competent if procedural job. The main complaint here is he rushes through the flat pages of dialog with no pause or rhythm at all. Many scenes involve the actors simply going through motions reciting their memorized lines with few touches of humanity.<br /><br />Neither movie is more than a cheap Saturday scare and to sum it up, put the cast from the Swedish film in one directed by Fincher and you've got the real deal. The most telling contrast in both movies that show where they stand is in the scene where Salander and Blomkvist are lying in bed toward the end and the writer muses to his ass kicking hacker about what she has been through. In one movie, the scene is quiet and human and the other movie, it's simply filler to the next scene. I fault Steve Zaillian's simplistic screenplay more than anything else. The Swedish one wisely compresses and simplifies many of the novels blatant flaws, while the Gringo version keeps all the boring warts.  Let's not ignore a \\"new\\" ending that requires an extraordinary suspension of disbelief or complete incompetence on the part of everybody else in the plot.<br /><br />Rooney Mara does a good, if robotic job playing Larsen's motorcycle driving Goth, hacker, sex pot, but I kept looking for the one and only Noomi Rapace at every turn. Hard act to follow. Either in writing or how she was directed, Mara's Salander plays more of a young girl in love with older man, than the distant cautious (and damaged) Salander of Rapace - which is rightly or wrongly, more in line with the book and frankly more realistic. i'm not taking anything away from Rooney Mara's work, she was brave and really good. I just prefer Noomi Rapace's interpretation.<br /><br />Also WTF? with the James Bond intro? Wrong movie Fincher...
B005HSG3VK|4.0|The Marware Kindle Fire Lightweight Microshell Folio Cover is great.  Is is slim and lightweight and not bulky like another cover that I bought.

It is a great product. It also is well priced.

0385523912|5.0|I bought this book to mark the demise of the \\"Dear Leader\\" Kim Jong-Il and was thoroughly impressed. Don't let yourself be alienated by some of the cheesy insipidness that can be found in the first chapter (\\"They don't stop to think that in the middle of this black hole [North Korea], in this bleak, dark country where millions have died of starvation, there is also love\\"), this tone is not representative of the rest of the book. The ordeals of the six \\"protagonists\\" are described very factually, but without any cynicism. After finishing it, I felt that I had acquired much new hard knowledge about the country and its regime as well as a faint glimpse of the emotional world that the North Korean people inhabit.

B005KP7EK4|2.0|A poor western with a typical story and typical acting and typical action. This was a waste of my time.
B0064NTZJO|4.0|Last year, there was a film called \\"The American\\", that was distributed by Focus Features, and had George Clooney in the role of a hitman who had lost his way, and was hiding out in a gorgeous Italian landscape, waiting to go on one last mission. This was something of an art film. It meant to be subtle, and emotional, and beautiful, and at the same time, somewhat surprising.   It did none of these things. I tend to be the occasional film snob, enjoying the kind of film that relies on subtlety, rather than either laughs or violence, or something like that, that the average audience is more likely to enjoy. However, I hated \\"The American\\". Nothing happened in it. It was dull and boring, and too snooty for even me to enjoy.   I mention all of this, because \\"Drive\\", a film I saw yesterday, was fantastic. It displayed exactly what \\"The American\\" was going for, but missed completely. This is a fully realized version of that movie. One reason why \\"The American\\" failed, is because I am completely tired of George Clooney. He's had his time in the spotlight, and that was one of his weakest performances.  However, Ryan Gosling is the heartbeat of \\"Drive\\". He's charismatic, charming, sexy, and one hell of an actor. You never know where his character is going to go, and that's what this movie wants of its audience. His charm isn't something easily accomplished, he becomes his character, like only the best actors do.   \\"Drive\\" follows an unnamed man, who is a stuntman for Hollywood movies. On the side, he moonlights as a getaway driver. He never works for the same person twice, and works anonymously. He falls in love with a woman (Carey Mulligan) who lives in his apartment building, whose husband (Oscar Isaac) is in prison. Somewhere in the film, Jewish mobsters (Albert Brooks, Ron Perlman) become involved in the story, threatening the lives of everyone.  The story is a slow-burner, taking awhile to set into affect. However, that's the way it should be. Unlike \\"The American\\", thestory eventually does go somewhere, and it has an ending that packs a huge punch. Unlike many action films that I've recently seen, it has undeniable style. It has a Tarantino-esque feel, and a look that separates it from a lot of other similar films.   It has a somber, and melancholic feel, and yet has many \\"gasp\\" moments. Its final act is unforgettable. Storylines overlap, and crash together in an almost classical way. It is definitely not for the faint of heart, though, as quiet moments in the film are broken by moments of brutal violence. However, that's one of the things that makes this film so good.   However, there are a few moments that lag the pacing, somewhat. A few things could have easily been cut out, because they don't bring the story along at all. But that doesn't hurt the overall product. Once you see how it ends, it more than makes up for its flaws.  Grade: B+
B005J6LKVI|5.0|Again, we have many reviewers that just can't get away from comparing the film to the book. That has always seemed unfair to me, and is always annoying. Director Tate Taylor has assembled a dedicated, focused cast, and has presented a tale of fiction that may be pretty much like it was. To get away from the mundane lot of the abused Black maids, we have a white character, the sweet and clueless Celia, played to perfection by Jessica Chastain, whose inclusion just adds to the nastiness of the white female antagonists.<br /><br />Most males might be put off by this film, which has no major male characters and is purely from a female perspective. The book, too, was most popular with females. The bottom line is that this is a film with heart and integrity, an earnest attempt to present a riveting narrative. The acting is excellent, without exception. Viola Davis is fine as the central character, though she never really has a big \\"scene\\", but consistent in her sad demeanor, on a road to nothingness. Emma Stone is fine as Skeeter, the real protagonist; Bryce Dallas Howard is wonderfully nasty; Sissy Spacek is wonderfully spunky; the great Cecily Tyson has a too brief appearance, an important character, Skeeter's true inspiration. Allison Janney, too, is like an older version of Howard's. Octavia Spencer's Minny is feisty and fun, sweet and sad, the whole nine yards.<br /><br />But it's Jessica Chastain's Celia that is so fully formed, presenting practically every emotion available to an actress. Though from the \\"wrong side of the tracks\\", she's not stupid. She's definitely a fish out of water, is treated with contempt and ridicule, is truly devoted to her husband, makes light of regular disappointments, and is ready to give up until she meets Minny. I won't blab away the plot, but a particular scene where Minny comes to her rescue is one of the most heart-wrenching scenes I can recall, handled by 2 very capable actresses.<br /><br />I enjoyed \\"The Help\\" very much. The innate goodness of people is well explored, as well as the conditioned, ignorant meanness of others. A good lesson in how to treat your fellow human being. Despite the ugliness that occurs, it's really a joyous film. Unfortunately, ALL the stories may never be known, and, I'm sure, weren't as positive. Highly recommended.explored, as well as the conditioned, ignorant meanness of others. A good lesson in how to treat your fellow human being.

B00664AM5C|5.0|Not a lot scares me, when it comes to movies, anyway. I can watch the goriest horror movie, and not be scared, even in the slightest. But \\"Contagion\\" got under my skin. It has more effect than even the most well-done horror movie, yet, it's not really a horror movie at all. It's mostly a psychological disaster film, and at one point, it feels like something of a docudrama, and then it morphs into a humane psychology story, and has overtones of the power of paranoia and fear that start when the film begins, and don't end until the last, satisfying moments.   \\"Contagion\\" is director Steven Soderbergh's first feature this year. A few years ago, he directed two films in the same year, Matt Damon comedy-thriller studio-produced vehicle \\"The Informant!\\" and porn star Sasha Grey's first mainstream (albeit indie) film, \\"The Girlfriend Experience\\". This year, he repeats himself, doing two films in the same year, this, and the upcoming independent action thriller \\"Haywire\\". I'm intrigued to see that one as well, but I can't see it being any better than \\"Contagion\\".   \\"Contagion\\" scared the living crap out of me. It follows characters, living throughout the world, all effected by a mysterious pandemic that threatens the lives of everyone. It's something like bird flu, but not quite. It has the worldwide reaction that H1N1 had on the world, but worse. It becomes a government conspiracy tale, that proves that something of this catastrophic weight is not a cut-and-dry kind of thing. There are twists coming from each imaginable angle. The biggest mystery is how this thing began, which isn't ignored, like I thought it would be.   One thing that \\"Contagion\\" has going for it, is a lot of big names. Kate Winslet, Matt Damon, Laurence Fishburne, Marion Cotillard, Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow. Everybody brings more to the table than you expect them to. Each character's story becomes vital to how the story unfolds, and, even as it begins to delude into something of a cut-and-dry docudrama, it pulls the wool out from under your eyes, and surprises you with realistic, yet not melodramatic emotion, and becomes quite the emotionally draining and devastating tale, leaving such an impression on the audience, making this one impossible to tune out.   I choose, for this review, not to really get into each character's story, because, one, it would take up too much time, and two, it's much better experienced, not knowing very much about it, as the story unfolds.   It'll stick with you for longer than you expect it to. I read advance reviews before seeing it today, that claim that leaving the theatre, no one in the audience spoke about it, or touched anyone, or contacted with anyone around them. Paranoia is a main ingredient to \\"Contagion\\", proving that no one is immune to fear that is unspoken, but completely pinpointed, and like I said, impossible to ignore. Seeing an afternoon show, in the college town where I live with a few friends of mine, I didn't quite experience this. However, it's completely believable. It leaves you in such a state of paranoia and euphoria, that it's maddening, considering that there aren't many films like this nowadays.   Another thing that \\"Contagion\\" has going for it is how it's made. Soderbergh doesn't waste any time here. Keeping it concise, at a humane running time (105 minutes), it's a roller-coaster from the very first unsettling scene, right up until the last frame. It's written in a way that feels overall very clinical and to-the-point, yet becomes an emotional journey that makes you feel something for each one of its characters.   The scariest thing about \\"Contagion\\" is its plausibility. Unlike your regular horror movie, it has a base which actually could happen, and has happened, in the past. The scares come from things that human beings encounter every day. No ghosts or zombies (in the literal sense of the world) pop out and scare you, while the typical ominous, trying-to-be scary score plays in the background. It's proof that the quietest movies can be the most terrifying. There's a horrifying atmosphere about this one, that sneaks up on you when you least expect it to. This is compelling stuff, don't miss it.   Grade: A-

B002VKE1K2|5.0|When I watched this movie in the first time I was very skeptical. I thought (''oh no not again such boring movie with ghosts and hunted houses etc...'') but I was wrong. Very wrong. From the beginning the movie turned out to be excellent. It's all filmed with a private camera so it makes it really realistic and creepy. Really creepy. Unfortunately the end is somehow in the middle of the movie predictable and ANYWAY impressive. One little quiddle is the guy (Micah) like other reviews say he didn't make a great job but he acts not bad as well. I'd say everyone who loves horror movies will love this. And the Paranormal Activity 2 is a must for everyone who watched this. It's better than this part. But anyway I can only recommend this movie.
B000T0XEGS|5.0|An audio and visual delight! This is a masterpiece that should not be missed.  This is one of my all time favorites.
B004FK24ZA|5.0|In THE BISHOP'S WIFE, Bishop Henry Brougham (Niven) is trying to raise funds for a cathedral, but he's confounded by Mrs. Hamilton (Cooper), a curt, wealthy widow and primary donor who wants the edifice to be a memorial to her late husband. When Henry prays for Divine guidance, an angel named Dudley (Grant) appears.<br /><br />A side story concerns Prof. Wutheridge, delightfully portrayed by Woolley. He's an aging, atheistic historian with a severe case of writer's block (been working on the same history of Rome for 20 years).<br /><br />Dudley gets involved in everyone's lives, bringing joy to all he comes in contact with except the man who conjured him up, the bishop. Partially scripted by Billy Wilder and Robert Sherwood, this beautiful, gentle Xmastime story is filled with magic, a few neat special effects, and lots of love. Highest recommendation.<br /><br />NOTE: Little Karolyn Grimes, who has the last line in Frank Capra's [[ASIN:B0012VT6RO IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE]] (1946), here plays Julia's and Henry's daughter, Debby.<br /><br />.<br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(7.5) The Bishop's Wife (1947) - David Niven/Loretta Young/Cary Grant/Monty Woolley/James Gleason/Gladys Cooper/Elsa Lanchester/Karolyn Grimes/Regis Toomey
B003CYKCHW|4.0|First things first... Man, does this thing look good! Aside from that and it's very quick tracking speed though, this mouse leaves some things to be desired. Yes, it's cool to be able to program your three little buttons and switch profiles on the fly, but three buttons (including the profiles, nine programmable keys) just feels... Kinda useless. Granted, in my off hand sits a Razer Nostromo, so I could just be biased, but I'll let you decide if three buttons cuts it. On the up side, on max DPi, this thing flies. The thumb shelf is both comfortable and functional, and the finish on the mouse feels great.<br />All in all, it's a really quick, budget gaming mouse with some good features.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I like the app and it is a great companion to the kindle's. the file size is way to big. I am on the fence about keeping it on my phone. as far as the app goes, it works flawlessly.  if you have one of the newer phones with plenty of RAM you will love it. but I have the HTC Desire and not a lot of room to begin with.

0316154687|4.0|This was my first Sedaris book, I was not sure what to expect but it blew me away. I have never had so many sidesplitting laughs in my life from a book before. His stories are non-conventional and highly entertaining. Some parts of the book were definitely not as amusing as the rest and somewhat slow, but I still enjoyed reading about his experiences just because they're so unique. I am now reading \\"Naked\\" and bought two more of his books - could not stop laughing on a recent flight, had to actually put the book away not to disturb my fellow passengers.

B003VANOFY|5.0|Alright, I will start off by saying if you look for this headset, so many professional gamers have it, or the wired version. No one likes to read walls of text, everyone loves pro/con lists! So lets do that. p.s. My reason for buying this headset was I had a problem with wired headsets and cable breaks.  Pros:  1. Really does have 10 hour battery life.  2. Micro USB recharging, basically if you don't like wireless devices you can leave it plugged up and pretend it isn't wireless.  3. 7.1 surround sound.  4. Noise canceling works well.  Cons:  1. If you are the kind of person who is worried about the 10 hour battery life, because you will actually drain the device. You will also find that this headset is only comfortable for about 10 hours before it rubs all the skin off the side of your head.  2. If you are not careful, I am not sure how easy it would be to break the ear piece off, they take no effort to turn. Basically just don't sling your $160 headset around.
B0050XH1H2|5.0|Great to listen straight through, or even one track at a time.  One of my favorite albums of 2011, I've been gifting this to my friends for xmas.  Plus amazon makes it easy (and cheap) to send to people, so it's double awesome.
B005V4FJC4|1.0|The vocal version of nails on a chalkboard.    I guess you can call it whimsical, like a kindergarten musical.    Though the kids tend to at least hit a couple of the notes right.  The music is great, the selections are great, even her style of singing is ok.. kind of a sleepytime/drug-induced/half-hearted style,  it's just that she sings so flat, it ruins the whole thing.  What can I say?  Listen to the samples, if you like it, buy it.  Though I'd hope you support better singers.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I don't own a dog,and have no interest in auto racing. I did not expect to enjoy this, but it had so many 5 star reviews that I bought it as a kindle daily deal.  To my surprise, I loved this book. The story is edgier than I expected, with characters you easily care about, and the narration is perfect.  I haven't cried at the end of a book in a long time, but this one got to me.  It's a quick and easy read, and totally enjoyable. May even consider getting a dog. . .
B004SMD4H2|4.0|Really enjoyed being able to not only rewatch the first season in beautiful HD quality, but to also hear commentary from cast and crew. I do wish that all the episodes had had commentary and the extra features were okay, but they did feel a tad scripted at times, not so natural.
B005V20JKI|4.0|Fun game. Entertainment for free, what more can you want? Never crashed on me and the variety of characters is pretty cool.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|I like this game, but it does not get any updates. The iOS version gets updates. Since they are not really supporting this on the android I only give it 2 stars.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|This is a well designed CPU cooler that's easy to install and keeps my 2500k nice and cool.  The fan had a tick tick tick noise that I couldn't fix, so I ordered another for $7 and all's well.  Not taking a star off for that, crap happens.  This thing is really big.  I have a full sized HAF X case and it was no problem, but I bet you would play hell getting one of these in an ANTEC 900 or the like.  Bottom line:  Works great, good price, easy to install...  two thumbs up!
B003Y5H5HO|3.0|You KNEW I'd be a hard sell on this American retread, but the word \\"gratuitous\\" quickly came to mind. I'll be the first to acknowledge that David Fincher (\\"Zodiac\\") is a brilliant director, but when a book and original movie are already universally known and effectively done, why pad a perfectly adequate story with blatant foreshadowing, gratuitous characters and unnecessary violence? This thing runs for 158 minutes and inserts new scenes that are not consistent with Stieg Larsson's originals!  My defense shields came up during the over-wrought title sequence, but they came down a bit when the film actually began because I AM fond of the story. It has interesting characters, plenty of action, and a plot that is just complicated enough to keep us engaged. After all, how many stories involve a 40-year-old murder?  Let's start with the cast:    * Daniel Craig (\\"Defiance\\"), it took courage to accept a role when the standard has already been set by Michael Nyqvist. Craig's work already stands alone: He is a terrific James Bond and has enjoyed wide-ranging roles over an impressive number of years. Here, his journalist, Mikael Blomkvist is hired by an industrialist to investigate the death/disappearance of his beloved niece 40 years ago. We love Craig, so we won't hold this against him.    * Rooney Mara (\\"The Social Network\\") was determined to make this work. She got piercings, worked out and shaved off her eyebrows. THAT should prove her dedication to her art! Taking over the iconic role of social misfit Liz Salander from Noomie Rapace took guts, and it's clear that she did exactly as Fincher directed her to do. ...sigh....    * Christopher Plummer (\\"Beginners\\") has the aristocratic panache necessary to portray an elderly industrialist. His wry descriptions of his relatives bring humor to a pretty desolate picture of the dysfunctional Vanger family.    * Stellan Skarsgård (\\"Thor\\") is a prominent member of that dysfunctional family....    * Robin Wright (\\"The Conspirator\\") is perfect as Erika Berger, Mikael's long-time (married) lover and co-publisher of their Millennium magazine.  It's a sad commentary that this movie is even necessary. Are Americans so illiterate that we can't even manage to read captions? Are we so jaded that we must have an already action-filled story ramped up to this degree? With an R rating, expect nudity, rape, violence, and blowie uppie stuff.  Now let me try to be fair: I'm going to guess that \\"...Tattoo\\" virgins, who haven't a clue what to expect, will be thrilled and surprised. They will never guess that a much better version exists. I guess that's why this was made in the first place, huh? Well, who am I to say....? I will pre-order this DVD as soon as it is available on Amazon.com because my DVD library contains many such comparisons and remakes. I'm sad, though...
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I wanted a streamlined, light-weight, protective cover for my Kindle Fire so I could carry it around in my purse. After reviewing many different covers, this one is the ticket for me.  The others were too bulky or heavy.  I don't use the stand, so I can't comment on that criticism from other reviewers. The Kindle snaps in and the corners hold it securely in place. I like that holes don't occlude the speakers, on/off switch, or micro USB port for charging.  The elastic band holds the front cover in place and if you fold the cover back you can also slip your hand under the elastic band to hold it. This cover does does exactly what I wanted it to, and was worth the price (and 3-week wait).  Be sure to watch the video on it.
B004DK49DW|5.0|I saw Social Distortion in concert last November, 2010. They played most of this new album--and I liked what I heard immediately--but the album wasn't released until the following March. I downloaded two of the songs then, but never got around to getting the complete collection until now. I'm sorry I waited so long. Hard Times and Nursery Rhymes is a great album.<br /><br />It kicks off with the short, charging instrumental \\"Road Zombie,\\" then the catchy \\"California (Hustle and Flow), \\"Gimme the Sweet and Lowdown,\\" and \\"Diamond in the Rough\\" follow. The hit \\"Machine Gun Blues\\" is next; that's five killers to start the album. Usually albums begin to peter out at this point, the further you get into it.  Not so here. In fact, two of my favorite cuts are the last two songs, \\"Can't Take it With You,\\" and \\"Still Alive.\\"<br /><br />I seriously love this album (if you couldn't tell by now). I can't stop playing it; it ends and I start at the beginning again. Thanks, Social D!
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Loved this game on PC, wanted it for my tablet (Acer iconia a500). Gameplay works fine but the transitions from level to level are 'laggy'. Great game overall, and worth the purchase for the PvZ addicts out there.

1416955070|4.0|admittedly the 1st book had me on the fence, but i have been assured by others that have read through book four that it gets so much better. it has intriguing ideas and the characters are more enticing as the book goes on. certainly fills the void left by finishing Twilight.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|When one lives in and loves a city with an ancient history, such as Paris or Rome, it becomes very easy to sense the existence of an imperceptible permeability between past and present. It is as if one only has to wait for the light to change a certain way, or for a bell to strike a certain hour, and the magic will happen--for those who are receptive to magic, that is, and are willing to believe in the Magic of Place.<br /><br />This is the premise of Woody Allen's latest whimsical flight into the imaginative world of Gil Pender (Owen Wilson), a self-acknowledged Hollywood screenwriting hack, who dreams of writing a novel, the protagonist of which owns a nostalgia shop. \\"What is a nostalgia shop?\\" asks one of Allen's characters. Anyone who has to ask such a question is assuredly immune to magic, and will probably not enjoy this film. Since I am a romantic and firmly believe in the Magic of Place, I enjoyed it immensely.<br /><br />Woody Allen clearly loves Paris. His opening scenes, in fact, represent a paean to The City of Light, as for almost four minutes the camera, with an evocative jazz accompaniment, moves from point to point along the Seine, the Luxembourg Gardens, Montmartre, the Champs &Eacute;lys&eacute;es, the Tuileries, the Left Bank, among other locations. We are treated to views of great boulevards, narrow streets, steep stairs, roofs with chimney pots, as the camera's eye glances at brasseries, cafes, fashion houses, fountains, the pyramid of the Louvre, Notre Dame, the Opera, and the Tour Eiffel. Paris in the sunshine; Paris in the rain. And all that is before the opening credits, in which we see that Allen, as usual, has assembled an ensemble cast. And for a special treat, the actual film begins among the lily ponds at Monet's Giverny.<br /><br />Although I enjoyed all the performances, I particularly liked Adrian Brodie as Salvator Dali (He seemed so perfectly at home in Dali's surrealist skin), and Kathy Bates as Gertrude Stein (She brings a convincing panache to any part she plays). Marion Cotillard is charming as Pender's love-interest from the past, and her costumes--in fact, all the costumes--are splendid. Michael Sheen, looking a bit like Tony Blair with a beard, plays Paul, a pontificating academic, who cannot resist showing off his knowledge--never mind that he is mistaken--to their Rodin museum guide--played in an engaging cameo, by the glamourous Mme Sarkosy.<br /><br />\\"Midnight in Paris\\" deals with themes similar to those in \\"The Purple Rose of Cairo\\" in which the lines between past and present, between illusion and reality, become delightfully blurred. Magic, in fact, comes along in the form of a 1920 Peugeot, which stops and opens its door in invitation. If you accept, it will take you along for an enchanting ride!arion Cotillard is charming as Pender's love-interest from the past, and her costumes--in fact, all the costumes--are splendid.

B0067D7Y3U|3.0|Was a little disappointed with this album. I guess when you set the bar high like he did with the first two albums it's tough to match. I have been a Daughtry fan since day 1. There is only about 6 songs really worth listening too.Gone too soon and start of something good are slower and pretty good. Renegade is good but pretty hard.Crawling back to you, we're not gonna fall and louder than ever are the other tracks that are good.If your a Daughtry fan you will find some enjoyment from the album. Would i buy the album again? Yes. if you only want the good songs then just preview them and download the ones you want. Today you can get the whole album download for $3.99. it is definitely worth that. I preordered mine from the daughtry web site so i have had it since it was released. Over all not bad but not his best album.
B003O86FMW|1.0|I read all three books, and my apologies to everybody who liked them but I thought they were awful. Unfortunately I suffer from the compulsion that forces one to finish a book that has been started. They came highly recommended from a few people so I hoped they would be good; and I think they are if you are between the ages of 13 and 17? If you are an adult I wouldn't bother. For example, I think anything by Herman Wouk, Somerset Maugham, or Tom Robbins is excellent; if you agree then do not buy these books.

0439023513|2.0|Other reviewers have already covered the problems of poor character and plot development, so I figured I'd delve into new territory: the hugely problematic \\"messages\\" Collins is sending through these books, especially Mockingjay. I enjoyed these books as pure entertainment, but so many people seem to be talking about them as more than that -- as satiric commentary on reality TV, for instance -- and that to me opens quite a few cans of worms.  First, while Collins writes leaps and bounds better than a certain other extremely popular female YA novelist, I note one troublesome similarity: a female protagonist who is strong and deeply caring about those she loves and also clearly drop-dead gorgeous though of course she's totally unaware of this as well as the fact that there are not one but two fabulous guys in love with her, neither of whom pressures her for sex but is contented with sweetly intense platonic love.  Yeah, because that's what all teenage girls are like, and it in no way builds unrealistic romantic ideals in the heads of young women.    Second, Mockingjay's politics are as messy as its plot.  Despite the grimness and violence of this book, ultimately Collins seems to be pushing an inoffensive, overly simplistic quasi-libertarian ideology -- less pretentiously put, she believes that individuals should have freedom.  Yay, individual freedom!  Boo government, and boo rebellion against government for that matter because, as Mockingjay suggests, any organized rebellion against government is probably just as bad as the government itself.  So Katniss's ruthless killing is OK because she's fighting for herself and her loved ones, and Peeta's lying about things like the pregnancy is OK because he's doing it for her.  Good to know.  Third, I was delighted that the first book depicted Katniss as having \\"olive skin,\\" meaning that she wasn't necessarily caucasian.  But not much is made of this detail going forward, disappointingly.  What's more, readers are almost certainly going to identify with Katniss rather than the superficial twits in the Capitol.  We always prefer to identify with the oppressed, after all.  Problem is, most of Collins's readers, certainly the American ones, are probably closer aligned with the Capitol.  If she had made District 12 in Mexico or Southeast Asia, then the books would make much more sense as a real-world satire.    Finally, I can't see that Collins has anything particularly revelatory to say about reality TV.  Reality TV is fake.  Gasp!  Really?  Nor does she have much to say about contemporary American society.  This book has more in common with Orwell's 1984 than 21st century America.  Her depiction is simplistic:  there are bad guys who subjugate the poor through entertainment.  In our world it's a whole lot more complicated than that, because those who are subjugated are just as enthralled by the entertainment as everyone else.  If you identified with Katniss and cheered for her and frowned angrily at all the horrors they went through, why did you enjoy reading about the games so much?  Because we're all guilty -- a point missed entirely by these books.  Yeah, I know, this is way too analytical for a bunch of fun teen books, but whatever; whenever I hear intelligent people praising a book to the skies, my crap detector comes out.  Sorry.

0307949486|4.0|Stieg Larsson would be pleased by the popularity, but would probably rather be alive. This is a good book, but it's great popularity was a matter of good luck, timing and promotion. Certainly the tale is gripping. The characters are well drawn. The events are unusual and the outcome surprising.<br />For me, the most fascinating aspect of the first novel was to sense, almost experience the cultural aspects of the setting. How differently the events would have played out in America.

0385336942|4.0|This is a slow read, but worthwhile.  The reader's patience is rewarded.  Even though it is a minor story, it is a very tough story.  The climax has elements of Shakespearean tragedy, but it is so understated you can miss it if you're not paying attention  Think here, Romeo & Juliet in a minor key.  With minor actors, minor characters that no one has ever heard of let alone cares about.  It is a slow read, it has its high points but you have to wait for them.  It is a bit like fishing, meditative in that way. It is slow, and a bit frustrating, but all this is necessary for the unfolding of the ending.  The writer does spare the reader  --  the climax is not traumatizing to the reader, but as is made clear, the young soldier Louis Belk spends the rest of his life trying to recover from it.    The descriptions of Alaska are of course sublime, as many reviewers have already mentioned.  The writer is in full control here, as he is with his difficult characters.    Not quite 5 stars, but close.  Highly recommended.

B00005N6KG|5.0|A GREAT pair of phones! Believe it or not, the last pair of these I bought was in 1998 for $22! Back then the headband was metal instead of plastic but the earphones appear to be the same and sound GREAT. In December 2011 the old pair finally gave out, a frayed wire. THIRTEEN YEARS OF EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE!   I HATE \\"ear buds\\"! HATE em! Ear buds are uncomfortable and block out outside sound which can be dangerous in certain situations, like when you're mowing your lawn, jogging or when your spouse is screaming at you.   These are adjustable, \\"rest\\" in your ears instead of clogging them, are ultra lightweight and produce great sound.....and they are CHEAP!!! I am NOT a sound aficionado so I would NEVER buy a pair of BOSE ear buds for $80! (WHY?) Personally, I think that would be stupid and a waste of money in an effort to appear \\"cool\\", like buying RAYBAN sunglasses for $130.  Anyway, take my word for it, these are a TRUE bargain! I recommend them HIGHLY! Thank you SONY for continuing to manufacture these!  One more thing - SONY uses minimal packaging with these! Very earth smart!

B0067D7Y3U|3.0|The album itself is OK but not as good as the previous ones. After I purchased this album for 3.99 I noticed that the deluxe version contains 4 more songs not on this version of the album. I do not like that they do this. Just make one album with all the songs and leave it at that. At 0.99 cents per DL that's another $4.00. Its still cheaper than buying the actual album new but your not really getting the really great deal at $3.99 that you might think.

B005I6EU48|5.0|I can't stress enough how good this case looks and feels (I have the red one).  Yes, the price is quite high but in my opinion it is worth it.  I don't understand all the reviews about it being too small.  Sure, it takes a bit of initial wiggling to get the straps on properly but it fits my Fire perfectly.  If you plan on taking your Fire out of the case a lot I would suggest looking at alternatives.  The cover doesn't raise up at all after a minimal break in period and setting it face down for a little while.   The red version has a brown spine which some people may find weird with the dark red cover.  I personally think it looks awesome.  The inside is very soft as is the outside which feels great.  There is also a little slip pocket inside to store bits of paper or a cleaning cloth.  If you're looking at this case it is probably because you want a touch of class and like the idea of your Kindle looking like a book.  The case is just awesome all around and when I use my Fire I feel like I'm handling an old school leather bound book.  It is perfect.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|When I finished Mockingjay, I felt like I had survived a war myself. It was difficult to read to the end; there are horrors and losses throughout the series that overwhelmed me. You have to understand that this is not a fairytale; this is not happily-ever-after. This is survival of unimaginable events, unimaginable evil. I have never read a book, a fictional series that has ever been as honest with its readers as this series. It is painful, it is real, and it is completely worth it. Suzanne Collins has written a truly awesome series. You will not regret reading these books to the end - but you cannot expect a happily-ever-after.
0307959856|4.0|Aside from a major error of not mentioning what happened to Lydia's friend, Mrs. Denny, P.D. James provided good entertainment. She has some fun social commentaries similar to Jane Austen's. For example, \\"A brutal murder one one's own property by a brother by marriage with whom one is know to be at enmity will inevitably produce a large [church] congregation, including some well-known invalids  whose prolonged indisposition had prohibited them them from the rigours of church attendance for many years.\\" She also keeps her story properly within the time period, including the police work. While the mystery was not very exciting for me, I didn't really care; I enjoyed the plausible continuation of the P&P story. Unlike some readers, I also liked the psychological progression of the main characters. They developed the way I would hope, into better characters, although still working on their personal weaknesses. This was a delightful read and one of the best continuations of any Austen work I've read.
B000IJ79UW|5.0|With all these reviews, I'll make this one simple...        Christopher Reeve just simply has it, he has everything you want your Superhero to have; he's Charming, smiling, friendly, charismatic, confident, and his acting is absolutely brilliant!!! You don't get this from many actors these days, especially actors playing the roll of a superhero.     I put this movie in my top 3 of all time, right next to Shawshank Redemption and Superman 2! :D   Get the Ultimate Collection instead of just this 4 disc version, the Ultimate Collection has all 4 of these disc's included, as well as Superman 2, the making of Sups 2, Superman 3, the making of Sups 3, and Superman 4 also with special features! Thats 8 DVD's packed with everything you ever wanted to know about Christopher Reeve and how they made the magic happen,  All for only $15 bucks!!!
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I don't understand the negative reviews on this product! I liked it so much that I ordered another. I have the tan and the red. Yes, it's a tight fit. Isn't that the purpose, for protection? The Fire is not going to fall out of this case and it is beautiful! I love both of mine! I recently won another Fire in a contest and I might just purchase this case yet again! It doesn't close all the way? Really, just turn it over and the weight of the Fire closes the case.

0451219597|4.0|I enjoyed this story. The plot was full of conflict and bite-your-nails tension, with death always imminent. In addition, Follett based his story on the true-life incident of British women who acted as spies in France during World War II. In fact, the woman he most likely based the story on died not too many years after the novel was published, and her obituary mentioned that she was the model for the main character in Jackdaws. All the characters were interesting, willing to sacrifice in order to defeat the Nazis. I found this story more visual than many of Follett's novels: I can still, years later, see the night-time landing in the field. And I thought the plot was good up until the end, where Follett went for a smash-bang finish that was certainly spectacular, but not necessarily the best ending. Definitely worth reading.
0061784788|5.0|Well, I must say that I'm 100% satisfied with yet another amazing thrill ride in \\"The Devil Colony\\" by my favorite fantastic author James Rollins!!  The 1st Rollins book I read was \\"Deep Fathom\\" 3 or 4 yrs ago. Instantly I was hooked!!  Since then, I became a self proclaimed \\"Super Fan\\"...I have read all of your books Mr. Rollins and shall anxiously await your next Sigma Force suspense thriller! I sincerely enjoy the experience one receives by holding a real book, Rollins' books, not a Kindle or other device, flipping through each page smelling the paper and ink, just waiting to see what the next sentence, paragraph and chapter will reveal. Reading Rollins' books ,any and all, is an exciting, suspenseful, thrilling adventure that exceeds all expectation and delivers a great tumultuos ride from start to finish!!  Thank you Mr. Rollins for bringing such wonderful stories together in each and every book you write!  What Blast to read them!
B004EPYZUS|4.0|Ethan Hunt is forced to go underground with his team in order to prevent a Russian nuclear missile from striking the United States. Due to the sensitivity of Russian and American relations, he is performing his mission with only a wink-wink from his superiors. This one contains the requisite action and excitement and is the best film in this trilogy since the original. The storyline is not overly complex, and I found myself invested in the action, at times feeling the thrills of the onscreen excitement right there in my seat. This is a fun movie to watch.
0670022950|5.0|This is an exceptionally well researched and written book, and it tells one of the most important stories of our times. While it recognizes the grim fact that humanity has always been violent, it affirms the remarkable progress towards peace. The progress spans centuries and it is remarkable. The best news is that the pace of progress is accelerating, in large part because of a growing recognition that violence is not a reasonable, rational or acceptable way to resolve differences. Furthermore, systems and mechanisms are being developed to provide alternatives to violent force to resolve serious issues. As the public at large and policy makers in particular understand that violence is not inevitable and that it can be prevented with beneficial outcomes the more safe and secure all of humanity will be. A growing community of conflict resolution professionals and peacebuilding organizations is making it happen. This marvelous book helps everyone understand that building peace is possible.
B003Y5H5HY|4.0|A man who works as a journalist is asked to investigate the disappearance of a woman in the 60's. He teams with Lisbeth Salander, a woman who, let's just say, is very unique. She is a computer hacker who early on in the film takes revenge on a man who brutally rapes her. The two are working together to solve the mystery of Harriet, who mysteriously vanished years ago. The film is technically outstanding, well-acted, and it maintains the realism and brutality of the rape and revenge scenes involving Lisbeth Salander. Unfortunately, the movie is overlong due to an unnecessary revenge sequence involving a businessman that the journalist had been convicted of libeling. With David Fincher at the helm, I expected a great film, but what I saw was merely a good one.

While there, she befriends another former acquaintance, a nerdy guy from her school to whom she would not have given the time of day as a teenager. This is a well-written and well-acted story of a lady trying to recapture her best years and perhaps hook-up with a guy that she regrets not having in her life. Screenwriter Diablo Cody is at the top of her game, telling a story that is funny, clever, and emotional and will touch a nerve with varying members of the audience. Don't miss this one.

B0059XTUMC|5.0|It is 1927 and a silent film star, George Valentin has a photo shoot interrupted by a young fan, Peppy Miller. What appears to be an awkward moment turns out to be a funny one. The fan becomes a film star in her own right over the next couple of years. As silent films become popular, George Valentin's career fades, and Peppy Miller is now the toast of Hollywood. This is an actual silent film, which certainly makes it unique in today's culture, and the results are delightful. The film becomes better as it moves along, resulting in a crescendo of emotion as the former star finds his career and marriage diminish, and his former fan, now a movie star, tries to help him. The film is highlighted by a brilliant lead performance from Jean Dujardin, a fantastic musical score, and George's very funny canine companion. This is much heralded film that does not disappoint.

1250006341|5.0|From the robin's-egg blue of the actual book, to the luminous dust jacket, to the fonts, and really, the entire book design, everything looks very elegant and Edwardian. If you've followed my blog Edwardian Promenade for a while, or read books about the Edwardians, some of the historical content isn't exactly new per se, but Fellowes does a great job of placing the cold, plain facts of the era in the context of Downton Abbey's inhabitants. The book kicks off with a forward by Julian Fellowes, where he discusses his philosophy towards the series and continues to share his deep love affair with the long-gone society that inhabited the English country house.<br /><br />Fellowes (Jessica, that is), takes us literally through the world of Downton Abbey, starting with family life, touching on society and its changes, life belowstairs, fashion of the age, the function of the country estate, romantic relationships, and war. Last but not least is the chapter devoted to behind the scenes of the series, though the entire book is interspersed with tidbits of the actual production. The amount of work that goes into creating this incredible high drama is astounding, and without pictures of the sets and costumes and crew I would find it difficult to believe this wasn't pulled together with the wave of a wand.<br /><br />Best yet are the mini-interviews from the cast and crew, whose interesting-and sometimes entertaining-recollections of filming series one and two (based on the synopses I've placed on the site, the book hints at happenings up to the second or third episode) are a treat. The one that stands out to me is historical adviser Alastair Bruce's conversation with Sophie McShera (Daisy), who complained that she never got to see the house since, as scullery maid, Daisy rarely left the kitchens! The only downside is that there are no quotes from Dame Maggie Smith! I would have loved to hear her thoughts on the series and its success, as well as her position as Grand Dame on the set, but alack alas alack-at least there are plenty of \\"Violetisms\\" sprinkled throughout the text.<br /><br />But yet again I cannot express how lovely this book is! I spent the first day or two just looking at the book because it's so beautiful, and the following week was spent absorbing all of the information in the book-and even then I've saved a few sections to read later on. Basically, The World of Downton Abbey is the entire series in print format, and for all of you Downtonites, this book is well worth purchasing!<br /><br />(this review is reposted from Edwardian Promenade, where I've also interviewed Jessica Fellowes!)as alack-at least there are plenty of \\"Violetisms\\" sprinkled throughout the text.

After learning about his death, I decided to find out more about Steve and share what I have learned.<br /><br />In some way, he was not much different from you and me. He was raised (and adopted) by a working class couple. Growing up he was energetic, prankful, and fun-loving.<br /><br />Yet, he was different. He had above average intelligence, (skipping one grade in elementary school). He showed single-child syndrome - ego-centric, a loner with few friends, and did not know how to share. In other words, his emotional quotient was rather low. It showed up in his relationships with his friends, girl friends, family, employee, co-workers, business partners, and bosses. The only exception may be his wife who was strong enough to standup to him and weather the ups and downs of his personality. He found Apple, bore a child out of wedlock, and eventually became rich and famous.<br /><br />His view of the world was black and white, either you were insanely right or f***ing wrong. His emotions fluctuated between the two extremes.<br /> The biggest difference between him and us was his passion - passion for excellence.<br /><br />In the American business schools, we are taught to fulfill the needs of stakeholders - stock holders, investors, owners, employees, creditors, and suppliers - by maximizing return on investments. In reality, the CEOs are fulfilling their needs first - getting 6-8 figures salaries, huge stock options, and golden parachutes upon separation. Steve thought that was the wrong approach. He believed in creating a market based on great products and innovation.

B0030IIZ4M|5.0|This is a great movie for kids and for adults. I will defentally be letting my future children watch this movie because not only can I watch it, but i will also enjoy it with them (unlike a lot of the TV shows out there today).
B005OK721G|4.0|Last week I saw Zoe Saldana being interviewed on Chelsea Lately. Up to that point I had not intended to see the movie. I thought she had a presence about her though, and when she mentioned it was a Luc Besson movie, whose name is synonymous with stylish thriller, I had to go.<br /><br />Throughout his illustrious film career as writer, producer and director, Luc Besson has crafted many thrillers featuring assassins. Most notably probably [[ASIN:B004GIV0MO La Femme Nikita]], which has now become two different tv series, and remade as an American movie starring Bridget Fonda, which lacked the killer instinct of the original. He wrote the characters for the Transporter movies starring Jason Statham, and the excellent movie [[ASIN:B002BI6SMI Taken]] starring Liam Neeson. Leon [[ASIN:B002O5M4SA L&eacute;on: The Professional (Theatrical and Extended Edition) [Blu-ray]]], a personal favorite stars Natalie Portman in her first screen role, and he wrote Colombiana.<br /><br />While Colombiana may not distinguish itself particularly when compared with these other movies, what does distinguish it is Zoe Saldana. If looks could kill, she wouldn't need a weapon. So, when a young girl witnesses her parents murdered by a ruthless druglord, she demonstrates strange abilities, makes her way to America, joins her uncle. Picture a 10 year old saying to her uncle: \\"I want to kill people, can you help?\\"<br /><br />So, she becomes an assassin, and finds creative ways of getting into the most secure places. She is like the mist. You may notice something visually captivating, and captivating in other ways too, about watching a woman in a sleek, figure revealing black one piece, doing all manner of things which demonstrate her flexibility and nimbleness, and wielding a weapon. It's quite sexy.<br /><br />In fact it's fair to say that Zoe Saldana elevates the movie, and shows that she has what it takes to play leading roles, and carry a movie at the box office. Yes, as you expect, you will find the usual crash bang wallop here too.<br />So, I give the movie 6 out of 10 for quality, 8 out of 10 for style, and I give Zoe Saldana 10 out of 10, for her presence, charisma, and overall sexiness, which makes the movie 8 out of 10.<br /><br />And if you like this movie, and have not already seen the other ones I highlighted above, I highly recommend you check them out. I think you will enjoy the movie, and I hope you found this review helpful.So, I give the movie 6 out of 10 for quality, 8 out of 10 for style, and I give Zoe Saldana 10 out of 10, for her presence, charisma, and overall sexiness, which makes the movie 8 out of 10.

B0050SYS5A|1.0|I struggled with this for an hour.  It was actually kind of neat.  I was at the kinect configuration screen where it shows the person all green and I was tweaking and tweaking trying to get the screen to have a clear enough picture.  Then I took the dumb thing off and it was a night and day difference.  Everything worked instantly.<br /><br />This thing sounds like a good idea, but it just doesn't work.<br /><br />After thinking about it... I realized that makes sense.  After all, if this thing worked, why wouldn't Microsoft have just built the original lenses this way?

As the title implies the revolution to the Capital tyranny has taken flame by the symbol of Cat, the mockingjay pin, and a few poison berries.<br /><br />Catching Fire is another page turner that defies you to put it down before you are finished.

0439023521|4.0|Once I started reading The Hunger Games I had trouble putting it down.<br /><br />Yes, the main character starts off minus a parent. There is action, defiance, rebellion, and cliche, but Hunger Games moves at an unstoppable pace that cannot be denied.<br /><br />There is incredible resonance with 21st century America and an extreme seperation of rich and poor. The media is used to control. Sound familiar?<br /><br />Hunger Games resonates because it reflects our current culture where everything is judged by appearance and sound bytes. Suzanne Collins has successfully tapped into a meme that can propell us into the next century. Reading \\"Catching Fire\\" and I am equally enthralled.

B0007MUR2W|5.0|So, you want to buy a CD version of the old vinyl album you once had. I'll bet you have been looking at dozens of different versions of Ziggy Stardust, and are trying to untangle the mess. If you are reading my review, you just got lucky.  Sellers alternate between calling the CD \\"Ziggy Stardust\\", \\"Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars\\", \\"The Rise And Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars\\", \\"Ziggy Stardust (The Motion Picture)\\" or other names.  Critics have stated that the 30th Anniversary re-issue sucks, as some of the intros are cut out and the stereo is right and left instead of left and right. Other versions do not include bonus tracks, and yet other versions are said to be of poor quality. It has also been stated that the Ryco, or Rycodisc release is the best version, but how do you figure that out?  Well, I can tell you that I just crossed my fingers and took a guess, and was lucky. This is what I have in my hot little hands: The full album plus bonus tracks \\"John, I'm Only Dancing (previously unrelased mix)\\", \\"Velvet Goldmine (Single B-side)\\", \\"Sweet Head (Previously unreleased track)\\", \\"Ziggy Stardust (Previously unreleased original demo)\\", and \\"Lady Stardust (Previously unreleased original demo)\\". On the back at the bottom, it lists the copyright as 1972 and 1990, Manufactured and Marketed by Rycodisc.  I am happy with my purchase, and hope my review helps you with your search.
B003R0LBVW|2.0|There is much here to be admired and Franzen's writing is beautiful and luminous at times, but the novel as a whole is not cohesive in my opinion. Many reviewers point out that the section of the novel that is part of Patty's autobiography fails to differentiate her voice from the authors.  This point is valid and I believe the novel would be better if it was entirely written from the perspective of Patty. Franzen tries to cover much ground and draw a portrait of our time, but it becomes too disjointed between stories and characters. I think the book would have benefited here too by making Walter and Patty's character arcs more cohesive and believable by covering the years between college and marriage, and having their own children come of age. Maybe Franzen is trying to high-light generational differences by examining life experiences of children and parents at similar stages, but this makes it rather difficult to fully care about any of these characters.   Occasionally there are passages that describe this generation and times so well. This makes the novel worth reading, but for a book so lauded and that took 10 years to produce, you would expect a somewhat better delivery. Many reviews have said that the characters seem very flat in this novel; I disagree. They are not so much flat as their actions drawn out. If Franzen could have covered the same amount of plot and development in 200 fewer pages this would have been a classic.

B0067D7Y3U|5.0|Break the Spell review.  1. Renegade; the opening track of Daughtry's new album wakes you up and starts you head banging. This is the biggest rock song on Daughtry's album.  2. Crawling Back to You; I've been a fan of this song since I heard it live during a concert (which was on YouTube) - The song just proved Daughtry has a strong voice. It's easily one of Daughtry's best singles.  3. Outta My Head; completely different than I was expecting. I thought it would be a song like Over You but it's more among the lines of What I Want. It's a brilliant track.  4. Start of Something Good; What Chris calls his first true love song. It's amazing. The lyrics actually stand out. This is a great pop ballad song.  5. Crazy; This is one of my favorite songs on the album, from Chris' falsetto to the amazing lyrics. This song will get you dancing.  6. Break the Spell; What an amazing song, I wasn't sure if this was going to be good or not. You couldn't tell with the thirty second preview, but the song actually proves to me that you shouldn't even think Daughtry will be bad.   7. We're Not Gonna Fall; The best song on the album IMO. The lyrics are amazing, I love the Augustana vibe to it. It's Daughtry down to the D. You can't get better.  8. Gone Too Soon; The emotional ballad about losing a loved one. It's beautifully sung. A tear jerker song for sure.  9. Losing My Mind; This instantly stood out to me for Daughtry to have as the third single from the album. Another song that showcases Chris' falsetto. Brilliant song, brilliant lyrics and I'm sure this will be the fan favorite.  10. Rescue Me; The country-styled pop ballad, This showcases Chris' amazing talent for acoustic songs. Another top notch song from the rock band.  11. Louder than Ever; I think this song has an 80's vibe. It might be my least favorite song on the standard edition but I still think it's a great song which I will more than likely listen to more than once in a day.  12. Spaceship; Oh man. This song is amazing. The lyrics was not what I was expecting, I was expecting a song about being an alien. This song is about losing the girl you love and can't happen to find her. It's amazing. A song that I will listen to repeatedly.   - BONUS TRACKS -  13. Who's They; First time I read the title for this song, I thought it was a spelling mistake and thought it was meant to say `Who's There' - This quite an amazing song, I can understand why it's a bonus track though. I think it would have been weak on the standard edition but it's amazing as bonus track.   14. Maybe We're Already Gone; This is my least favorite song on the album. It's amazing though. Great lyrics, great song but it's not surprising it's a bonus track. It's more of a B-Side than a single.   15. Everything But Me; WHY IS THIS A BONUS TRACK? This song is genius, easily one of the best songs on the album. Beautiful lyrics, great vocals. Perfect song.  16. Lullaby; A song to his babies, what a nice warm hearted way to end the album, this song is a slow acoustic song which would fit perfectly with [the] Plain White T's. It's a very nice song.
B000HEWEJO|1.0|The film rates a 5. The anniversary edition rates a 5. The packaging rates a 0. At the beginning of this dvd is a preview for a movie. You can't remove it, you can't skip over it. All you can do is mute and endure. I resent having to pay for advertising when all I wanted was [It's]a Wonderful Life.
1250004217|3.0|\\"Sarah's Key\\" opens the door on a historical period, the Velodroma di'Hiver<br />in July of 1942, when French police rounded up Jewish residents.  It's an<br />event few of us were aware of and deserves to be told. Unfortunately, \\"Sarah's Key\\" doesn't really allow entry into the minds and passions  of those involved.  We are left wondering why Sarah's father doesn't do more to try to rescue his son, and why the mother is so passive.<br />The contemporary story of Julia, the journalist who tries to uncover<br />the secrets surrounding this event, is disappointding.  She's a character<br />who could have stepped out of the pages of Madomoiselle for all the depth she has.  Moreover, the relationship she has with her husband Bertrand is confusing to the reader and ultimately unrealistic.  The author also likes shopworn  phrases such as \\"bat out of hell\\", \\"bottom line\\" and other<br />cliches. Please forgive me, but bottom line, save your money.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I had seen all but the last 2 Harry Potter movies at the theater.  It was great to see the entire collection over a few days instead of a year or more apart.  Highly recommended.

B0063IH60K|4.0|This solitaire game is a bit different from normal, turning over 1 (not 3) cards at a time.  It is fun and wins are rewarding.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|I enjoy powerful music and this is a must have in your library. I found it by accident just browsing, it brought on the shivers lol. I do love my Amazon, they feature artist that I might have missed to my sorrow.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this app. This is one of the best and one of the most polished apps for the kindle market. I have this game on my Anroid phone and liked it on there but it is even better when it's on the kindle fire or any app. This app is definatley worth $0.99.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this app! Quick easy use and straightforward features. Was nice, I wanted just spider and I got just spider. Also has a minimal footprint on your phone.
0393317552|1.0|This book conveys the argument that humans leave nature's assembly line identical and all strengths and weaknesses result from non-genetic factors. It is a vigorous attempt at preventing bogeyman of geneticism from haunting the politically correct halls of universities, and bothering all of us with his harsh realities.
B0063GORYU|5.0|lots of fun. easy to pass time. graphics ok. better than sitting at computer to play.nice to try lefthanded wsy
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitare is easy to install, fun to play, ads between games only. Rating the app, however, is a different story.
B004GYY714|4.0|This is the best app that you can get if you're a music lover. Not only does it instantly recognize where you live and set up music from around your state, you can also listen to stations from around the world. Works great on kindle fire. I cant wait to discover new music stations! Better than iheartradio!
1572704861|5.0|the book arrived in great condition and promptly. thanks for a wonderful and efficient service. will definitely use this company again.
043902353X|4.0|im so into novels that seem to capture not only your interest but your very emotions and take you to a different world or perspective in life.<br />the kind that grips.. the kind that grabs you and keeps you guessing at what will happen next and astonishes you at the end. very highly recomended.<br />however, what i don't like is that fact that it is a trilogy or novels that you have to wait for the next one..<br />im reading to have fun and not to add up stress to my life waiting for the next one to come out.
B005KGPC4S|5.0|Great movie! Christian fundamentalist group terrorizes a small town which results in a standoff between the church members and the local branch of the ATF. Very reminiscient of a religious cult film I saw a few years ago called , \\"Believers.\\" Grade A acting, directing,story line etc. I would def recommend the film. I was not disappointed.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Great for all ages.  Improves problem-solving skills.  Excellent graphics, soothing music &amp; sounds.  Reminds me of an old computer game I used to have where you had to push around blocks of ice.  Well worth the price.  GET IT!
0446573019|2.0|I have read most of Baldacci's books and generally enjoyed them, but I think he lost his touch on this one. The story telling is good: I enjoyed the characters and their relationships, but the plot is preposterous and totally implausable. The hero is John Puller, a bright, solitary, military investigator, who as a Special Forces veteran of Middle East wars has developed unbelievably (and I do mean unbelievable) superhuman skills in defending himself. (At one point he dispatches a bad guy by slicing him open with an iPod sharpened to a razor edge. Has Baldacci every looked at an IPod? Give us a break.) His sidekick for this novel is a bright, competent small-town police woman, Samantha Cole, and their relationship is interesting and respectful. While I credit Baldacci for giving  competent females a major role, the fact remains that the woman contributes little to solving the mystery or dealing with the bad guys. The relationships between Puller and his dysfunctional family and Cole and her dysfunctional family are interesting but not well developed. Puller's brother, a nuclear scientist, is in military prison for treason, but we never understand any of that backstory. His father, a renowned Army General, is suffering from dementia, but the reasons for the the nature of the father-son relationship are not explained.   The plot and the elements of the story leave much to be desired because they are so implausable. For example, the bad guys make several efforts to kill Puller, twice attempting to blow him up with various kinds of bombs. They choose these complicated (and and, of course, unsuccessful) approaches when they could easily have shot him from long range, as they do with one of the other characters. One of the bad guys, when captured, kills himself, presumably to avoid being questioned, but that decision is totally implausible given the circumstances. A more serious defect is that we don't  really understand what the threat is that Puller is trying to deal with until virtually the end of the book. Little is revealed along the way to help us guess what it might be. When it is revealed, it's just not believable. There is no logical reason for the bad guys to be doing what they are doing. They threaten the very existence of a large part of West Virginia when there is no motive for them to do so. They could have covered their tracks in much easier ways.  What is ultimately very dissatisfying is that the explanation for all of what has happened, the solution to the mystery, occurs in a final confrontation between the hero and the chief bad guy. The villain (who pretty much comes out of nowhere) intends to kill Puller, but before he does so, he helpfully explains what he did and why he did it in great detail. So the plot is revealed in this last-minute conversation. Not good story telling.  If you choose to read this book, don't expect a good plot or a satisfying ending. Read to enjoy the journey rather than to reach the destination.
B005L3HJ8M|5.0|I got this vinyl as a present for my boyfriend. Absolutely wonderful, it's one of our favorite musical artists. The sound quality is absolutely wonderful. This is such a great album. The only song I was overall not satisfied with was \\"Princess of China\\" which had Rhianna in it. It really didn't sound like Coldplay. If I wanted to hear Rhianna, I would buy her music. On the other-hand though Paradise, Hurts like Heaven and Every Teardrop is a Waterfall are beyond amazing tracks. Overall a very well done album by Coldplay as expected. :]
B005QPGHQU|4.0|I was excited to hear this new Evanescence CD since hearing What You Want on the radio.  I've been a fan since The Fallen and was hoping for a another great album.  While I still feel this CD is very good, it really isn't on the same level as The Fallen.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These are some of the best books I have ever read.  I could not put them down- my husband and I formed a two person book club becuse he was just as wrapped up in the trilogy as I was.  The other reviews do a good job describing the books, I just wanted to express my love for them and highly recommend them to all.  Especially read before the movie comes out in March!
B000KJT8IG|5.0|It was received in the time. I received the product as described. The price was right. I would order again.
B001URY5IU|5.0|The best part of this scene is the cannon that swivels on the turret and the Tauntaun.  Let's face it-Tauntauns do not grow on trees in the Lego world and are exclusive to this set.  The fact that it also comes with two Snowtroopers, the Han Solo and two Rebels means 5 minifigs and said Tauntan for $40+ the other portions of the scene.  A pretty good value.  On it's own this scene can clearly shows a solid Hoth scene-but is by no means huge.<br /><br />As part of a larger Hoth scene, this becomes essential.  I have added it to the Limited Edition Echo Base 7879, Hoth Wampa Cave 8089, Hoth Rebel Base 7666 one additional Echo Base, two Motorized At-At's (10178), other dark gray and white misc pieces AND white dog toy stuffing for quite the display.  All of you may not have these sets but feel free to copy!  Looks amazing but takes up some space.<br /><br />If you are in to Lego scenes from the original trilogy, this is a must.
B00000G3PL|5.0|Received the product in time. The movies were as described. I would do business again and would recommend to my friends.
0756686970|5.0|I just got in to Lego's after working with them through my son and this book is visually stunning with one page dedicated to each figure along with a description of who that character is, what sets that figure appears in and what variations there are of that figure.  If you are a collector-you need to have this, but if you are even just a casual fan this is still very fun to look at.  Great to look at for kids even just for the pictures because it is so visually interesting.  Certainly a great bonus that it comes with a free mini fig.  For the price on Amazon and especially if you have Prime for free shipping-this becomes a no-brainer.  Great glossy and color pictures!
B0063IH60K|4.0|nice and  works great, but has too many advertisements. it has never crashed or froze on my kindle Fire tablet.
B003L77G8I|5.0|Wanted to get this because my wife and I like to watch Bones. Amazon had a great price and they always ship right away. We are enjoying watching the extras on the DVD.
B004W4N55C|2.0|the app looks terrible on the vzw galaxy 10.1 tablet. text runs over icons, on the main and supporting menus. you can use it, but not a great experience.
B00650SSWG|5.0|If you like Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis then you're going to love this movie.  Woody Harrelson is in it as well and adds to the comedic side of the film w/ his gay side jokes.  Great chemistry and the plot of course turns out to be...surprise!  A love story!  I'd highly recommend it!
1419702238|5.0|I love this product, it came very quickly in the mail, took only 3 days even though i ordered standered shipping ( the seller that i bought it from was in NJ while I was NY, so that helps), it brand new and much cheaper then retail, at only $6.00!  The book has the familiar 3D binding, the story in my opinion is the best by far!  very funny and witty and the cartoon drawings are great!  5 OUT OF 5  can't wait for the movies!  Samantha McDonnell, 13

B004OZOTSQ|5.0|While a USB connection between your phone and computer can get you to your files, this is an awesome FTP file server interface to your files. There are lot of options, ability to secure it reasonably well and niceties such as download as ZIP when retrieving multiple files. All it needs is a Wifi network to connect to. Configuration is real simple, just as you would go about connecting a laptop to your wifi network.
B0043URV5U|3.0|This CD is OK for a Seger sampler, but for someone as great and so much music, I think a box set is in order.
B000SW16LC|2.0|a bit of fluff for the holiday season, but nothing much compared to the original.  Edmund Gwenn WAS Santa Claus, and his charm, and the charm of the supporting actors in the original film far surpass this bit of Hollywood handiwork.  Certainly no harm in this film, but I'll not be watching it again.
B000HF6XKO|2.0|I want my hour and a half back.  This was the most boring movie I've seen in the last several years.  I don't know how they got Damon and Clooney, and all the other top level stars to contribute to it.  The money must have been real good.  It sucked!
0375851569|4.0|I ordered these books online not realizing that they had been reduced in size.  They are smaller than the standard Dr. Seuss books I grew up with, but they still work.  The pictures and text have been reduced in size but are still legible.
B003Y5H5HY|4.0|Having not read the novel, and only seeing the 2009 version from Sweden, David Fincher's The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo isn't all that different from the previous one. No surprises I mean (other than a different ending), but I did think the cast is better and the whole look of the film is much richer thanks to the director's vision. This is suspense mystery that feels more like a typical drama at times. Be ready to sit back and absorb a huge amount of dialogue with people just sitting around, especially in the first hour, but it does move rather fast after that point. It feels like the 2 hour and 40 minutes that it is, though it doesn't drag quite as much as the earlier version.<br /><br />Noomi Rapace was excellent as Lisbeth Salander, but I like Rooney Mara's performance a little bit more. She somehow manages to make her gothic appearance look odd and attractive at the same time. Her line delivery is fantastic and whenever she is on the screen you simply can't look away. She has already received a Golden Globe nomination, but I think maybe an Oscar could be in her future. Daniel Craig is at his best here as Mikael Blomkvist and a big improvement over the previous rendition of the character. I actually believed his connection with Lisbeth this time around.<br /><br />The brutal scenes that people who have read the book or have seen the 2009 movie know they are coming and are pushed even further here in terms of what is actually seen. If you don't know what is coming, prepare to brace yourself. The lady sitting behind me said \\"disgusting\\" more than once.<br /><br />Special mention for the opening credits. A new cover of the \\"Immigrant Song\\" plays over black oil colliding and making various shapes and characters in the story. I thought I was watching the next Daniel Craig Bond movie.<br /><br />I have had a trend over the last two years of seeing the most depressing movies right before Christmas. First Black Swan and now TGWTDT. It looks like next year will be The Hobbit, so maybe then I can redeem myself from becoming a total holiday Grinch.from becoming a total holiday Grinch.

B001AQMBHI|5.0|The Final Destination is a great movie, it is exciting, thrilling, and very intense and scary!  I highly recommend this movie, it was a great experience!

B004HO6I4W|5.0|This is one of the kids movie that I loved. We bought this for my 4 year old and 9 year old and is a big hit in our house. Awesome movie for any ages. Loved it. The birds are very cute and very colorful. The Rio song is wonderful as well. Would highly recommend it.
0439023521|5.0|I read this book after talking to a friend about the upcoming movie. I am now afraid to see the movie for fear of ruining the story. I ended up read this book as well as both sequels in 36 hours flat. Some of my new favorites.
B0068AWQQ2|3.0|Honestly I have to say that nothing beats the original, but this was a pretty good remake. I am not usually one for remakes nor am I one for sequals but kudos to the writer and director of this movie.
B004LWZW24|5.0|My teen daughter wished to view this movie. She absolutely loved it.  The story line is very very scary.  On the Poltergeist type theme... but done 100 times better.  This is a movie that one cant normally explain to others. They have to watch it themselves.  Watching a clip from youtube does not do this movie justice.   We watched it as a family a few nites ago.  Buy it used... you cant go wrong. One of the best endings ever.
0810983915|1.0|I bought this book, hoping that it would be better than the rest, but was sorely dissapointed. Greg is a whiny loser who has no social life, a clueless family, a dumb brother, a stupid friend and above all, no social life. Books should teach something and have a real plot. This book only taught me what to do if you want to be the biggest loser in middle school. Reading this book.   Greg wanders around his summer, whining about how he wants to be popular, and trying to hit on any girl. I can't even express how awful this book was in one review.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I'm addicted to this application I haven't stopped playing every since I got this game and I enjoy it. its an exciting game everyone should get it.
B00466HM28|4.0|This works great for laying beats and other tracks. I don't use the pads as much as I should because you can just as easily use the keys for drums. The pads light up to add a cool effect. If you have problems with latency (delay), check your music program. Mine was on a slow setting and I thought it was the MPK Mini. Not so.<br /><br />The arpeggiator is a cool feature that has been a welcome addition to my music. You can control this and other aspects through the provided software.<br /><br />Don't see why I would need any other MIDI controller. This is portable, quick, and easy to use.

B0055SWM08|4.0|works beautifully on the kindle fire. really well planned increases in difficulty levels. very fun to play. worth the purchase if you like puzzles.
B004EPYZQ2|4.0|if u loved lost then this will bring back a lot of memories especially the soundtrack and the way the story unfolds. jj abrams does a fantastic job with the movie and charcters. i cant wait for his next release. definitely recommend this movie to all jj fans. You wont be disappointed. maybe someday he will make a movie for lost.
B005TQAI6G|5.0|Eventhough the whole concert is Live lipsynched (that is the way it was designed, not because Epix chose to do it that way), it is a fun an entertaining experience, and it makes me dance everytime I watch it.  Some of the old songs have a very powerful arrangement, and it is a firework/powergas extravaganza. No surprise it was Rolling Stones Top 2011 concerts. So watch it with a 'I want to have fun and smaile' attitude, and enjoy.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I have the MyTouch 4g, and it runs great. Just like the iPhone version there is no Zen Garden and the achievements are lacking, but it's still a great way to waste time and have fun. :-)
B002JM1VJG|5.0|Watching Madonna progress through her music videos, and match this progression to my own life span is a awesome experience. You can see Madonna transform in front of you, from the 80's pop princess to an powerhouse 2000 entertainer.  There is no lows, only stages on her performer life, where she challenged music standards every step of the way. Her biggest turning points: \\"Vogue\\" and \\"Ray of Light\\" showed, eventhough time has passed, that radical change is good, and music needed something new to be brought to the table, because change was happening in the world. She will be the Queen of Pop Music long after. Dare to take this trip.
B001DF68MA|3.0|The seat was well-made and our 2yr old loved it but there were two main issues that made us return it.  One, my wife, who's 5'4\\" had trouble pedaling and keeping her balance with the seat; she even fell over once.  Two, the harness straps didn't seem very secure, which when combined with the balance issues and the fall, meant that she didn't want to use it for her bike.  May work great for others but not for us.

B005H0IW6W|5.0|Got delivered on time and Michael Buble really rocked out this Christmas Album! Michael Buble provides the old, yet hip sound to Christmas time and it's a great play along in the car.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|There isn't much to say that others haven't but I'll add my two cents anyway.  The quality of the \\"original\\" movies is pretty terrible.  My old VHS copies look better then what they put on these DVD's.  It's very grainy, the sound is iffy, it's so bad I had to stop watching it about 15 minutes in.    The \\"enhanced\\" version does look and sound a lot better in every way but it's unfortunate it was \\"changed\\".  If they would just clean up the original properly I'd happily pay another $25 for a copy but what I paid for these was just wasted money.
B005KN5AES|5.0|Immortal soul is the latest cd from riot, and musical genius band leader, and guitarist, mark reale. This cd is a reunion of band members from the cd thundersteel(1988),with reale, tony moore on vocals, don van stavern on bass, and of course bobby jarzombeck (the drummachine) on drums. Also long time band member guitarist, mike flyntz. Immortal soul is a must have for any fan of riot, hard rock, heavy metal music.I would definetly put it in the power metal genre and recommend this cd to fans of metallica, megadeath, judas priest, iron maiden, and early queensryche. This cd is fantastic, and gets better and better the more you listen to it. Make no mistake its no fire down under or thundersteel those are two of the greatest metal albums of all time. If you don't own them yet, you owe it to yourself to buy them now along with immortal soul. It is still early yet and remains to be seen if it turns out to be a metal classic like those two albums were. I must say though i can't eject immortal soul from my player, it just keeps getting better everytime I listen to it. This new cd is an effort that will take you back to the old school power metal sound of the 80s that we all love and miss. Immortal soul is as good or better than any metal music that is out there today. Tony hits all the notes like he's never missed a beat. Great rythym chops from mark and mike,and rediculous technical speed drumming of bobby j. I have been a huge fan of mark and riot since the fire down under days and have everything the band has ever put out. Mark started this riot in brooklyn n.y in 1976 and this band has stood the test of time. This new cd truly shows that. I just hope riot finally gets the credit it deserves as one of the greatest metal bands ever. Thanks mark for keeping this riot going on and on. Cant wait to see you on tour in rochester,ny in january. SHINE ON! Thanks,Geigs. Amsterdam,NY.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I have had the book on my wishlist because I did not think my husband would watch the movie. He suprised me with the DVD- we both LOVED it! This is a must see for everyone. It will make you sad, happy, laugh and cry. Well worth it and I really hope it wins awards this season because they will be well deserved.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|More than a fantastic work of fiction, this book left me with an unending sense of \\"what if\\" about most major events in history. The story surprised me in more ways than one. It wasn't the book I was expecting, and for that, I have to thank Stephen King!
0374275637|2.0|The whole subject of the System 1 & 2 could have been covered easily in 50 pages, but it was dragged out to 400 pages.  The author is intelligent, and this could be a great text book, but I rather have something that is more condensed and easier to follow.
1612130283|5.0|Read this book and fell in love with Fifty, I found myself not able to leave my book alone, I recommend to anyone to read, it has it all, love, excitment and gets you to lose your mind in some moments!!!
B004AP09CU|1.0|I've been waiting forever for a remastering of this album, but I'll continue waiting for a stand-alone CD version. A download isn't enough, and if the suits at Sony think I'll cough up $95 for a deluxe set -- in this economy -- they're nuts. It's especially galling to go through this for an album about working people.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Loved it. Blasted through it and couldn't get enough. I am a pseudo-runner and this was fascinating. Great book and a must read for anyone who doesn't hate running.
B00004TB5B|4.0|It goes without saying this is one of the best rap/any genre albums of all time. And I would have for sure of given this item 5/5 stars, but unlike most of the double LPs I own, the sleeve doesn't fold open. Although there is an insert with some album art that is different from the original CD version and each Record has a different picture in the center. Great buy all-in-all!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|What is fascinating is that Jobs is so polarizing that people who don't think they like him, think they can't enjoy a book about it. He lead an amazing life with unique perspectives, whether you like him or not. The book doesn't sugar coat anything and does a fair job of painting a true picture (or at least appears to). It is fair and both positive and negative on the life of a man credited with changing the way we use technology. Highly recommend.

B005Y423ZC|5.0|I saw her concert in new york city and i thought she is the best singer in the world right now. Unlike 'american idol' type singers who think screaming and yelling equal to good singing, she has good control and perfect vocal. She can soar high but never overdo it. This is why she has been in player the the past year and more. I wish that they keep the focus on her face and expressions as she sings, because that's all i care. A lot of young people complain that she is boring as hell because she just sits and sing. You know, i want to see her singing live and i don't care about everything else. Ella Fitzgerald is my all time favourite singer .. Adele is probably the second best.
0143038419|5.0|This is absolutely the best purchase I have made all year long! The book Eat, Pray, Love is fascinating, heart-wrenching (in a good way), and comforting all in one!
031261246X|5.0|Enjoyed the book from cover to cover. Could be read by someone who has not worked in the IT field, but is defiantly some quality nerd content. I'm looking forward to more titles from this author.
B0016MJ6T2|4.0|FIRST: Sorry this review is so terribly long, but bear with me if you can...  Years ago, when I was very young, I remembered seeing the \\"Club Kids\\" on all the talk shows my mom watched. Back then the hype was that the Club Kids would bring about the destruction of of down-home American traditions, morals, and values. Once I was in college, I was a frequent attendee of local raves and parties - which seemed to me to be the natural development and response to the manic energy and rebellion of the Club Kids in their heyday. I felt some kind of kinship to them.  I watched this movie again tonight and was very pleasantly surprised: for me at least, it remains an entertaining if (somewhat? then how much?) stylized window into Michael Alig's world, and the world of the Club Kids, as described by John St. John's book \\"Disco Bloodbath\\". [[ASIN:9999802664 Disco Bloodbath]]  I can't say that the story is terribly uplifting, as it basically follows Michael Alig's downward spiral into multiple drug overdoses, increasingly bizarre behavior, and the eventual murder of his roommate/drug dealer, but it is in my opinion a very clever, fast-paced and colorful look into that one unique place and time in popular culture. At the same time, it often manages quite a bit of humor and wit, despite the tragedies the characters inflict on themselves and those around them, the film is often quite funny, with witty dialogue and some very outlandish circumstances.  Macaulay Culkin's role as the emotionally damaged and increasingly drug-dependent Michael Alig continues to impress me - he has certain nuances of voice and expression that seem to completely capture the character of Michael Alig.   However, for me at least the really pleasant surprise is Seth Green as John St. John, the \\"Original Club Kid\\" and Alig's roommate. He is completely moving, walking, and talking as the character of John St. John. I think he's just brilliant in this role. Just for kicks, make sure you watch for Marylin Mansonas Christina Superstar, Wilmer Valderrama as Superstar DJ Keoki, among others.   This movie shown in limited release and generally received nehgative reviews...please don't let that stop you from at least trying to watch it. So many, many of our film cult classics got terrible reviews when released, but remain beloved for decades. So I'll take the bullet for this one. Give it a try...it won't hurt! ;-)  And if you made it this far...YAY! :-)
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|I'd had the show's regular DVD for a while, and recently got this blu-ray version. It's definitely worth the $$. The sound quality is impeccable!
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|will not purchase on our kindle file.we want to play it though. we would give five stars. if it would purchase ..
B000OPOAJS|4.0|I'm going to pass on giving a review of the movie, since if you want that then go to a website that specializes in that.  You probably wouldn't be conisdering purchasing it if you hadn't already seen it or heard good things about it anyway, right?  So I'll leave it at \\"I really like this movie.\\"<br /><br />That said, I'm reviewing the feature (Ronin) as offered on Blueray.  The movie and audio quality are great, no complaints.  I'm disappointed that there were no additional features added, however.  I'm relatively new to the Blueray world, and with all the extra disk space BD has, I thought there would be a directors commentary.  I don't fault anyone for this, it wasn't advertised that way and shame on me for making the assumption.  I normally wouldn't care about it either, except that after I got it, a friend recommended I watch the commentary and that's when I realized there wasn't one.<br /><br />So, in summary:  great movie, decent black Friday value.  4 stars.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|Whats not to love about this movie, plus got a great deal around Thanksgiving on it.  This movie is a great!
B0063IH60K|3.0|Love this game, I spend many hours playing in my down time. I would recommend this to anyone who has time to kill. It does make the time go by fast.
0374275637|3.0|A very technical approach to the mechanics of how the conscious mind works when it comes to decision making both in one's personal and business life. The book is written with much technical jargon and uses sophisticated statistical methods of analysis. It does however point out some very important points when it comes to how people make decisions and their shortcomings, by showing how people look for the easiest route and do not weigh the facts in a probabilistic logical manner all the time. In other words we tend to rely on our gut feelings more than we should which leads to flaws in our decision making process. If you don't mind the highly technical way this book is written and are interested in the human vulnerability of decision making, this book may be for you.
B004LWZW42|2.0|-------------------------------------  \\"X-Men: First Class\\"  -------------------------------------  Watching it last night, I thought this X-Men prequel was pretty bad, and that it was a jumbled, semi-incoherent, slow-moving, for-fans-only geekfest. Keep in mind that I am a Marvel geek myself, and have read my fair share of X-books over the years, but I still felt this movie was a muddle, and suffered (greatly!!) from the same affliction as most modern superhero movies: too much exposition and too many major plot points crammed into one, single feature film.   Case in point: the \\"Beast\\" character, introduced here in his original, basically-human guise, proclaiming before the official formation of the X-Men team that a cure for mutanthood needs to be developed, later dosing himself with a prototype vaccine and turning himself into a giant, blue-furred teddybear. Most of this happened in the comics, but over a span of roughly ten years - much later, a mutant vaccine *was* developed and it caused the decimation of the Marvel mutant population. But why put all that into one film, much less a back-to-the-days-of-yore prequel which focusses on the Cuban Missile Crisis as a proving ground for mutants as superheroes? Isn't nuclear annihilation enough? It seems to me that comicbook companies are sitting on a trove of potential scripts, and that they could be more judicious in how they dole them out. Perhaps it would be better *not* to cram all the major concepts of an entire superhero mythology in all at once, but rather set a simple goal -- fight one fight at a time -- and make the scripts more entertaining and less unwieldy and top-heavy.  Also, for this particular film, I disliked the mix'n'match approach to the characters they presented, plucking out mutant superdupers from several different phases (and decades) of the X-Men saga and putting them all into a big script-writing Cuisinart, and in many cases (Beast, Angel, Sebastian Shaw, et al) changing the characters themselves so as to make them nearly unrecognizable from their print-media personae. Why? Whywhywhywhywhy?? The Hollywoodization of comicbook fiction continues to be abysmal, which is good in that it encourages old-school comicbook fans like myself to get a life and not take this stuff so seriously, but bad in that it means they are making such lousy films. Oh, well. On a more balanced note, my wife (who is not a big comicbook geek) thought the movie was fine. Hence the two stars, and not one. (Axton)
B00689ILQC|4.0|I gave it 4 stars b/c the songs that i like are really really good! I think you should purchase the album b/c I am sure you'd like half of the songs. I hope that Riri comes harder the next time though!
B001P9EQH8|5.0|Purchased this device to boost the output of my THRIVE tablet which has a great display for watching movies but falls way short on the audio side.  Even with headphones it's difficult to enjoy movies or music for that matter, in most environments.  My hearing isn't that great either (I'm 65).  For the price (around $20), I thought it was worth a try and I'm not out all that much dough if it's junk  Well... it's not junk and I'm amazed!  Smaller than a book of matches (yeah, that's right), it's got plenty of power to boost that weak output to high volume listening levels using inexpensive sport headphones like Philips neckband headphones.  Controls are necessarily small but everything you need is there: on/off switch, volume control, it's even got a switch for bass boost that really works! Lithium ion rechargeable battery which you charge using a supplied cable connected to a usb port on your computer, or a charging adapter. Has standard 3.5mm input and output jacks (of course)and in addition to the charging cable, comes with 2 audio cables: 1 approx 4\\" long and the other about 30\\" long.  Also has a built in clip so that you can attach it to your shirt or waistband or where ever.  Treadmill is pretty dang boring stuff so I usually listen to music on my ipod to keep from going totally bonkers.  Well, the other day I decided to try watching a movie on my tablet while doing my treadmill work. I set up the tablet in the book tray on the treadmill, plugged into AC and then hooked up this tiny headphone amp.  4\\" audio cable between the tablet output jack & the FiiO input jack.  Plugged my headphones into the FiiO output jack, connected the charging cable from the FiiO amp to a usb port on the tablet figuring that the battery being pretty small would need the help.  Oh yeah, that's another nice thing about this device - you can charge it while it's in use.  So anyway, I'm all wired up now.  I get on the treadmill, start my movie, crank up the volume on the FiiO headphone amp and start my workout.  It worked great!  Plenty of volume for comfortable listening WITH NO NOTICEABLE HUM, even over the treadmill noise and my own huffing and puffing.    Knowing what I know now, would I buy another one?  You bet!  This is a great little headphone amp at a really nice price.  I expect to be using it a lot.
B005UPOAT2|5.0|I've been waiting for this on blu ray for forever!  One of my favorite movies.  I love this movie...I love New York City.  A must to my movie collection.  One word to describe this movie... Magical like NYC.  The music is wonderful too.
B00632HWOG|5.0|works great! I feel it views better than the pull in your yahoo email to kindle. its just like looking at yahoo mail but, better<br />!
B00275EGWY|1.0|The only thing hurting after watching this is my brain!!! Can I please get my 2 hours back?   If anyone who has watched this movie has spent anytime in or around the military (as I have), they know that this is way over-the-top...even for Hollywood. The movie didn't make me feel for the characters, and the ending was so predictable.  The pacing is off...ex: when the young soldier sees the enemy at their rear when they are pinned down...he took too long to shoot they guy...get real!! ex: WHENEVER the new guy is disarming a bomb he takes too long!!   Whoever made this movie needs to go back to film school. I hate being this critical, but this movie really does HURT!!!
B003B2H3MC|5.0|I want to give a preemptive hint about this disc - you may have to adjust the video settings of your bluray player to get a decent picture. When I first put the disc in my Sony player, I was utterly dismayed as the picture looked as if it had been filmed under a severe overcast. It was drab and dull, dull, dull. It looked worse than my standard dvd version until I went into the options menu of the player and changed the video settings from theater room to standard or brighter room. Brighter room made the picture a little better than standard but either is a huge improvement over Theater. This may only apply to Sony players as to the cure but if the picture is bad at first, try adjusting the video settings of your player.
0156030306|5.0|Beautiful book. Just wonderful. Even people who do not consider themselves fans of science fiction, will love this book, but be prepared for tears.
B002IKLZZY|5.0|I would recommend this anniversary video from Amazon. It is a true Hitchcock classic.I had not seen the movie for many years and found that the story still intriguing. The DVD was in great condition. The dialogue is great, and Hitchcock uses humor to break up the seriousness of the film, while building up suspense.  Highly recommend this.
B005IZLPKQ|2.0|Let me start by saying that I'm a huge fan of Chris Evans and Hugo Weaving. That said, this is a horrible movie. It was slow and predictable as well as cranking out a story that should have been filled out as much as Chris' chest was, unfortunately such was not the case and even Chris' fine physical attributes couldn't make this movie enjoyable. The last 10 minutes were by far the best part. I really wish I could have given this a better review, and if they do have a sequel here's hoping it turns out much better than this one!
B005K2Z2O2|3.0|Item did not fit my kindle, it was too small, however that was my mistake in ordering the wrong one.  I needed one that 8\\"  .
B0063IH60K|5.0|easy to play. no freezing. relaxing and enjoyable. minimal advertising. if you like solitaire you will enjoy this version. thanks.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|It really is simply amazing. I am always thinking about how to.improve my ideas and figure out the problems with them to turn them into.potential businesses and so I need access to the shebang of the idea whatever I'm doing and it simply does it, and does it fantastically
0062101897|5.0|The book when it arrived was great. I got it for my husband and he loves it. It was in great condition, and they shipped it fast. Now here comes my only issue with this purchase. The same day it arrived I saw the exact same book ( yes, first printing, first edition) at Barnes and Nobles for $75 plus an additional 30% off deal. I wanted to scream. I paid over 100 for it plus expedite shipping, because it said it was first printing. Well, be advised, since it was just published in Nov of this year, all of them out there are first printing. Save some money and get it at the book store or Amazon has it for about $50 now. I won't return the one I got since it was a Christmas present for my hubby, but the \\"buyer beware\\" axiom surely applies to me : (
B0066W1AZK|5.0|its a good interface to play. I liked the way it looks. it can be played between two people in addition to playing with system
B003Y5H574|5.0|We loved this movie.  Pretty muched laughed from begining to end.  And for once a movie actually suprised me which doesn't happen very often.  The bonus is you get to look at Ryan Gosling for an hour and half.
B005V20JKI|3.0|it's a good game, but you can't use it's online features because it's NEVER UPDATED. it needs the update to play with other devices.
B006O5XYWG|5.0|I live-streamed this with a fairly fast dsl and didn't have any of the problems others have complained about. I'm not going to try to analyze the movie or second guess the producers, I'm just going to say this was an awesome movie and I'd recommend it to anybody, even my mother. It was an entertaining movie, and that's why I watch a movie... to be entertained. Be sure to watch it all the way through the credits, or you will miss a significant loose end being tied up. This almost makes me want to go back and watch the \\"cheesy\\" older flicks, since this one is the prequel to them!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I purchased the original Quell just because I had never seen so many 5 star ratings on a game.  Yes, I immediately fell completely in love with the game.  Don't be fooled by those who say it's relaxing, and not frustrating.  IT'S BOTH.
B0017ZM3S4|5.0|Kang Chol-Hwan's memoir is so detailed and honest it is often startling and heartbreaking. As I read the carefully translated work, I could not even begin to imagine what any of his experiences must have truly felt like. Kang writes with such force that when writes of events that would change his entire outlook on life, you also feel as though you are being shocked into some uncertain reality. Kang's detailed account of his drive and determination to live and to escape the walls of the dangerous aquarium that is North Korea is both terrifying and beautifully written. Yair Reiner's translation is careful and well done, you won't feel as though you are missing anything from this translation. It is so difficult for me to identify anything that I did not like about this memoir. In my mind it is a must read and future classic.
B005CIYJ2A|4.0|This box set has been reviewed under the same title except for the word \\"import\\" in the title of the reviewed set.  The price has changed between a bit over $50 to $100.  It seems that both these editions sell for a similar price.  The label on the import is Columbia Europe.  This set is from Sony.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|While I highly recommend this - leaving out the Ultraviolet nonsense - I had hoped that Steve Kloves view of Harry and Ginny's relationship would carry through this installment. That this was missing in the books was also a disappointment, but, hey, it's JK Rowling's story, not mine.<br /><br />But that is my only misgiving; you should enjoy!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Does everything I was looking for in a weather app for kindle fire, including radar.  I like to see what's coming my way. Accurate for Pittsburgh region.
B000683VI4|1.0|This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen and, except for Hollywood's built-in nepotism, would have not been made.  My primary distaste for the movie and what distracted me from the \\"story\\" relates to the props and the over emphasis on \\"perfection.\\"  All of the signs for Coke, etc., were in perfect, unblemished condition.  The shoes worn by the girl star were totally today's.  The mother's French manicure made me want to set my hair on fire....  Help!!!  Guess it's really no worse than the Thin Man series and other movies from the 30's and 40's where most of the characters are rich and overdressed and were intended to encourage the masses to go out and attain their own impossible dreams but not to my taste at all. At least the earlier ones could be entertaining.
B0063IH60K|4.0|App works really well on Kindle Fire.  It is a great way to kill time and it has some cool options.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Love the app - force close often on Cruz so save often. Perhaps this will be fixed soon. Works grest on all other platforms for me. I saved a holiday recipe from the web last week on my desktop and opened it quickly to make it this morning! just one of many awesome uses! can save web pages, snippets, pics, and voice files!
B0058VW36U|5.0|wont install on my fire but ive played it on the ipod touch but it still a great game awsome
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Easy way to stream movies from my desktop.  Worth all 99 pennies. Happy not to have to convert stuff to mp4.
B004EPYZQ2|4.0|The music, cars, homes, hair styles and clothes etc bring back the memories of 1970's as this is the year setting for Super 8 (the \\"8\\" standing for 8mm). This would be good movie for the entire family to watch on a Friday or Saturday night.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|My 5-year-old daughter and I have each taken turns playing with this app on my Kindle Fire. It's exactly what I was looking for in a drawing application for a tablet.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|amazing game. well crafted and ingenious. do not let the minimalist view and feel fool you, and yes I see how a child would be amused. however one must have off the scales problem solving capacity to just breeze through with perfect scores. the great thinkers past and present would not put this down easily. the music is key in killing frustration, the soundtrack is beautiful and somewhat haunting. from a person who plays all genres of games across multiple platforms this one is in the top 5 of all games made sin e the Commodore 64 was state of the art.
B0064W652A|3.0|I decided to try reading one of the DC collections that were made available specifically for the Kindle Fire and chose HUSH because I had never read it before and had heard good things. The story and art are enjoyable. The experience of reading it on the Kindle Fire is not. It limits my options on how to read the story. I am not able to rotate it into landscape mode and the only zoom capabilities are the pre-defined ones that walk you through the story panel by panel. The predefined zoom is still not enough to sometimes read the captions.<br /><br />If Amazon chooses to update the Kindle Fire software to allow me to control my own zoom and to rotate the display, then I will score this higher.
B004K4IZ3G|2.0|I thought the 1st movie was boring and this update was not worth the time to watch. It was way to fast paced and plots were hard to follow. The acting was just as bad & they mumbled a lot and I found my self needing to do a replay just to understand what they are saying.  If you are a collector buy it if not then just rent it  This movie get  2 stars and no more. Sorry I really was hoping it have some better plots and would be more understandable.
1601251505|5.0|Paizo Publishing keeps updating the Pathfinder core rule book. I got the 4th Printing. There are updates to the 5th printing on paizo.com. Make sure to get the 5th edition. Other than that it's awesome. Pathfinder fixes stuff you didn't even know was wrong with D&D 3.5. Get it and play it. You will love it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I just finished the book and I loved it! I was 12 when Kennedy was killed and wondered how Mr. King could write a book about changing something so major in our shared history.   When it began talking about the \\"Jimla\\" I had a few misgivings that there was going to be a scary creature lurking just around the corner (its a King book, after all) but I was pleasantly surprised to find that all the characters remained painfully human. I guess humans are the Jimla, we have all wanted something to be when it simply cannot be.   The further I read the more I kept thinking that this book could only have an disappointing end. Save the world or save the librarian? How can he create an ending that I could accept. Then I read ... the Perfect Ending! In the Afterword, Mr. King gives credit for the ending to his son Joe Hill. I love it that he could go with a suggestion from someone else even if it may not have been his first thought.   My favorite King short story is \\"The Last Rung on the Ladder\\". I finished that story, and this book, with tears in my eyes.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Not too much to say, other than this movie is truly amazing. Like all Miyazaki movies, it has a great message but also entertains with great action scenes and incredible artistry. A true gem.
B003SI9WYG|5.0|For me Tim Burton had been an on & off success - he did an awful job with Planet of the Apes but really soared with Ed Wood.  So renting this movie was with some trepidation.<br /><br />But it's not so!  Henry Selick directed and Burton produced a great stop animation feature, something you don't see much of today, nor in 1993 when it was produced.  With a technical team that took three years to make, the film is really the sum of its parts.  Great film!<br /><br />The story is a simple one with a simple theme.  Jack, the Pumpkin King in Halloween-town has just pulled off another great Halloween complete with vampires that look like Nosferatu and a few horror icons from old films and weird wickedness!  But Jack is bored of the whole thing and wanders around and bumps into doors that lead to holidays - a big heart door for Valentines', an egg-shaped door for Easter.  What's this?  Christmas-town?<br /><br />After much analysis of what makes Christmas, Jack decides to make Christmas in his own Halloween-obsessed image to hilarious results.  A ragdoll girl, recently created, has a crush on Jack and tries to stop him before her premonition comes true and both holidays are lost.<br /><br />favorite scenes:  I like all the wild and crazy characters but especially the Boogey man who rolls those bones (literally) and takes Santa captive.  Another is the mayor of Halloween-town who has a spinning head - one with smiles and one with a fearful frown.  Could this be a metaphor for those who change faces when things don't go well?  Nah!<br /><br />Memorable themes by Danny Elfman!  And a great \\"making of\\" feature where we meet the director, producers and tech personnel and all the hard work they put into this film.  Quite impressive.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  I had heard a criticism on this film that children would confuse Christmas with Halloween, which is nonsense.  The film is light-hearted, makes fun of itself and has great themes of trying something new and if it doesn't work out, at least you tried!  Good work Tim.<br /><br />Other Animated Burton Products:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B003UAKE9Y Coraline]]<br />[[ASIN:B000C3L27U Tim Burton's Corpse Bride (Widescreen Edition)]]r Animated Burton Products:  [[ASIN:B003UAKE9Y Coraline]]  [[ASIN:B000C3L27U Tim Burton's Corpse Bride (Widescreen Edition)]]

B004T32SOK|1.0|echoing everyone else, why wont amazon give us dropbox? we all use it; letting us have the app would allow me to use my fire more, not less.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is not your typical girl meets boy and falls in love kind of story. This is gripping from the beginning and terrifying as well.  You feel for these characters and the downwards life spiral they have become to know as normal.  There are some structure issues within the book with pacing, overall it's very engaging and I would highly recommend it.  I do stress that this is not for the young at heart, or those who can't handle violence in their books.  It's very brutal (but with a point) and not a typical YA novel I've read in a very long time.  So I can understand why some people struggle with the content of the story.  It's not easy.
B003OK2HE0|5.0|I liked what the object developed into, how it didn't just go into the past, it showed you the consequences too in a way. I liked the way it ended, because *Spoiler* even though I knew what was going to happen part of me still believed they might change it.

B006OOHYIC|5.0|\\"Quell\\" and \\"Quell Reflect\\" were two of the first game apps that I installed on my original Kindle Fire. They're uniquely different kinds of games that don't involve dodging swarms of enemies and trying to destroy them. Instead, the goal is to guide a raindrop around a maze-like playing field while collecting pearls and avoiding hazards that can shatter your raindrop. Levels get steadily more difficult, but each new feature is described, so the games are in effect a long, continuing tutorial. There's no time limit, but you do get credit for winning each level in the fewest possible moves. The music soundtracks are very pleasant and calming, although after a while, I usually turn the sound off.<br /><br />\\"Quell\\" and \\"Quell Reflect\\" are remarkable games, and I haven't seen anything else with such a concept in the app store. When I get tired of fast-paced shoot-em-ups, \\"Quell\\" and \\"Quell Reflect\\" are what I turn to for some relaxing, but very challenging logic puzzles.
B0015DROBO|2.0|I'm sorry. I don't get it.  I read this novel with, I think, great patience.  I waded through the meandering (and ultimately tangential) setup secure in the knowledge that the book's runaway-bestseller status guaranteed a supremely worthwhile payoff.  When I finally reached the end, I was dumbfounded.  That's it? Fortunately, there were still one or two more endings to come, as the author apparently decided that the tortures inflicted upon the characters in the novel should also be suffered by the reader. When I reached the final last page, I reread the title to make sure I hadn't picked up a knockoff by mistake.  Nope. Should you elect to read this work, I hope you'll enjoy it. At the very least, I can assure you that you'll get many words for your money.
B001IXZ4UY|5.0|I bought this mini lp cd and 4 other Iron Maiden mini lp's for $20 each the first time I ever saw them. I wondered how come Iron Maiden was the only band making these cool mini record album replicas. I did see one by Exodus at that time but didnt get it cause I already had the same recording, just in a jewel box. I had to rebuy all my Iron Maiden Mni LP's except one. I just found out when I first started going on E Bay that there are3 all kinds of mini lp cd's. This one(Piece OF MIND0that you are looking at is going for $196.66 brand new sealed on e bay. And Powerslave is goign for the same price brand new sealed. I guess I should have left my Powerslave sealed huh? Trust me, you have to buy these. they are so cool.Nice since i lost my entire LP collection..now I can get some of them back and although its a cd its kinda like a record too.

I can also access and manage anything on my PC remotely which in a pinch is nice. Also lets me stream all my multimedia content to my Fire without conversion or loading it on there. For the sale price today Perfect. I would also have paid Full price also.
0553801473|2.0|Others have given well written, lengthy, reviews with which I agree so I shall keep mine brief.<br /><br />Finished reading \\"A Dance with Dragons\\" and I'm very disappointed with both it and the preceding volume, \\"A Feast for Crows\\". George R.R. Martin is getting too wordy, too predictable, and the plot lines are buried behind too many characters. Character death lacks any real significance since GRRM started magically resurrecting dead characters. There's a significant increase in misogyny and sadism, as well. Too much time is spent on minor characters and minor houses and too many words are devoted to the minutia of feasts, age, weather, or smells.<br /><br />Never have I read so many pages for main characters to accomplish so little. By the end of \\"A Dance with Dragons\\" most of the characters are in the exact same places they were by the end of book 3, with little real development of the plot and little development of the characters. In many cases, characters have regressed from their developments in books 2 and 3 (Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen being the two most prominent regressions).<br /><br />Martin is in dire need of editors rather than his current one who can't seem to tell him \\"no\\". There was no reason \\"A Feast for Crows\\" and \\"A Dance with Dragons\\" couldn't have been one book. With proper editing, more than half of each book could have been stripped away with little to no artistic impact. Words are wind and Martin conjures tornadoes that prove to be the utter ruination of the series.<br /><br />I can't say I care about the next book, which is fine, since it will likely be 5 years before we see it.
B006ANJ4BW|1.0|I personally didn't like it, it was a pain to watch but the LordOfTheRings-esque backdrop eye-candy scenery and buildings made it bearable.<br /><br />Here's why I thought it didn't work:<br />1. Classic case of bad guys talking too much<br />2. Too many holes in the plot<br />3. What's the point of having sorcery powers if you don't use it<br />4. Jason Momoa isn't really the best actor, his voice still breaks like a teenager going through puberty<br />5. Like a bad cheesy horror movie, characters does decisions that lacks common sense<br />6. Main bad guy sets himself up to fail, really lousy cliche ending<br />7. If you expected at least some good fighting scenes, the blade and blood effects look cheap<br />8. Morgan Freeman doing a background voice? Is there some morals to be learned from a violent action movie?
B0015DYIH2|1.0|Save yourself and do not pick up this book or any of the preceding ones. This is a sappy romance filled with anti-feminism and a story that undermines all the blood and gore that we love to read about with true vampires.
B0063IH60K|1.0|It is too bad that the tactics used to get attention for the ads are so sneaky because the game is actually good. What is not so good is when a commercial starts playing mid-game.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I love the Muppets and was initially deterred from this by the vast reviews of earlier versions that seem to have been edited to the point that the content was compromised.  I ordered the 50th Anniversary edition and it seems to be \\"intact\\", including the song everyone seemed to be missing \\"When Love is Gone\\".  So, I\\"m thrilled to have discovered this film after the controvery surrounding the transfer from film to DVD.  I love this film and plan to watch it with my kids every Christmas.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game try it. is so fun and easy to beat wy first. I thought it was hard but its not.
B004WKOCP8|2.0|What is up with this soft side of Incubus ? After listening to this, i'm thinking is Incubus on decline or i hope it's just for now,or am i listening to the wrong cd ?when this first cameout, i was looking forward to this album. but when i listened to some of it on youtube, i couldnt find any music that i liked. are these guys trying to be the new version of coldplay!! i hope their not going to go in this path on their next album. PLEASE WE WANT THE HARDCORE INCUBUS !!!!
B004XUMPFQ|5.0|I'm sad that I discovered Firefly too late. I was really getting into it and realized that it was cancelled forever. All of the actor have gone on to other successful projects, so it's unlikely that we could ever get this great ensemble together again. Maybe another movie? I'm just glad that Joss Whedon and the rest of the team were vindicated by the cult following that has developed behind this series and the film. Although I'm late to the party, I am glad to be a new fan.
B0063GORYU|5.0|very fun game. good for relaxing. I really enjoy the levels and all the options. my favorite level is withheld two decks
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is very addictive. It has great graphics and is very smooth! I definitely would recommend this game to anyone!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think this game is a wonderful varety of mini games for boys and girls of all ages. I approve of this game for my kid
B005I6EU7U|5.0|This cover is awesome!  It fits my Kindle Fire like a glove, and it looks most elegant on the coffee table.  The insides of the elastic straps are lined with rubbery stuff that holds the Fire inside firmly.  As the product description states, this is a cover, not a sleeve.  If you plan to take your Fire in and out, purchase a sleeve.  This cover is for longevity.  Some of the other reviews complain that it was hard to get on, that was not a problem for me.  Some reviews complain that the cover did not lay flat - not a problem for me - the spine has plenty of room, so if you push it against your hand, perpendicular to the front and back covers, it lays perfectly flat.  However, after using the Fire, depending on length of use, the cover is slightly raised when I set it down.  I suspect this will go away over time, but what is the big issue with that anyway?  Several covers come with a tacky elastic piece or magnetic part to keep them closed - probably because those raise up, too.  If that is an issue for you, choose a cover with one of those closure things.    This antique book cover is awesome!  The fake leather feels super soft, and the \\"antiquing\\" is just cool given that inside is a sweet piece of technology.  I love this cover and highly recommend it to others looking for a long term cover that looks nice in your hand and sitting on a table!
6305127697|5.0|I love this movie. Purchased as a gift and I received it quicker than the receiving date said I would. Very happy with it.
B0061S073A|5.0|if you have a kindle fire YOU HAVE TO GET IT!!!!!! Like another reviewer stated, it adds spool much value to it!!
1885283148|5.0|I bought this for my husband who was recovering from an operation.  He is interested in flying and all that goes with it.  This is the third book of this kind that he has read and he is laughing all the time.  This was by far his favorite of the three astronaut books that he read.  I would recommend this to anyone interested in the program.
B002ZG999U|5.0|It's a great action movie with lots of stars in it. I would recomend this movie to any man,it is a man's movie or anyone who like action movies.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have only had this a short time but I am really enjoying it.  Easy to use and works everytime.  No issues with it at all.
B002JODUI4|4.0|To be completely honest, I was hoping for a little more from this album.  I started out just hearing hits from Deadmau5 like Faxing Berlin & Arguru, and I was hooked on them.  So I recently decided to pick up his most recent album 4x4=12.  I wasn't too impressed with that album but people were saying that that album doesn't compare to his first two...So I picked this album up.  While it IS better than his latest, it's still not what I was hoping for.    It's a much more laid back album that his latest and there are a couple songs I really like, \\"Strobe\\" and \\"FML\\" namely.  Other than that the beats seem a bit bland.  They're not bad, just not great.  I'll go back and give Random Album Title a listen and see what I think of that.   Overall, definitely a good album, but not the best.  Recommended none the less!  Enjoy!
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Bought it as a gift for myself and couldn't be happier! Awesome family movie. Great price and arrived quicker than expected
B006BQM762|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when we rented this movie.  The movie reminds me of a cross between \\"ET\\" and \\"Stand by Me\\"...it has one of the best train wreck scene.  My two teenage daughters were glued to the screen if that tells you anything.  It's a good movie that the entire family can enjoy!
B005KJZDXK|4.0|I have never listened to a \\"She & Him\\" song or album but saw this and thought I'd try it.  I think Zooey's voice is really unique.  I am not at all disappointed and have played it several times a day and am not tired of it.  There is definitely an \\"amateur\\" sound to it, especially the instruments, but it comes across simple and uncomplicated and easy to listen to.  I would definitely recommend it.
9889979942|5.0|I worked a minimum wage job, just taught grandma how to use her oven she's had for 8 years, and survived Iowa.  I was looking for a break, and I stumbled upon Tom's book.  At first I wondered what was lurking inside this dictionary with a unique cover?  A story?  Or one of those boxes of candy that are made to look like a catchy book?  Either way, strolling through Barnes and Noble I found myself always returning to stare at the book.  I decided I might as well get a taste of whatever was inside.  Opening the cover, the contents can direct the reader to the different provinces in China (most I've never heard of).  Each province (section) contains a written review by a local from that province or Tom himself; and each short review is followed by at least 20 pages of clear photos that try to give the reader a glimpse of China.  I found myself amazed of all the different ethnic minorities that make up what we call \\"China\\".  Tom took stunning photos of both city and farm life.  As a cancer survivor I felt there had to be more to life than Iowa.  I finished Tom's photobook, went to the door, and like the fictional Frodo Baggins I bid my goodbye to the US.  My Mordor experience was over, so it was time for an adventure to the beautiful shores of China.
B005SV9X22|5.0|I bought the DVD because I saw the special in HBO. Is a good production and she is a great singer and entertainer but if you wanna see the concert in all of his glory I recommend it to buy it in Blu Ray format. The concert was shot in High Definition. I bought it here when Amazon supposedly offer it in Blu Ray format but it arrived in DVD. So I had to bought it in some other place. Buy it in Blu Ray is so worth it.
145551389X|5.0|Great candid photos of Gaga. You get to see her like you have never seen her before. Great book for Little Monsters like me. I loved it!
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I can't give it a 5 star review. I should but I can't.  My first impression of the book was that it is the kind of book that pretentious people would love. That isn't a negative against the actual book but just something that will end up happening. It will happen because this book is important, and will be in years to come.  The writing is pretty, very pretty. However it isn't the kind of book you can go into when you're looking to relax on a lazy afternoon (unless you swing that way). What I mean to say is that it isn't written like a conversation, similar to contemporary writing styles, rather it does the classic \\"this is an important award winning book\\" style, kind of writing.  The characters aren't terribly complex emotionally like \\"real life\\" characters. Instead they have a stock character feel with complex baggage being slowly put on them, making them into rounder characters. Again, this is not necessarily a negative.     The situations and the overall story was unexpected in good ways. Still it sits heavy within me, like something that isn't quite perfect. It isn't as complex as Weaveworld (Clive Barker) or as simple as a bedtime story, but straddles in between the two. It does a great job my mind says, but my heart isn't sure.  In all honesty there aren't any actual negatives to this book. It's just that... I dont know... my head says this is a 5 star book, but my heart gives it a 3. In the end, I settled for a 4, out of respect.
1451648537|5.0|Go with the flow here.  Look at the reviews.  Very, very good job by an excellent writer, Walter Isaacson.  STEVE JOBS is a great read, sure, very big book but you will learn so much about Jobs, Apple and business.  I found myself marking passages and reading outloud to my daughter and wife.  Full of great tales.  Get this one. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B004GJDQT8|1.0|Amazon has been getting more of my business lately, but I will not use this app. Lack of sort, lack of filters, unclear locations, poor image handling make this a very poor option compared to using a full browser to access Amazon.com directly on my tablet. Overall poor quality, with almost zero usable functionality.
B006FLGBGA|1.0|It's a pretty lousy movie, serving only to offer the same \\"lesson\\" as so many others -- it's the capitalist's fault. If the problem is political in nature, it's the capitalist's fault. If economic, also, the capitalist's fault. If the problem is scientific, it's also, still, the capitalist's fault. It's ALWAYS the capitalist's fault.  As applied to fiction, the \\"willing suspension of disbelief\\" used to range far and wide over vast subjects ... but now, there's only one thing you need to set aside - the fact that most of the world's horrors were visited upon humanity by well-intentioned do-gooders, social utopians, or a combination thereof. Instead, you must always remember - it's ALWAYS the capitalist's fault.
B000YRY8BG|4.0|Even thought this series was produced in 2003, the depiction of the British press and the manipulative tactics they undertake to get their story is very timely and makes me think of the current phone hacking scandal in the UK. The way the story unravels through the persistant digging by the reporters is very exciting. The focus of guilt keeps shifting and keeps you on the edge of your seat. This works better as a movie that you watch all at once, rather than the episodic treatment currently seen on BBC America. I recommend the DVD.
B005LY4B0A|4.0|Fun game, starts out easy to get the feel of it then gets progressively harder.  Would be nice if it had an undo button cause u can accidently hit a wrong piece of web. Also, would like it to give you a new hint every 2 hours or so instead of 12. Overall, much better than the average game out there.

B006OOHYIC|5.0|Great game.  Has the right amount of challeneg while also being relaxing.  Great gameplay and excellent soundtrack. I definitely reccomend this game.
B0000YEEHG|5.0|For my money, Pauline Kael was right that this film contains the sexiest single scene ever put on celluloid--you'll never forget it.    It also has the most interesting non-sexual relationship.  To me, Persona is Bergman's best.  Can't be distilled, described, or explained.  It's also sometimes boring and annoying as hell, which is part of the point.  Unlike his other celebrated films, this one doesn't try to seduce or impress you by being aggressively \\"deep\\" and Scandinavian.  There's genuine tedium, hatred and contempt here--and friendship and honesty--not self-conscious angst and pretentious symbolism.  Loved this film when I first saw it in college and still do, even though I can't watch most of Bergman's other \\"greats\\" anymore (Cries and Whispers, Fanny and Alexander, Seventh Seal, etc.), they're so serious and self-important (though I do still enjoy \\"Wild Strawberries\\").  Persona's different; somehow it gives you space, you seem to develop your own relationships with the characters, you become part of it but without losing yourself in it or feeling manipulated.  Can't recommend it enough.

B0063GORYU|4.0|I enjoy it more than the one I paid for. I wish it had more background and card design options.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|so I got this book recently, having heard a lot about it on tv and on the internet. early on it definitely seems like a sci fi thing, but man it REALLY rambles on and on. its more like a huge collection of short, mostly boring stories. a super mutant named Jesus shows up halfway through and it gets even more boring - I stopped there.  I do not recommend this book.  EDIT:  Okay apparently, I'm reading more about this book.  Apparently there is some kind of cult that worships this book!!! Creepyyyy!  Especially because it says stuff in here about killing gay people and atheists and stoning insubordinate children!  Psycho.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|This is an amazing movie. The Harry Potter series get better as they go. It bothered me when the owl and the little elf died.
020161622X|5.0|A massively enlightening book for anyone doing any programming at any stage of their career. Many of the principles contained in it's text transcend boundaries of programming languages, platforms, and development processes. This book has positively raised my awareness of the concepts of good programming.  Hunt and Thomas express their wisdom in beautifully contained chapters; some are illustrated with an analogy, and many are labelled with an indelible mantra. The DRY (Dont Repeat Yourself) Principle, Orthogonal Code, Tracer Bullets, Soldiers and the Stone Soup - and I first read this book about 4 years ago!  Refer back to this book once in a while and I guarantee a different set of chapters will resonate with something you have been bitten by since your last read. I cannot recommend this book highly enough!
B0067D7Y3U|4.0|I respectfully disagree with those who feel that Daughtry's latest release is not as good as his first two. I have been a fan since my wife and I began texting votes for him on American Idol. Daughtry (the man) has an amazing voice and is a gifted entertainer, and those qualities have been transferred to Daughtry (the band) perfectly. Chris Daughtry always gives you the feeling that he LOVES what he does for a living, and that happiness comes through in his music. What's cool about \\"Break The Spell\\" is that the rock songs are SO catchy (try not singing along with songs like \\"Outta My Head\\" and \\"Renegade\\"), and yet the slower songs are great as well, with a couple of them almost having an underlying country element to them. Don't misunderstand; it's not country at all (thank goodness), but it seems to me there are many different musical layers here. I get the feeling the band members themselves have a variety of musical tastes, and are allowed to throw their two cents into the mix when they go into the studio. A great sing-along song like \\"Louder Than Ever\\" would work great for rock radio, while I could picture \\"Gone Too Soon\\" (a sad song about loss, where Chris sings \\"Would you have been president? Or a painter, an author or sing like your mother?\\") on country or pop stations. The thing that Chris Daughtry does so beautifully is create radio-friendly songs with good quality music and top-notch vocals. My personal opinion is that his first CD is his best so far (I have it on constant rotation on my computer at work), his 2nd CD lagged a bit, but this 3rd release is more in the tradition of his debut. It's catchy with lots of hooks and vocals that will floor you. While Daughtry has the vocal chops to soar HIGH above the music, the band writes music that allow his abilities to shine without overshadowing the music. This is no solo act; it's a BAND, and vocals and music are woven together nicely. I think the feeling of the entire release is summed up in \\"Renegade,\\" whenChris sings, \\"100 miles an hour with the top rolled down, racing the wind, breakin' outta this town.\\" Metal-heads who watched him on \\"Idol\\" and thought he was going to be solely a hard rock performer will not be crazy about \\"Break The Spell,\\" but for lovers of good, solid rock with catchy, sing-along choruses and a good mix of gritty rock and heart-felt ballads will truly enjoy it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love it. What a fantastic game for free! don't. hesitate. to get this one. I play this more than anything. else on my Kindle.
B001AZFO14|5.0|What a great combination, one of my favorite actors in one of my favorite films!  It also features one of the best lines ever spoken, \\"I'm going to kill them all, Sir.\\"  As a bonus, we get multiple closeups of the absolutely gorgeous Connie Nielsen.  I will be watching this movie again.
B000V86OKG|5.0|Season Two of DEXTER gives up twelve more episodes of guilty pleasure viewing. You don't get more anti-hero than Dexter Morgan, by day an unassuming blood spatter analyst on Miami Metro Police's forensics team and by night a notorious serial killer dubbed by the media as the Bay Harbor Butcher. That's right, after years of Dexter's being so very careful with his kills, his chickens have still come home to roost. Imagine his shock when his dumped garbage bags full of hacked-up body parts are found just off the coast of Miami, riling up the media, throwing Miami Metro PD in chaos, especially when evidence surfaces suggesting that the Butcher may be a cop in their department. To quote Dexter: \\"For such a neat monster, I'm making an awfully big mess.\\"<br /><br />Season Two conveys a whiff of Kevin Costner's [[ASIN:0792844874 No Way Out]] and Denzel Washington's [[ASIN:B0000VJG72 Out of Time]], as Dexter finds himself furiously racing against time, what with his colleagues getting ever closer to uncovering the Bay Harbor Butcher's true identity. Still, to demonstrate again how thought-provoking this show is, when the police's digging around unearths that the Butcher seems only to have slain other murderers, one headline from the print media reads: \\"Bay Harbor Butcher: Friend or Foe?\\" We see Dexter, after reading that, stand a little bit taller.<br /><br />Not that the recent past is neglected. The harrowing Ice Truck Killer case isn't yet so distant in the rear view mirror. Dexter is haunted by having had to kill the Ice Truck Killer who, as you know, was his long-lost brother. Dexter's cop sister Debra (an appealingly awkward Jennifer Carpenter) is a wreck. She's still coping with having been duped and captured and almost killed by the Ice Truck Killer who, as you know, was her fiance. Let's face it, Debra's radar for sensing serial killers is sort of suspect.<br /><br />Dexter has always been meticulous about blending in, about preserving his \\"Dark Passenger.\\" He adheres to the Code of Harry, rules of survival taught him by his foster father, him what originally set him on this dark road. To hide his true nature, Dexter Morgan maintains a cloak of normality, fakes emotions he doesn't feel, adopts behavior that pushes him unobstrusively to the background. Except that enough of Dexter's secret life had leaked into his \\"cover\\" that he finds himself having to confess to his girlfriend Rita that, yes, he is an addict. She assumes a drug addiction and convinces him to attend Narcotics Anoymous. But we all know it's an even darker dependency that he clings to, and it's really interesting watching Dexter try to 12-step his way to recovery, especially when he lands a beautiful NA sponsor (played by Jaime Murray, marvelous) determined to reach the \\"real\\" Dexter. As ever, only the combustible Sgt. Doakes suspects that there's something off with the resident blood spatter analyst. And in this season's final few episodes, the highly charged interactions between Erik King (\\"Doakes\\") and Michael C. Hall become utterly compelling.<br /><br />I think I'm in love with Deb Morgan as played by Jennifer Carpenter. Deb wears her emotions on her sleeve, is brash and bull-headed and fidgety and so potty-mouthed that Richard Pryor just ran off to fetch a bar of soap. She spends the first half of Season Two traumatized from her time with the Ice Truck Killer. Carpenter oozes attitude and wounded vulnerability and she's so very likable. And anyone could see it coming, that Deb would latch onto Keith Carradine's grounded FBI agent.<br /><br />Michael C. Hall's complex and uncannily sympathetic performance obviously anchors the show, and you can pin phrases such as \\"darkly funny\\" and \\"a deliciously wicked turn\\" to what he brings. His frequently amusing voice-over narration sheds a light on how his mind works. We take in his pointed commentary on society and its many vagaries. We observe Dexter's growth as a character. We see him evolve beyond the Code of Harry. Which doesn't mean he stops chopping up those what deserve to get chopped up. What's that credo? Some whatsis about having the serenity to accept the things one cannot change? And, ultimately, after the season-long bout of second-guessing, what's Dexter Morgan if not serene? It's the show itself that's morally ambivalent, leaving its audience conflicted and yet absolutely engrossed. Addicted, even.ry.

B001GSTOAM|4.0|Begins with some excellent insights on coding, emphasizing separation of concerns, supported by excellent examples (but, sadly some shamefully poor illustrations!). The book has an excellent compilation of code smells and heuristics which will make a great reference to anyone cleaning up a mess (whether someone else's or their own!). The sections on concurrency are a bit vague for me.
B0055SWM08|5.0|this is the game for the real puzzle person... It's getting better and better ever evolving. keep it up fallen tree!
B0013N7AD8|4.0|The movies are great (well, at least the first two are), but the packaging could have been better.  The packaging is held together with gummy tape (or whatever it's called).  This means that once you open it up, you can never get it closed again.  This results in the inability to display the movies on a bookshelf in the original packaging.<br /><br />If the packaging was better, this would have gotten five stars instead of just four.  Still an overall good buy if you're a fan of the Tim Burton Batman movies.  I could take or leave the Joel Shumacher films, but for only a couple bucks more than if you bought the two Burtons separately, this was a good deal.

140131046X|4.0|Mitch has indeed done it again. After reading Tuesdays with Morrie, I immediately wanted to read another book by Albom, so I chose this one.   I didn't give 5 stars because (for me at least) it definitely was not as much of an engaging page-turner as Tuesdays was, but still, at the end I thought it was a very enjoyable book. Just because I didn't have the same obsessive need to get to the next chapter as with Tuesdays doesn't mean it wasn't a great product by Albom.   To me, this book is mixed with humor, humility, and made me feel very comfortable, as if Albom was casually speaking to me. It's very personal and approachable. I think most people who grew up in religion can identify with parts of the book. At first, it was hard to put the two stories together, and it was only towards the middle of the book that I saw where Albom was going with this.   Unlike some of the lower-starred reviews, I do not believe (but by all means I am not saying my thoughts trump that of others) that Albom was trying to re-create another Tuesdays. There is definitely some overlap, but I don't see the harm in it. Both books talk about issues related to death, so there would naturally be some related themes. I do agree with other reviewers that have pointed out that there are holes that would have been great to fill, such as, did Albom wind up becoming more in touch with his Jewish faith? What did he wind up doing as a result? Small, but interesting questions that are left open, which is probably what he meant to do.   I don't believe this was a hocus-pocus, Oprah-ish type of book as some of the older reviews have insinuated, but we are all entitled to our own opinions. I think it's a refreshing read that one should definitely check out at their local library or via e-books on Kindle. It's another instance of reminding us to be more kind and treat others a bit more humanely!
B006O5XYWG|2.0|There is some entertainment \\"value\\" in the movie, but for the most part it is/was very predictable.  I wish I could give it a higher rating than two stars, but too often into the second half of the movie I kept saying \\"pu-leeze\\" when many of the action scenes were taking place.  I can see teenage boys liking this genere of movies, but for others you may want to search for something more mentally engaging.
B0067D7Y3U|5.0|Daughtry was my favorite and this is my second album of his and this is what I enjoy about him. Really glad I got this one.
B005V4FJC4|2.0|I almost clicked purchase, only because the album is so cheap and I'd save money compared to buying the few songs I really like individually. But then I heard \\"Baby, It's Cold Outside.\\" Everyone has wanted to buy the full version from the film \\"Elf\\" since the movie first screened in theaters. Now, for her first Christmas album, Deschanel sticks us with the 21st century, androgynous version of the song, wherein she and Ward flip the traditional parts. No thanks!
B00650SSWG|1.0|Justin is a usual bore and Mila is plain annoying, with plenty of sarcastic, dry banter that's not really funny. The plot is very shallow and contrived, and it feels like the movie was sort of done for the heck of it and nobody really gave too much cr@p. Boring!
B0036TGT3E|5.0|The product is what I expected and a very good quality. The product was received on a timely manner. NICE..
B004Y1WCDE|4.0|Purchased Plex for iPod Touch and liked it enough to purchase for the Android.  Plex allows you to stream media - video, music - from your home computer without tying up storage on the portable device.<br /><br />Plex is a strong competitor to Zumocast. Zumocast still works on my Touch, though it has been removed from the Apple market after the product was purchased by one of the Android vendors.<br /><br />Plex does have a tendancy to lag or completely stall now and then when it plays video. And there is a long, noticable delay between music files. Also, Plex does streaming and streaming ONLY.<br /><br />Zumocast, on the other hand allows you to optionally download the file for later playback, and I have not experienced the lags with it.<br /><br />If Plex would allow the same download capability as Zumocast, I would rate it 5 stars, as this would allow me to overcome the other problems with delays and lags.

B006LS7DQE|2.0|First game I purchased for my Fire.  I have owned all versions of this game for the DS and have loved it.  Many of the functions I have found most useful in the game are not available on the Kindle.  As just one example, if you hold your finger on a spell icon, it tells you what the spell is and how it works.  Great feature except that when you let go of the icon, the spell is cast and there is no way to stop it.  There are many of these quirks and, inaddition, even though the screen on the kindle is 5 times as big as on the DS, it is impossible to see many icons, like the weapons your character is currently carrying, etc.  Bottom line, this game costs 2 to 5 times as much as many other Kindle games and is a terrible rendition of the game.  I would return it if I could.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|i like this app, but i am scared that if i udate it, everything will go away :( other than that, a nice app
B000HF6XKO|1.0|This was a Very Anti-American/ Pro Arab Movie in my opinion..I hate that Matt Damon played in this movie, because I liked him. I expected it from George Clooney. Our Country isn't perfect, but we do more good than harm in the World. I hope all those that watch this Movie don't believe everything (or even half) of what this movie portrays. Movies like this try to kill American Pride.. F U Clooney and Damon.. Just my take on the Movie.
B00425S1H8|3.0|I do not have a serial port on my laptop and I needed an adapter to  run an equipment which requires a serial port.  I have tried many adapter such as this one but none have worked.  Unfortunately, this one does not work either.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Some folks are complaining that this is simply a port, and not a very good port.  Well, this Android version is all I've played, and I think it's great.  It does take a while to load, and to unload, but I've never had the game crash the phone, lose a saved game, or be unable to take a call.  The game is so great that my only complaint is that it's too addictive.
0060873027|4.0|I read this book with a little reserve, but I really enjoyed it. It definitely has elements from other books such as Jurassic Park and Timeline. Character development is not as detailed. But it is a compelling narrative to ponder. There's no way to know just how Michael would have done the finished product, but I can see a movie coming out of this comparable to Fantastic Voyage of the late '60s. There are more pros than cons.
B00005LOUP|4.0|Both the book and original animated version of How The Grinch Stole Christmas are such classics that it's hard for anyone or anything to compete with them. And this movie version has high points and low points throughout. I find the appearance of the residents of Whoville to be somewhat creepy rather than whimsical in this movie - those noses and backsides just don't sit right, although the town itself is visually a lot of fun. The backstory on the Grinch that is added to flesh this out into a 2+ hour movie has its up and downs as well - it's a little too mean in places for my taste, and the vengeance on the town Mayor that happens towards the end doesn't quite jibe with the overall theme of the original Seuss book, which was more funny than mean. Jim Carrey has great and weak moments as the Grinch - he seems to be in improv mode quite a bit, especially when alone in his Grinch cave, and sometimes it works, sometimes it just drags. But Max the dog is superb - there hasn't been an onscreen dog since Benji with such a great presence!<br /><br />So until the end of this movie, it was running at 3 stars for me. But then the climactic scene came, where the Grinch hears the music from town, realizes he hasn't stopped Christmas after all, and has his awakening - \\"Maybe Christmas...doesn't come from a store...Maybe Christmas...perhaps...means a little bit more!\\" This is handled beautifully in the movie, with an exquisite sunset behind the Grinch, and the Grinch crying tears of joy as his heart grows. I found it truly moving, and it brought this film back up to 4 stars for me. I should also mention that my kids ages 5 & 7, were riveted all the way through this year, so that also counts for a lot.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I've read some of the reviews on this thin but durable cover and have determined that depending on what your needs are the reviews vary.  I needed protection.  And this cover gives you that.  Not cushioning, like a padded leather cover will give you, but some protection from abrasion and scratches.  I like it because it doesn't increase the footprint of the Kindle by much and will still fit into another bag or briefcase. It props up for watching videos or reading books very nicely but only in landscape mode, not portrait.  I would buy this again.  dab<br /><br />Well I've had my kindle for a year and a half now and I still have it in the original case.  It has protected it from 2 drops so far.  It is well beat up now but is still functioning.  Sep 2013
B0063IH60K|5.0|Game works great on Kindle Fire. Good graphics and I like the options in the menu. Makes time fly quickly.
B004SQS9FA|5.0|To begin with I'm not one of those who buy into the Radiohead myth and think that everything they do is classic. I think their debut Pablo Honey was underrated, The Bends was a masterpiece, and OK Computer was an absolute classic, a true landmark. But to be honest they lost me with Kid A. But they won me over again three albums later with In Rainbows. So praise for this album (which may be their most polarizing) was not automatic by any means. This is a truly haunting album which truly creeps up on you with each subsequent listen. Some detractors draw attention to the fact that there is only 8 songs and it is barely over 37 minutes. But the album is a cohesive whole that doesn't over stay it's welcome. Some criticizes the lack of ambition (at least by Radiohead's standards) but I personally find the not trying too hard to be refreshing. Trying to be experimental and different doesn't automatically make it good. If you listen with a truly open mind it is truly a gorgeous album.

B004EPZ06Q|1.0|This movie goes way to far and should go down in the record book as one of the worst sequels ever made and one of the worst movies ever made. The first Hangover movie was funny but the frontal nudity and sexuality in this one was offensive, totally unnecessary and just made a horribly, overly raunchy movie that much worse. Why this was allowed to have a \\"R\\" rating is beyond me, it should have been \\"X\\" rated.
0385738773|5.0|Well done, Mr. Dashner, well done. So how do you end a unique sci-fi, post-apocalyptic dystopian series that is nonstop action, unrelenting danger?... a true adrenaline rush to the very end? Well, with a BANG of course and rightfully so. As the first two books of this thrilling trilogy kept readers on the edge of their seats expect no less from this final installment.<br /><br />In this third and last book THE DEATH CURE, Thomas and his remaining friends find that even though they fought their way out of The MAZE and survived The SCORCH TRIALS, WICKED isn't quite done with them. Now as some alliances may have been swayed, they must decide who can sill be trusted and what is the truth as it's finally time to make a choice... is WICKED really good? Within the twist and turns of this ever forward moving plot, unforeseen heroes will arise, ghost of the past will return, friendships will be tested and some betrayed, but most shockingly, the lives of some beloved characters will come to a devastating end.<br /><br />Dashner doesn't hold back as he skillfully grants the many answers the series readers so desperately need, while keeping the adventure and suspense that fans have come to expect from this fast paced and exciting series. I absolutely loved this last book. THE DEATH CURE is brilliantly finished, providing the reader closer at an intensity that did the series justice. The MAZE RUNNER trilogy has proved to be an adventure fit for all ages and a true page turner to the very end.
B006BXT4TI|4.0|In the case of this album, I didn't connect with it the same way I did with their previous album Brothers (which was my #1 album for 2010). But there is no denying that this an irresistibly rocking album. They abandoned some of their earlier blues influence for more of a classic rock feel (Brothers already started in that direction, and angered some Black Key purists). But from top to bottom there is no filler to be found. It may not be the best album of 2011 but may be the most authentically rocking album of the year. Very few bands know how to rock anymore, so for that alone make this album a breath of fresh air.
B005DF2QMC|5.0|I bought this to convert an audio cassette tape of my wedding in 1981 to digital.  Very fast shipping and product was just as described.  Instructions were easy to follow and the included software was simple and quick to install and use.  The digital copy sounded exactly like the original, no improvement but no loss of sound quality either.  Although the silver plastic parts appear to be loose and cheaply made, the item works great and seems to me a very good buy for the low price.
B006O5Y0SS|5.0|Woody, you did well sir. This is just a gem of a movie. Who knew Owen Wilson would be such a sublime conduit of time travel. You will be pleased if you take the time to enjoy this. Cheers.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|To make my point I'll be as concise as possible in this review. 90% of this and Feast for Crows were not only boring, but pointless to plot. The other part of the problem in Feast, repeated here, is focus on characters that aren't interesting. And most importantly, Martin's insistence on the use of internal narrative over and over again - whether it be simple thoughts or dream sequences - is completely unnecessary. When it was Catelyn remembering playing with her sister and Littlefinger as kids I could take it, because those folks were interesting. But I don't need 200 pages to realize that Cersei hates everyone, and I don't need 200 pages of Dany contemplating, or Tyrion pissing.  I don't need to be reminded anymore that Davos has lost his fingers. If this book was going to be terrible couldn't it have been shorter?!  Maybe in more need of an editor than anything I've read this side of a Bill Simmons article.
B0050VJ29Y|5.0|This collaboration of super producer Brian Burton (Danger Mouse) and Italian composer Daniele Luppi is inspired by the music from spaghetti westerns was a project 5 years in the making.  The album also reunites the choir which performed on the soundtrack of The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.  The album also features three tracks with vocals from Jack White and three songs with vocals from Norah Jones. It is hard not to admire the ambition of the project, but the album succeeds beyond being an interesting musical experiment. Of course the album is cinematic, but it is also haunting and gorgeous. It also accomplished the miraculous feat of turning me into a Norah Jones fan. I always found her music and persona somewhat bland. But there is a real coolness to her performance on this album. Jack White's vocals are emotional highlights as well. But much of the album is instrumental. To be honest not really a huge instrumental fan, but the instrumental tracks on the album are truly compelling. A real masterpiece.

B005HJWWW8|2.0|This little amplifier worked fine until a static discharge killed it.  Used with headphones attached to a TV, while running on a treadmill.  Got a static discharge when stepping on the treadmill and the unit turned off and now it is completely dead.  The charging light turns on when it is plugged in to USB but it won't turn on any longer.<br /><br />We have an E5 that works fine in the same environment.
B001HPP2XW|5.0|Nothing can compare to the original movie.  It has real actors and actresses that were already great.  This just proves that it is hard to beat the masters of old.
B006A819AG|4.0|The band's eleventh studio album is also their first concept album. With this album The Roots continues to be one of the most ambitious & adventurous groups in hip hop. Many of the songs contains a really cool funky old school vibe, while other features strings (like the four part Redford mini suite that ends the album) and some are really rocking (like Stomp). It also may be one their darkest album subject rise, but it does impact you on an emotional level. From time to time we can all relate to the bleakness of life, it is just trying to learn the lessons from the tragedies (including other peoples). This album shows that musically the band continues to be one of the tightest & most versatile groups in any genre.
B005KDWUG4|1.0|Very disappointing video quality.  This is not live video recording - rather it is a poor flim transfer and the grain is as big as golf balls.  Buy the regular DVD instead.

B00192KCQ0|1.0|This album is just plain awful. It seems that they couldn't stand their hardcore fans complaining and whining about the old sound of Metallica that they missed so much. So they made this crap just to please all those Beavis an Butt head instead of being loyal to them selves. There is not a single song here, a single one that you can remember after listening. The voice line is awful, AWFUL!. The songs sound like a bunch of riffs one after the others, then Hetfield sang whatever he had on top of his head at the moment. Horrible. Why? Because they were not themselves, they were just pleasing their immature audience, and that's a sin in the realm of music and art. One of the best stuff Metallica has made in terms of music and artistic values in general is Load and St. Anger, because they were free, the did what they wanted to do, regardless what people wanted to hear. People who think that going back to the roots is the right thing to do are just plain idiots. And by the way this awful album doesn't sound either like their old stuff, so in the end they didn't even please their idiotic fans. I hope next time they have the courage to be themselves again and make another St. Anger, another Load or whatever THEY feel is right for them, not for their fans.

1604596163|1.0|I read 30 pages of the book, and put it down. The author does not make me care about Lady Chatterley as a person. I want to feel some sort of sympathy for a character, even if she makes mistakes.  Frankly, Lawrence should have wrote this under a pseudonym and marketed it as erotica/pornography. It would have escaped the censors at the time and he would have made money off of it, at least.
B004LFO0FG|4.0|When I first heard \\"Til The World Ends\\" on the radio I became addicted to Britney again.  She can sing and dance, what you need to be a successful solo artist.  While I didn't enjoy her first few albums, just some songs from them, this one is great almost all the way through.  She still looks great on the cover and back cover which guys will enjoy and her music is fun pop which girls will enjoy!  I can't think of a favorite track but all the tracks chosen for singles were great and good choices.  One of the songs \\"Criminal\\" is a great a definately single-worthy.  I still don't understand why it fell flat on the radio because of less listener requests!  That's what the dj on the radio said at least when I was listening on my local radio station.  The singles are still being played and the videos are great too.  If you've been a fan of Britney for a while then this album is for you.  It may be different (More techno-pop), but still worth the purchase!  4 out of 5 stars.  Go Britney!
B004LWZW4M|5.0|Rise of the Planet of the Apes is by far one of the best movies of 2011 and I am a serious movie buff!! I used to watch the original Planet of the Apes as a kid and was always fascinated by the fact that they were apes that ruled civilization and did everything that humans do.The storeyline and plot is awesome and filled with much action! For anyone who watched Planet of the Apes as a kid this makes the movie even more interesting because this movie describes how it all started! Rise of the the Planet of the Apes is definitely a must see! I've already watched it about 3 times since I purchased! If I could rate more than 5 stars then I would have rated to the highest number available! Definitely on my list of my top favorite movies of all time!!!
B002F6FQGK|5.0|This is the first time I have listened to this artist and I love this album. Bought Ceremonials today as well.
B005PTYOTE|1.0|Am I going crazy?  Or did they edit this movie to remove all character development?  It's been a long time since I've seen the first one, so I anxiously fired up the disk and -- after I got over the shock of wondering whether this was even SD quality -- I anxiously awaited the scene where Tom Cruise submerses himself in the moral and psychological struggle of sleeping with his dead bosses wife while wondering if she's who he thinks he is.  Instead, the whole scene was gone!  I'm now checking the case, wondering if they removed the 13 from the rating!  There were a few other edits, very similar to this one, that I can't quite put my finger on.  What a joke!  I felt totally cheated!  I mean, explosions are cool and all, but why strip the movie of its humanity?  Could it not all fit on the disk?  Did I just mentally create those parts the first time I saw the movie, because they were so obviously missing?  Can't say for sure.  In any event, don't buy this.  The crappy non blu-ray quality is enough reason alone.  Other bloggers are whining about no lossless audio.  Don't really care.  This edition lost a lot more than audio.
B0042RUMH8|5.0|I bought this digitally and I have to say it's so underrated!  While it might not be J Lo's best album to date, it's still pretty good!  All the songs from it are listenable and she still can sing, while she may not be the best singer.  The producers are good even though not too well known.  No DarkChild or Timbaland on this album but still a fun album from Jennifer.  She is one of my favorite entertainers.  A talented actress (seen her in a few films), funny (saw her on SNL) and can sing decently (While not the best, but then again, I'm not either!).  This album incorporates some more urban style into it with rappers (Lil Wayne, one of my favorites and Pitbull, popular right now).  While I like her better than Enrique, they're still good singers with formidable talents!  Check this album out if you are new to Jennifer Lopez.  2011 was definately a comeback to her.  GO JENNY!<br /><br />- ERIC S.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|Seeing it in blu ray really makes a difference. Super awesome a must see with a great price too match .
B000FS9FCG|5.0|PILOJ is the acronymn for \\"Proscription In Lieu Of Justice\\". Proscription means banishment. And, here, in \\"V For Vendetta\\", where govt killing is to be avenged, and where justice is impossible, V's penalty for banishment is death.  Until justice is done... We are, of course, in the twisty-turny world of justifying vigilante killings. When a govt does not protect citizens from murder, when a govt is instead responsible for the murder of its citizens; when a govt does not protect citizen rights, when a govt instead violates its citizen rights; when a govt's representatives act as though they live above the law and do not obey the Constitution, then justice must be considered to be impossible.  And, the vigilante may properly contend, if those conditions hold, then that govt's claim to the consent of its citizens is forfeit, and that govt is illegitimate until justice is done.  When authorities have made justice impossible, when they've wired down a society's pressure cooker's safety valve--stopping all possibility of change--and then have cranked up the heat by continually disobeying the Constitution, there's only one result to be sanely expected.  Americans are there, doing that.  Stories such as \\"V For Vendetta\\" give us a basis for discussion, a point of departure for speculation.  Vigilante killings, in some pure sense, are wrongful murders.  You cannot take the law into your own hands when you live under the rule of law.  If you do, then you must expect to pay the piper.  However--no matter how genuine the rule of law seems to be at the time--every era has many persons who think they live above the law, as well as many persons who live outside the law.  Such persons can always arrange circumstances in which their killings--their wrongful taking of lives--makes justice impossible for ordinary citizens to obtain.  It's the way of the world and has been since the earliest codifications of law.  Well--with the sole exception of Switzerland, the only nation in which democracy is directly in the hands of the people at all jurisdictional levels.  If we, as ordinary citizens, with no ability to make justice happen under our govt, banish a wrong-doer and his/her helpers from our society, we can choose any penalty for the banishment that we choose.  If the person is clearly guilty of robbery, not murder, we may penalize him/her by taking wealth--money and property.  If the person is clearly guilty of wrongfully taking lives, then killing that person and his/her helper(s) is arguably justifiable.  And so, into the twisty-turny world of vigilante killings.  The fictional man called \\"V\\" lives under a totalitarian govt that has proven itself to him to be guilty of many murders.  It's a fascist govt very similar to Hitler's Germany, the infamous 3rd Reich.  Under such govts, ordinary people cannot make justice happen.  After his near-thing escape from a research center--in which a lethal virus and its cure were developed, killing dozens--V watches as the politician-killers take many tens of thousands of lives with their own cureable virus.  He then prepares himself for about twenty years, and then jumps up his campaign to topple the totalitarian govt.  He blows things up and kills as needed to keep himself free.  Under the cloak of state-controlled news media, he kills men and women whom he knows are directly guilty of wrongful death.  He also kills their helpers, for example, policemen. Ultimately, he cuts down the criminal govt's topmost leaders.  Killing helpers is a bit of a stretch legally, but those who aid others in wrongful killing are themselves part of the \\"felony murder\\" conspiracy.  So V's killing of the regime's policemen--as with Robin Hood's killing of \\"the Sheriff's men\\" in the late 12th Century--is arguably the killing of those guilty of conspiratorial felony murder and therefore arguably justifiable.  You don't step very far away from Robin Hood in any dealings with vigilante justice.  The History Channel's priceless documentary, \\"The Real Robin Hood\\", should be on the viewing list for anyone chewing on vigilante justice.  Sure, it's probably a grautuitous hype for the Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe movie, \\"Robin Hood\\".  But it's the outlaw's backstory, no matter how far in the future the outlaw runs with his vigilante justice.  Surprisingly, Crowe's touchstone of Robin Hood's taking rights and liberties from the rich and giving those to the poor so that justice can be done is \\"spot on\\", as the Brits say, for today's needs.    In any event, the key here is that V's killings are punishment for murders done by a govt that protects itself and its cronnies and under which justice is impossible.  V's unsurprising intention is to take that liberty-set from the rich and powerful and then to give it to the poor and ordinary citizens.  Hello, justice.  Hello, Crowe and Scott.  Hello, Robin Hood.  That govt's self-protectiveness and illegal caring for its rich and powerful cronnies is, in fact, very similar to the US govt since the Reagan administrations in the 1980s.  (See especially, \\"Inside Job\\", the 2011 Oscar-winning Best Documentary of the Year, which covers the causes of the 2008 financial meltdown.)  The similarity of govts is what makes the movie, \\"V For Vendetta\\", an important topic of discussion and point of departure for ordinary Americans.  The movie is done in a \\"filmatic graphic novel\\" syle, according to the filmmakers themselves.  I didn't notice any filmatic nod to the graphic novel until V's final fight, you know, when he brings his daggers to a gunfight.  Then the filmatic comic book effects fairly jump off the screen at you.  The spun and hurled daggers are given the same visual after-images that you expect to see on a comic book's pages.  Yes, it's CGI to die for.  The film's story is based on a ten-issue comic book series and given the \\"graphic novel\\" upgrade tag.  It's writers, and certainly the adaptive filmmakers, want it to be seen as something more than comic book logic.  I'm not sure that the story makes it to that next level.  The story has many twists and turns that smack of disjointed, disconnected comic book logic.  Still, the story seems more engaging than something out of the straight, superhero, comic book genre.  Some of the film's core features are things that our today's revolutionaries need to digest.  Given the belief of enough people, V says, a symbol--say the blowing up of a building--can change the world.  When V's bomb blows up the buildings of Parliament at the end--punctuated by a great sprong from the airborne Big Ben clock--the implication is that he's successfully involved enough people to bring down the V-decaptivated govt.  Revolutionaries, make a note.  Rule one is seeing democracy done.  It's doers must be seen by its other doers--directly and beyond the reach of the sniveling superrich or their parasitic politicians.  All the great democracy movements share this seeing.  In the end, V-the-filmatic-graphic-novel shows the needed seeing of democracy done.    --spib, 23 Dec 2011

B0034G4P4O|3.0|Put me in the evidently small group of people who have never heard of Tintin, let alone read any of the books.  Well sure, I've seen the movie trailers.  Initially, I was a bit put off because I couldn't figure out how old this kid is.  My son suggested he was about 15 and that's pretty much the way the character acted and looked.  Then, he heads back to his bachelor pad, straps on a Ruger 9 mm and heads out looking for the crooks that stole his model ship.  He even heads out to sea after being captured and manages to dispatch numerous henchmen with the boxing skills of Manny Pacquiao.  I guess he's a bit older.  In any case director Steven Spielberg, in his first animated film, resurrects what appears to be Young Indiana Jones.<br /><br />Tintin purchases a model 3-masted sailing ship at a flea market unaware that sealed inside one of the masts is a map that leads to a great treasure.  This early part of the film wants to be witty and I wish it were.  Where are all those inside jokes that keep the adults interested?  The movie jumps to a full gallop and never lets up for the next hour or more.  Tintin, with the help of his trusted pooch Snowy, manage to figure things out.  Aboard the ship, Tintin frees the captain who is the grandson of the original sailing ship's captain.  The ship (Unicorn)  sunk loaded with gold and other treasures.  In reflection the ship was sunk after a great battle with a pirate named Sakharine.  He was the grandfather of the thief (Rackham) who took Tintin's model ship.  Each of the 3 model ships that were built by grandpa Haddock contains clues to the treasure location.  The chase is on.  And it's quite a chase.  The action is exhausting.<br /><br />The movie uses motion capture and is very well done.  Excellent voice acting helps as well.  Jamie Bell is Tintin, Daniel Craig is the evil Rackham/Sakharine and talented Andy Serkis is the Captains Haddock.  I saw this film in 3-D and it is subtle and very effective.  This is a close second to the 3-D version of \\"Hugo\\" in terms of technical effectiveness.  I would also note that I saw this in a theater filled with kids who can often be fidgety and noisy, but there wasn't a peep.  The only distraction was the numbskull in front of me who kept checking his Blackberry.of \\"Hugo\\" in terms of technical effectiveness.

4789009637|5.0|I am a student at the university and we are currently using this book. I can't believe some of the reviews I've read. Some of them are so negative. Truth is, this is an amazing book. I have purchased so many Japanese books, but so far, this is the best one. It is extremely detailed and provides excellent information. All students of all levels and ages can us this book. Don't be discouraged or hesitant by the negative remarks.
034544678X|3.0|This book was nice. I enjoyed some of the insights into dog behavior. It doesn't rate higher, however because of it's scattered nature. Had it been a book of all of the tales of her clients, it would have rated higher. Had it been a book about dog nature according to an animal behaviorist, or about training with the dogs nature it would have been higher. Instead, it was a mish-mash of all of these, never letting you settle into one genre before flinging you to another. Maybe I am just bad at transitioning. I am, however, glad that I read the book and some of the images in the stories pop up in my day to day interaction with my dogs.... So would I do it again? YES. Would I suggest it to others? no.
B004EPZ06Q|2.0|I should state from the get-go that I was not the biggest fan of the first film.  I thought it was reasonably funny, but never understood the mass appeal.  Or rather, I did (I was in college when the first film came out), but it still didn't impress me all that much.  That said, when I checked the Amazon reviews a few weeks ago, I thought that surely people were exaggerating their criticisms of Part II.  Most of the complaints seemed to be about the unoriginality of the script.  And, yes, it follows the original premise almost completely:  Ed Helms sings a song about halfway through, and it ends with incriminating photos discovered on a phone.  Oh, those crazy cell phone pics.<br /><br />But none of that bothers me.  It's a franchise about hangovers - the options aren't so numerous.  The real problem is that the film is just lame.  Really lame.  The performances feel completely telegraphed, so I think even the actors might have agreed.  Nobody is looking for Shakespearean depth in a flick with a cigarette smoking monkey, but signs that they're actually interested in their lines wouldn't hurt.<br /><br />In short: the attempts at outlandish humor result more often in eye rolls than laughs.  It's all so tired, and there is a complete lack of new ideas.  The movie is at its most pathetic when the writers finally just have one of the characters get shot.  Sure, why not?  That's funny, right?!  The first film made a gazillion dollars, and now all involved have decided to ride this cash cow for all it's worth.  Part III is due out in 2013, and I'm sure it will pull in the big bucks, too.  (Aside: is it any surprise that America's favorite sitcoms are the Chuck Lorre dreck on CBS?)<br /><br />I give it two stars for the soundtrack and Mike Tyson, who deserved better material.  Fingers crossed for a Herman Cain biopic.

B0053JJLLC|3.0|I can't read this book on my Kindle Fire with the Font Style set as white characters on a black background.  For some reason the white characters appear black on black and therefore unreadable.  Yet it works fine on my android phone.  I have had my Kindle Fire for a month now and have almost a hundred Kindle books.  I set my Kindle Fire Font Style with a black background and white letters setting the display brightness to minimum.  I find this easy to read for long periods and helps conserve battery life.  I can't read this book that way because of some book manufacture setting.  I have to read it with black characters on either white or the tan background.  I have factory reset and reloaded the book and have the same problem.

B005Z4LCZS|4.0|This is not a rules overview.<br /><br />Takenoko is a fun and strategic game that is quite easy to learn- the rules are only a few pages, but the in-game choices and multiple paths to victory ensure that every game plays differently. I played this with 3 others, pre-release, at the 2011 Essen Game Fair in Germany, and it was fun. The components and art are great. The turns move quickly. There are lots of choices to earn victory points. I immediately added this to the top of my wishlist because I knew that I could get gamers of all shapes and sizes to play this- strategy is probably about the level of Settlers of Catan, but the components are way cooler.
B005I64U66|1.0|Don't waste your time watching this.  Anything even marginally funny could be condensed down to about 2 minutes.  The rest of the movie is boring and an insult to the intelligence of a four year old.
B0018O4YSQ|5.0|This is an amazing movie that wound up being my own Christmas present since the person it was intended for decided to go shopping for himself 2 days before Christmas and bought this...  So, Merry Christmas to me!  I love this movie!  A must see!  The delivery was quick and precise even with all the complications (my fault).  I was impressed how it wasn't delivered in just a bubble wrap envelope, too!  It was plastic sealed on cardboard that fit in the box package to prevent the Blu-Ray from moving around and possibly being damaged!  Great job!  Once again, my experience has been wonderful!  :-)
B000026258|5.0|This beautiful ECM edition captures perfectly the space of the whole piece like no other edition and it represent for me the original \\"Music for 18 musicians\\" as it should be played: the original steve reich's ensemble is made up by fantastic players such as Russ Hartenberger, Bob Becker or Glen Velez and they all play with great tempo and synchronization, excellent crescendos and diminuendos in the voices/wind sections, and a fantastic energy. Compared to the RCA version (by modern ensemble) it sounds more richer and more spaced like a live version but the modern ensemble version is more energetic and \\"mathematical\\" because players are very very precise. I personally don't like the \\"Grand valley ensemble\\" version because of its exaggerated reverb that doesn't help instruments to mix each others and so the energy result dissipated into the soundscape but on the other and this version has an interesting and different  mixing. This beautifully recorded ECM version features a great introduction by the author himself explaining the structure of the whole piece for the new listener.  This is the original edition with the original ensemble and it should be the first choice for the first listener and it will remain as a standard for its acoustical perfection, but for those who know WELL the piece I would recommend the Ensemble Modern version for its very lively, precise and energetic performance.

1439110123|2.0|It is difficult for me to believe that this long winded volume won the Pulitzer.  Although Yergin recounts in painful detail the impressive sweep of oil over 150 years, it reads like the \\"one damn thing after another\\" version of history. There is no attempt at synthesis. Yergin introduces characters with a paragraph of irrelevant detail \\"he had an impressive moustache\\", reserving equal detail for someone as important as Rockefeller and as trivial as some guy who drilled a handful of wells in Texas.  This book may be a great reference, but the lack of fitting facts into an overarching hierarchy makes it almost unreadable. Interesting chapters on the early history of oil, oil during the world wars, and oil crises. Badly needed some context for the facts and figures: a graph of the production history of oil regions and a graph of oil prices vs time would have eliminated endless, painful, contextless statements like \\" production in Iran went from xx to xx bpd.\\" do we care? was that production change important?  Did prices change then or before or after?
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|The Descendants is a beautiful film shot in Hawaii. This film showcases the beauty of Hawaii well.  I love the shots of the valleys and beaches.  I live here so this is something I see every day.  George Clooney stars as Matt King.  He is a father trying to raise his daughters after his wife goes into a coma after a boating accident.<br /><br /> Matt learns from his teenage daughter that his wife was carrying on an affair at the time of her accident.  The daughter is played Shailene Woodley.  Upon learning about his wife's infidelity, Matt chooses to locate and confront the man having an affair with his wife.  An actor named Matthew Lillard plays Brian Speer.  He is  the man having an  affair with Matt King's wife.  An actress named Judy Greer plays Speer's wife.  These characters each have individual scenes with Clooney that are both dramatic and comedic.<br /><br />  I have an empathy for any father facing the issues of dating and alcoholism with his daughter.  Their relationship is authentic.  The chemistry between Clooney and Woodley is the most appealing aspects of this movie.  I have an empathy for any father and daughter facing these typical teenage issues.<br /><br />The music is note worthy here.  The soundtrack is filled with Hawaiian music that is playing in the background.  I don't understand a word of the Hawaiian language, but the slack key music is so peaceful and soothing.  The music reflects what living in Hawaii is like.  It is laid back and peaceful.  The Descendants is an excellent film.

B001HR5AIC|5.0|I thought I had heard all of Amy's songs until I bought this collection!  It has both her albums and part 2's of them as well.  A few poignant writings by the people who knew her best, about who she was as a person (besides the BS everyone has slammed her for).  And a few pictures of her transition from average looking girl to the \\"star\\" appearance she had in her later years.  The talent this woman had was absolutely amazing.  She had the world in the palm of her hands but unfortunately let it go.  A great gift and I'm going to buy another one just to keep it closed...I am a big fan!

B005H0IW6W|5.0|I've been trying to get my ULTRA alpha male boyfriend to take me to see Michael Buble' for a year. He had never heard him sing and always stated, \\"I'm not going to see that crap!\\" We're both SNL fans, usually recording it and watching it sometime on Sunday. Well, last week's musical guest was Michael Buble' and I had to beg my bf to not fast forward thru the first musical performance.  (Not so) surprisingly, he enjoyed Michael's performance, even watching the second one.  When I got home the other night, there was one of my Christmas presents on the kitchen table with a note that said, \\"Open now!\\" It was the Michael Buble' Christmas cd! We've been playing it non-stop for the past three days and it has kicked our Christmas spirits into high gear! The bf who was somewhat of a grinch this year pulled out the Christmas lights and his ladder and went into decorating overdrive! This is such a fun and uplifting cd. It is so hard to pick a favorite. The more you listen to it, the more you appreciate his vocals and the various arrangements! This could be my only gift and I'd be as happy as a jolly old elf!
0374275637|1.0|Reading this book is like having a root canal without anesthesia, a bunker busting bomb of a bore, like reading maybe fifty of the most tedious semi-scientific papers under torture until you yell \\"uncle.\\" Who or what in God's name would publish such a tome without extensively editing it, like getting rid of at least half of the pedestrian, scientific drivel. Better yet giving this loaf of unbaked bread to someone like a journalist who can write something interesting and get across the gems of knowledge buried under all the irrelevant garbage printed here. Books like this are not for the general public and I resent all the misleading hype that will get  people to plunk down their hard earned dough and then want to tear their hair out trying to read it. Books like this are so bad they deserve an occupy the offices of the publisher alone for the deceptive blather required to sell such a pile of junk. Nobel \\"shnobel\\" if the guy can't be whipped into writing a readable book about some fascinating data then let someone else do it. REALLY!
B000GFLE1S|3.0|A shoemaker has to save his dying business. He meets a saucy drag queen and gets the idea to make hot high heels that will support the weight of a man, a heretofore unexplored niche. The two must team up and... You see where this going.<br /><br />The only reason why this movie hasn't played over and over again on TV is because of its title and the presence of said drag queen.<br /><br />So what if this was based on a true story? Reality can be just as predictable. Don't get me wrong. The filming, acting, music, all that--it was good. But the story is so utterly predictable that I couldn't bring myself to finish it. But that's the point, isn't it? I didn't have to.<br /><br />If you like \\"power movies\\" where the protagonist has his work cut out for him, formulaic plots, and inevitable triumphs with cheesy dialogue interspersed throughout: go for it. This movie is definitely a harmless feel-good flick.<br /><br />But if you're tired of the same cinematic gruel over and over, do yourself a favor and go see something with substance, maybe something made in the '40s. If this sounds like a lecture, it is. Kinky Boots is about an hour and a half of my life I'll never get back. At least the couple of minutes I'm using to write this will, I hope, save someone else the trouble.<br /><br />Also: was surprised by how corny some of the dialogue was. This is an English movie. What happened?<br /><br />Special appearances from Queenie from [[ASIN:B002EWD0I6 Lark Rise to Candleford: The Complete Season One]] and the cool sidekick from [[ASIN:B000RJO578 Hot Fuzz (Widescreen Edition)]].<br /><br />Finally: if you're a shoe fetishist, you're in for a treat. Lola's liquorice-red boots are to die for. Wish I had a pair.
B002VWNID6|1.0|I thought 5 bucks was a bargain for this movie, but it's just a cheap copy with half of the movie missing.
6305622914|4.0|Let me begin by saying that this is one of my all time favorite movies. There is something to be said about the friendships that this movie illustrates, in some ways it reminds me of Waking Ned Devine in that its rare that we see movies about men and actual friendships. By now you know the story of these men and their quest to add a few quid to their wallets by trying their luck in an unexpected way. Its a fun filled movie. Yes, the English accents can be hard to follow at times but well worth it.  Now for the bad. The dvd arrived in the cheapest case I've ever seen, an \\"Eco-Case\\" (yes this was purchased new directly from Amazon). I opened the wrapper to find the case already broken in half! Ok, I can get past that I suppose but what I can't get past is that while the dvd is advertised as being wide-screen (1.85:1 ratio)the movie was very small on my tv, basically it was two-thirds size. At first I though there was something wrong with my blu-ray player or tv but I checked it using other movies and no problems. What's even more aggravating is that the disc menu fills the screen and for that matter the trailer is shown in full screen mode. Aggravating. Yes, I am used to the letter box but this is not acceptable. I will be discussing with Amazon regarding an exchange, anyone else having this issue?  Problems aside, press the buy now button and when it get ready to have some fun! Great movie spoiled by poor dvd presentation.

B002ECJZ76|4.0|Today I saw this Finnish film (with English overdubs), which for seventy-five minutes offers up interesting and historically plausible explanations for the origin of the modern-day fable of Santa Claus. Then, in the seventy-sixth minute, the film suddenly takes a turn for the surreal as the Nikolas character flies off into the sky on his reindeer-powered sleigh, with absolutely no attempt whatsoever at explaining how or why...  Overall one of the better Christmas movies I've seen, but you might remember it more fondly if you just shut it off right before the end.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|As a white woman who grew up in the south I can sadly say that this was a pretty tame version of the truth. Fortunately I grew up when all of this vileness was coming to it's end.

1456407872|5.0|A magnificent and revolutionary story of the metamorphosis of Scrooge during the Christmas Season. One can really feel Dickens' love of humanity and joie de vivre throughout. At the end, Scrooge overcomes his addiction to money, misanthropy and greed to partake of the joys of participating in mankind.<br /><br />It is revolutionary because it is the transition of a miserly man to one, who at the conclusion, shares what he has with his fellow beings. In a sense, it is an apt theme for the \\"Occupy Movement\\" with its focus on the 1% who control most of the wealth of the world.<br /><br />There are an astounding number of moral lessons to be taken from this simple, but animated tale, by one of the world's greatest story-tellers.<br /><br />Favourite quotes: from Marley's ghost playing on the word \\"business\\" - \\"Mankind was my business. The common welfare was my business; charity, mercy, forbearance and benevolence, were all, my business\\"<br /><br />From the second ghost: \\"There is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humour\\".

0913866156|5.0|As I feel that anyone can form a bond with almost any deck, I do believe that the Thoth deck has some intrinsic worth to it.  At first when I got this deck I had no idea what to do with it.  I would use it in conjunction with other decks and get detailed readings that way.  But I've purchased a few books that have helped make reading from this deck powerful and magical.  Keywords for the Crowley Tarot is my main book I use when reading from this deck.  My other favorites are Tarot Mirror of Your Relationships and Tarot Mirror of the Soul by Gerd Ziegler.  I also like Angeles Arrien's Tarot Handbook.  There are tons of symbols on the major arcana and court cards that can bewilder you for years to come.  But once you're familiar with the inherent meaning of the symbols, it will be ingrained.  You can get really deep and powerful messages from this deck that other decks won't give you.  Also, this deck delivers the truth without apologies.  So be ready for an honest reading with all of the light and shadows.  I tend to go to this deck for the \\"truth\\" of a matter.  I've had many decks in my time (about 50 Tarot and about 40+ oracle)and as I am whittling down my stash to the few essential decks to have I have kept this deck as part of my favorites.  If you can find a good book on Thoth of which you relate to, you will find this deck to be extremely powerful.
